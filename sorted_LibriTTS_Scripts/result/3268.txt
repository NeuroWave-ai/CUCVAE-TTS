Aubert s liberality or extravagance had so much involved his affairs that his son found it necessary to dispose of a part of the family domain and some years after his marriage he sold it to Monsieur Quesnel the brother of his wife and retired to a small estate in Gascony where conjugal felicity and parental duties divided his attention with the treasures of knowledge and the illuminations of genius To this spot he had been attached from his infancy He had often made excursions to it when a boy and the impressions of delight given to his mind by the homely kindness of the grey headed peasant to whom it was intrusted and whose fruit and cream never failed had not been obliterated by succeeding circumstances The green pastures along which he had so often bounded in the exultation of health and youthful freedom the woods under whose refreshing shade he had first indulged that pensive melancholy which afterwards made a strong feature of his character the wild walks of the mountains the river on whose waves he had floated and the distant plains which seemed boundless as his early hopes were never after remembered by saint Aubert but with enthusiasm and regret At length he disengaged himself from the world and retired hither to realize the wishes of many years The building as it then stood was merely a summer cottage rendered interesting to a stranger by its neat simplicity or the beauty of the surrounding scene and considerable additions were necessary to make it a comfortable family residence saint Aubert felt a kind of affection for every part of the fabric which he remembered in his youth and would not suffer a stone of it to be removed so that the new building adapted to the style of the old one formed with it only a simple and elegant residence The taste of Madame saint Aubert was conspicuous in its internal finishing where the same chaste simplicity was observable in the furniture and in the few ornaments of the apartments that characterized the manners of its inhabitants The library occupied the west side of the chateau and was enriched by a collection of the best books in the ancient and modern languages This room opened upon a grove which stood on the brow of a gentle declivity that fell towards the river and the tall trees gave it a melancholy and pleasing shade while from the windows the eye caught beneath the spreading branches the gay and luxuriant landscape stretching to the west and overlooked on the left by the bold precipices of the Pyrenees Adjoining the library was a green house stored with scarce and beautiful plants for one of the amusements of saint Aubert was the study of botany and among the neighbouring mountains which afforded a luxurious feast to the mind of the naturalist he often passed the day in the pursuit of his favourite science He was sometimes accompanied in these little excursions by Madame saint Aubert and frequently by his daughter when with a small osier basket to receive plants and another filled with cold refreshments such as the cabin of the shepherd did not afford they wandered away among the most romantic and magnificent scenes nor suffered the charms of Nature s lowly children to abstract them from the observance of her stupendous works When weary of sauntering among cliffs that seemed scarcely accessible but to the steps of the enthusiast and where no track appeared on the vegetation but what the foot of the izard had left they would seek one of those green recesses which so beautifully adorn the bosom of these mountains where under the shade of the lofty larch or cedar they enjoyed their simple repast made sweeter by the waters of the cool stream that crept along the turf and by the breath of wild flowers and aromatic plants that fringed the rocks and inlaid the grass Adjoining the eastern side of the green house looking towards the plains of Languedoc was a room which Emily called hers and which contained her books her drawings her musical instruments with some favourite birds and plants Here she usually exercised herself in elegant arts cultivated only because they were congenial to her taste and in which native genius assisted by the instructions of Monsieur and Madame saint Aubert made her an early proficient The windows of this room were particularly pleasant they descended to the floor and opening upon the little lawn that surrounded the house the eye was led between groves of almond palm trees flowering ash and myrtle to the distant landscape where the Garonne wandered The peasants of this gay climate were often seen on an evening when the day s labour was done dancing in groups on the margin of the river Their sprightly melodies debonnaire steps the fanciful figure of their dances with the tasteful and capricious manner in which the girls adjusted their simple dress gave a character to the scene entirely French The front of the chateau which having a southern aspect opened upon the grandeur of the mountains was occupied on the ground floor by a rustic hall and two excellent sitting rooms The first floor for the cottage had no second story was laid out in bed chambers except one apartment that opened to a balcony and which was generally used for a breakfast room In the surrounding ground saint Aubert had made very tasteful improvements yet such was his attachment to objects he had remembered from his boyish days that he had in some instances sacrificed taste to sentiment There were two old larches that shaded the building and interrupted the prospect saint Aubert had sometimes declared that he believed he should have been weak enough to have wept at their fall In addition to these larches he planted a little grove of beech pine and mountain ash On a lofty terrace formed by the swelling bank of the river rose a plantation of orange lemon and palm trees whose fruit in the coolness of evening breathed delicious fragrance With these were mingled a few trees of other species Here under the ample shade of a plane tree that spread its majestic canopy towards the river saint Aubert loved to sit in the fine evenings of summer with his wife and children watching beneath its foliage the setting sun the mild splendour of its light fading from the distant landscape till the shadows of twilight melted its various features into one tint of sober grey Here too he loved to read and to converse with Madame saint Aubert or to play with his children resigning himself to the influence of those sweet affections which are ever attendant on simplicity and nature He has often said while tears of pleasure trembled in his eyes that these were moments infinitely more delightful than any passed amid the brilliant and tumultuous scenes that are courted by the world His heart was occupied it had what can be so rarely said no wish for a happiness beyond what it experienced The consciousness of acting right diffused a serenity over his manners which nothing else could impart to a man of moral perceptions like his and which refined his sense of every surrounding blessing The deepest shade of twilight did not send him from his favourite plane tree He loved the soothing hour when the last tints of light die away when the stars one by one tremble through aether and are reflected on the dark mirror of the waters that hour which of all others inspires the mind with pensive tenderness and often elevates it to sublime contemplation When the moon shed her soft rays among the foliage he still lingered and his pastoral supper of cream and fruits was often spread beneath it Then on the stillness of night came the song of the nightingale breathing sweetness and awakening melancholy The first interruptions to the happiness he had known since his retirement were occasioned by the death of his two sons He lost them at that age when infantine simplicity is so fascinating and though in consideration of Madame saint Aubert s distress he restrained the expression of his own and endeavoured to bear it as he meant with philosophy he had in truth no philosophy that could render him calm to such losses One daughter was now his only surviving child and while he watched the unfolding of her infant character with anxious fondness he endeavoured with unremitting effort to counteract those traits in her disposition which might hereafter lead her from happiness She had discovered in her early years uncommon delicacy of mind warm affections and ready benevolence but with these was observable a degree of susceptibility too exquisite to admit of lasting peace As she advanced in youth this sensibility gave a pensive tone to her spirits and a softness to her manner which added grace to beauty and rendered her a very interesting object to persons of a congenial disposition But saint Aubert had too much good sense to prefer a charm to a virtue and had penetration enough to see that this charm was too dangerous to its possessor to be allowed the character of a blessing He endeavoured therefore to strengthen her mind to enure her to habits of self command to teach her to reject the first impulse of her feelings and to look with cool examination upon the disappointments he sometimes threw in her way While he instructed her to resist first impressions and to acquire that steady dignity of mind that can alone counterbalance the passions and bear us as far as is compatible with our nature above the reach of circumstances he taught himself a lesson of fortitude for he was often obliged to witness with seeming indifference the tears and struggles which his caution occasioned her In person Emily resembled her mother having the same elegant symmetry of form the same delicacy of features and the same blue eyes full of tender sweetness But lovely as was her person it was the varied expression of her countenance as conversation awakened the nicer emotions of her mind that threw such a captivating grace around her Those tend rer tints that shun the careless eye And in the world s contagious circle die saint Aubert cultivated her understanding with the most scrupulous care He gave her a general view of the sciences and an exact acquaintance with every part of elegant literature He taught her Latin and English chiefly that she might understand the sublimity of their best poets She discovered in her early years a taste for works of genius and it was saint Aubert s principle as well as his inclination to promote every innocent means of happiness A well informed mind he would say is the best security against the contagion of folly and of vice The vacant mind is ever on the watch for relief and ready to plunge into error to escape from the languor of idleness Store it with ideas teach it the pleasure of thinking and the temptations of the world without will be counteracted by the gratifications derived from the world within Thought and cultivation are necessary equally to the happiness of a country and a city life in the first they prevent the uneasy sensations of indolence and afford a sublime pleasure in the taste they create for the beautiful and the grand in the latter they make dissipation less an object of necessity and consequently of interest It was one of Emily s earliest pleasures to ramble among the scenes of nature nor was it in the soft and glowing landscape that she most delighted she loved more the wild wood walks that skirted the mountain and still more the mountain s stupendous recesses where the silence and grandeur of solitude impressed a sacred awe upon her heart and lifted her thoughts to the GOD OF HEAVEN AND EARTH In scenes like these she would often linger along wrapt in a melancholy charm till the last gleam of day faded from the west till the lonely sound of a sheep bell or the distant bark of a watch dog were all that broke on the stillness of the evening Then the gloom of the woods the trembling of their leaves at intervals in the breeze the bat flitting on the twilight the cottage lights now seen and now lost were circumstances that awakened her mind into effort and led to enthusiasm and poetry Her favourite walk was to a little fishing house belonging to saint Aubert in a woody glen on the margin of a rivulet that descended from the Pyrenees and after foaming among their rocks wound its silent way beneath the shades it reflected Above the woods that screened this glen rose the lofty summits of the Pyrenees which often burst boldly on the eye through the glades below Sometimes the shattered face of a rock only was seen crowned with wild shrubs or a shepherd s cabin seated on a cliff overshadowed by dark cypress or waving ash Emerging from the deep recesses of the woods the glade opened to the distant landscape where the rich pastures and vine covered slopes of Gascony gradually declined to the plains and there on the winding shores of the Garonne groves and hamlets and villas their outlines softened by distance melted from the eye into one rich harmonious tint This too was the favourite retreat of saint Aubert to which he frequently withdrew from the fervour of noon with his wife his daughter and his books or came at the sweet evening hour to welcome the silent dusk or to listen for the music of the nightingale Sometimes too he brought music of his own and awakened every fairy echo with the tender accents of his oboe and often have the tones of Emily s voice drawn sweetness from the waves over which they trembled It was in one of these excursions to this spot that she observed the following lines written with a pencil on a part of the wainscot SONNET Go pencil faithful to thy master s sighs Go tell the Goddess of the fairy scene When next her light steps wind these wood walks green Whence all his tears his tender sorrows rise Ah paint her form her soul illumin d eyes The sweet expression of her pensive face The light ning smile the animated grace The portrait well the lover s voice supplies Speaks all his heart must feel his tongue would say Yet ah not all his heart must sadly feel How oft the flow ret s silken leaves conceal The drug that steals the vital spark away And who that gazes on that angel smile Would fear its charm or think it could beguile These lines were not inscribed to any person Emily therefore could not apply them to herself though she was undoubtedly the nymph of these shades Having glanced round the little circle of her acquaintance without being detained by a suspicion as to whom they could be addressed she was compelled to rest in uncertainty an uncertainty which would have been more painful to an idle mind than it was to hers She had no leisure to suffer this circumstance trifling at first to swell into importance by frequent remembrance The little vanity it had excited for the incertitude which forbade her to presume upon having inspired the sonnet forbade her also to disbelieve it passed away and the incident was dismissed from her thoughts amid her books her studies and the exercise of social charities Soon after this period her anxiety was awakened by the indisposition of her father who was attacked with a fever which though not thought to be of a dangerous kind gave a severe shock to his constitution Madame saint Aubert and Emily attended him with unremitting care but his recovery was very slow and as he advanced towards health Madame seemed to decline The first scene he visited after he was well enough to take the air was his favourite fishing house A basket of provisions was sent thither with books and Emily s lute for fishing tackle he had no use for he never could find amusement in torturing or destroying After employing himself for about an hour in botanizing dinner was served It was a repast to which gratitude for being again permitted to visit this spot gave sweetness and family happiness once more smiled beneath these shades Monsieur saint Aubert conversed with unusual cheerfulness every object delighted his senses The refreshing pleasure from the first view of nature after the pain of illness and the confinement of a sick chamber is above the conceptions as well as the descriptions of those in health The green woods and pastures the flowery turf the blue concave of the heavens the balmy air the murmur of the limpid stream and even the hum of every little insect of the shade seem to revivify the soul and make mere existence bliss Madame saint Aubert reanimated by the cheerfulness and recovery of her husband was no longer sensible of the indisposition which had lately oppressed her and as she sauntered along the wood walks of this romantic glen and conversed with him and with her daughter she often looked at them alternately with a degree of tenderness that filled her eyes with tears saint Aubert observed this more than once and gently reproved her for the emotion but she could only smile clasp his hand and that of Emily and weep the more He felt the tender enthusiasm stealing upon himself in a degree that became almost painful his features assumed a serious air and he could not forbear secretly sighing Perhaps I shall some time look back to these moments as to the summit of my happiness with hopeless regret But let me not misuse them by useless anticipation let me hope I shall not live to mourn the loss of those who are dearer to me than life To relieve or perhaps to indulge the pensive temper of his mind he bade Emily fetch the lute she knew how to touch with such sweet pathos As she drew near the fishing house she was surprised to hear the tones of the instrument which were awakened by the hand of taste and uttered a plaintive air whose exquisite melody engaged all her attention She listened in profound silence afraid to move from the spot lest the sound of her steps should occasion her to lose a note of the music or should disturb the musician Every thing without the building was still and no person appeared She continued to listen till timidity succeeded to surprise and delight a timidity increased by a remembrance of the pencilled lines she had formerly seen and she hesitated whether to proceed or to return While she paused the music ceased and after a momentary hesitation she re collected courage to advance to the fishing house which she entered with faltering steps and found unoccupied Her lute lay on the table every thing seemed undisturbed and she began to believe it was another instrument she had heard till she remembered that when she followed M and Madame saint Aubert from this spot her lute was left on a window seat She felt alarmed yet knew not wherefore the melancholy gloom of evening and the profound stillness of the place interrupted only by the light trembling of leaves heightened her fanciful apprehensions and she was desirous of quitting the building but perceived herself grow faint and sat down As she tried to recover herself the pencilled lines on the wainscot met her eye she started as if she had seen a stranger but endeavouring to conquer the tremor of her spirits rose and went to the window To the lines before noticed she now perceived that others were added in which her name appeared Though no longer suffered to doubt that they were addressed to herself she was as ignorant as before by whom they could be written While she mused she thought she heard the sound of a step without the building and again alarmed she caught up her lute and hurried away Monsieur and Madame saint Aubert she found in a little path that wound along the sides of the glen Having reached a green summit shadowed by palm trees and overlooking the vallies and plains of Gascony they seated themselves on the turf and while their eyes wandered over the glorious scene and they inhaled the sweet breath of flowers and herbs that enriched the grass Emily played and sung several of their favourite airs with the delicacy of expression in which she so much excelled Music and conversation detained them in this enchanting spot till the sun s last light slept upon the plains till the white sails that glided beneath the mountains where the Garonne wandered became dim and the gloom of evening stole over the landscape It was a melancholy but not unpleasing gloom saint Aubert and his family rose and left the place with regret alas Madame saint Aubert knew not that she left it for ever When they reached the fishing house she missed her bracelet and recollected that she had taken it from her arm after dinner and had left it on the table when she went to walk After a long search in which Emily was very active she was compelled to resign herself to the loss of it What made this bracelet valuable to her was a miniature of her daughter to which it was attached esteemed a striking resemblance and which had been painted only a few months before When Emily was convinced that the bracelet was really gone she blushed and became thoughtful That some stranger had been in the fishing house during her absence her lute and the additional lines of a pencil had already informed her from the purport of these lines it was not unreasonable to believe that the poet the musician and the thief were the same person But though the music she had heard the written lines she had seen and the disappearance of the picture formed a combination of circumstances very remarkable she was irresistibly restrained from mentioning them secretly determining however never again to visit the fishing house without Monsieur or Madame saint Aubert They returned pensively to the chateau Emily musing on the incident which had just occurred saint Aubert reflecting with placid gratitude on the blessings he possessed and Madame saint Aubert somewhat disturbed and perplexed by the loss of her daughter s picture As they drew near the house they observed an unusual bustle about it the sound of voices was distinctly heard servants and horses were seen passing between the trees and at length the wheels of a carriage rolled along Having come within view of the front of the chateau a landau with smoking horses appeared on the little lawn before it saint Aubert perceived the liveries of his brother in law and in the parlour he found Monsieur and Madame Quesnel already entered They had left Paris some days before and were on the way to their estate only ten leagues distant from La Vallee and which Monsieur Quesnel had purchased several years before of saint Aubert This gentleman was the only brother of Madame saint Aubert but the ties of relationship having never been strengthened by congeniality of character the intercourse between them had not been frequent M Quesnel had lived altogether in the world his aim had been consequence splendour was the object of his taste and his address and knowledge of character had carried him forward to the attainment of almost all that he had courted By a man of such a disposition it is not surprising that the virtues of saint Aubert should be overlooked or that his pure taste simplicity and moderated wishes were considered as marks of a weak intellect and of confined views The marriage of his sister with saint Aubert had been mortifying to his ambition for he had designed that the matrimonial connection she formed should assist him to attain the consequence which he so much desired and some offers were made her by persons whose rank and fortune flattered his warmest hope But his sister who was then addressed also by saint Aubert perceived or thought she perceived that happiness and splendour were not the same and she did not hesitate to forego the last for the attainment of the former Whether Monsieur Quesnel thought them the same or not he would readily have sacrificed his sister s peace to the gratification of his own ambition and on her marriage with saint Aubert expressed in private his contempt of her spiritless conduct and of the connection which it permitted Madame saint Aubert though she concealed this insult from her husband felt perhaps for the first time resentment lighted in her heart and though a regard for her own dignity united with considerations of prudence restrained her expression of this resentment there was ever after a mild reserve in her manner towards M Quesnel which he both understood and felt In his own marriage he did not follow his sister s example His lady was an Italian and an heiress by birth and by nature and education was a vain and frivolous woman They now determined to pass the night with saint Aubert and as the chateau was not large enough to accommodate their servants the latter were dismissed to the neighbouring village When the first compliments were over and the arrangements for the night made M Quesnel began the display of his intelligence and his connections while saint Aubert who had been long enough in retirement to find these topics recommended by their novelty listened with a degree of patience and attention which his guest mistook for the humility of wonder The latter indeed described the few festivities which the turbulence of that period permitted to the court of Henry the Third with a minuteness that somewhat recompensed for his ostentation but when he came to speak of the character of the Duke de Joyeuse of a secret treaty which he knew to be negotiating with the Porte and of the light in which Henry of Navarre was received M saint Aubert recollected enough of his former experience to be assured that his guest could be only of an inferior class of politicians and that from the importance of the subjects upon which he committed himself he could not be of the rank to which he pretended to belong The opinions delivered by M Quesnel were such as saint Aubert forebore to reply to for he knew that his guest had neither humanity to feel nor discernment to perceive what is just Madame Quesnel meanwhile was expressing to Madame saint Aubert her astonishment that she could bear to pass her life in this remote corner of the world as she called it and describing from a wish probably of exciting envy the splendour of the balls banquets and processions which had just been given by the court in honour of the nuptials of the Duke de Joyeuse with Margaretta of Lorrain the sister of the Queen She described with equal minuteness the magnificence she had seen and that from which she had been excluded while Emily s vivid fancy as she listened with the ardent curiosity of youth heightened the scenes she heard of and Madame saint Aubert looking on her family felt as a tear stole to her eye that though splendour may grace happiness virtue only can bestow it It is now twelve years saint Aubert said M Quesnel since I purchased your family estate Somewhere thereabout replied saint Aubert suppressing a sigh It is near five years since I have been there resumed Quesnel for Paris and its neighbourhood is the only place in the world to live in and I am so immersed in politics and have so many affairs of moment on my hands that I find it difficult to steal away even for a month or two saint Aubert remaining silent M Quesnel proceeded I have sometimes wondered how you who have lived in the capital and have been accustomed to company can exist elsewhere especially in so remote a country as this where you can neither hear nor see any thing and can in short be scarcely conscious of life I live for my family and myself said saint Aubert I am now contented to know only happiness formerly I knew life I mean to expend thirty or forty thousand livres on improvements said M Quesnel without seeming to notice the words of saint Aubert for I design next summer to bring here my friends the Duke de Durefort and the Marquis Ramont to pass a month or two with me To saint Aubert s enquiry as to these intended improvements he replied that he should take down the whole east wing of the chateau and raise upon the site a set of stables Then I shall build said he a SALLE A MANGER a SALON a SALLE AU COMMUNE and a number of rooms for servants for at present there is not accommodation for a third part of my own people It accommodated our father s household said saint Aubert grieved that the old mansion was to be thus improved and that was not a small one Our notions are somewhat enlarged since those days said M Quesnel what was then thought a decent style of living would not now be endured Even the calm saint Aubert blushed at these words but his anger soon yielded to contempt The ground about the chateau is encumbered with trees I mean to cut some of them down Cut down the trees too said saint Aubert Certainly Why should I not they interrupt my prospects There is a chesnut which spreads its branches before the whole south side of the chateau and which is so ancient that they tell me the hollow of its trunk will hold a dozen men Your enthusiasm will scarcely contend that there can be either use or beauty in such a sapless old tree as this Good God exclaimed saint Aubert you surely will not destroy that noble chesnut which has flourished for centuries the glory of the estate It was in its maturity when the present mansion was built How often in my youth have I climbed among its broad branches and sat embowered amidst a world of leaves while the heavy shower has pattered above and not a rain drop reached me How often I have sat with a book in my hand sometimes reading and sometimes looking out between the branches upon the wide landscape and the setting sun till twilight came and brought the birds home to their little nests among the leaves How often but pardon me added saint Aubert recollecting that he was speaking to a man who could neither comprehend nor allow his feelings I am talking of times and feelings as old fashioned as the taste that would spare that venerable tree It will certainly come down said M Quesnel I believe I shall plant some Lombardy poplars among the clumps of chesnut that I shall leave of the avenue Madame Quesnel is partial to the poplar and tells me how much it adorns a villa of her uncle not far from Venice On the banks of the Brenta indeed continued saint Aubert where its spiry form is intermingled with the pine and the cypress and where it plays over light and elegant porticos and colonnades it unquestionably adorns the scene but among the giants of the forest and near a heavy gothic mansion Well my good sir said M Quesnel I will not dispute with you You must return to Paris before our ideas can at all agree But A PROPOS of Venice I have some thoughts of going thither next summer events may call me to take possession of that same villa too which they tell me is the most charming that can be imagined In that case I shall leave the improvements I mention to another year and I may perhaps be tempted to stay some time in Italy Emily was somewhat surprised to hear him talk of being tempted to remain abroad after he had mentioned his presence to be so necessary at Paris that it was with difficulty he could steal away for a month or two but saint Aubert understood the self importance of the man too well to wonder at this trait and the possibility that these projected improvements might be deferred gave him a hope that they might never take place Before they separated for the night M Quesnel desired to speak with saint Aubert alone and they retired to another room where they remained a considerable time The subject of this conversation was not known but whatever it might be saint Aubert when he returned to the supper room seemed much disturbed and a shade of sorrow sometimes fell upon his features that alarmed Madame saint Aubert When they were alone she was tempted to enquire the occasion of it but the delicacy of mind which had ever appeared in his conduct restrained her she considered that if saint Aubert wished her to be acquainted with the subject of his concern he would not wait on her enquiries On the following day before M Quesnel departed he had a second conference with saint Aubert The guests after dining at the chateau set out in the cool of the day for Epourville whither they gave him and Madame saint Aubert a pressing invitation prompted rather by the vanity of displaying their splendour than by a wish to make their friends happy Emily returned with delight to the liberty which their presence had restrained to her books her walks and the rational conversation of M and Madame saint Aubert who seemed to rejoice no less that they were delivered from the shackles which arrogance and frivolity had imposed Madame saint Aubert excused herself from sharing their usual evening walk complaining that she was not quite well and saint Aubert and Emily went out together They chose a walk towards the mountains intending to visit some old pensioners of saint Aubert which from his very moderate income he contrived to support though it is probable M Quesnel with his very large one could not have afforded this After distributing to his pensioners their weekly stipends listening patiently to the complaints of some redressing the grievances of others and softening the discontents of all by the look of sympathy and the smile of benevolence saint Aubert returned home through the woods where At fall of eve the fairy people throng In various games and revelry to pass The summer night as village stories tell Thomson The evening gloom of woods was always delightful to me said saint Aubert whose mind now experienced the sweet calm which results from the consciousness of having done a beneficent action and which disposes it to receive pleasure from every surrounding object I remember that in my youth this gloom used to call forth to my fancy a thousand fairy visions and romantic images and I own I am not yet wholly insensible of that high enthusiasm which wakes the poet s dream I can linger with solemn steps under the deep shades send forward a transforming eye into the distant obscurity and listen with thrilling delight to the mystic murmuring of the woods O my dear father said Emily while a sudden tear started to her eye how exactly you describe what I have felt so often and which I thought nobody had ever felt but myself But hark here comes the sweeping sound over the wood tops now it dies away how solemn the stillness that succeeds Now the breeze swells again It is like the voice of some supernatural being the voice of the spirit of the woods that watches over them by night Ah what light is yonder But it is gone And now it gleams again near the root of that large chestnut look sir Are you such an admirer of nature said saint Aubert and so little acquainted with her appearances as not to know that for the glow worm But come added he gaily step a little further and we shall see fairies perhaps they are often companions The glow worm lends his light and they in return charm him with music and the dance Do you see nothing tripping yonder Emily laughed Well my dear sir said she since you allow of this alliance I may venture to own I have anticipated you and almost dare venture to repeat some verses I made one evening in these very woods Nay replied saint Aubert dismiss the ALMOST and venture quite let us hear what vagaries fancy has been playing in your mind If she has given you one of her spells you need not envy those of the fairies If it is strong enough to enchant your judgment sir said Emily while I disclose her images I need NOT envy them The lines go in a sort of tripping measure which I thought might suit the subject well enough but I fear they are too irregular THE GLOW WORM How pleasant is the green wood s deep matted shade On a mid summer s eve when the fresh rain is o er When the yellow beams slope and sparkle thro the glade And swiftly in the thin air the light swallows soar But sweeter sweeter still when the sun sinks to rest And twilight comes on with the fairies so gay Tripping through the forest walk where flow rs unprest Bow not their tall heads beneath their frolic play To music s softest sounds they dance away the hour Till moon light steals down among the trembling leaves And checquers all the ground and guides them to the bow r The long haunted bow r where the nightingale grieves Then no more they dance till her sad song is done But silent as the night to her mourning attend And often as her dying notes their pity have won They vow all her sacred haunts from mortals to defend When down among the mountains sinks the ev ning star And the changing moon forsakes this shadowy sphere How cheerless would they be tho they fairies are If I with my pale light came not near Yet cheerless tho they d be they re ungrateful to my love For often when the traveller s benighted on his way And I glimmer in his path and would guide him thro the grove They bind me in their magic spells to lead him far astray And in the mire to leave him till the stars are all burnt out While in strange looking shapes they frisk about the ground And afar in the woods they raise a dismal shout Till I shrink into my cell again for terror of the sound But see where all the tiny elves come dancing in a ring With the merry merry pipe and the tabor and the horn And the timbrel so clear and the lute with dulcet string Then round about the oak they go till peeping of the morn Down yonder glade two lovers steal to shun the fairy queen Who frowns upon their plighted vows and jealous is of me That yester eve I lighted them along the dewy green To seek the purple flow r whose juice from all her spells can free And now to punish me she keeps afar her jocund band With the merry merry pipe and the tabor and the lute If I creep near yonder oak she will wave her fairy wand And to me the dance will cease and the music all be mute O had I but that purple flow r whose leaves her charms can foil And knew like fays to draw the juice and throw it on the wind I d be her slave no longer nor the traveller beguile And help all faithful lovers nor fear the fairy kind But soon the VAPOUR OF THE WOODS will wander afar And the fickle moon will fade and the stars disappear Then cheerless will they be tho they fairies are If I with my pale light come not near Whatever saint Aubert might think of the stanzas he would not deny his daughter the pleasure of believing that he approved them and having given his commendation he sunk into a reverie and they walked on in silence A faint erroneous ray Glanc d from th imperfect surfaces of things Flung half an image on the straining eye While waving woods and villages and streams And rocks and mountain tops that long retain The ascending gleam are all one swimming scene Uncertain if beheld Thomson saint Aubert continued silent till he reached the chateau where his wife had retired to her chamber The languor and dejection that had lately oppressed her and which the exertion called forth by the arrival of her guests had suspended now returned with increased effect On the following day symptoms of fever appeared and saint Aubert having sent for medical advice learned that her disorder was a fever of the same nature as that from which he had lately recovered She had indeed taken the infection during her attendance upon him and her constitution being too weak to throw out the disease immediately it had lurked in her veins and occasioned the heavy languor of which she had complained saint Aubert whose anxiety for his wife overcame every other consideration detained the physician in his house He remembered the feelings and the reflections that had called a momentary gloom upon his mind on the day when he had last visited the fishing house in company with Madame saint Aubert and he now admitted a presentiment that this illness would be a fatal one But he effectually concealed this from her and from his daughter whom he endeavoured to re animate with hopes that her constant assiduities would not be unavailing The physician when asked by saint Aubert for his opinion of the disorder replied that the event of it depended upon circumstances which he could not ascertain Madame saint Aubert seemed to have formed a more decided one but her eyes only gave hints of this She frequently fixed them upon her anxious friends with an expression of pity and of tenderness as if she anticipated the sorrow that awaited them and that seemed to say it was for their sakes only for their sufferings that she regretted life On the seventh day the disorder was at its crisis The physician assumed a graver manner which she observed and took occasion when her family had once quitted the chamber to tell him that she perceived her death was approaching Do not attempt to deceive me said she I feel that I cannot long survive I am prepared for the event I have long I hope been preparing for it Since I have not long to live do not suffer a mistaken compassion to induce you to flatter my family with false hopes If you do their affliction will only be the heavier when it arrives I will endeavour to teach them resignation by my example The physician was affected he promised to obey her and told saint Aubert somewhat abruptly that there was nothing to expect The latter was not philosopher enough to restrain his feelings when he received this information but a consideration of the increased affliction which the observance of his grief would occasion his wife enabled him after some time to command himself in her presence Emily was at first overwhelmed with the intelligence then deluded by the strength of her wishes a hope sprung up in her mind that her mother would yet recover and to this she pertinaciously adhered almost to the last hour The progress of this disorder was marked on the side of Madame saint Aubert by patient suffering and subjected wishes The composure with which she awaited her death could be derived only from the retrospect of a life governed as far as human frailty permits by a consciousness of being always in the presence of the Deity and by the hope of a higher world But her piety could not entirely subdue the grief of parting from those whom she so dearly loved During these her last hours she conversed much with saint Aubert and Emily on the prospect of futurity and on other religious topics The resignation she expressed with the firm hope of meeting in a future world the friends she left in this and the effort which sometimes appeared to conceal her sorrow at this temporary separation frequently affected saint Aubert so much as to oblige him to leave the room Having indulged his tears awhile he would dry them and return to the chamber with a countenance composed by an endeavour which did but increase his grief Never had Emily felt the importance of the lessons which had taught her to restrain her sensibility so much as in these moments and never had she practised them with a triumph so complete But when the last was over she sunk at once under the pressure of her sorrow and then perceived that it was hope as well as fortitude which had hitherto supported her saint Aubert was for a time too devoid of comfort himself to bestow any on his daughter CHAPTER II I could a tale unfold whose lightest word Would harrow up thy soul SHAKESPEARE Madame saint Aubert was interred in the neighbouring village church her husband and daughter attended her to the grave followed by a long train of the peasantry who were sincere mourners of this excellent woman On his return from the funeral saint Aubert shut himself in his chamber When he came forth it was with a serene countenance though pale in sorrow He gave orders that his family should attend him Emily only was absent who overcome with the scene she had just witnessed had retired to her closet to weep alone saint Aubert followed her thither he took her hand in silence while she continued to weep and it was some moments before he could so far command his voice as to speak It trembled while he said My Emily I am going to prayers with my family you will join us We must ask support from above Where else ought we to seek it where else can we find it Emily checked her tears and followed her father to the parlour where the servants being assembled saint Aubert read in a low and solemn voice the evening service and added a prayer for the soul of the departed During this his voice often faltered his tears fell upon the book and at length he paused But the sublime emotions of pure devotion gradually elevated his views above this world and finally brought comfort to his heart When the service was ended and the servants were withdrawn he tenderly kissed Emily and said I have endeavoured to teach you from your earliest youth the duty of self command I have pointed out to you the great importance of it through life not only as it preserves us in the various and dangerous temptations that call us from rectitude and virtue but as it limits the indulgences which are termed virtuous yet which extended beyond a certain boundary are vicious for their consequence is evil All excess is vicious even that sorrow which is amiable in its origin becomes a selfish and unjust passion if indulged at the expence of our duties by our duties I mean what we owe to ourselves as well as to others The indulgence of excessive grief enervates the mind and almost incapacitates it for again partaking of those various innocent enjoyments which a benevolent God designed to be the sun shine of our lives My dear Emily recollect and practise the precepts I have so often given you and which your own experience has so often shewn you to be wise Your sorrow is useless Do not receive this as merely a commonplace remark but let reason THEREFORE restrain sorrow I would not annihilate your feelings my child I would only teach you to command them for whatever may be the evils resulting from a too susceptible heart nothing can be hoped from an insensible one that on the other hand is all vice vice of which the deformity is not softened or the effect consoled for by any semblance or possibility of good You know my sufferings and are therefore convinced that mine are not the light words which on these occasions are so often repeated to destroy even the sources of honest emotion or which merely display the selfish ostentation of a false philosophy I will shew my Emily that I can practise what I advise I have said thus much because I cannot bear to see you wasting in useless sorrow for want of that resistance which is due from mind and I have not said it till now because there is a period when all reasoning must yield to nature that is past and another when excessive indulgence having sunk into habit weighs down the elasticity of the spirits so as to render conquest nearly impossible this is to come You my Emily will shew that you are willing to avoid it Emily smiled through her tears upon her father Dear sir said she and her voice trembled she would have added I will shew myself worthy of being your daughter but a mingled emotion of gratitude affection and grief overcame her saint Aubert suffered her to weep without interruption and then began to talk on common topics The first person who came to condole with saint Aubert was a M Barreaux an austere and seemingly unfeeling man A taste for botany had introduced them to each other for they had frequently met in their wanderings among the mountains M Barreaux had retired from the world and almost from society to live in a pleasant chateau on the skirts of the woods near La Vallee He also had been disappointed in his opinion of mankind but he did not like saint Aubert pity and mourn for them he felt more indignation at their vices than compassion for their weaknesses saint Aubert was somewhat surprised to see him for though he had often pressed him to come to the chateau he had never till now accepted the invitation and now he came without ceremony or reserve entering the parlour as an old friend The claims of misfortune appeared to have softened down all the ruggedness and prejudices of his heart saint Aubert unhappy seemed to be the sole idea that occupied his mind It was in manners more than in words that he appeared to sympathize with his friends he spoke little on the subject of their grief but the minute attention he gave them and the modulated voice and softened look that accompanied it came from his heart and spoke to theirs At this melancholy period saint Aubert was likewise visited by Madame Cheron his only surviving sister who had been some years a widow and now resided on her own estate near Tholouse The intercourse between them had not been very frequent In her condolements words were not wanting she understood not the magic of the look that speaks at once to the soul or the voice that sinks like balm to the heart but she assured saint Aubert that she sincerely sympathized with him praised the virtues of his late wife and then offered what she considered to be consolation Emily wept unceasingly while she spoke saint Aubert was tranquil listened to what she said in silence and then turned the discourse upon another subject At parting she pressed him and her niece to make her an early visit Change of place will amuse you said she and it is wrong to give way to grief saint Aubert acknowledged the truth of these words of course but at the same time felt more reluctant than ever to quit the spot which his past happiness had consecrated The presence of his wife had sanctified every surrounding scene and each day as it gradually softened the acuteness of his suffering assisted the tender enchantment that bound him to home But there were calls which must be complied with and of this kind was the visit he paid to his brother in law M Quesnel An affair of an interesting nature made it necessary that he should delay this visit no longer and wishing to rouse Emily from her dejection he took her with him to Epourville As the carriage entered upon the forest that adjoined his paternal domain his eyes once more caught between the chesnut avenue the turreted corners of the chateau He sighed to think of what had passed since he was last there and that it was now the property of a man who neither revered nor valued it At length he entered the avenue whose lofty trees had so often delighted him when a boy and whose melancholy shade was now so congenial with the tone of his spirits Every feature of the edifice distinguished by an air of heavy grandeur appeared successively between the branches of the trees the broad turret the arched gate way that led into the courts the drawbridge and the dry fosse which surrounded the whole The sound of carriage wheels brought a troop of servants to the great gate where saint Aubert alighted and from which he led Emily into the gothic hall now no longer hung with the arms and ancient banners of the family These were displaced and the oak wainscotting and beams that crossed the roof were painted white The large table too that used to stretch along the upper end of the hall where the master of the mansion loved to display his hospitality and whence the peal of laughter and the song of conviviality had so often resounded was now removed even the benches that had surrounded the hall were no longer there The heavy walls were hung with frivolous ornaments and every thing that appeared denoted the false taste and corrupted sentiments of the present owner saint Aubert followed a gay Parisian servant to a parlour where sat Mons and Madame Quesnel who received him with a stately politeness and after a few formal words of condolement seemed to have forgotten that they ever had a sister Emily felt tears swell into her eyes and then resentment checked them saint Aubert calm and deliberate preserved his dignity without assuming importance and Quesnel was depressed by his presence without exactly knowing wherefore After some general conversation saint Aubert requested to speak with him alone and Emily being left with Madame Quesnel soon learned that a large party was invited to dine at the chateau and was compelled to hear that nothing which was past and irremediable ought to prevent the festivity of the present hour saint Aubert when he was told that company were expected felt a mixed emotion of disgust and indignation against the insensibility of Quesnel which prompted him to return home immediately But he was informed that Madame Cheron had been asked to meet him and when he looked at Emily and considered that a time might come when the enmity of her uncle would be prejudicial to her he determined not to incur it himself by conduct which would be resented as indecorous by the very persons who now showed so little sense of decorum Among the visitors assembled at dinner were two Italian gentlemen of whom one was named Montoni a distant relation of Madame Quesnel a man about forty of an uncommonly handsome person with features manly and expressive but whose countenance exhibited upon the whole more of the haughtiness of command and the quickness of discernment than of any other character Signor Cavigni his friend appeared to be about thirty inferior in dignity but equal to him in penetration of countenance and superior in insinuation of manner Emily was shocked by the salutation with which Madame Cheron met her father Dear brother said she I am concerned to see you look so very ill do pray have advice saint Aubert answered with a melancholy smile that he felt himself much as usual but Emily s fears made her now fancy that her father looked worse than he really did Emily would have been amused by the new characters she saw and the varied conversation that passed during dinner which was served in a style of splendour she had seldom seen before had her spirits been less oppressed Of the guests Signor Montoni was lately come from Italy and he spoke of the commotions which at that period agitated the country talked of party differences with warmth and then lamented the probable consequences of the tumults His friend spoke with equal ardour of the politics of his country praised the government and prosperity of Venice and boasted of its decided superiority over all the other Italian states He then turned to the ladies and talked with the same eloquence of Parisian fashions the French opera and French manners and on the latter subject he did not fail to mingle what is so particularly agreeable to French taste The flattery was not detected by those to whom it was addressed though its effect in producing submissive attention did not escape his observation When he could disengage himself from the assiduities of the other ladies he sometimes addressed Emily but she knew nothing of Parisian fashions or Parisian operas and her modesty simplicity and correct manners formed a decided contrast to those of her female companions After dinner saint Aubert stole from the room to view once more the old chesnut which Quesnel talked of cutting down As he stood under its shade and looked up among its branches still luxuriant and saw here and there the blue sky trembling between them the pursuits and events of his early days crowded fast to his mind with the figures and characters of friends long since gone from the earth and he now felt himself to be almost an insulated being with nobody but his Emily for his heart to turn to He stood lost amid the scenes of years which fancy called up till the succession closed with the picture of his dying wife and he started away to forget it if possible at the social board saint Aubert ordered his carriage at an early hour and Emily observed that he was more than usually silent and dejected on the way home but she considered this to be the effect of his visit to a place which spoke so eloquently of former times nor suspected that he had a cause of grief which he concealed from her On entering the chateau she felt more depressed than ever for she more than ever missed the presence of that dear parent who whenever she had been from home used to welcome her return with smiles and fondness now all was silent and forsaken But what reason and effort may fail to do time effects Week after week passed away and each as it passed stole something from the harshness of her affliction till it was mellowed to that tenderness which the feeling heart cherishes as sacred saint Aubert on the contrary visibly declined in health though Emily who had been so constantly with him was almost the last person who observed it His constitution had never recovered from the late attack of the fever and the succeeding shock it received from Madame saint Aubert s death had produced its present infirmity His physician now ordered him to travel for it was perceptible that sorrow had seized upon his nerves weakened as they had been by the preceding illness and variety of scene it was probable would by amusing his mind restore them to their proper tone For some days Emily was occupied in preparations to attend him and he by endeavours to diminish his expences at home during the journey a purpose which determined him at length to dismiss his domestics Emily seldom opposed her father s wishes by questions or remonstrances or she would now have asked why he did not take a servant and have represented that his infirm health made one almost necessary But when on the eve of their departure she found that he had dismissed Jacques Francis and Mary and detained only Theresa the old housekeeper she was extremely surprised and ventured to ask his reason for having done so To save expences my dear he replied we are going on an expensive excursion The physician had prescribed the air of Languedoc and Provence and saint Aubert determined therefore to travel leisurely along the shores of the Mediterranean towards Provence They retired early to their chamber on the night before their departure but Emily had a few books and other things to collect and the clock had struck twelve before she had finished or had remembered that some of her drawing instruments which she meant to take with her were in the parlour below As she went to fetch these she passed her father s room and perceiving the door half open concluded that he was in his study for since the death of Madame saint Aubert it had been frequently his custom to rise from his restless bed and go thither to compose his mind When she was below stairs she looked into this room but without finding him and as she returned to her chamber she tapped at his door and receiving no answer stepped softly in to be certain whether he was there The room was dark but a light glimmered through some panes of glass that were placed in the upper part of a closet door Emily believed her father to be in the closet and surprised that he was up at so late an hour apprehended he was unwell and was going to enquire but considering that her sudden appearance at this hour might alarm him she removed her light to the stair case and then stepped softly to the closet On looking through the panes of glass she saw him seated at a small table with papers before him some of which he was reading with deep attention and interest during which he often wept and sobbed aloud Emily who had come to the door to learn whether her father was ill was now detained there by a mixture of curiosity and tenderness She could not witness his sorrow without being anxious to know the subject of and she therefore continued to observe him in silence concluding that those papers were letters of her late mother Presently he knelt down and with a look so solemn as she had seldom seen him assume and which was mingled with a certain wild expression that partook more of horror than of any other character he prayed silently for a considerable time When he rose a ghastly paleness was on his countenance Emily was hastily retiring but she saw him turn again to the papers and she stopped He took from among them a small case and from thence a miniature picture The rays of light fell strongly upon it and she perceived it to be that of a lady but not of her mother saint Aubert gazed earnestly and tenderly upon his portrait put it to his lips and then to his heart and sighed with a convulsive force Emily could scarcely believe what she saw to be real She never knew till now that he had a picture of any other lady than her mother much less that he had one which he evidently valued so highly but having looked repeatedly to be certain that it was not the resemblance of Madame saint Aubert she became entirely convinced that it was designed for that of some other person At length saint Aubert returned the picture to its case and Emily recollecting that she was intruding upon his private sorrows softly withdrew from the chamber

none	none	If any thing could have tempted me from my retirement said M Barreaux it would have been the pleasure of accompanying you on this little tour I do not often offer compliments you may therefore believe me when I say that I shall look for your return with impatience The travellers proceeded on their journey As they ascended the heights saint Aubert often looked back upon the chateau in the plain below tender images crowded to his mind his melancholy imagination suggested that he should return no more and though he checked this wandering thought still he continued to look till the haziness of distance blended his home with the general landscape and saint Aubert seemed to Drag at each remove a lengthening chain He and Emily continued sunk in musing silence for some leagues from which melancholy reverie Emily first awoke and her young fancy struck with the grandeur of the objects around gradually yielded to delightful impressions The road now descended into glens confined by stupendous walls of rock grey and barren except where shrubs fringed their summits or patches of meagre vegetation tinted their recesses in which the wild goat was frequently browsing And now the way led to the lofty cliffs from whence the landscape was seen extending in all its magnificence Emily could not restrain her transport as she looked over the pine forests of the mountains upon the vast plains that enriched with woods towns blushing vines and plantations of almonds palms and olives stretched along till their various colours melted in distance into one harmonious hue that seemed to unite earth with heaven Through the whole of this glorious scene the majestic Garonne wandered descending from its source among the Pyrenees and winding its blue waves towards the Bay of Biscay The ruggedness of the unfrequented road often obliged the wanderers to alight from their little carriage but they thought themselves amply repaid for this inconvenience by the grandeur of the scenes and while the muleteer led his animals slowly over the broken ground the travellers had leisure to linger amid these solitudes and to indulge the sublime reflections which soften while they elevate the heart and fill it with the certainty of a present God Still the enjoyment of saint Aubert was touched with that pensive melancholy which gives to every object a mellower tint and breathes a sacred charm over all around They had provided against part of the evil to be encountered from a want of convenient inns by carrying a stock of provisions in the carriage so that they might take refreshment on any pleasant spot in the open air and pass the nights wherever they should happen to meet with a comfortable cottage For the mind also they had provided by a work on botany written by M Barreaux and by several of the Latin and Italian poets while Emily s pencil enabled her to preserve some of those combinations of forms which charmed her at every step The loneliness of the road where only now and then a peasant was seen driving his mule or some mountaineer children at play among the rocks heightened the effect of the scenery saint Aubert was so much struck with it that he determined if he could hear of a road to penetrate further among the mountains and bending his way rather more to the south to emerge into Rousillon and coast the Mediterranean along part of that country to Languedoc 
2411_132530_000012_000000	train-clean-360	Soon after mid day they reached the summit of one of those cliffs which bright with the verdure of palm trees adorn like gems the tremendous walls of the rocks and which overlooked the greater part of Gascony and part of Languedoc

none	none	This was a spot well suited for rest and the travellers alighted to dine while the mules were unharnessed to browse on the savoury herbs that enriched this summit It was some time before saint Aubert or Emily could withdraw their attention from the surrounding objects so as to partake of their little repast Seated in the shade of the palms saint Aubert pointed out to her observation the course of the rivers the situation of great towns and the boundaries of provinces which science rather than the eye enabled him to describe Notwithstanding this occupation when he had talked awhile he suddenly became silent thoughtful and tears often swelled to his eyes which Emily observed and the sympathy of her own heart told her their cause The scene before them bore some resemblance though it was on a much grander scale to a favourite one of the late Madame saint Aubert within view of the fishing house They both observed this and thought how delighted she would have been with the present landscape while they knew that her eyes must never never more open upon this world saint Aubert remembered the last time of his visiting that spot in company with her and also the mournfully presaging thoughts which had then arisen in his mind and were now even thus soon realized The recollections subdued him and he abruptly rose from his seat and walked away to where no eye could observe his grief When he returned his countenance had recovered its usual serenity he took Emily s hand pressed it affectionately without speaking and soon after called to the muleteer who sat at a little distance concerning a road among the mountains towards Rousillon Michael said there were several that way but he did not know how far they extended or even whether they were passable and saint Aubert who did not intend to travel after sun set asked what village they could reach about that time The muleteer calculated that they could easily reach Mateau which was in their present road but that if they took a road that sloped more to the south towards Rousillon there was a hamlet which he thought they could gain before the evening shut in saint Aubert after some hesitation determined to take the latter course and Michael having finished his meal and harnessed his mules again set forward but soon stopped and saint Aubert saw him doing homage to a cross that stood on a rock impending over their way Having concluded his devotions he smacked his whip in the air and in spite of the rough road and the pain of his poor mules which he had been lately lamenting rattled in a full gallop along the edge of a precipice which it made the eye dizzy to look down Emily was terrified almost to fainting and saint Aubert apprehending still greater danger from suddenly stopping the driver was compelled to sit quietly and trust his fate to the strength and discretion of the mules who seemed to possess a greater portion of the latter quality than their master for they carried the travellers safely into the valley and there stopped upon the brink of the rivulet that watered it Leaving the splendour of extensive prospects they now entered this narrow valley screened by

none	none	The scene of barrenness was here and there interrupted by the spreading branches of the larch and cedar which threw their gloom over the cliff or athwart the torrent that rolled in the vale No living creature appeared except the izard scrambling among the rocks and often hanging upon points so dangerous that fancy shrunk from the view of them This was such a scene as SALVATOR would have chosen had he then existed for his canvas saint Aubert impressed by the romantic character of the place almost expected to see banditti start from behind some projecting rock and he kept his hand upon the arms with which he always travelled As they advanced the valley opened its savage features gradually softened and towards evening they were among heathy mountains stretched in far perspective along which the solitary sheep bell was heard and the voice of the shepherd calling his wandering flocks to the nightly fold His cabin partly shadowed by the cork tree and the ilex which saint Aubert observed to flourish in higher regions of the air than any other trees except the fir was all the human habitation that yet appeared Along the bottom of this valley the most vivid verdure was spread and in the little hollow recesses of the mountains under the shade of the oak and chestnut herds of cattle were grazing Groups of them too were often seen reposing on the banks of the rivulet or laving their sides in the cool stream and sipping its wave The sun was now setting upon the valley its last light gleamed upon the water and heightened the rich yellow and purple tints of the heath and broom that overspread the mountains saint Aubert enquired of Michael the distance to the hamlet he had mentioned but the man could not with certainty tell and Emily began to fear that he had mistaken the road Here was no human being to assist or direct them they had left the shepherd and his cabin far behind and the scene became so obscured in twilight that the eye could not follow the distant perspective of the valley in search of a cottage or a hamlet A glow of the horizon still marked the west and this was of some little use to the travellers Michael seemed endeavouring to keep up his courage by singing his music however was not of a kind to disperse melancholy he sung in a sort of chant one of the most dismal ditties his present auditors had ever heard and saint Aubert at length discovered it to be a vesper hymn to his favourite saint They travelled on sunk in that thoughtful melancholy with which twilight and solitude impress the mind Michael had now ended his ditty and nothing was heard but the drowsy murmur of the breeze among the woods and its light flutter as it blew freshly into the carriage They were at length roused by the sound of fire arms saint Aubert called to the muleteer to stop and they listened The noise was not repeated but presently they heard a rustling among the brakes saint Aubert drew forth a pistol and ordered Michael to proceed as fast as possible who had not long obeyed before a horn sounded that made the mountains ring

none	none	The stranger was in a hunter s dress His gun was slung across his shoulders the hunter s horn hung from his belt and in his hand was a small pike which as he held it added to the manly grace of his figure and assisted the agility of his steps After a moment s hesitation saint Aubert again stopped the carriage and waited till he came up that they might enquire concerning the hamlet they were in search of The stranger informed him that it was only half a league distant that he was going thither himself and would readily shew the way saint Aubert thanked him for the offer and pleased with his chevalier like air and open countenance asked him to take a seat in the carriage which the stranger with an acknowledgment declined adding that he would keep pace with the mules But I fear you will be wretchedly accommodated said he the inhabitants of these mountains are a simple people who are not only without the luxuries of life but almost destitute of what in other places are held to be its necessaries I perceive you are not one of its inhabitants sir said saint Aubert No sir I am only a wanderer here The carriage drove on and the increasing dusk made the travellers very thankful that they had a guide the frequent glens too that now opened among the mountains would likewise have added to their perplexity Emily as she looked up one of these saw something at a great distance like a bright cloud in the air What light is yonder sir said she saint Aubert looked and perceived that it was the snowy summit of a mountain so much higher than any around it that it still reflected the sun s rays while those below lay in deep shade At length the village lights were seen to twinkle through the dusk and soon after some cottages were discovered in the valley or rather were seen by reflection in the stream on whose margin they stood and which still gleamed with the evening light The stranger now came up and saint Aubert on further enquiry found not only that there was no inn in the place but not any sort of house of public reception The stranger however offered to walk on and enquire for a cottage to accommodate them for which further civility saint Aubert returned his thanks and said that as the village was so near he would alight and walk with him Emily followed slowly in the carriage On the way saint Aubert asked his companion what success he had had in the chase Not much sir he replied nor do I aim at it I am pleased with the country and mean to saunter away a few weeks among its scenes My dogs I take with me more for companionship than for game This dress too gives me an ostensible business and procures me that respect from the people which would perhaps be refused to a lonely stranger who had no visible motive for coming among them I admire your taste said saint Aubert and if I was a younger man should like to pass a few weeks in your way exceedingly I too am a wanderer but neither my plan nor pursuits are exactly like yours I go in search of health as much as of amusement saint Aubert sighed and paused and then seeming to recollect himself he resumed If I can hear of a tolerable road that shall afford decent accommodation it is my intention to pass into Rousillon and along the sea shore to Languedoc You sir seem to be acquainted with the country and can perhaps give me information on the subject The stranger said that what information he could give was entirely at his service and then mentioned a road rather more to the east which led to a town whence it would be easy to proceed into Rousillon They now arrived at the village and commenced their search for a cottage that would afford a night s lodging In several which they entered ignorance poverty and mirth seemed equally to prevail and the owners eyed saint Aubert with a mixture of curiosity and timidity Nothing like a bed could be found and he had ceased to enquire for one when Emily joined him who observed the languor of her father s countenance and lamented that he had taken a road so ill provided with the comforts necessary for an invalid Other cottages which they examined seemed somewhat less savage than the former consisting of two rooms if such they could be called the first of these occupied by mules and pigs the second by the family which generally consisted of six or eight children with their parents who slept on beds of skins and dried beech leaves spread upon a mud floor

none	none	Eggs and milk were the only food the cottage afforded but against scarcity of provisions saint Aubert had provided and he requested Valancourt to stay and partake with him of less homely fare an invitation which was readily accepted and they passed an hour in intelligent conversation saint Aubert was much pleased with the manly frankness simplicity and keen susceptibility to the grandeur of nature which his new acquaintance discovered and indeed he had often been heard to say that without a certain simplicity of heart this taste could not exist in any strong degree The conversation was interrupted by a violent uproar without in which the voice of the muleteer was heard above every other sound Valancourt started from his seat and went to enquire the occasion but the dispute continued so long afterwards that saint Aubert went himself and found Michael quarrelling with the hostess because she had refused to let his mules lie in a little room where he and three of her sons were to pass the night The place was wretched enough but there was no other for these people to sleep in and with somewhat more of delicacy than was usual among the inhabitants of this wild tract of country she persisted in refusing to let the animals have the same BED CHAMBER with her children This was a tender point with the muleteer his honour was wounded when his mules were treated with disrespect and he would have received a blow perhaps with more meekness 
2411_132530_000036_000004	train-clean-360	He declared that his beasts were as honest beasts and as good beasts as any in the whole province and that they had a right to be well treated wherever they went 
none	none	They are as harmless as lambs said he if people don t affront them I never knew them behave themselves amiss above once or twice in my life and then they had good reason for doing so Once indeed they kicked at a boy s leg that lay asleep in the stable and broke it but I told them they were out there and by saint Anthony I believe they understood me for they never did so again He concluded this eloquent harangue with protesting that they should share with him go where he would The dispute was at length settled by Valancourt who drew the hostess aside and desired she would let the muleteer and his beasts have the place in question to themselves while her sons should have the bed of skins designed for him for that he would wrap himself in his cloak and sleep on the bench by the cottage door But this she thought it her duty to oppose and she felt it to be her inclination to disappoint the muleteer Valancourt however was positive and the tedious affair was at length settled It was late when saint Aubert and Emily retired to their rooms and Valancourt to his station at the door which at this mild season he preferred to a close cabin and a bed of skins saint Aubert was somewhat surprised to find in his room volumes of Homer Horace and Petrarch but the name of Valancourt written in them told him to whom they belonged CHAPTER IV In truth he was a strange and wayward wight Fond of each gentle and each dreadful scene In darkness and in storm he found delight Nor less than when on ocean wave serene The southern sun diffus d his dazzling sheen Even sad vicissitude amus d his soul And if a sigh would sometimes intervene And down his cheek a tear of pity roll A sigh a tear so sweet he wish d not to controul THE MINSTREL saint Aubert awoke at an early hour refreshed by sleep and desirous to set forward He invited the stranger to breakfast with him and talking again of the road Valancourt said that some months past he had travelled as far as Beaujeu which was a town of some consequence on the way to Rousillon He recommended it to saint Aubert to take that route and the latter determined to do so The road from this hamlet said Valancourt and that to Beaujeu part at the distance of about a league and a half from hence if you will give me leave I will direct your muleteer so far I must wander somewhere and your company would make this a pleasanter ramble than any other I could take saint Aubert thankfully accepted his offer and they set out together the young stranger on foot for he refused the invitation of saint Aubert to take a seat in his little carriage The road wound along the feet of the mountains through a pastoral valley bright with verdure and varied with groves of dwarf oak beech and sycamore under whose branches herds of cattle reposed The mountain ash too and the weeping birch often threw their pendant foliage over the steeps above where the scanty soil scarcely concealed their roots and where their light branches waved to every breeze that fluttered from the mountains The travellers were frequently met at this early hour for the sun had not yet risen upon the valley by shepherds driving immense flocks from their folds to feed upon the hills saint Aubert had set out thus early not only that he might enjoy the first appearance of sunrise but that he might inhale the first pure breath of morning which above all things is refreshing to the spirits of the invalid In these regions it was particularly so where an abundance of wild flowers and aromatic herbs breathed forth their essence on the air The dawn which softened the scenery with its peculiar grey tint now dispersed and Emily watched the progress of the day first trembling on the tops of the highest cliffs then touching them with splendid light while their sides and the vale below were still wrapt in dewy mist Meanwhile the sullen grey of the eastern clouds began to blush then to redden and then to glow with a thousand colours till the golden light darted over all the air touched the lower points of the mountain s brow and glanced in long sloping beams upon the valley and its stream All nature seemed to have awakened from death into life the spirit of saint Aubert was renovated His heart was full he wept and his thoughts ascended to the Great Creator Emily wished to trip along the turf so green and bright with dew and to taste the full delight of that liberty which the izard seemed to enjoy as he bounded along the brow of the cliffs while Valancourt often stopped to speak with the travellers and with social feeling to point out to them the peculiar objects of his admiration saint Aubert was pleased with him Here is the real ingenuousness and ardour of youth said he to himself this young man has never been at Paris He was sorry when they came to the spot where the roads parted and his heart took a more affectionate leave of him than is usual after so short an acquaintance Valancourt talked long by the side of the carriage seemed more than once to be going but still lingered and appeared to search anxiously for topics of conversation to account for his delay At length he took leave As he went saint Aubert observed him look with an earnest and pensive eye at Emily who bowed to him with a countenance full of timid sweetness while the carriage drove on saint Aubert for whatever reason soon after looked from the window and saw Valancourt standing upon the bank of the road resting on his pike with folded arms and following the carriage with his eyes He waved his hand and Valancourt seeming to awake from his reverie returned the salute and started away The aspect of the country now began to change and the travellers soon found themselves among mountains covered from their base nearly to their summits with forests of gloomy pine except where a rock of granite shot up from the vale and lost its snowy top in the clouds The rivulet which had hitherto accompanied them now expanded into a river and flowing deeply and silently along reflected as in a mirror the blackness of the impending shades Sometimes a cliff was seen lifting its bold head above the woods and the vapours that floated mid way down the mountains and sometimes a face of perpendicular marble rose from the water s edge over which the larch threw his gigantic arms here scathed with lightning and there floating in luxuriant foliage They continued to travel over a rough and unfrequented road seeing now and then at a distance the solitary shepherd with his dog stalking along the valley and hearing only the dashing of torrents which the woods concealed from the eye the long sullen murmur of the breeze as it swept over the pines or the notes of the eagle and the vulture which were seen towering round the beetling cliff Often as the carriage moved slowly over uneven ground saint Aubert alighted and amused himself with examining the curious plants that grew on the banks of the road and with which these regions abound while Emily wrapt in high enthusiasm wandered away under the shades listening in deep silence to the lonely murmur of the woods Neither village nor hamlet was seen for many leagues the goat herd s or the hunter s cabin perched among the cliffs of the rocks were the only human habitations that appeared The travellers again took their dinner in the open air on a pleasant spot in the valley under the spreading shade of cedars and then set forward towards Beaujeu The road now began to descend and leaving the pine forests behind wound among rocky precipices The evening twilight again fell over the scene and the travellers were ignorant how far they might yet be from Beaujeu saint Aubert however conjectured that the distance could not be very great and comforted himself with the prospect of travelling on a more frequented road after reaching that town where he designed to pass the night Mingled woods and rocks and heathy mountains were now seen obscurely through the dusk but soon even these imperfect images faded in darkness Michael proceeded with caution for he could scarcely distinguish the road his mules however seemed to have more sagacity and their steps were sure On turning the angle of a mountain a light appeared at a distance that illumined the rocks and the horizon to a great extent It was evidently a large fire but whether accidental or otherwise there were no means of knowing saint Aubert thought it was probably kindled by some of the numerous banditti that infested the Pyrenees and he became watchful and anxious to know whether the road passed near this fire He had arms with him which on an emergency might afford some protection though certainly a very unequal one against a band of robbers so desperate too as those usually were who haunted these wild regions While many reflections rose upon his mind he heard a voice shouting from the road behind and ordering the muleteer to stop saint Aubert bade him proceed as fast as possible but either Michael or his mules were obstinate for they did not quit the old pace Horses feet were now heard a man rode up to the carriage still ordering the driver to stop and saint Aubert who could no longer doubt his purpose was with difficulty able to prepare a pistol for his defence when his hand was upon the door of the chaise The man staggered on his horse the report of the pistol was followed by a groan and saint Aubert s horror may be imagined when in the next instant he thought he heard the faint voice of Valancourt He now himself bade the muleteer stop and pronouncing the name of Valancourt was answered in a voice that no longer suffered him to doubt saint Aubert who instantly alighted and went to his assistance found him still sitting on his horse but bleeding profusely and appearing to be in great pain though he endeavoured to soften the terror of saint Aubert by assurances that he was not materially hurt the wound being only in his arm saint Aubert with the muleteer assisted him to dismount and he sat down on the bank of the road where saint Aubert tried to bind up his arm but his hands trembled so excessively that he could not accomplish it and Michael being now gone in pursuit of the horse which on being disengaged from his rider had galloped off he called Emily to his assistance Receiving no answer he went to the carriage and found her sunk on the seat in a fainting fit Between the distress of this circumstance and that of leaving Valancourt bleeding he scarcely knew what he did he endeavoured however to raise her and called to Michael to fetch water from the rivulet that flowed by the road but Michael was gone beyond the reach of his voice Valancourt who heard these calls and also the repeated name of Emily instantly understood the subject of his distress and almost forgetting his own condition he hastened to her relief She was reviving when he reached the carriage and then understanding that anxiety for him had occasioned her indisposition he assured her in a voice that trembled but not from anguish that his wound was of no consequence While he said this saint Aubert turned round and perceiving that he was still bleeding the subject of his alarm changed again and he hastily formed some handkerchiefs into a bandage This stopped the effusion of the blood but saint Aubert dreading the consequence of the wound enquired repeatedly how far they were from Beaujeu when learning that it was at two leagues distance his distress increased since he knew not how Valancourt in his present state would bear the motion of the carriage and perceived that he was already faint from loss of blood When he mentioned the subject of his anxiety Valancourt entreated that he would not suffer himself to be thus alarmed on his account for that he had no doubt he should be able to support himself very well and then he talked of the accident as a slight one The muleteer being now returned with Valancourt s horse assisted him into the chaise and as Emily was now revived they moved slowly on towards Beaujeu saint Aubert when he had recovered from the terror occasioned him by this accident expressed surprise on seeing Valancourt who explained his unexpected appearance by saying You sir renewed my taste for society when you had left the hamlet it did indeed appear a solitude I determined therefore since my object was merely amusement to change the scene and I took this road because I knew it led through a more romantic tract of mountains than the spot I have left Besides added he hesitating for an instant I will own and why should I not that I had some hope of overtaking you And I have made you a very unexpected return for the compliment said saint Aubert who lamented again the rashness which had produced the accident and explained the cause of his late alarm But Valancourt seemed anxious only to remove from the minds of his companions every unpleasant feeling relative to himself and for that purpose still struggled against a sense of pain and tried to converse with gaiety Emily meanwhile was silent except when Valancourt particularly addressed her and there was at those times a tremulous tone in his voice that spoke much They were now so near the fire which had long flamed at a distance on the blackness of night that it gleamed upon the road and they could distinguish figures moving about the blaze The way winding still nearer they perceived in the valley one of those numerous bands of gipsies which at that period particularly haunted the wilds of the Pyrenees and lived partly by plundering the traveller Emily looked with some degree of terror on the savage countenances of these people shewn by the fire which heightened the romantic effects of the scenery as it threw a red dusky gleam upon the rocks and on the foliage of the trees leaving heavy masses of shade and regions of obscurity which the eye feared to penetrate They were preparing their supper a large pot stood by the fire over which several figures were busy The blaze discovered a rude kind of tent round which many children and dogs were playing and the whole formed a picture highly grotesque The travellers saw plainly their danger Valancourt was silent but laid his hand on one of saint Aubert s pistols saint Aubert drew forth another and Michael was ordered to proceed as fast as possible They passed the place however without being attacked the rovers being probably unprepared for the opportunity and too busy about their supper to feel much interest at the moment in any thing besides After a league and a half more passed in darkness the travellers arrived at Beaujeu and drove up to the only inn the place afforded which though superior to any they had seen since they entered the mountains was bad enough The surgeon of the town was immediately sent for if a surgeon he could be called who prescribed for horses as well as for men and shaved faces at least as dexterously as he set bones After examining Valancourt s arm and perceiving that the bullet had passed through the flesh without touching the bone he dressed it and left him with a solemn prescription of quiet which his patient was not inclined to obey The delight of ease had now succeeded to pain for ease may be allowed to assume a positive quality when contrasted with anguish and his spirits thus re animated he wished to partake of the conversation of saint Aubert and Emily who released from so many apprehensions were uncommonly cheerful Late as it was however saint Aubert was obliged to go out with the landlord to buy meat for supper and Emily who during this interval had been absent as long as she could upon excuses of looking to their accommodation which she found rather better than she expected was compelled to return and converse with Valancourt alone They talked of the character of the scenes they had passed of the natural history of the country of poetry and of saint Aubert a subject on which Emily always spoke and listened to with peculiar pleasure The travellers passed an agreeable evening but saint Aubert was fatigued with his journey and as Valancourt seemed again sensible of pain they separated soon after supper In the morning saint Aubert found that Valancourt had passed a restless night that he was feverish and his wound very painful The surgeon when he dressed it advised him to remain quietly at Beaujeu advice which was too reasonable to be rejected saint Aubert however had no favourable opinion of this practitioner and was anxious to commit Valancourt into more skilful hands but learning upon enquiry that there was no town within several leagues which seemed more likely to afford better advice he altered the plan of his journey and determined to await the recovery of Valancourt who with somewhat more ceremony than sincerity made many objections to this delay By order of his surgeon Valancourt did not go out of the house that day but saint Aubert and Emily surveyed with delight the environs of the town situated at the feet of the Pyrenean Alps that rose some in abrupt precipices and others swelling with woods of cedar fir and cypress which stretched nearly to their highest summits The cheerful green of the beech and mountain ash was sometimes seen like a gleam of light amidst the dark verdure of the forest and sometimes a torrent poured its sparkling flood high among the woods Valancourt s indisposition detained the travellers at Beaujeu several days during which interval saint Aubert had observed his disposition and his talents with the philosophic inquiry so natural to him He saw a frank and generous nature full of ardour highly susceptible of whatever is grand and beautiful but impetuous wild and somewhat romantic Valancourt had known little of the world His perceptions were clear and his feelings just his indignation of an unworthy or his admiration of a generous action were expressed in terms of equal vehemence saint Aubert sometimes smiled at his warmth but seldom checked it and often repeated to himself This young man has never been at Paris A sigh sometimes followed this silent ejaculation He determined not to leave Valancourt till he should be perfectly recovered and as he was now well enough to travel though not able to manage his horse saint Aubert invited him to accompany him for a few days in the carriage This he the more readily did since he had discovered that Valancourt was of a family of the same name in Gascony with whose respectability he was well acquainted The latter accepted the offer with great pleasure and they again set forward among these romantic wilds about Rousillon They travelled leisurely stopping wherever a scene uncommonly grand appeared frequently alighting to walk to an eminence whither the mules could not go from which the prospect opened in greater magnificence and often sauntering over hillocks covered with lavender wild thyme juniper and tamarisc and under the shades of woods between those boles they caught the long mountain vista sublime beyond any thing that Emily had ever imagined saint Aubert sometimes amused himself with botanizing while Valancourt and Emily strolled on he pointing out to her notice the objects that particularly charmed him and reciting beautiful passages from such of the Latin and Italian poets as he had heard her admire In the pauses of conversation when he thought himself not observed he frequently fixed his eyes pensively on her countenance which expressed with so much animation the taste and energy of her mind and when he spoke again there was a peculiar tenderness in the tone of his voice that defeated any attempt to conceal his sentiments By degrees these silent pauses became more frequent till Emily only betrayed an anxiety to interrupt them and she who had been hitherto reserved would now talk again and again of the woods and the vallies and the mountains to avoid the danger of sympathy and silence From Beaujeu the road had constantly ascended conducting the travellers into the higher regions of the air where immense glaciers exhibited their frozen horrors and eternal snow whitened the summits of the mountains They often paused to contemplate these stupendous scenes and seated on some wild cliff where only the ilex or the larch could flourish looked over dark forests of fir and precipices where human foot had never wandered into the glen so deep that the thunder of the torrent which was seen to foam along the bottom was scarcely heard to murmur Over these crags rose others of stupendous height and fantastic shape some shooting into cones others impending far over their base in huge masses of granite along whose broken ridges was often lodged a weight of snow that trembling even to the vibration of a sound threatened to bear destruction in its course to the vale Around on every side far as the eye could penetrate were seen only forms of grandeur the long perspective of mountain tops tinged with ethereal blue or white with snow vallies of ice and forests of gloomy fir The serenity and clearness of the air in these high regions were particularly delightful to the travellers it seemed to inspire them with a finer spirit and diffused an indescribable complacency over their minds They had no words to express the sublime emotions they felt A solemn expression characterized the feelings of saint Aubert tears often came to his eyes and he frequently walked away from his companions Valancourt now and then spoke to point to Emily s notice some feature of the scene The thinness of the atmosphere through which every object came so distinctly to the eye surprised and deluded her who could scarcely believe that objects which appeared so near were in reality so distant The deep silence of these solitudes was broken only at intervals by the scream of the vultures seen cowering round some cliff below or by the cry of the eagle sailing high in the air except when the travellers listened to the hollow thunder that sometimes muttered at their feet While above the deep blue of the heavens was unobscured by the lightest cloud half way down the mountains long billows of vapour were frequently seen rolling now wholly excluding the country below and now opening and partially revealing its features Emily delighted to observe the grandeur of these clouds as they changed in shape and tints and to watch their various effect on the lower world whose features partly veiled were continually assuming new forms of sublimity After traversing these regions for many leagues they began to descend towards Rousillon and features of beauty then mingled with the scene Yet the travellers did not look back without some regret to the sublime objects they had quitted though the eye fatigued with the extension of its powers was glad to repose on the verdure of woods and pastures that now hung on the margin of the river below to view again the humble cottage shaded by cedars the playful group of mountaineer children and the flowery nooks that appeared among the hills As they descended they saw at a distance on the right one of the grand passes of the Pyrenees into Spain gleaming with its battlements and towers to the splendour of the setting rays yellow tops of woods colouring the steeps below while far above aspired the snowy points of the mountains still reflecting a rosy hue saint Aubert began to look out for the little town he had been directed to by the people of Beaujeu and where he meant to pass the night but no habitation yet appeared Of its distance Valancourt could not assist him to judge for he had never been so far along this chain of Alps before There was however a road to guide them and there could be little doubt that it was the right one for since they had left Beaujeu there had been no variety of tracks to perplex or mislead The sun now gave his last light and saint Aubert bade the muleteer proceed with all possible dispatch He found indeed the lassitude of illness return upon him after a day of uncommon fatigue both of body and mind and he longed for repose His anxiety was not soothed by observing a numerous train consisting of men horses and loaded mules winding down the steeps of an opposite mountain appearing and disappearing at intervals among the woods so that its numbers could not be judged of Something bright like arms glanced in the setting ray and the military dress was distinguishable upon the men who were in the van and on others scattered among the troop that followed As these wound into the vale the rear of the party emerged from the woods and exhibited a band of soldiers saint Aubert s apprehensions now subsided he had no doubt that the train before him consisted of smugglers who in conveying prohibited goods over the Pyrenees had been encountered and conquered by a party of troops The travellers had lingered so long among the sublimer scenes of these mountains that they found themselves entirely mistaken in their calculation that they could reach Montigny at sun set but as they wound along the valley the saw on a rude Alpine bridge that united two lofty crags of the glen a group of mountaineer children amusing themselves with dropping pebbles into a torrent below and watching the stones plunge into the water that threw up its white spray high in the air as it received them and returned a sullen sound which the echoes of the mountains prolonged Under the bridge was seen a perspective of the valley with its cataract descending among the rocks and a cottage on a cliff overshadowed with pines It appeared that they could not be far from some small town saint Aubert bade the muleteer stop and then called to the children to enquire if he was near Montigny but the distance and the roaring of the waters would not suffer his voice to be heard and the crags adjoining the bridge were of such tremendous height and steepness that to have climbed either would have been scarcely practicable to a person unacquainted with the ascent saint Aubert therefore did not waste more moments in delay They continued to travel long after twilight had obscured the road which was so broken that now thinking it safer to walk than to ride they all alighted The moon was rising but her light was yet too feeble to assist them While they stepped carefully on they heard the vesper bell of a convent The twilight would not permit them to distinguish anything like a building but the sounds seemed to come from some woods that overhung an acclivity to the right Valancourt proposed to go in search of this convent If they will not accommodate us with a night s lodging said he they may certainly inform us how far we are from Montigny and direct us towards it He was bounding forward without waiting saint Aubert s reply when the latter stopped him I am very weary said saint Aubert and wish for nothing so much as for immediate rest We will all go to the convent your good looks would defeat our purpose but when they see mine and Emily s exhausted countenances they will scarcely deny us repose As he said this he took Emily s arm within his and telling Michael to wait awhile in the road with the carriage they began to ascend towards the woods guided by the bell of the convent His steps were feeble and Valancourt offered him his arm which he accepted The moon now threw a faint light over their path and soon after enabled them to distinguish some towers rising above the tops of the woods Still following the note of the bell they entered the shade of those woods lighted only by the moonbeams that glided down between the leaves and threw a tremulous uncertain gleam upon the steep track they were winding The gloom and the silence that prevailed except when the bell returned upon the air together with the wildness of the surrounding scene struck Emily with a degree of fear which however the voice and conversation of Valancourt somewhat repressed When they had been some time ascending saint Aubert complained of weariness and they stopped to rest upon a little green summit where the trees opened and admitted the moon light He sat down upon the turf between Emily and Valancourt The bell had now ceased and the deep repose of the scene was undisturbed by any sound for the low dull murmur of some distant torrents might be said to sooth rather than to interrupt the silence Before them extended the valley they had quitted its rocks and woods to the left just silvered by the rays formed a contrast to the deep shadow that involved the opposite cliffs whose fringed summits only were tipped with light while the distant perspective of the valley was lost in the yellow mist of moon light The travellers sat for some time wrapt in the complacency which such scenes inspire These scenes said Valancourt at length soften the heart like the notes of sweet music and inspire that delicious melancholy which no person who had felt it once would resign for the gayest pleasures They waken our best and purest feelings disposing us to benevolence pity and friendship Those whom I love I always seem to love more in such an hour as this His voice trembled and he paused saint Aubert was silent Emily perceived a warm tear fall upon the hand he held she knew the object of his thoughts hers too had for some time been occupied by the remembrance of her mother He seemed by an effort to rouse himself Yes said he with an half suppressed sigh the memory of those we love of times for ever past in such an hour as this steals upon the mind like a strain of distant music in the stillness of night all tender and harmonious as this landscape sleeping in the mellow moon light After the pause of a moment saint Aubert added I have always fancied that I thought with more clearness and precision at such an hour than at any other and that heart must be insensible in a great degree that does not soften to its influence But many such there are Valancourt sighed Are there indeed many such said Emily A few years hence my Emily replied saint Aubert and you may smile at the recollection of that question if you do not weep to it But come I am somewhat refreshed let us proceed Having emerged from the woods they saw upon a turfy hillock above the convent of which they were in search A high wall that surrounded it led them to an ancient gate at which they knocked and the poor monk who opened it conducted them into a small adjoining room where he desired they would wait while he informed the superior of their request In this interval several friars came in separately to look at them and at length the first monk returned and they followed him to a room where the superior was sitting in an arm chair with a large folio volume printed in black letter open on a desk before him He received them with courtesy though he did not rise from his seat and having asked them a few questions granted their request After a short conversation formal and solemn on the part of the superior they withdrew to the apartment where they were to sup and Valancourt whom one of the inferior friars civilly desired to accompany went to seek Michael and his mules They had not descended half way down the cliffs before they heard the voice of the muleteer echoing far and wide Sometimes he called on saint Aubert and sometimes on Valancourt who having at length convinced him that he had nothing to fear either for himself or his master and having disposed of him for the night in a cottage on the skirts of the woods returned to sup with his friends on such sober fare as the monks thought it prudent to set before them While saint Aubert was too much indisposed to share it Emily in her anxiety for her father forgot herself and Valancourt silent and thoughtful yet never inattentive to them appeared particularly solicitous to accommodate and relieve saint Aubert who often observed while his daughter was pressing him to eat or adjusting the pillow she had placed in the back of his arm chair that Valancourt fixed on her a look of pensive tenderness which he was not displeased to understand They separated at an early hour and retired to their respective apartments Emily was shown to hers by a nun of the convent whom she was glad to dismiss for her heart was melancholy and her attention so much abstracted that conversation with a stranger was painful She thought her father daily declining and attributed his present fatigue more to the feeble state of his frame than to the difficulty of the journey A train of gloomy ideas haunted her mind till she fell asleep In about two hours after she was awakened by the chiming of a bell and then heard quick steps pass along the gallery into which her chamber opened She was so little accustomed to the manners of a convent as to be alarmed by this circumstance her fears ever alive for her father suggested that he was very ill and she rose in haste to go to him Having paused however to let the persons in the gallery pass before she opened her door her thoughts in the mean time recovered from the confusion of sleep and she understood that the bell was the call of the monks to prayers It had now ceased and all being again still she forbore to go to saint Aubert s room Her mind was not disposed for immediate sleep and the moon light that shone into her chamber invited her to open the casement and look out upon the country It was a still and beautiful night the sky was unobscured by any cloud and scarce a leaf of the woods beneath trembled in the air As she listened the mid night hymn of the monks rose softly from a chapel that stood on one of the lower cliffs an holy strain that seemed to ascend through the silence of night to heaven and her thoughts ascended with it From the consideration of His works her mind arose to the adoration of the Deity in His goodness and power wherever she turned her view whether on the sleeping earth or to the vast regions of space glowing with worlds beyond the reach of human thought the sublimity of God and the majesty of His presence appeared Her eyes were filled with tears of awful love and admiration and she felt that pure devotion superior to all the distinctions of human system which lifts the soul above this world and seems to expand it into a nobler nature such devotion as can perhaps only be experienced when the mind rescued for a moment from the humbleness of earthly considerations aspires to contemplate His power in the sublimity of His works and His goodness in the infinity of His blessings Is it not now the hour The holy hour when to the cloudless height Of yon starred concave climbs the full orbed moon And to this nether world in solemn stillness Gives sign that to the list ning ear of Heaven Religion s voice should plead The very babe Knows this and chance awak d his little hands Lifts to the gods and on his innocent couch Calls down a blessing Caractacus The midnight chant of the monks soon after dropped into silence but Emily remained at the casement watching the setting moon and the valley sinking into deep shade and willing to prolong her present state of mind At length she retired to her mattress and sunk into tranquil slumber CHAPTER V While in the rosy vale Love breath d his infant sighs from anguish free Thomson saint Aubert sufficiently restored by a night s repose to pursue his journey set out in the morning with his family and Valancourt for Rousillon which he hoped to reach before night fall The scenes through which they now passed were as wild and romantic as any they had yet observed with this difference that beauty every now and then softened the landscape into smiles Little woody recesses appeared among the mountains covered with bright verdure and flowers or a pastoral valley opened its grassy bosom in the shade of the cliffs with flocks and herds loitering along the banks of a rivulet that refreshed it with perpetual green saint Aubert could not repent the having taken this fatiguing road though he was this day also frequently obliged to alight to walk along the rugged precipice and to climb the steep and flinty mountain The wonderful sublimity and variety of the prospects repaid him for all this and the enthusiasm with which they were viewed by his young companions heightened his own and awakened a remembrance of all the delightful emotions of his early days when the sublime charms of nature were first unveiled to him He found great pleasure in conversing with Valancourt and in listening to his ingenuous remarks The fire and simplicity of his manners seemed to render him a characteristic figure in the scenes around them and saint Aubert discovered in his sentiments the justness and the dignity of an elevated mind unbiased by intercourse with the world He perceived that his opinions were formed rather than imbibed were more the result of thought than of learning Of the world he seemed to know nothing for he believed well of all mankind and this opinion gave him the reflected image of his own heart saint Aubert as he sometimes lingered to examine the wild plants in his path often looked forward with pleasure to Emily and Valancourt as they strolled on together he with a countenance of animated delight pointing to her attention some grand feature of the scene and she listening and observing with a look of tender seriousness that spoke the elevation of her mind They appeared like two lovers who had never strayed beyond these their native mountains whose situation had secluded them from the frivolities of common life whose ideas were simple and grand like the landscapes among which they moved and who knew no other happiness than in the union of pure and affectionate hearts saint Aubert smiled and sighed at the romantic picture of felicity his fancy drew and sighed again to think that nature and simplicity were so little known to the world as that their pleasures were thought romantic The world said he pursuing this train of thought ridicules a passion which it seldom feels its scenes and its interests distract the mind deprave the taste corrupt the heart and love cannot exist in a heart that has lost the meek dignity of innocence Virtue and taste are nearly the same for virtue is little more than active taste and the most delicate affections of each combine in real love How then are we to look for love in great cities where selfishness dissipation and insincerity supply the place of tenderness simplicity and truth It was near noon when the travellers having arrived at a piece of steep and dangerous road alighted to walk The road wound up an ascent that was clothed with wood and instead of following the carriage they entered the refreshing shade A dewy coolness was diffused upon the air which with the bright verdure of turf that grew under the trees the mingled fragrance of flowers and of balm thyme and lavender that enriched it and the grandeur of the pines beech and chestnuts that overshadowed them rendered this a most delicious retreat Sometimes the thick foliage excluded all view of the country at others it admitted some partial catches of the distant scenery which gave hints to the imagination to picture landscapes more interesting more impressive than any that had been presented to the eye The wanderers often lingered to indulge in these reveries of fancy The pauses of silence such as had formerly interrupted the conversations of Valancourt and Emily were more frequent today than ever Valancourt often dropped suddenly from the most animating vivacity into fits of deep musing and there was sometimes an unaffected melancholy in his smile which Emily could not avoid understanding for her heart was interested in the sentiment it spoke saint Aubert was refreshed by the shades and they continued to saunter under them following as nearly as they could guess the direction of the road till they perceived that they had totally lost it They had continued near the brow of the precipice allured by the scenery it exhibited while the road wound far away over the cliff above Valancourt called loudly to Michael but heard no voice except his own echoing among the rocks and his various efforts to regain the road were equally unsuccessful While they were thus circumstanced they perceived a shepherd s cabin between the boles of the trees at some distance and Valancourt bounded on first to ask assistance When he reached it he saw only two little children at play on the turf before the door He looked into the hut but no person was there and the eldest of the boys told him that their father was with his flocks and their mother was gone down into the vale but would be back presently As he stood considering what was further to be done on a sudden he heard Michael s voice roaring forth most manfully among the cliffs above till he made their echoes ring Valancourt immediately answered the call and endeavoured to make his way through the thicket that clothed the steeps following the direction of the sound After much struggle over brambles and precipices he reached Michael and at length prevailed with him to be silent and to listen to him The road was at a considerable distance from the spot where saint Aubert and Emily were the carriage could not easily return to the entrance of the wood and since it would be very fatiguing for saint Aubert to climb the long and steep road to the place where it now stood Valancourt was anxious to find a more easy ascent by the way he had himself passed Meanwhile saint Aubert and Emily approached the cottage and rested themselves on a rustic bench fastened between two pines which overshadowed it till Valancourt whose steps they had observed should return The eldest of the children desisted from his play and stood still to observe the strangers while the younger continued his little gambols and teased his brother to join in them saint Aubert looked with pleasure upon this picture of infantine simplicity till it brought to his remembrance his own boys whom he had lost about the age of these and their lamented mother and he sunk into a thoughtfulness which Emily observing she immediately began to sing one of those simple and lively airs he was so fond of and which she knew how to give with the most captivating sweetness saint Aubert smiled on her through his tears took her hand and pressed it affectionately and then tried to dissipate the melancholy reflections that lingered in his mind While she sung Valancourt approached who was unwilling to interrupt her and paused at a little distance to listen When she had concluded he joined the party and told them that he had found Michael as well as a way by which he thought they could ascend the cliff to the carriage He pointed to the woody steeps above which saint Aubert surveyed with an anxious eye He was already wearied by his walk and this ascent was formidable to him He thought however it would be less toilsome than the long and broken road and he determined to attempt it but Emily ever watchful of his ease proposing that he should rest and dine before they proceeded further Valancourt went to the carriage for the refreshments deposited there On his return he proposed removing a little higher up the mountain to where the woods opened upon a grand and extensive prospect and thither they were preparing to go when they saw a young woman join the children and caress and weep over them The travellers interested by her distress stopped to observe her She took the youngest of the children in her arms and perceiving the strangers hastily dried her tears and proceeded to the cottage saint Aubert on enquiring the occasion of her sorrow learned that her husband who was a shepherd and lived here in the summer months to watch over the flocks he led to feed upon these mountains had lost on the preceding night his little all A gang of gipsies who had for some time infested the neighbourhood had driven away several of his master s sheep Jacques added the shepherd s wife had saved a little money and had bought a few sheep with it and now they must go to his master for those that are stolen and what is worse than all his master when he comes to know how it is will trust him no longer with the care of his flocks for he is a hard man and then what is to become of our children The innocent countenance of the woman and the simplicity of her manner in relating her grievance inclined saint Aubert to believe her story and Valancourt convinced that it was true asked eagerly what was the value of the stolen sheep on hearing which he turned away with a look of disappointment saint Aubert put some money into her hand Emily too gave something from her little purse and they walked towards the cliff but Valancourt lingered behind and spoke to the shepherd s wife who was now weeping with gratitude and surprise He enquired how much money was yet wanting to replace the stolen sheep and found that it was a sum very little short of all he had about him He was perplexed and distressed This sum then said he to himself would make this poor family completely happy it is in my power to give it to make them completely happy But what is to become of me how shall I contrive to reach home with the little money that will remain For a moment he stood unwilling to forego the luxury of raising a family from ruin to happiness yet considering the difficulties of pursuing his journey with so small a sum as would be left While he was in this state of perplexity the shepherd himself appeared his children ran to meet him he took one of them in his arms and with the other clinging to his coat came forward with a loitering step His forlorn and melancholy look determined Valancourt at once he threw down all the money he had except a very few louis and bounded away after saint Aubert and Emily who were proceeding slowly up the steep Valancourt had seldom felt his heart so light as at this moment his gay spirits danced with pleasure every object around him appeared more interesting or beautiful than before saint Aubert observed the uncommon vivacity of his countenance What has pleased you so much said he O what a lovely day replied Valancourt how brightly the sun shines how pure is this air what enchanting scenery It is indeed enchanting said saint Aubert whom early experience had taught to understand the nature of Valancourt s present feelings What pity that the wealthy who can command such sunshine should ever pass their days in gloom in the cold shade of selfishness For you my young friend may the sun always shine as brightly as at this moment may your own conduct always give you the sunshine of benevolence and reason united Valancourt highly flattered by this compliment could make no reply but by a smile of gratitude They continued to wind under the woods between the grassy knolls of the mountain and as they reached the shady summit which he had pointed out the whole party burst into an exclamation Behind the spot where they stood the rock rose perpendicularly in a massy wall to a considerable height and then branched out into overhanging crags Their grey tints were well contrasted by the bright hues of the plants and wild flowers that grew in their fractured sides and were deepened by the gloom of the pines and cedars that waved above The steeps below over which the eye passed abruptly to the valley were fringed with thickets of alpine shrubs and lower still appeared the tufted tops of the chesnut woods that clothed their base among which peeped forth the shepherd s cottage just left by the travellers with its blueish smoke curling high in the air On every side appeared the majestic summits of the Pyrenees some exhibiting tremendous crags of marble whose appearance was changing every instant as the varying lights fell upon their surface others still higher displaying only snowy points while their lower steeps were covered almost invariably with forests of pine larch and oak that stretched down to the vale This was one of the narrow vallies that open from the Pyrenees into the country of Rousillon and whose green pastures and cultivated beauty form a decided and wonderful contrast to the romantic grandeur that environs it Through a vista of the mountains appeared the lowlands of Rousillon tinted with the blue haze of distance as they united with the waters of the Mediterranean where on a promontory which marked the boundary of the shore stood a lonely beacon over which were seen circling flights of sea fowl Beyond appeared now and then a stealing sail white with the sun beam and whose progress was perceivable by its approach to the light house Sometimes too was seen a sail so distant that it served only to mark the line of separation between the sky and the waves On the other side of the valley immediately opposite to the spot where the travellers rested a rocky pass opened toward Gascony Here no sign of cultivation appeared The rocks of granite that screened the glen rose abruptly from their base and stretched their barren points to the clouds unvaried with woods and uncheered even by a hunter s cabin Sometimes indeed a gigantic larch threw its long shade over the precipice and here and there a cliff reared on its brow a monumental cross to tell the traveller the fate of him who had ventured thither before This spot seemed the very haunt of banditti and Emily as she looked down upon it almost expected to see them stealing out from some hollow cave to look for their prey Soon after an object not less terrific struck her a gibbet standing on a point of rock near the entrance of the pass and immediately over one of the crosses she had before observed These were hieroglyphics that told a plain and dreadful story She forbore to point it out to saint Aubert but it threw a gloom over her spirits and made her anxious to hasten forward that they might with certainty reach Rousillon before night fall It was necessary however that saint Aubert should take some refreshment and seating themselves on the short dry turf they opened the basket of provisions while by breezy murmurs cool d Broad o er THEIR heads the verdant cedars wave And high palmetos lift their graceful shade THEY draw Ethereal soul there drink reviving gales Profusely breathing from the piney groves And vales of fragrance there at a distance hear The roaring floods and cataracts Thomson saint Aubert was revived by rest and by the serene air of this summit and Valancourt was so charmed with all around and with the conversation of his companions that he seemed to have forgotten he had any further to go Having concluded their simple repast they gave a long farewell look to the scene and again began to ascend saint Aubert rejoiced when he reached the carriage which Emily entered with him but Valancourt willing to take a more extensive view of the enchanting country into which they were about to descend than he could do from a carriage loosened his dogs and once more bounded with them along the banks of the road He often quitted it for points that promised a wider prospect and the slow pace at which the mules travelled allowed him to overtake them with ease Whenever a scene of uncommon magnificence appeared he hastened to inform saint Aubert who though he was too much tired to walk himself sometimes made the chaise wait while Emily went to the neighbouring cliff It was evening when they descended the lower alps that bind Rousillon and form a majestic barrier round that charming country leaving it open only on the east to the Mediterranean The gay tints of cultivation once more beautified the landscape for the lowlands were coloured with the richest hues which a luxuriant climate and an industrious people can awaken into life Groves of orange and lemon perfumed the air their ripe fruit glowing among the foliage while sloping to the plains extensive vineyards spread their treasures Beyond these woods and pastures and mingled towns and hamlets stretched towards the sea on whose bright surface gleamed many a distant sail while over the whole scene was diffused the purple glow of evening This landscape with the surrounding alps did indeed present a perfect picture of the lovely and the sublime of beauty sleeping in the lap of horror The travellers having reached the plains proceeded between hedges of flowering myrtle and pomegranate to the town of Arles where they proposed to rest for the night They met with simple but neat accommodation and would have passed a happy evening after the toils and the delights of this day had not the approaching separation thrown a gloom over their spirit It was saint Aubert s plan to proceed on the morrow to the borders of the Mediterranean and travel along its shores into Languedoc and Valancourt since he was now nearly recovered and had no longer a pretence for continuing with his new friends resolved to leave them here saint Aubert who was much pleased with him invited him to go further but did not repeat the invitation and Valancourt had resolution enough to forego the temptation of accepting it that he might prove himself not unworthy of the favour On the following morning therefore they were to part saint Aubert to pursue his way to Languedoc and Valancourt to explore new scenes among the mountains on his return home During this evening he was often silent and thoughtful saint Aubert s manner towards him was affectionate though grave and Emily was serious though she made frequent efforts to appear cheerful After one of the most melancholy evenings they had yet passed together they separated for the night CHAPTER VI I care not Fortune what you me deny You cannot rob me of free nature s grace You cannot shut the windows of the sky Through which Aurora shews her brightening face You cannot bar my constant feet to trace The woods and lawns by living stream at eve Let health my nerves and finer fibres brace And I their toys to the great children leave Of fancy reason virtue nought can me bereave THOMSON In the morning Valancourt breakfasted with saint Aubert and Emily neither of whom seemed much refreshed by sleep The languor of illness still hung over saint Aubert and to Emily s fears his disorder appeared to be increasing fast upon him She watched his looks with anxious affection and their expression was always faithfully reflected in her own At the commencement of their acquaintance Valancourt had made known his name and family saint Aubert was not a stranger to either for the family estates which were now in the possession of an elder brother of Valancourt were little more than twenty miles distant from La Vallee and he had sometimes met the elder Valancourt on visits in the neighbourhood This knowledge had made him more willingly receive his present companion for though his countenance and manners would have won him the acquaintance of saint Aubert who was very apt to trust to the intelligence of his own eyes with respect to countenances he would not have accepted these as sufficient introductions to that of his daughter The breakfast was almost as silent as the supper of the preceding night but their musing was at length interrupted by the sound of the carriage wheels which were to bear away saint Aubert and Emily Valancourt started from his chair and went to the window it was indeed the carriage and he returned to his seat without speaking The moment was now come when they must part saint Aubert told Valancourt that he hoped he would never pass La Vallee without favouring him with a visit and Valancourt eagerly thanking him assured him that he never would as he said which he looked timidly at Emily who tried to smile away the seriousness of her spirits They passed a few minutes in interesting conversation and saint Aubert then led the way to the carriage Emily and Valancourt following in silence The latter lingered at the door several minutes after they were seated and none of the party seemed to have courage enough to say Farewell At length saint Aubert pronounced the melancholy word which Emily passed to Valancourt who returned it with a dejected smile and the carriage drove on The travellers remained for some time in a state of tranquil pensiveness which is not unpleasing saint Aubert interrupted it by observing This is a very promising young man it is many years since I have been so much pleased with any person on so short an acquaintance He brings back to my memory the days of my youth when every scene was new and delightful saint Aubert sighed and sunk again into a reverie and as Emily looked back upon the road they had passed Valancourt was seen at the door of the little inn following them with his eyes Her perceived her and waved his hand and she returned the adieu till the winding road shut her from his sight I remember when I was about his age resumed saint Aubert and I thought and felt exactly as he does The world was opening upon me then now it is closing My dear sir do not think so gloomily said Emily in a trembling voice I hope you have many many years to live for your own sake for MY sake Ah my Emily replied saint Aubert for thy sake Well I hope it is so He wiped away a tear that was stealing down his cheek threw a smile upon his countenance and said in a cheering voice there is something in the ardour and ingenuousness of youth which is particularly pleasing to the contemplation of an old man if his feelings have not been entirely corroded by the world It is cheering and reviving like the view of spring to a sick person his mind catches somewhat of the spirit of the season and his eyes are lighted up with a transient sunshine Valancourt is this spring to me Emily who pressed her father s hand affectionately had never before listened with so much pleasure to the praises he bestowed no not even when he had bestowed them on herself They travelled on among vineyards woods and pastures delighted with the romantic beauty of the landscape which was bounded on one side by the grandeur of the Pyrenees and on the other by the ocean and soon after noon they reached the town of Colioure situated on the Mediterranean Here they dined and rested till towards the cool of day when they pursued their way along the shores those enchanting shores which extend to Languedoc Emily gazed with enthusiasm on the vastness of the sea its surface varying as the lights and shadows fell and on its woody banks mellowed with autumnal tints saint Aubert was impatient to reach Perpignan where he expected letters from M Quesnel and it was the expectation of these letters that had induced him to leave Colioure for his feeble frame had required immediate rest After travelling a few miles he fell asleep and Emily who had put two or three books into the carriage on leaving La Vallee had now the leisure for looking into them She sought for one in which Valancourt had been reading the day before and hoped for the pleasure of re tracing a page over which the eyes of a beloved friend had lately passed of dwelling on the passages which he had admired and of permitting them to speak to her in the language of his own mind and to bring himself to her presence On searching for the book she could find it no where but in its stead perceived a volume of Petrarch s poems that had belonged to Valancourt whose name was written in it and from which he had frequently read passages to her with all the pathetic expression that characterized the feelings of the author She hesitated in believing what would have been sufficiently apparent to almost any other person that he had purposely left this book instead of the one she had lost and that love had prompted the exchange but having opened it with impatient pleasure and observed the lines of his pencil drawn along the various passages he had read aloud and under others more descriptive of delicate tenderness than he had dared to trust his voice with the conviction came at length to her mind For some moments she was conscious only of being beloved then a recollection of all the variations of tone and countenance with which he had recited these sonnets and of the soul which spoke in their expression pressed to her memory and she wept over the memorial of his affection They arrived at Perpignan soon after sunset where saint Aubert found as he had expected letters from M Quesnel the contents of which so evidently and grievously affected him that Emily was alarmed and pressed him as far as her delicacy would permit to disclose the occasion of his concern but he answered her only by tears and immediately began to talk on other topics Emily though she forbore to press the one most interesting to her was greatly affected by her father s manner and passed a night of sleepless solicitude In the morning they pursued their journey along the coast towards Leucate another town on the Mediterranean situated on the borders of Languedoc and Rousillon On the way Emily renewed the subject of the preceding night and appeared so deeply affected by saint Aubert s silence and dejection that he relaxed from his reserve I was unwilling my dear Emily said he to throw a cloud over the pleasure you receive from these scenes and meant therefore to conceal for the present some circumstances with which however you must at length have been made acquainted But your anxiety has defeated my purpose you suffer as much from this perhaps as you will do from a knowledge of the facts I have to relate M Quesnel s visit proved an unhappy one to me he came to tell me part of the news he has now confirmed You may have heard me mention a M Motteville of Paris but you did not know that the chief of my personal property was invested in his hands I had great confidence in him and I am yet willing to believe that he is not wholly unworthy of my esteem A variety of circumstances have concurred to ruin him and I am ruined with him saint Aubert paused to conceal his emotion The letters I have just received from M Quesnel resumed he struggling to speak with firmness enclosed others from Motteville which confirmed all I dreaded Must we then quit La Vallee said Emily after a long pause of silence That is yet uncertain replied saint Aubert it will depend upon the compromise Motteville is able to make with his creditors My income you know was never large and now it will be reduced to little indeed It is for you Emily for you my child that I am most afflicted His last words faltered Emily smiled tenderly upon him through her tears and then endeavouring to overcome her emotion My dear father said she do not grieve for me or for yourself we may yet be happy if La Vallee remains for us we must be happy We will retain only one servant and you shall scarcely perceive the change in your income Be comforted my dear sir we shall not feel the want of those luxuries which others value so highly since we never had a taste for them and poverty cannot deprive us of many consolations It cannot rob us of the affection we have for each other or degrade us in our own opinion or in that of any person whose opinion we ought to value saint Aubert concealed his face with his handkerchief and was unable to speak but Emily continued to urge to her father the truths which himself had impressed upon her mind Besides my dear sir poverty cannot deprive us of intellectual delights It cannot deprive you of the comfort of affording me examples of fortitude and benevolence nor me of the delight of consoling a beloved parent It cannot deaden our taste for the grand and the beautiful or deny us the means of indulging it for the scenes of nature those sublime spectacles so infinitely superior to all artificial luxuries are open for the enjoyment of the poor as well as of the rich Of what then have we to complain so long as we are not in want of necessaries Pleasures such as wealth cannot buy will still be ours We retain then the sublime luxuries of nature and lose only the frivolous ones of art saint Aubert could not reply he caught Emily to his bosom their tears flowed together but they were not tears of sorrow After this language of the heart all other would have been feeble and they remained silent for some time Then saint Aubert conversed as before for if his mind had not recovered its natural tranquillity it at least assumed the appearance of it They reached the romantic town of Leucate early in the day but saint Aubert was weary and they determined to pass the night there In the evening he exerted himself so far as to walk with his daughter to view the environs that overlook the lake of Leucate the Mediterranean part of Rousillon with the Pyrenees and a wide extent of the luxuriant province of Languedoc now blushing with the ripened vintage which the peasants were beginning to gather saint Aubert and Emily saw the busy groups caught the joyous song that was wafted on the breeze and anticipated with apparent pleasure their next day s journey over this gay region He designed however still to wind along the sea shore To return home immediately was partly his wish but from this he was withheld by a desire to lengthen the pleasure which the journey gave his daughter and to try the effect of the sea air on his own disorder On the following day therefore they recommenced their journey through Languedoc winding the shores of the Mediterranean the Pyrenees still forming the magnificent back ground of their prospects while on their right was the ocean and on their left wide extended plains melting into the blue horizon saint Aubert was pleased and conversed much with Emily yet his cheerfulness was sometimes artificial and sometimes a shade of melancholy would steal upon his countenance and betray him This was soon chased away by Emily s smile who smiled however with an aching heart for she saw that his misfortunes preyed upon his mind and upon his enfeebled frame It was evening when they reached a small village of Upper Languedoc where they meant to pass the night but the place could not afford them beds for here too it was the time of the vintage and they were obliged to proceed to the next post The languor of illness and of fatigue which returned upon saint Aubert required immediate repose and the evening was now far advanced but from necessity there was no appeal and he ordered Michael to proceed The rich plains of Languedoc which exhibited all the glories of the vintage with the gaieties of a French festival no longer awakened saint Aubert to pleasure whose condition formed a mournful contrast to the hilarity and youthful beauty which surrounded him As his languid eyes moved over the scene he considered that they would soon perhaps be closed for ever on this world Those distant and sublime mountains said he secretly as he gazed on a chain of the Pyrenees that stretched towards the west these luxuriant plains this blue vault the cheerful light of day will be shut from my eyes The song of the peasant the cheering voice of man will no longer sound for me The intelligent eyes of Emily seemed to read what passed in the mind of her father and she fixed them on his face with an expression of such tender pity as recalled his thoughts from every desultory object of regret and he remembered only that he must leave his daughter without protection This reflection changed regret to agony he sighed deeply and remained silent while she seemed to understand that sigh for she pressed his hand affectionately and then turned to the window to conceal her tears The sun now threw a last yellow gleam on the waves of the Mediterranean and the gloom of twilight spread fast over the scene till only a melancholy ray appeared on the western horizon marking the point where the sun had set amid the vapours of an autumnal evening A cool breeze now came from the shore and Emily let down the glass but the air which was refreshing to health was as chilling to sickness and saint Aubert desired that the window might be drawn up Increasing illness made him now more anxious than ever to finish the day s journey and he stopped the muleteer to enquire how far they had yet to go to the next post He replied Nine miles I feel I am unable to proceed much further said saint Aubert enquire as you go if there is any house on the road that would accommodate us for the night He sunk back in the carriage and Michael cracking his whip in the air set off and continued on the full gallop till saint Aubert almost fainting called to him to stop Emily looked anxiously from the window and saw a peasant walking at some little distance on the road for whom they waited till he came up when he was asked if there was any house in the neighbourhood that accommodated travellers He replied that he knew of none There is a chateau indeed among those woods on the right added he but I believe it receives nobody and I cannot show you the way for I am almost a stranger here saint Aubert was going to ask him some further question concerning the chateau but the man abruptly passed on After some consideration he ordered Michael to proceed slowly to the woods Every moment now deepened the twilight and increased the difficulty of finding the road Another peasant soon after passed Which is the way to the chateau in the woods cried Michael The chateau in the woods exclaimed the peasant Do you mean that with the turret yonder I don t know as for the turret as you call it said Michael I mean that white piece of a building that we see at a distance there among the trees Yes that is the turret why who are you that you are going thither said the man with surprise saint Aubert on hearing this odd question and observing the peculiar tone in which it was delivered looked out from the carriage We are travellers said he who are in search of a house of accommodation for the night is there any hereabout None Monsieur unless you have a mind to try your luck yonder replied the peasant pointing to the woods but I would not advise you to go there To whom does the chateau belong I scarcely know myself Monsieur It is uninhabited then No not uninhabited the steward and housekeeper are there I believe On hearing this saint Aubert determined to proceed to the chateau and risque the refusal of being accommodated for the night he therefore desired the countryman would shew Michael the way and bade him expect reward for his trouble The man was for a moment silent and then said that he was going on other business but that the road could not be missed if they went up an avenue to the right to which he pointed saint Aubert was going to speak but the peasant wished him good night and walked on The carriage now moved towards the avenue which was guarded by a gate and Michael having dismounted to open it they entered between rows of ancient oak and chesnut whose intermingled branches formed a lofty arch above There was something so gloomy and desolate in the appearance of this avenue and its lonely silence that Emily almost shuddered as she passed along and recollecting the manner in which the peasant had mentioned the chateau she gave a mysterious meaning to his words such as she had not suspected when he uttered them These apprehensions however she tried to check considering that they were probably the effect of a melancholy imagination which her father s situation and a consideration of her own circumstances had made sensible to every impression They passed slowly on for they were now almost in darkness which together with the unevenness of the ground and the frequent roots of old trees that shot up above the soil made it necessary to proceed with caution On a sudden Michael stopped the carriage and as saint Aubert looked from the window to enquire the cause he perceived a figure at some distance moving up the avenue The dusk would not permit him to distinguish what it was but he bade Michael go on This seems a wild place said Michael there is no house hereabout don t your honour think we had better turn back Go a little farther and if we see no house then we will return to the road replied saint Aubert Michael proceeded with reluctance and the extreme slowness of his pace made saint Aubert look again from the window to hasten him when again he saw the same figure He was somewhat startled probably the gloominess of the spot made him more liable to alarm than usual however this might be he now stopped Michael and bade him call to the person in the avenue Please your honour he may be a robber said Michael It does not please me replied saint Aubert who could not forbear smiling at the simplicity of his phrase and we will therefore return to the road for I see no probability of meeting here with what we seek Michael turned about immediately and was retracing his way with alacrity when a voice was heard from among the trees on the left It was not the voice of command or distress but a deep hollow tone which seemed to be scarcely human The man whipped his mules till they went as fast as possible regardless of the darkness the broken ground and the necks of the whole party nor once stopped till he reached the gate which opened from the avenue into the high road where he went into a more moderate pace I am very ill said saint Aubert taking his daughter s hand You are worse then sir said Emily extremely alarmed by his manner you are worse and here is no assistance Good God what is to be done He leaned his head on her shoulder while she endeavoured to support him with her arm and Michael was again ordered to stop When the rattling of the wheels had ceased music was heard on their air it was to Emily the voice of Hope Oh we are near some human habitation said she help may soon be had She listened anxiously the sounds were distant and seemed to come from a remote part of the woods that bordered the road and as she looked towards the spot whence they issued she perceived in the faint moon light something like a chateau It was difficult however to reach this saint Aubert was now too ill to bear the motion of the carriage Michael could not quit his mules and Emily who still supported her father feared to leave him and also feared to venture alone to such a distance she knew not whither or to whom Something however it was necessary to determine upon immediately saint Aubert therefore told Michael to proceed slowly but they had not gone far when he fainted and the carriage was again stopped He lay quite senseless My dear dear father cried Emily in great agony who began to fear that he was dying speak if it is only one word to let me hear the sound of your voice But no voice spoke in reply In the agony of terror she bade Michael bring water from the rivulet that flowed along the road and having received some in the man s hat with trembling hands she sprinkled it over her father s face which as the moon s rays now fell upon it seemed to bear the impression of death Every emotion of selfish fear now gave way to a stronger influence and committing saint Aubert to the care of Michael who refused to go far from his mules she stepped from the carriage in search of the chateau she had seen at a distance It was a still moon light night and the music which yet sounded on the air directed her steps from the high road up a shadowy lane that led to the woods Her mind was for some time so entirely occupied by anxiety and terror for her father that she felt none for herself till the deepening gloom of the overhanging foliage which now wholly excluded the moon light and the wildness of the place recalled her to a sense of her adventurous situation The music had ceased and she had no guide but chance For a moment she paused in terrified perplexity till a sense of her father s condition again overcoming every consideration for herself she proceeded The lane terminated in the woods but she looked round in vain for a house or a human being and as vainly listened for a sound to guide her She hurried on however not knowing whither avoiding the recesses of the woods and endeavouring to keep along their margin till a rude kind of avenue which opened upon a moon light spot arrested her attention The wildness of this avenue brought to her recollection the one leading to the turreted chateau and she was inclined to believe that this was a part of the same domain and probably led to the same point While she hesitated whether to follow it or not a sound of many voices in loud merriment burst upon her ear It seemed not the laugh of cheerfulness but of riot and she stood appalled While she paused she heard a distant voice calling from the way she had come and not doubting but it was that of Michael her first impulse was to hasten back but a second thought changed her purpose she believed that nothing less than the last extremity could have prevailed with Michael to quit his mules and fearing that her father was now dying she rushed forward with a feeble hope of obtaining assistance from the people in the woods Her heart beat with fearful expectation as she drew near the spot whence the voices issued and she often startled when her steps disturbed the fallen leaves The sounds led her towards the moon light glade she had before noticed at a little distance from which she stopped and saw between the boles of the trees a small circular level of green turf surrounded by the woods on which appeared a group of figures On drawing nearer she distinguished these by their dress to be peasants and perceived several cottages scattered round the edge of the woods which waved loftily over this spot While she gazed and endeavoured to overcome the apprehensions that withheld her steps several peasant girls came out of a cottage music instantly struck up and the dance began It was the joyous music of the vintage the same she had before heard upon the air Her heart occupied with terror for her father could not feel the contrast which this gay scene offered to her own distress she stepped hastily forward towards a group of elder peasants who were seated at the door of a cottage and having explained her situation entreated their assistance Several of them rose with alacrity and offering any service in their power followed Emily who seemed to move on the wind as fast as they could towards the road When she reached the carriage she found saint Aubert restored to animation On the recovery of his senses having heard from Michael whither his daughter was gone anxiety for her overcame every regard for himself and he had sent him in search of her He was however still languid and perceiving himself unable to travel much farther he renewed his enquiries for an inn and concerning the chateau in the woods The chateau cannot accommodate you sir said a venerable peasant who had followed Emily from the woods it is scarcely inhabited but if you will do me the honour to visit my cottage you shall be welcome to the best bed it affords saint Aubert was himself a Frenchman he therefore was not surprised at French courtesy but ill as he was he felt the value of the offer enhanced by the manner which accompanied it He had too much delicacy to apologize or to appear to hesitate about availing himself of the peasant s hospitality but immediately accepted it with the same frankness with which it was offered The carriage again moved slowly on Michael following the peasants up the lane which Emily had just quitted till they came to the moon light glade saint Aubert s spirits were so far restored by the courtesy of his host and the near prospect of repose that he looked with a sweet complacency upon the moon light scene surrounded by the shadowy woods through which here and there an opening admitted the streaming splendour discovering a cottage or a sparkling rivulet He listened with no painful emotion to the merry notes of the guitar and tamborine and though tears came to his eyes when he saw the debonnaire dance of the peasants they were not merely tears of mournful regret With Emily it was otherwise immediate terror for her father had now subsided into a gentle melancholy which every note of joy by awakening comparison served to heighten The dance ceased on the approach of the carriage which was a phenomenon in these sequestered woods and the peasantry flocked round it with eager curiosity On learning that it brought a sick stranger several girls ran across the turf and returned with wine and baskets of grapes which they presented to the travellers each with kind contention pressing for a preference At length the carriage stopped at a neat cottage and his venerable conductor having assisted saint Aubert to alight led him and Emily to a small inner room illuminated only by moon beams which the open casement admitted saint Aubert rejoicing in rest seated himself in an arm chair and his senses were refreshed by the cool and balmy air that lightly waved the embowering honeysuckles and wafted their sweet breath into the apartment His host who was called La Voisin quitted the room but soon returned with fruits cream and all the pastoral luxury his cottage afforded having set down which with a smile of unfeigned welcome he retired behind the chair of his guest saint Aubert insisted on his taking a seat at the table and when the fruit had allayed the fever of his palate and he found himself somewhat revived he began to converse with his host who communicated several particulars concerning himself and his family which were interesting because they were spoken from the heart and delineated a picture of the sweet courtesies of family kindness Emily sat by her father holding his hand and while she listened to the old man her heart swelled with the affectionate sympathy he described and her tears fell to the mournful consideration that death would probably soon deprive her of the dearest blessing she then possessed The soft moon light of an autumnal evening and the distant music which now sounded a plaintive strain aided the melancholy of her mind The old man continued to talk of his family and saint Aubert remained silent I have only one daughter living said La Voisin but she is happily married and is every thing to me When I lost my wife he added with a sigh I came to live with Agnes and her family she has several children who are all dancing on the green yonder as merry as grasshoppers and long may they be so I hope to die among them monsieur I am old now and cannot expect to live long but there is some comfort in dying surrounded by one s children My good friend said saint Aubert while his voice trembled I hope you will long live surrounded by them Ah sir at my age I must not expect that replied the old man and he paused I can scarcely wish it he resumed for I trust that whenever I die I shall go to heaven where my poor wife is gone before me I can sometimes almost fancy I see her of a still moon light night walking among these shades she loved so well Do you believe monsieur that we shall be permitted to revisit the earth after we have quitted the body Emily could no longer stifle the anguish of her heart her tears fell fast upon her father s hand which she yet held He made an effort to speak and at length said in a low voice I hope we shall be permitted to look down on those we have left on the earth but I can only hope it Futurity is much veiled from our eyes and faith and hope are our only guides concerning it We are not enjoined to believe that disembodied spirits watch over the friends they have loved but we may innocently hope it It is a hope which I will never resign continued he while he wiped the tears from his daughter s eyes it will sweeten the bitter moments of death Tears fell slowly on his cheeks La Voisin wept too and there was a pause of silence Then La Voisin renewing the subject said But you believe sir that we shall meet in another world the relations we have loved in this I must believe this Then do believe it replied saint Aubert severe indeed would be the pangs of separation if we believed it to be eternal Look up my dear Emily we shall meet again He lifted his eyes towards heaven and a gleam of moon light which fell upon his countenance discovered peace and resignation stealing on the lines of sorrow La Voisin felt that he had pursued the subject too far and he dropped it saying We are in darkness I forgot to bring a light No said saint Aubert this is a light I love Sit down my good friend Emily my love I find myself better than I have been all day this air refreshes me I can enjoy this tranquil hour and that music which floats so sweetly at a distance Let me see you smile Who touches that guitar so tastefully are there two instruments or is it an echo I hear It is an echo monsieur I fancy That guitar is often heard at night when all is still but nobody knows who touches it and it is sometimes accompanied by a voice so sweet and so sad one would almost think the woods were haunted They certainly are haunted said saint Aubert with a smile but I believe it is by mortals I have sometimes heard it at midnight when I could not sleep rejoined La Voisin not seeming to notice this remark almost under my window and I never heard any music like it It has often made me think of my poor wife till I cried I have sometimes got up to the window to look if I could see anybody but as soon as I opened the casement all was hushed and nobody to be seen and I have listened and listened till I have been so timorous that even the trembling of the leaves in the breeze has made me start They say it often comes to warn people of their death but I have heard it these many years and outlived the warning Emily though she smiled at the mention of this ridiculous superstition could not in the present tone of her spirits wholly resist its contagion Well but my good friend said saint Aubert has nobody had courage to follow the sounds If they had they would probably have discovered who is the musician Yes sir they have followed them some way into the woods but the music has still retreated and seemed as distant as ever and the people have at last been afraid of being led into harm and would go no further It is very seldom that I have heard these sounds so early in the evening They usually come about midnight when that bright planet which is rising above the turret yonder sets below the woods on the left What turret asked saint Aubert with quickness I see none Your pardon monsieur you do see one indeed for the moon shines full upon it up the avenue yonder a long way off the chateau it belongs to is hid among the trees Yes my dear sir said Emily pointing don t you see something glitter above the dark woods It is a fane I fancy which the rays fall upon O yes I see what you mean and who does the chateau belong to The Marquis de Villeroi was its owner replied La Voisin emphatically Ah said saint Aubert with a deep sigh are we then so near Le Blanc He appeared much agitated It used to be the Marquis s favourite residence resumed La Voisin but he took a dislike to the place and has not been there for many years We have heard lately that he is dead and that it is fallen into other hands saint Aubert who had sat in deep musing was roused by the last words Dead he exclaimed Good God when did he die He is reported to have died about five weeks since replied La Voisin Did you know the Marquis sir This is very extraordinary said saint Aubert without attending to the question Why is it so my dear sir said Emily in a voice of timid curiosity He made no reply but sunk again into a reverie and in a few moments when he seemed to have recovered himself asked who had succeeded to the estates I have forgot his title monsieur said La Voisin but my lord resides at Paris chiefly I hear no talk of his coming hither The chateau is shut up then still Why little better sir the old housekeeper and her husband the steward have the care of it but they live generally in a cottage hard by The chateau is spacious I suppose said Emily and must be desolate for the residence of only two persons Desolate enough mademoiselle replied La Voisin I would not pass one night in the chateau for the value of the whole domain What is that said saint Aubert roused again from thoughtfulness As his host repeated his last sentence a groan escaped from saint Aubert and then as if anxious to prevent it from being noticed he hastily asked La Voisin how long he had lived in this neighbourhood Almost from my childhood sir replied his host You remember the late marchioness then said saint Aubert in an altered voice Ah monsieur that I do well There are many besides me who remember her Yes said saint Aubert and I am one of those Alas sir you remember then a most beautiful and excellent lady She deserved a better fate Tears stood in saint Aubert s eyes Enough said he in a voice almost stifled by the violence of his emotions it is enough my friend Emily though extremely surprised by her father s manner forbore to express her feelings by any question La Voisin began to apologize but saint Aubert interrupted him Apology is quite unnecessary said he let us change the topic You was speaking of the music we just now heard I was monsieur but hark it comes again listen to that voice They were all silent At last a soft and solemn breathing sound Rose like a stream of rich distilled perfumes And stole upon the air that even Silence Was took ere she was ware and wished she might Deny her nature and be never more Still to be so displaced Milton In a few moments the voice died into air and the instrument which had been heard before sounded in low symphony saint Aubert now observed that it produced a tone much more full and melodious than that of a guitar and still more melancholy and soft than the lute They continued to listen but the sounds returned no more This is strange said saint Aubert at length interrupting the silence Very strange said Emily It is so rejoined La Voisin and they were again silent After a long pause It is now about eighteen years since I first heard that music said La Voisin I remember it was on a fine summer s night much like this but later that I was walking in the woods and alone I remember too that my spirits were very low for one of my boys was ill and we feared we should lose him I had been watching at his bed side all the evening while his mother slept for she had sat up with him the night before I had been watching and went out for a little fresh air the day had been very sultry As I walked under the shades and mused I heard music at a distance and thought it was Claude playing upon his flute as he often did of a fine evening at the cottage door But when I came to a place where the trees opened I shall never forget it and stood looking up at the north lights which shot up the heaven to a great height I heard all of a sudden such sounds they came so as I cannot describe It was like the music of angels and I looked up again almost expecting to see them in the sky When I came home I told what I had heard but they laughed at me and said it must be some of the shepherds playing on their pipes and I could not persuade them to the contrary A few nights after however my wife herself heard the same sounds and was as much surprised as I was and Father Denis frightened her sadly by saying that it was music come to warn her of her child s death and that music often came to houses where there was a dying person Emily on hearing this shrunk with a superstitious dread entirely new to her and could scarcely conceal her agitation from saint Aubert But the boy lived monsieur in spite of Father Denis Father Denis said saint Aubert who had listened to narrative old age with patient attention are we near a convent then Yes sir the convent of saint Clair stands at no great distance on the sea shore yonder Ah said saint Aubert as if struck with some sudden remembrance the convent of saint Clair Emily observed the clouds of grief mingled with a faint expression of horror gathering on his brow his countenance became fixed and touched as it now was by the silver whiteness of the moon light he resembled one of those marble statues of a monument which seem to bend in hopeless sorrow over the ashes of the dead shewn by the blunted light That the dim moon through painted casements lends The Emigrants But my dear sir said Emily anxious to dissipate his thoughts you forget that repose is necessary to you If our kind host will give me leave I will prepare your bed for I know how you like it to be made saint Aubert recollecting himself and smiling affectionately desired she would not add to her fatigue by that attention and La Voisin whose consideration for his guest had been suspended by the interests which his own narrative had recalled now started from his seat and apologizing for not having called Agnes from the green hurried out of the room In a few moments he returned with his daughter a young woman of pleasing countenance and Emily learned from her what she had not before suspected that for their accommodation it was necessary part of La Voisin s family should leave their beds she lamented this circumstance but Agnes by her reply fully proved that she inherited at least a share of her father s courteous hospitality It was settled that some of her children and Michael should sleep in the neighbouring cottage If I am better to morrow my dear said saint Aubert when Emily returned to him I mean to set out at an early hour that we may rest during the heat of the day and will travel towards home In the present state of my health and spirits I cannot look on a longer journey with pleasure and I am also very anxious to reach La Vallee Emily though she also desired to return was grieved at her father s sudden wish to do so which she thought indicated a greater degree of indisposition than he would acknowledge saint Aubert now retired to rest and Emily to her little chamber but not to immediate repose Her thoughts returned to the late conversation concerning the state of departed spirits a subject at this time particularly affecting to her when she had every reason to believe that her dear father would ere long be numbered with them She leaned pensively on the little open casement and in deep thought fixed her eyes on the heaven whose blue unclouded concave was studded thick with stars the worlds perhaps of spirits unsphered of mortal mould As her eyes wandered along the boundless aether her thoughts rose as before towards the sublimity of the Deity and to the contemplation of futurity No busy note of this world interrupted the course of her mind the merry dance had ceased and every cottager had retired to his home The still air seemed scarcely to breathe upon the woods and now and then the distant sound of a solitary sheep bell or of a closing casement was all that broke on silence At length even this hint of human being was heard no more Elevated and enwrapt while her eyes were often wet with tears of sublime devotion and solemn awe she continued at the casement till the gloom of mid night hung over the earth and the planet which La Voisin had pointed out sunk below the woods She then recollected what he had said concerning this planet and the mysterious music and as she lingered at the window half hoping and half fearing that it would return her mind was led to the remembrance of the extreme emotion her father had shewn on mention of the Marquis La Villeroi s death and of the fate of the Marchioness and she felt strongly interested concerning the remote cause of this emotion Her surprise and curiosity were indeed the greater because she did not recollect ever to have heard him mention the name of Villeroi No music however stole on the silence of the night and Emily perceiving the lateness of the hour returned to a scene of fatigue remembered that she was to rise early in the morning and withdrew from the window to repose CHAPTER VII Let those deplore their doom Whose hope still grovels in this dark sojourn But lofty souls can look beyond the tomb Can smile at fate and wonder how they mourn Shall Spring to these sad scenes no more return Is yonder wave the sun s eternal bed Soon shall the orient with new lustre burn And Spring shall soon her vital influence shed Again attune the grove again adorn the mead BEATTIE Emily called as she had requested at an early hour awoke little refreshed by sleep for uneasy dreams had pursued her and marred the kindest blessing of the unhappy But when she opened her casement looked out upon the woods bright with the morning sun and inspired the pure air her mind was soothed The scene was filled with that cheering freshness which seems to breathe the very spirit of health and she heard only sweet and PICTURESQUE sounds if such an expression may be allowed the matin bell of a distant convent the faint murmur of the sea waves the song of birds and the far off low of cattle which she saw coming slowly on between the trunks of trees Struck with the circumstances of imagery around her she indulged the pensive tranquillity which they inspired and while she leaned on her window waiting till saint Aubert should descend to breakfast her ideas arranged themselves in the following lines THE FIRST HOUR OF MORNING How sweet to wind the forest s tangled shade When early twilight from the eastern bound Dawns on the sleeping landscape in the glade And fades as morning spreads her blush around When ev ry infant flower that wept in night Lifts its chill head soft glowing with a tear Expands its tender blossom to the light And gives its incense to the genial air How fresh the breeze that wafts the rich perfume And swells the melody of waking birds The hum of bees beneath the verdant gloom And woodman s song and low of distant herds Then doubtful gleams the mountain s hoary head Seen through the parting foliage from afar And farther still the ocean s misty bed With flitting sails that partial sun beams share But vain the sylvan shade the breath of May The voice of music floating on the gale And forms that beam through morning s dewy veil If health no longer bid the heart be gay O balmy hour tis thine her wealth to give Here spread her blush and bid the parent live Emily now heard persons moving below in the cottage and presently the voice of Michael who was talking to his mules as he led them forth from a hut adjoining As she left her room saint Aubert who was now risen met her at the door apparently as little restored by sleep as herself She led him down stairs to the little parlour in which they had supped on the preceding night where they found a neat breakfast set out while the host and his daughter waited to bid them good morrow I envy you this cottage my good friends said saint Aubert as he met them it is so pleasant so quiet and so neat and this air that one breathes if any thing could restore lost health it would surely be this air La Voisin bowed gratefully and replied with the gallantry of a Frenchman Our cottage may be envied sir since you and Mademoiselle have honoured it with your presence saint Aubert gave him a friendly smile for his compliment and sat down to a table spread with cream fruit new cheese butter and coffee Emily who had observed her father with attention and thought he looked very ill endeavoured to persuade him to defer travelling till the afternoon but he seemed very anxious to be at home and his anxiety he expressed repeatedly and with an earnestness that was unusual with him He now said he found himself as well as he had been of late and that he could bear travelling better in the cool hour of the morning than at any other time But while he was talking with his venerable host and thanking him for his kind attentions Emily observed his countenance change and before she could reach him he fell back in his chair In a few moments he recovered from the sudden faintness that had come over him but felt so ill that he perceived himself unable to set out and having remained a little while struggling against the pressure of indisposition he begged he might be helped up stairs to bed This request renewed all the terror which Emily had suffered on the preceding evening but though scarcely able to support herself under the sudden shock it gave her she tried to conceal her apprehensions from saint Aubert and gave her trembling arm to assist him to the door of his chamber When he was once more in bed he desired that Emily who was then weeping in her own room might be called and as she came he waved his hand for every other person to quit the apartment When they were alone he held out his hand to her and fixed his eyes upon her countenance with an expression so full of tenderness and grief that all her fortitude forsook her and she burst into an agony of tears saint Aubert seemed struggling to acquire firmness but was still unable to speak he could only press her hand and check the tears that stood trembling in his eyes At length he commanded his voice My dear child said he trying to smile through his anguish my dear Emily and paused again He raised his eyes to heaven as if in prayer and then in a firmer tone and with a look in which the tenderness of the father was dignified by the pious solemnity of the saint he said My dear child I would soften the painful truth I have to tell you but I find myself quite unequal to the art Alas I would at this moment conceal it from you but that it would be most cruel to deceive you It cannot be long before we must part let us talk of it that our thoughts and our prayers may prepare us to bear it His voice faltered while Emily still weeping pressed his hand close to her heart which swelled with a convulsive sigh but she could not look up Let me not waste these moments said saint Aubert recovering himself I have much to say There is a circumstance of solemn consequence which I have to mention and a solemn promise to obtain from you when this is done I shall be easier You have observed my dear how anxious I am to reach home but know not all my reasons for this Listen to what I am going to say Yet stay before I say more give me this promise a promise made to your dying father saint Aubert was interrupted Emily struck by his last words as if for the first time with a conviction of his immediate danger raised her head her tears stopped and gazing at him for a moment with an expression of unutterable anguish a slight convulsion seized her and she sunk senseless in her chair saint Aubert s cries brought La Voisin and his daughter to the room and they administered every means in their power to restore her but for a considerable time without effect When she recovered saint Aubert was so exhausted by the scene he had witnessed that it was many minutes before he had strength to speak he was however somewhat revived by a cordial which Emily gave him and being again alone with her he exerted himself to tranquilize her spirits and to offer her all the comfort of which her situation admitted She threw herself into his arms wept on his neck and grief made her so insensible to all he said that he ceased to offer the alleviations which he himself could not at this moment feel and mingled his silent tears with hers Recalled at length to a sense of duty she tried to spare her father from a farther view of her suffering and quitting his embrace dried her tears and said something which she meant for consolation My dear Emily replied saint Aubert my dear child we must look up with humble confidence to that Being who has protected and comforted us in every danger and in every affliction we have known to whose eye every moment of our lives has been exposed he will not he does not forsake us now I feel his consolations in my heart I shall leave you my child still in his care and though I depart from this world I shall be still in his presence Nay weep not again my Emily In death there is nothing new or surprising since we all know that we are born to die and nothing terrible to those who can confide in an all powerful God Had my life been spared now after a very few years in the course of nature I must have resigned it old age with all its train of infirmity its privations and its sorrows would have been mine and then at last death would have come and called forth the tears you now shed Rather my child rejoice that I am saved from such suffering and that I am permitted to die with a mind unimpaired and sensible of the comforts of faith and resignation saint Aubert paused fatigued with speaking Emily again endeavoured to assume an air of composure and in replying to what he had said tried to sooth him with a belief that he had not spoken in vain When he had reposed a while he resumed the conversation Let me return said he to a subject which is very near my heart I said I had a solemn promise to receive from you let me receive it now before I explain the chief circumstance which it concerns there are others of which your peace requires that you should rest in ignorance Promise then that you will perform exactly what I shall enjoin Emily awed by the earnest solemnity of his manner dried her tears that had begun again to flow in spite of her efforts to suppress them and looking eloquently at saint Aubert bound herself to do whatever he should require by a vow at which she shuddered yet knew not why He proceeded I know you too well my Emily to believe that you would break any promise much less one thus solemnly given your assurance gives me peace and the observance of it is of the utmost importance to your tranquillity Hear then what I am going to tell you The closet which adjoins my chamber at La Vallee has a sliding board in the floor You will know it by a remarkable knot in the wood and by its being the next board except one to the wainscot which fronts the door At the distance of about a yard from that end nearer the window you will perceive a line across it as if the plank had been joined the way to open it is this Press your foot upon the line the end of the board will then sink and you may slide it with ease beneath the other Below you will see a hollow place saint Aubert paused for breath and Emily sat fixed in deep attention Do you understand these directions my dear said he Emily though scarcely able to speak assured him that she did When you return home then he added with a deep sigh At the mention of her return home all the melancholy circumstances that must attend this return rushed upon her fancy she burst into convulsive grief and saint Aubert himself affected beyond the resistance of the fortitude which he had at first summoned wept with her After some moments he composed himself My dear child said he be comforted When I am gone you will not be forsaken I leave you only in the more immediate care of that Providence which has never yet forsaken me Do not afflict me with this excess of grief rather teach me by your example to bear my own He stopped again and Emily the more she endeavoured to restrain her emotion found it the less possible to do so saint Aubert who now spoke with pain resumed the subject That closet my dear when you return home go to it and beneath the board I have described you will find a packet of written papers Attend to me now for the promise you have given particularly relates to what I shall direct These papers you must burn and solemnly I command you WITHOUT EXAMINING THEM Emily s surprise for a moment overcame her grief and she ventured to ask why this must be saint Aubert replied that if it had been right for him to explain his reasons her late promise would have been unnecessarily exacted It is sufficient for you my love to have a deep sense of the importance of observing me in this instance saint Aubert proceeded Under that board you will also find about two hundred louis d ors wrapped in a silk purse indeed it was to secure whatever money might be in the chateau that this secret place was contrived at a time when the province was over run by troops of men who took advantage of the tumults and became plunderers But I have yet another promise to receive from you which is that you will never whatever may be your future circumstances SELL the chateau saint Aubert even enjoined her whenever she might marry to make it an article in the contract that the chateau should always be hers He then gave her a more minute account of his present circumstances than he had yet done adding The two hundred louis with what money you will now find in my purse is all the ready money I have to leave you I have told you how I am circumstanced with M Motteville at Paris Ah my child I leave you poor but not destitute he added after a long pause Emily could make no reply to any thing he now said but knelt at the bed side with her face upon the quilt weeping over the hand she held there After this conversation the mind of saint Aubert appeared to be much more at ease but exhausted by the effort of speaking he sunk into a kind of doze and Emily continued to watch and weep beside him till a gentle tap at the chamber door roused her It was La Voisin come to say that a confessor from the neighbouring convent was below ready to attend saint Aubert Emily would not suffer her father to be disturbed but desired that the priest might not leave the cottage When saint Aubert awoke from this doze his senses were confused and it was some moments before he recovered them sufficiently to know that it was Emily who sat beside him He then moved his lips and stretched forth his hand to her as she received which she sunk back in her chair overcome by the impression of death on his countenance In a few minutes he recovered his voice and Emily then asked if he wished to see the confessor he replied that he did and when the holy father appeared she withdrew They remained alone together above half an hour when Emily was called in she found saint Aubert more agitated than when she had left him and she gazed with a slight degree of resentment at the friar as the cause of this who however looked mildly and mournfully at her and turned away saint Aubert in a tremulous voice said he wished her to join in prayer with him and asked if La Voisin would do so too The old man and his daughter came they both wept and knelt with Emily round the bed while the holy father read in a solemn voice the service for the dying saint Aubert lay with a serene countenance and seemed to join fervently in the devotion while tears often stole from beneath his closed eyelids and Emily s sobs more than once interrupted the service When it was concluded and extreme unction had been administered the friar withdrew saint Aubert then made a sign for La Voisin to come nearer He gave him his hand and was for a moment silent At length he said in a trembling voice My good friend our acquaintance has been short but long enough to give you an opportunity of shewing me much kind attention I cannot doubt that you will extend this kindness to my daughter when I am gone she will have need of it I entrust her to your care during the few days she will remain here I need say no more you know the feelings of a father for you have children mine would be indeed severe if I had less confidence in you He paused La Voisin assured him and his tears bore testimony to his sincerity that he would do all he could to soften her affliction and that if saint Aubert wished it he would even attend her into Gascony an offer so pleasing to saint Aubert that he had scarcely words to acknowledge his sense of the old man s kindness or to tell him that he accepted it The scene that followed between saint Aubert and Emily affected La Voisin so much that he quitted the chamber and she was again left alone with her father whose spirits seemed fainting fast but neither his senses or his voice yet failed him and at intervals he employed much of these last awful moments in advising his daughter as to her future conduct Perhaps he never had thought more justly or expressed himself more clearly than he did now Above all my dear Emily said he do not indulge in the pride of fine feeling the romantic error of amiable minds Those who really possess sensibility ought early to be taught that it is a dangerous quality which is continually extracting the excess of misery or delight from every surrounding circumstance And since in our passage through this world painful circumstances occur more frequently than pleasing ones and since our sense of evil is I fear more acute than our sense of good we become the victims of our feelings unless we can in some degree command them I know you will say for you are young my Emily I know you will say that you are contented sometimes to suffer rather than to give up your refined sense of happiness at others but when your mind has been long harassed by vicissitude you will be content to rest and you will then recover from your delusion You will perceive that the phantom of happiness is exchanged for the substance for happiness arises in a state of peace not of tumult It is of a temperate and uniform nature and can no more exist in a heart that is continually alive to minute circumstances than in one that is dead to feeling You see my dear that though I would guard you against the dangers of sensibility I am not an advocate for apathy At your age I should have said THAT is a vice more hateful than all the errors of sensibility and I say so still I call it a VICE because it leads to positive evil in this however it does no more than an ill governed sensibility which by such a rule might also be called a vice but the evil of the former is of more general consequence I have exhausted myself said saint Aubert feebly and have wearied you my Emily but on a subject so important to your future comfort I am anxious to be perfectly understood Emily assured him that his advice was most precious to her and that she would never forget it or cease from endeavouring to profit by it saint Aubert smiled affectionately and sorrowfully upon her I repeat it said he I would not teach you to become insensible if I could I would only warn you of the evils of susceptibility and point out how you may avoid them Beware my love I conjure you of that self delusion which has been fatal to the peace of so many persons beware of priding yourself on the gracefulness of sensibility if you yield to this vanity your happiness is lost for ever Always remember how much more valuable is the strength of fortitude than the grace of sensibility Do not however confound fortitude with apathy apathy cannot know the virtue Remember too that one act of beneficence one act of real usefulness is worth all the abstract sentiment in the world Sentiment is a disgrace instead of an ornament unless it lead us to good actions The miser who thinks himself respectable merely because he possesses wealth and thus mistakes the means of doing good for the actual accomplishment of it is not more blameable than the man of sentiment without active virtue You may have observed persons who delight so much in this sort of sensibility to sentiment which excludes that to the calls of any practical virtue that they turn from the distressed and because their sufferings are painful to be contemplated do not endeavour to relieve them How despicable is that humanity which can be contented to pity where it might assuage saint Aubert some time after spoke of Madame Cheron his sister Let me inform you of a circumstance that nearly affects your welfare he added We have you know had little intercourse for some years but as she is now your only female relation I have thought it proper to consign you to her care as you will see in my will till you are of age and to recommend you to her protection afterwards She is not exactly the person to whom I would have committed my Emily but I had no alternative and I believe her to be upon the whole a good kind of woman I need not recommend it to your prudence my love to endeavour to conciliate her kindness you will do this for his sake who has often wished to do so for yours Emily assured him that whatever he requested she would religiously perform to the utmost of her ability Alas added she in a voice interrupted by sighs that will soon be all which remains for me it will be almost my only consolation to fulfil your wishes saint Aubert looked up silently in her face as if would have spoken but his spirit sunk a while and his eyes became heavy and dull She felt that look at her heart My dear father she exclaimed and then checking herself pressed his hand closer and hid her face with her handkerchief Her tears were concealed but saint Aubert heard her convulsive sobs His spirits returned O my child said he faintly let my consolations be yours I die in peace for I know that I am about to return to the bosom of my Father who will still be your Father when I am gone Always trust in him my love and he will support you in these moments as he supports me Emily could only listen and weep but the extreme composure of his manner and the faith and hope he expressed somewhat soothed her anguish Yet whenever she looked upon his emaciated countenance and saw the lines of death beginning to prevail over it saw his sunk eyes still bent on her and their heavy lids pressing to a close there was a pang in her heart such as defied expression though it required filial virtue like hers to forbear the attempt He desired once more to bless her Where are you my dear said he as he stretched forth his hands Emily had turned to the window that he might not perceive her anguish she now understood that his sight had failed him When he had given her his blessing and it seemed to be the last effort of expiring life he sunk back on his pillow She kissed his forehead the damps of death had settled there and forgetting her fortitude for a moment her tears mingled with them saint Aubert lifted up his eyes the spirit of a father returned to them but it quickly vanished and he spoke no more saint Aubert lingered till about three o clock in the afternoon and thus gradually sinking into death he expired without a struggle or a sigh Emily was led from the chamber by La Voisin and his daughter who did what they could to comfort her The old man sat and wept with her Agnes was more erroneously officious CHAPTER VIII O er him whose doom thy virtues grieve Aerial forms shall sit at eve and bend the pensive head COLLINS The monk who had before appeared returned in the evening to offer consolation to Emily and brought a kind message from the lady abbess inviting her to the convent Emily though she did not accept the offer returned an answer expressive of her gratitude The holy conversation of the friar whose mild benevolence of manners bore some resemblance to those of saint Aubert soothed the violence of her grief and lifted her heart to the Being who extending through all place and all eternity looks on the events of this little world as on the shadows of a moment and beholds equally and in the same instant the soul that has passed the gates of death and that which still lingers in the body In the sight of God said Emily my dear father now exists as truly as he yesterday existed to me it is to me only that he is dead to God and to himself he yet lives The good monk left her more tranquil than she had been since saint Aubert died and before she retired to her little cabin for the night she trusted herself so far as to visit the corpse Silent and without weeping she stood by its side The features placid and serene told the nature of the last sensations that had lingered in the now deserted frame For a moment she turned away in horror of the stillness in which death had fixed that countenance never till now seen otherwise than animated then gazed on it with a mixture of doubt and awful astonishment Her reason could scarcely overcome an involuntary and unaccountable expectation of seeing that beloved countenance still susceptible She continued to gaze wildly took up the cold hand spoke still gazed and then burst into a transport of grief La Voisin hearing her sobs came into the room to lead her away but she heard nothing and only begged that he would leave her Again alone she indulged her tears and when the gloom of evening obscured the chamber and almost veiled from her eyes the object of her distress she still hung over the body till her spirits at length were exhausted and she became tranquil La Voisin again knocked at the door and entreated that she would come to the common apartment Before she went she kissed the lips of saint Aubert as she was wont to do when she bade him good night Again she kissed them her heart felt as if it would break a few tears of agony started to her eyes she looked up to heaven then at saint Aubert and left the room Retired to her lonely cabin her melancholy thoughts still hovered round the body of her deceased parent and when she sunk into a kind of slumber the images of her waking mind still haunted her fancy She thought she saw her father approaching her with a benign countenance then smiling mournfully and pointing upwards his lips moved but instead of words she heard sweet music borne on the distant air and presently saw his features glow with the mild rapture of a superior being The strain seemed to swell louder and she awoke The vision was gone but music yet came to her ear in strains such as angels might breathe She doubted listened raised herself in the bed and again listened It was music and not an illusion of her imagination After a solemn steady harmony it paused then rose again in mournful sweetness and then died in a cadence that seemed to bear away the listening soul to heaven She instantly remembered the music of the preceding night with the strange circumstances related by La Voisin and the affecting conversation it had led to concerning the state of departed spirits All that saint Aubert had said on that subject now pressed upon her heart and overwhelmed it What a change in a few hours He who then could only conjecture was now made acquainted with truth was himself become one of the departed As she listened she was chilled with superstitious awe her tears stopped and she rose and went to the window All without was obscured in shade but Emily turning her eyes from the massy darkness of the woods whose waving outline appeared on the horizon saw on the left that effulgent planet which the old man had pointed out setting over the woods She remembered what he had said concerning it and the music now coming at intervals on the air she unclosed the casement to listen to the strains that soon gradually sunk to a greater distance and tried to discover whence they came The obscurity prevented her from distinguishing any object on the green platform below and the sounds became fainter and fainter till they softened into silence She listened but they returned no more Soon after she observed the planet trembling between the fringed tops of the woods and in the next moment sink behind them Chilled with a melancholy awe she retired once more to her bed and at length forgot for a while her sorrows in sleep On the following morning she was visited by a sister of the convent who came with kind offices and a second invitation from the lady abbess and Emily though she could not forsake the cottage while the remains of her father were in it consented however painful such a visit must be in the present state of her spirits to pay her respects to the abbess in the evening About an hour before sun set La Voisin shewed her the way through the woods to the convent which stood in a small bay of the Mediterranean crowned by a woody amphitheatre and Emily had she been less unhappy would have admired the extensive sea view that appeared from the green slope in front of the edifice and the rich shores hung with woods and pastures that extended on either hand But her thoughts were now occupied by one sad idea and the features of nature were to her colourless and without form The bell for vespers struck as she passed the ancient gate of the convent and seemed the funereal note for saint Aubert Little incidents affect a mind enervated by sorrow Emily struggled against the sickening faintness that came over her and was led into the presence of the abbess who received her with an air of maternal tenderness an air of such gentle solicitude and consideration as touched her with an instantaneous gratitude her eyes were filled with tears and the words she would have spoken faltered on her lips The abbess led her to a seat and sat down beside her still holding her hand and regarding her in silence as Emily dried her tears and attempted to speak Be composed my daughter said the abbess in a soothing voice do not speak yet I know all you would say Your spirits must be soothed We are going to prayers will you attend our evening service It is comfortable my child to look up in our afflictions to a father who sees and pities us and who chastens in his mercy Emily s tears flowed again but a thousand sweet emotions mingled with them The abbess suffered her to weep without interruption and watched over her with a look of benignity that might have characterized the countenance of a guardian angel Emily when she became tranquil was encouraged to speak without reserve and to mention the motive that made her unwilling to quit the cottage which the abbess did not oppose even by a hint but praised the filial piety of her conduct and added a hope that she would pass a few days at the convent before she returned to La Vallee You must allow yourself a little time to recover from your first shock my daughter before you encounter a second I will not affect to conceal from you how much I know your heart must suffer on returning to the scene of your former happiness Here you will have all that quiet and sympathy and religion can give to restore your spirits But come added she observing the tears swell in Emily s eyes we will go to the chapel Emily followed to the parlour where the nuns were assembled to whom the abbess committed her saying This is a daughter for whom I have much esteem be sisters to her They passed on in a train to the chapel where the solemn devotion with which the service was performed elevated her mind and brought to it the comforts of faith and resignation Twilight came on before the abbess s kindness would suffer Emily to depart when she left the convent with a heart much lighter than she had entered it and was reconducted by La Voisin through the woods the pensive gloom of which was in unison with the temper of her mind and she pursued the little wild path in musing silence till her guide suddenly stopped looked round and then struck out of the path into the high grass saying he had mistaken the road He now walked on quickly and Emily proceeding with difficulty over the obscured and uneven ground was left at some distance till her voice arrested him who seemed unwilling to stop and still hurried on If you are in doubt about the way said Emily had we not better enquire it at the chateau yonder between the trees No replied La Voisin there is no occasion When we reach that brook ma amselle you see the light upon the water there beyond the woods when we reach that brook we shall be at home presently I don t know how I happened to mistake the path I seldom come this way after sun set It is solitary enough said Emily but you have no banditti here No ma amselle no banditti What are you afraid of then my good friend you are not superstitious No not superstitious but to tell you the truth lady nobody likes to go near that chateau after dusk By whom is it inhabited said Emily that it is so formidable Why ma amselle it is scarcely inhabited for our lord the Marquis and the lord of all these find woods too is dead He had not once been in it for these many years and his people who have the care of it live in a cottage close by Emily now understood this to be the chateau which La Voisin had formerly pointed out as having belonged to the Marquis Villeroi on the mention of which her father had appeared so much affected Ah it is a desolate place now continued La Voisin and such a grand fine place as I remember it Emily enquired what had occasioned this lamentable change but the old man was silent and Emily whose interest was awakened by the fear he had expressed and above all by a recollection of her father s agitation repeated the question and added If you are neither afraid of the inhabitants my good friend nor are superstitious how happens it that you dread to pass near that chateau in the dark Perhaps then I am a little superstitious ma amselle and if you knew what I do you might be so too Strange things have happened there Monsieur your good father appeared to have known the late Marchioness Pray inform me what did happen said Emily with much emotion Alas ma amselle answered La Voisin enquire no further it is not for me to lay open the domestic secrets of my lord Emily surprised by the old man s words and his manner of delivering them forbore to repeat her question a nearer interest the remembrance of saint Aubert occupied her thoughts and she was led to recollect the music she heard on the preceding night which she mentioned to La Voisin You was not alone ma amselle in this he replied I heard it too but I have so often heard it at the same hour that I was scarcely surprised You doubtless believe this music to have some connection with the chateau said Emily suddenly and are therefore superstitious It may be so ma amselle but there are other circumstances belonging to that chateau which I remember and sadly too A heavy sigh followed but Emily s delicacy restrained the curiosity these words revived and she enquired no further On reaching the cottage all the violence of her grief returned it seemed as if she had escaped its heavy pressure only while she was removed from the object of it She passed immediately to the chamber where the remains of her father were laid and yielded to all the anguish of hopeless grief La Voisin at length persuaded her to leave the room and she returned to her own where exhausted by the sufferings of the day she soon fell into deep sleep and awoke considerably refreshed When the dreadful hour arrived in which the remains of saint Aubert were to be taken from her for ever she went alone to the chamber to look upon his countenance yet once again and La Voisin who had waited patiently below stairs till her despair should subside with the respect due to grief forbore to interrupt the indulgence of it till surprise at the length of her stay and then apprehension overcame his delicacy and he went to lead her from the chamber Having tapped gently at the door without receiving an answer he listened attentively but all was still no sigh no sob of anguish was heard Yet more alarmed by this silence he opened the door and found Emily lying senseless across the foot of the bed near which stood the coffin His calls procured assistance and she was carried to her room where proper applications at length restored her During her state of insensibility La Voisin had given directions for the coffin to be closed and he succeeded in persuading Emily to forbear revisiting the chamber She indeed felt herself unequal to this and also perceived the necessity of sparing her spirits and recollecting fortitude sufficient to bear her through the approaching scene saint Aubert had given a particular injunction that his remains should be interred in the church of the convent of saint Clair and in mentioning the north chancel near the ancient tomb of the Villerois had pointed out the exact spot where he wished to be laid The superior had granted this place for the interment and thither therefore the sad procession now moved which was met at the gates by the venerable priest followed by a train of friars Every person who heard the solemn chant of the anthem and the peal of the organ that struck up when the body entered the church and saw also the feeble steps and the assumed tranquillity of Emily gave her involuntary tears She shed none but walked her face partly shaded by a thin black veil between two persons who supported her preceded by the abbess and followed by nuns whose plaintive voices mellowed the swelling harmony of the dirge When the procession came to the grave the music ceased Emily drew the veil entirely over her face and in a momentary pause between the anthem and the rest of the service her sobs were distinctly audible The holy father began the service and Emily again commanded her feelings till the coffin was let down and she heard the earth rattle on its lid Then as she shuddered a groan burst from her heart and she leaned for support on the person who stood next to her In a few moments she recovered and when she heard those affecting and sublime words His body is buried in peace and his soul returns to Him that gave it her anguish softened into tears The abbess led her from the church into her own parlour and there administered all the consolations that religion and gentle sympathy can give Emily struggled against the pressure of grief but the abbess observing her attentively ordered a bed to be prepared and recommended her to retire to repose She also kindly claimed her promise to remain a few days at the convent and Emily who had no wish to return to the cottage the scene of all her sufferings had leisure now that no immediate care pressed upon her attention to feel the indisposition which disabled her from immediately travelling Meanwhile the maternal kindness of the abbess and the gentle attentions of the nuns did all that was possible towards soothing her spirits and restoring her health But the latter was too deeply wounded through the medium of her mind to be quickly revived She lingered for some weeks at the convent under the influence of a slow fever wishing to return home yet unable to go thither often even reluctant to leave the spot where her father s relics were deposited and sometimes soothing herself with the consideration that if she died here her remains would repose beside those of saint Aubert In the meanwhile she sent letters to Madame Cheron and to the old housekeeper informing them of the sad event that had taken place and of her own situation From her aunt she received an answer abounding more in common place condolement than in traits of real sorrow which assured her that a servant should be sent to conduct her to La Vallee for that her own time was so much occupied by company that she had no leisure to undertake so long a journey However Emily might prefer La Vallee to Tholouse she could not be insensible to the indecorous and unkind conduct of her aunt in suffering her to return thither where she had no longer a relation to console and protect her a conduct which was the more culpable since saint Aubert had appointed Madame Cheron the guardian of his orphan daughter Madame Cheron s servant made the attendance of the good La Voisin unnecessary and Emily who felt sensibly her obligations to him for all his kind attention to her late father as well as to herself was glad to spare him a long and what at his time of life must have been a troublesome journey During her stay at the convent the peace and sanctity that reigned within the tranquil beauty of the scenery without and the delicate attentions of the abbess and the nuns were circumstances so soothing to her mind that they almost tempted her to leave a world where she had lost her dearest friends and devote herself to the cloister in a spot rendered sacred to her by containing the tomb of saint Aubert The pensive enthusiasm too so natural to her temper had spread a beautiful illusion over the sanctified retirement of a nun that almost hid from her view the selfishness of its security But the touches which a melancholy fancy slightly tinctured with superstition gave to the monastic scene began to fade as her spirits revived and brought once more to her heart an image which had only transiently been banished thence By this she was silently awakened to hope and comfort and sweet affections visions of happiness gleamed faintly at a distance and though she knew them to be illusions she could not resolve to shut them out for ever It was the remembrance of Valancourt of his taste his genius and of the countenance which glowed with both that perhaps alone determined her to return to the world The grandeur and sublimity of the scenes amidst which they had first met had fascinated her fancy and had imperceptibly contributed to render Valancourt more interesting by seeming to communicate to him somewhat of their own character The esteem too which saint Aubert had repeatedly expressed for him sanctioned this kindness but though his countenance and manner had continually expressed his admiration of her he had not otherwise declared it and even the hope of seeing him again was so distant that she was scarcely conscious of it still less that it influenced her conduct on this occasion It was several days after the arrival of Madame Cheron s servant before Emily was sufficiently recovered to undertake the journey to La Vallee On the evening preceding her departure she went to the cottage to take leave of La Voisin and his family and to make them a return for their kindness The old man she found sitting on a bench at his door between his daughter and his son in law who was just returned from his daily labour and who was playing upon a pipe that in tone resembled an oboe A flask of wine stood beside the old man and before him a small table with fruit and bread round which stood several of his grandsons fine rosy children who were taking their supper as their mother distributed it On the edge of the little green that spread before the cottage were cattle and a few sheep reposing under the trees The landscape was touched with the mellow light of the evening sun whose long slanting beams played through a vista of the woods and lighted up the distant turrets of the chateau She paused a moment before she emerged from the shade to gaze upon the happy group before her on the complacency and ease of healthy age depictured on the countenance of La Voisin the maternal tenderness of Agnes as she looked upon her children and the innocency of infantine pleasures reflected in their smiles Emily looked again at the venerable old man and at the cottage the memory of her father rose with full force upon her mind and she hastily stepped forward afraid to trust herself with a longer pause She took an affectionate and affecting leave of La Voisin and his family he seemed to love her as his daughter and shed tears Emily shed many She avoided going into the cottage since she knew it would revive emotions such as she could not now endure One painful scene yet awaited her for she determined to visit again her father s grave and that she might not be interrupted or observed in the indulgence of her melancholy tenderness she deferred her visit till every inhabitant of the convent except the nun who promised to bring her the key of the church should be retired to rest Emily remained in her chamber till she heard the convent bell strike twelve when the nun came as she had appointed with the key of a private door that opened into the church and they descended together the narrow winding stair case that led thither The nun offered to accompany Emily to the grave adding It is melancholy to go alone at this hour but the former thanking her for the consideration could not consent to have any witness of her sorrow and the sister having unlocked the door gave her the lamp You will remember sister said she that in the east aisle which you must pass is a newly opened grave hold the light to the ground that you may not stumble over the loose earth Emily thanking her again took the lamp and stepping into the church sister Mariette departed But Emily paused a moment at the door a sudden fear came over her and she returned to the foot of the stair case where as she heard the steps of the nun ascending and while she held up the lamp saw her black veil waving over the spiral balusters she was tempted to call her back While she hesitated the veil disappeared and in the next moment ashamed of her fears she returned to the church The cold air of the aisles chilled her and their deep silence and extent feebly shone upon by the moon light that streamed through a distant gothic window would at any other time have awed her into superstition now grief occupied all her attention She scarcely heard the whispering echoes of her own steps or thought of the open grave till she found herself almost on its brink A friar of the convent had been buried there on the preceding evening and as she had sat alone in her chamber at twilight she heard at distance the monks chanting the requiem for his soul This brought freshly to her memory the circumstances of her father s death and as the voices mingling with a low querulous peal of the organ swelled faintly gloomy and affecting visions had arisen upon her mind Now she remembered them and turning aside to avoid the broken ground these recollections made her pass on with quicker steps to the grave of saint Aubert when in the moon light that fell athwart a remote part of the aisle she thought she saw a shadow gliding between the pillars She stopped to listen and not hearing any footstep believed that her fancy had deceived her and no longer apprehensive of being observed proceeded saint Aubert was buried beneath a plain marble bearing little more than his name and the date of his birth and death near the foot of the stately monument of the Villerois Emily remained at his grave till a chime that called the monks to early prayers warned her to retire then she wept over it a last farewel and forced herself from the spot After this hour of melancholy indulgence she was refreshed by a deeper sleep than she had experienced for a long time and on awakening her mind was more tranquil and resigned than it had been since saint Aubert s death But when the moment of her departure from the convent arrived all her grief returned the memory of the dead and the kindness of the living attached her to the place and for the sacred spot where her father s remains were interred she seemed to feel all those tender affections which we conceive for home The abbess repeated many kind assurances of regard at their parting and pressed her to return if ever she should find her condition elsewhere unpleasant many of the nuns also expressed unaffected regret at her departure and Emily left the convent with many tears and followed by sincere wishes for her happiness She had travelled several leagues before the scenes of the country through which she passed had power to rouse her for a moment from the deep melancholy into which she was sunk and when they did it was only to remind her that on her last view of them saint Aubert was at her side and to call up to her remembrance the remarks he had delivered on similar scenery Thus without any particular occurrence passed the day in languor and dejection She slept that night in a town on the skirts of Languedoc and on the following morning entered Gascony Towards the close of this day Emily came within view of the plains in the neighbourhood of La Vallee and the well known objects of former times began to press upon her notice and with them recollections that awakened all her tenderness and grief Often while she looked through her tears upon the wild grandeur of the Pyrenees now varied with the rich lights and shadows of evening she remembered that when last she saw them her father partook with her of the pleasure they inspired Suddenly some scene which he had particularly pointed out to her would present itself and the sick languor of despair would steal upon her heart There she would exclaim there are the very cliffs there the wood of pines which he looked at with such delight as we passed this road together for the last time There too under the crag of that mountain is the cottage peeping from among the cedars which he bade me remember and copy with my pencil O my father shall I never see you more As she drew near the chateau these melancholy memorials of past times multiplied At length the chateau itself appeared amid the glowing beauty of saint Aubert s favourite landscape This was an object which called for fortitude not for tears Emily dried hers and prepared to meet with calmness the trying moment of her return to that home where there was no longer a parent to welcome her Yes said she let me not forget the lessons he has taught me How often he has pointed out the necessity of resisting even virtuous sorrow how often we have admired together the greatness of a mind that can at once suffer and reason O my father if you are permitted to look down upon your child it will please you to see that she remembers and endeavours to practise the precepts you have given her A turn on the road now allowed a nearer view of the chateau the chimneys tipped with light rising from behind saint Aubert s favourite oaks whose foliage partly concealed the lower part of the building Emily could not suppress a heavy sigh This too was his favourite hour said she as she gazed upon the long evening shadows stretched athwart the landscape How deep the repose how lovely the scene lovely and tranquil as in former days Again she resisted the pressure of sorrow till her ear caught the gay melody of the dance which she had so often listened to as she walked with saint Aubert on the margin of the Garonne when all her fortitude forsook her and she continued to weep till the carriage stopped at the little gate that opened upon what was now her own territory She raised her eyes on the sudden stopping of the carriage and saw her father s old housekeeper coming to open the gate Manchon also came running and barking before her and when his young mistress alighted fawned and played round her gasping with joy Dear ma amselle said Theresa and paused and looked as if she would have offered something of condolement to Emily whose tears now prevented reply The dog still fawned and ran round her and then flew towards the carriage with a short quick bark Ah ma amselle my poor master said Theresa whose feelings were more awakened than her delicacy Manchon s gone to look for him Emily sobbed aloud and on looking towards the carriage which still stood with the door open saw the animal spring into it and instantly leap out and then with his nose on the ground run round the horses Don t cry so ma amselle said Theresa it breaks my heart to see you The dog now came running to Emily then returned to the carriage and then back again to her whining and discontented Poor rogue said Theresa thou hast lost thy master thou mayst well cry But come my dear young lady be comforted What shall I get to refresh you Emily gave her hand to the old servant and tried to restrain her grief while she made some kind enquiries concerning her health But she still lingered in the walk which led to the chateau for within was no person to meet her with the kiss of affection her own heart no longer palpitated with impatient joy to meet again the well known smile and she dreaded to see objects which would recall the full remembrance of her former happiness She moved slowly towards the door paused went on and paused again How silent how forsaken how forlorn did the chateau appear Trembling to enter it yet blaming herself for delaying what she could not avoid she at length passed into the hall crossed it with a hurried step as if afraid to look round and opened the door of that room which she was wont to call her own The gloom of evening gave solemnity to its silent and deserted air The chairs the tables every article of furniture so familiar to her in happier times spoke eloquently to her heart She seated herself without immediately observing it in a window which opened upon the garden and where saint Aubert had often sat with her watching the sun retire from the rich and extensive prospect that appeared beyond the groves Having indulged her tears for some time she became more composed and when Theresa after seeing the baggage deposited in her lady s room again appeared she had so far recovered her spirits as to be able to converse with her I have made up the green bed for you ma amselle said Theresa as she set the coffee upon the table I thought you would like it better than your own now but I little thought this day month that you would come back alone A well a day the news almost broke my heart when it did come Who would have believed that my poor master when he went from home would never return again Emily hid her face with her handkerchief and waved her hand Do taste the coffee said Theresa My dear young lady be comforted we must all die My dear master is a saint above Emily took the handkerchief from her face and raised her eyes full of tears towards heaven soon after she dried them and in a calm but tremulous voice began to enquire concerning some of her late father s pensioners Alas a day said Theresa as she poured out the coffee and handed it to her mistress all that could come have been here every day to enquire after you and my master She then proceeded to tell that some were dead whom they had left well and others who were ill had recovered And see ma amselle added Theresa there is old Mary coming up the garden now she has looked every day these three years as if she would die yet she is alive still She has seen the chaise at the door and knows you are come home The sight of this poor old woman would have been too much for Emily and she begged Theresa would go and tell her that she was too ill to see any person that night To morrow I shall be better perhaps but give her this token of my remembrance Emily sat for some time given up to sorrow Not an object on which her eye glanced but awakened some remembrance that led immediately to the subject of her grief Her favourite plants which saint Aubert had taught her to nurse the little drawings that adorned the room which his taste had instructed her to execute the books that he had selected for her use and which they had read together her musical instruments whose sounds he loved so well and which he sometimes awakened himself every object gave new force to sorrow At length she roused herself from this melancholy indulgence and summoning all her resolution stepped forward to go into those forlorn rooms which though she dreaded to enter she knew would yet more powerfully affect her if she delayed to visit them Having passed through the green house her courage for a moment forsook her when she opened the door of the library and perhaps the shade which evening and the foliage of the trees near the windows threw across the room heightened the solemnity of her feelings on entering that apartment where every thing spoke of her father There was an arm chair in which he used to sit she shrunk when she observed it for she had so often seen him seated there and the idea of him rose so distinctly to her mind that she almost fancied she saw him before her But she checked the illusions of a distempered imagination though she could not subdue a certain degree of awe which now mingled with her emotions She walked slowly to the chair and seated herself in it there was a reading desk before it on which lay a book open as it had been left by her father It was some moments before she recovered courage enough to examine it and when she looked at the open page she immediately recollected that saint Aubert on the evening before his departure from the chateau had read to her some passages from this his favourite author The circumstance now affected her extremely she looked at the page wept and looked again To her the book appeared sacred and invaluable and she would not have moved it or closed the page which he had left open for the treasures of the Indies Still she sat before the desk and could not resolve to quit it though the increasing gloom and the profound silence of the apartment revived a degree of painful awe Her thoughts dwelt on the probable state of departed spirits and she remembered the affecting conversation which had passed between saint Aubert and La Voisin on the night preceding his death As she mused she saw the door slowly open and a rustling sound in a remote part of the room startled her Through the dusk she thought she perceived something move The subject she had been considering and the present tone of her spirits which made her imagination respond to every impression of her senses gave her a sudden terror of something supernatural She sat for a moment motionless and then her dissipated reason returning What should I fear said she If the spirits of those we love ever return to us it is in kindness The silence which again reigned made her ashamed of her late fears and she believed that her imagination had deluded her or that she had heard one of those unaccountable noises which sometimes occur in old houses The same sound however returned and distinguishing something moving towards her and in the next instant press beside her into the chair she shrieked but her fleeting senses were instantly recalled on perceiving that it was Manchon who sat by her and who now licked her hands affectionately Perceiving her spirits unequal to the task she had assigned herself of visiting the deserted rooms of the chateau this night when she left the library she walked into the garden and down to the terrace that overhung the river The sun was now set but under the dark branches of the almond trees was seen the saffron glow of the west spreading beyond the twilight of middle air The bat flitted silently by and now and then the mourning note of the nightingale was heard The circumstances of the hour brought to her recollection some lines which she had once heard saint Aubert recite on this very spot and she had now a melancholy pleasure in repeating them SONNET Now the bat circles on the breeze of eve That creeps in shudd ring fits along the wave And trembles mid the woods and through the cave Whose lonely sighs the wanderer deceive For oft when melancholy charms his mind He thinks the Spirit of the rock he hears Nor listens but with sweetly thrilling fears To the low mystic murmurs of the wind Now the bat circles and the twilight dew Falls silent round and o er the mountain cliff The gleaming wave and far discover d skiff Spreads the gray veil of soft harmonious hue So falls o er Grief the dew of pity s tear Dimming her lonely visions of despair Emily wandering on came to saint Aubert s favourite plane tree where so often at this hour they had sat beneath the shade together and with her dear mother so often had conversed on the subject of a future state How often too had her father expressed the comfort he derived from believing that they should meet in another world Emily overcome by these recollections left the plane tree and as she leaned pensively on the wall of the terrace she observed a group of peasants dancing gaily on the banks of the Garonne which spread in broad expanse below and reflected the evening light What a contrast they formed to the desolate unhappy Emily They were gay and debonnaire as they were wont to be when she too was gay when saint Aubert used to listen to their merry music with a countenance beaming pleasure and benevolence Emily having looked for a moment on this sprightly band turned away unable to bear the remembrances it excited but where alas could she turn and not meet new objects to give acuteness to grief As she walked slowly towards the house she was met by Theresa Dear ma amselle said she I have been seeking you up and down this half hour and was afraid some accident had happened to you How can you like to wander about so in this night air Do come into the house Think what my poor master would have said if he could see you I am sure when my dear lady died no gentleman could take it more to heart than he did yet you know he seldom shed a tear Pray Theresa cease said Emily wishing to interrupt this ill judged but well meaning harangue Theresa s loquacity however was not to be silenced so easily And when you used to grieve so she added he often told you how wrong it was for that my mistress was happy And if she was happy I am sure he is so too for the prayers of the poor they say reach heaven During this speech Emily had walked silently into the chateau and Theresa lighted her across the hall into the common sitting parlour where she had laid the cloth with one solitary knife and fork for supper Emily was in the room before she perceived that it was not her own apartment but she checked the emotion which inclined her to leave it and seated herself quietly by the little supper table Her father s hat hung upon the opposite wall while she gazed at it a faintness came over her Theresa looked at her and then at the object on which her eyes were settled and went to remove it but Emily waved her hand No said she let it remain I am going to my chamber Nay ma amselle supper is ready I cannot take it replied Emily I will go to my room and try to sleep Tomorrow I shall be better This is poor doings said Theresa Dear lady do take some food I have dressed a pheasant and a fine one it is Old Monsieur Barreaux sent it this morning for I saw him yesterday and told him you were coming And I know nobody that seemed more concerned when he heard the sad news then he Did he said Emily in a tender voice while she felt her poor heart warmed for a moment by a ray of sympathy At length her spirits were entirely overcome and she retired to her room

none	none	And it was now that she understood the full value of the education she had received from saint Aubert for in cultivating her understanding he had secured her an asylum from indolence without recourse to dissipation and rich and varied amusement and information independent of the society from which her situation secluded her Nor were the good effects of this education confined to selfish advantages since saint Aubert having nourished every amiable qualify of her heart it now expanded in benevolence to all around her and taught her when she could not remove the misfortunes of others at least to soften them by sympathy and tenderness a benevolence that taught her to feel for all that could suffer Madame Cheron returned no answer to Emily s letter who began to hope that she should be permitted to remain some time longer in her retirement and her mind had now so far recovered its strength that she ventured to view the scenes which most powerfully recalled the images of past times Among these was the fishing house and to indulge still more the affectionate melancholy of the visit she took thither her lute that she might again hear there the tones to which saint Aubert and her mother had so often delighted to listen She went alone and at that still hour of the evening which is so soothing to fancy and to grief The last time she had been here she was in company with Monsieur and Madame saint Aubert a few days preceding that on which the latter was seized with a fatal illness Now when Emily again entered the woods that surrounded the building they awakened so forcibly the memory of former times that her resolution yielded for a moment to excess of grief She stopped leaned for support against a tree and wept for some minutes before she had recovered herself sufficiently to proceed The little path that led to the building was overgrown with grass and the flowers which saint Aubert had scattered carelessly along the border were almost choked with weeds the tall thistle the fox glove and the nettle She often paused to look on the desolate spot now so silent and forsaken and when with a trembling hand she opened the door of the fishing house Ah said she every thing every thing remains as when I left it last left it with those who never must return She went to a window that overhung the rivulet and leaning over it with her eyes fixed on the current was soon lost in melancholy reverie The lute she had brought lay forgotten beside her the mournful sighing of the breeze as it waved the high pines above and its softer whispers among the osiers that bowed upon the banks below was a kind of music more in unison with her feelings It did not vibrate on the chords of unhappy memory but was soothing to the heart as the voice of Pity She continued to muse unconscious of the gloom of evening and that the sun s last light trembled on the heights above and would probably have remained so much longer if a sudden footstep without the building had not alarmed her attention and first made her recollect that she was unprotected In the next moment a door opened and a stranger appeared who stopped on perceiving Emily and then began to apologize for his intrusion But Emily at the sound of his voice lost her fear in a stronger emotion its tones were familiar to her ear and though she could not readily distinguish through the dusk the features of the person who spoke she felt a remembrance too strong to be distrusted He repeated his apology and Emily then said something in reply when the stranger eagerly advancing exclaimed Good God can it be surely I am not mistaken ma amselle saint Aubert is it not It is indeed said Emily who was confirmed in her first conjecture for she now distinguished the countenance of Valancourt lighted up with still more than its usual animation A thousand painful recollections crowded to her mind and the effort which she made to support herself only served to increase her agitation Valancourt meanwhile having enquired anxiously after her health and expressed his hopes that M saint Aubert had found benefit from travelling learned from the flood of tears which she could no longer repress the fatal truth He led her to a seat and sat down by her while Emily continued to weep and Valancourt to hold the hand which she was unconscious he had taken till it was wet with the tears which grief for saint Aubert and sympathy for herself had called forth I feel said he at length I feel how insufficient all attempt at consolation must be on this subject I can only mourn with you for I cannot doubt the source of your tears Would to God I were mistaken Emily could still answer only by tears till she rose and begged they might leave the melancholy spot when Valancourt though he saw her feebleness could not offer to detain her but took her arm within his and led her from the fishing house They walked silently through the woods Valancourt anxious to know yet fearing to ask any particulars concerning saint Aubert and Emily too much distressed to converse After some time however she acquired fortitude enough to speak of her father and to give a brief account of the manner of his death during which recital Valancourt s countenance betrayed strong emotion and when he heard that saint Aubert had died on the road and that Emily had been left among strangers he pressed her hand between his and involuntarily exclaimed Why was I not there but in the next moment recollected himself for he immediately returned to the mention of her father till perceiving that her spirits were exhausted he gradually changed the subject and spoke of himself Emily thus learned that after they had parted he had wandered for some time along the shores of the Mediterranean and had then returned through Languedoc into Gascony which was his native province and where he usually resided When he had concluded his little narrative he sunk into a silence which Emily was not disposed to interrupt and it continued till they reached the gate of the chateau when he stopped as if he had known this to be the limit of his walk Here saying that it was his intention to return to Estuviere on the following day he asked her if she would permit him to take leave of her in the morning and Emily perceiving that she could not reject an ordinary civility without expressing by her refusal an expectation of something more was compelled to answer that she should be at home She passed a melancholy evening during which the retrospect of all that had happened since she had seen Valancourt would rise to her imagination and the scene of her father s death appeared in tints as fresh as if it had passed on the preceding day She remembered particularly the earnest and solemn manner in which he had required her to destroy the manuscript papers and awakening from the lethargy in which sorrow had held her she was shocked to think she had not yet obeyed him and determined that another day should not reproach her with the neglect CHAPTER X Can such things be And overcome us like a summer s cloud Without our special wonder MACBETH On the next morning Emily ordered a fire to be lighted in the stove of the chamber where saint Aubert used to sleep and as soon as she had breakfasted went thither to burn the papers Having fastened the door to prevent interruption she opened the closet where they were concealed as she entered which she felt an emotion of unusual awe and stood for some moments surveying it trembling and almost afraid to remove the board There was a great chair in one corner of the closet and opposite to it stood the table at which she had seen her father sit on the evening that preceded his departure looking over with so much emotion what she believed to be these very papers The solitary life which Emily had led of late and the melancholy subjects on which she had suffered her thoughts to dwell had rendered her at times sensible to the thick coming fancies of a mind greatly enervated It was lamentable that her excellent understanding should have yielded even for a moment to the reveries of superstition or rather to those starts of imagination which deceive the senses into what can be called nothing less than momentary madness Instances of this temporary failure of mind had more than once occurred since her return home particularly when wandering through this lonely mansion in the evening twilight she had been alarmed by appearances which would have been unseen in her more cheerful days To this infirm state of her nerves may be attributed what she imagined when her eyes glancing a second time on the arm chair which stood in an obscure part of the closet the countenance of her dead father appeared there Emily stood fixed for a moment to the floor after which she left the closet Her spirits however soon returned she reproached herself with the weakness of thus suffering interruption in an act of serious importance and again opened the door By the directions which saint Aubert had given her she readily found the board he had described in an opposite corner of the closet near the window she distinguished also the line he had mentioned and pressing it as he had bade her it slid down and disclosed the bundle of papers together with some scattered ones and the purse of louis With a trembling hand she removed them replaced the board paused a moment and was rising from the floor when on looking up there appeared to her alarmed fancy the same countenance in the chair The illusion another instance of the unhappy effect which solitude and grief had gradually produced upon her mind subdued her spirits she rushed forward into the chamber and sunk almost senseless into a chair Returning reason soon overcame the dreadful but pitiable attack of imagination and she turned to the papers though still with so little recollection that her eyes involuntarily settled on the writing of some loose sheets which lay open and she was unconscious that she was transgressing her father s strict injunction till a sentence of dreadful import awakened her attention and her memory together She hastily put the papers from her but the words which had roused equally her curiosity and terror she could not dismiss from her thoughts So powerfully had they affected her that she even could not resolve to destroy the papers immediately and the more she dwelt on the circumstance the more it inflamed her imagination Urged by the most forcible and apparently the most necessary curiosity to enquire farther concerning the terrible and mysterious subject to which she had seen an allusion she began to lament her promise to destroy the papers For a moment she even doubted whether it could justly be obeyed in contradiction to such reasons as there appeared to be for further information But the delusion was momentary I have given a solemn promise said she to observe a solemn injunction and it is not my business to argue but to obey Let me hasten to remove the temptation that would destroy my innocence and embitter my life with the consciousness of irremediable guilt while I have strength to reject it Thus re animated with a sense of her duty she completed the triumph of her integrity over temptation more forcible than any she had ever known and consigned the papers to the flames Her eyes watched them as they slowly consumed she shuddered at the recollection of the sentence she had just seen and at the certainty that the only opportunity of explaining it was then passing away for ever It was long after this that she recollected the purse and as she was depositing it unopened in a cabinet perceiving that it contained something of a size larger than coin she examined it His hand deposited them here said she as she kissed some pieces of the coin and wetted them with her tears his hand which is now dust At the bottom of the purse was a small packet having taken out which and unfolded paper after paper she found to be an ivory case containing the miniature of a lady She started The same said she my father wept over On examining the countenance she could recollect no person that it resembled It was of uncommon beauty and was characterized by an expression of sweetness shaded with sorrow and tempered by resignation saint Aubert had given no directions concerning this picture nor had even named it she therefore thought herself justified in preserving it More than once remembering his manner when he had spoken of the Marchioness of Villeroi she felt inclined to believe that this was her resemblance yet there appeared no reason why he should have preserved a picture of that lady or having preserved it why he should lament over it in a manner so striking and affecting as she had witnessed on the night preceding his departure Emily still gazed on the countenance examining its features but she knew not where to detect the charm that captivated her attention and inspired sentiments of such love and pity Dark brown hair played carelessly along the open forehead the nose was rather inclined to aquiline the lips spoke in a smile but it was a melancholy one the eyes were blue and were directed upwards with an expression of peculiar meekness while the soft cloud of the brow spoke of the fine sensibility of the temper Emily was roused from the musing mood into which the picture had thrown her by the closing of the garden gate and on turning her eyes to the window she saw Valancourt coming towards the chateau Her spirits agitated by the subjects that had lately occupied her mind she felt unprepared to see him and remained a few moments in the chamber to recover herself When she met him in the parlour she was struck with the change that appeared in his air and countenance since they had parted in Rousillon which twilight and the distress she suffered on the preceding evening had prevented her from observing But dejection and languor disappeared for a moment in the smile that now enlightened his countenance on perceiving her You see said he I have availed myself of the permission with which you honoured me of bidding YOU farewell whom I had the happiness of meeting only yesterday Emily smiled faintly and anxious to say something asked if he had been long in Gascony A few days only replied Valancourt while a blush passed over his cheek I engaged in a long ramble after I had the misfortune of parting with the friends who had made my wanderings among the Pyrenees so delightful A tear came to Emily s eye as Valancourt said this which he observed and anxious to draw off her attention from the remembrance that had occasioned it as well as shocked at his own thoughtlessness he began to speak on other subjects expressing his admiration of the chateau and its prospects Emily who felt somewhat embarrassed how to support a conversation was glad of such an opportunity to continue it on indifferent topics They walked down to the terrace where Valancourt was charmed with the river scenery and the views over the opposite shores of Guienne As he leaned on the wall of the terrace watching the rapid current of the Garonne I was a few weeks ago said he at the source of this noble river I had not then the happiness of knowing you or I should have regretted your absence it was a scene so exactly suited to your taste It rises in a part of the Pyrenees still wilder and more sublime I think than any we passed in the way to Rousillon He then described its fall among the precipices of the mountains where its waters augmented by the streams that descend from the snowy summits around rush into the Vallee d Aran between whose romantic heights it foams along pursuing its way to the north west till it emerges upon the plains of Languedoc Then washing the walls of Tholouse and turning again to the north west it assumes a milder character as it fertilizes the pastures of Gascony and Guienne in its progress to the Bay of Biscay Emily and Valancourt talked of the scenes they had passed among the Pyrenean Alps as he spoke of which there was often a tremulous tenderness in his voice and sometimes he expatiated on them with all the fire of genius sometimes would appear scarcely conscious of the topic though he continued to speak This subject recalled forcibly to Emily the idea of her father whose image appeared in every landscape which Valancourt particularized whose remarks dwelt upon her memory and whose enthusiasm still glowed in her heart Her silence at length reminded Valancourt how nearly his conversation approached to the occasion of her grief and he changed the subject though for one scarcely less affecting to Emily When he admired the grandeur of the plane tree that spread its wide branches over the terrace and under whose shade they now sat she remembered how often she had sat thus with saint Aubert and heard him express the same admiration This was a favourite tree with my dear father said she he used to love to sit under its foliage with his family about him in the fine evenings of summer Valancourt understood her feelings and was silent had she raised her eyes from the ground she would have seen tears in his He rose and leaned on the wall of the terrace from which in a few moments he returned to his seat then rose again and appeared to be greatly agitated while Emily found her spirits so much depressed that several of her attempts to renew the conversation were ineffectual Valancourt again sat down but was still silent and trembled At length he said with a hesitating voice This lovely scene I am going to leave to leave you perhaps for ever These moments may never return I cannot resolve to neglect though I scarcely dare to avail myself of them Let me however without offending the delicacy of your sorrow venture to declare the admiration I must always feel of your goodness O that at some future period I might be permitted to call it love Emily s emotion would not suffer her to reply and Valancourt who now ventured to look up observing her countenance change expected to see her faint and made an involuntary effort to support her which recalled Emily to a sense of her situation and to an exertion of her spirits Valancourt did not appear to notice her indisposition but when he spoke again his voice told the tenderest love I will not presume he added to intrude this subject longer upon your attention at this time but I may perhaps be permitted to mention that these parting moments would lose much of their bitterness if I might be allowed to hope the declaration I have made would not exclude me from your presence in future Emily made another effort to overcome the confusion of her thoughts and to speak She feared to trust the preference her heart acknowledged towards Valancourt and to give him any encouragement for hope on so short an acquaintance For though in this narrow period she had observed much that was admirable in his taste and disposition and though these observations had been sanctioned by the opinion of her father they were not sufficient testimonies of his general worth to determine her upon a subject so infinitely important to her future happiness as that which now solicited her attention Yet though the thought of dismissing Valancourt was so very painful to her that she could scarcely endure to pause upon it the consciousness of this made her fear the partiality of her judgment and hesitate still more to encourage that suit for which her own heart too tenderly pleaded The family of Valancourt if not his circumstances had been known to her father and known to be unexceptionable Of his circumstances Valancourt himself hinted as far as delicacy would permit when he said he had at present little else to offer but an heart that adored her He had solicited only for a distant hope and she could not resolve to forbid though she scarcely dared to permit it at length she acquired courage to say that she must think herself honoured by the good opinion of any person whom her father had esteemed And was I then thought worthy of his esteem said Valancourt in a voice trembling with anxiety then checking himself he added But pardon the question I scarcely know what I say If I might dare to hope that you think me not unworthy such honour and might be permitted sometimes to enquire after your health I should now leave you with comparative tranquillity Emily after a moment s silence said I will be ingenuous with you for I know you will understand and allow for my situation you will consider it as a proof of my my esteem that I am so Though I live here in what was my father s house I live here alone I have alas no longer a parent a parent whose presence might sanction your visits It is unnecessary for me to point out the impropriety of my receiving them Nor will I affect to be insensible of this replied Valancourt adding mournfully but what is to console me for my candour I distress you and would now leave the subject if I might carry with me a hope of being some time permitted to renew it of being allowed to make myself known to your family Emily was again confused and again hesitated what to reply she felt most acutely the difficulty the forlornness of her situation which did not allow her a single relative or friend to whom she could turn for even a look that might support and guide her in the present embarrassing circumstances Madame Cheron who was her only relative and ought to have been this friend was either occupied by her own amusements or so resentful of the reluctance her niece had shewn to quit La Vallee that she seemed totally to have abandoned her Ah I see said Valancourt after a long pause during which Emily had begun and left unfinished two or three sentences I see that I have nothing to hope my fears were too just you think me unworthy of your esteem That fatal journey which I considered as the happiest period of my life those delightful days were to embitter all my future ones How often I have looked back to them with hope and fear yet never till this moment could I prevail with myself to regret their enchanting influence His voice faltered and he abruptly quitted his seat and walked on the terrace There was an expression of despair on his countenance that affected Emily The pleadings of her heart overcame in some degree her extreme timidity and when he resumed his seat she said in an accent that betrayed her tenderness You do both yourself and me injustice when you say I think you unworthy of my esteem I will acknowledge that you have long possessed it and and Valancourt waited impatiently for the conclusion of the sentence but the words died on her lips Her eyes however reflected all the emotions of her heart Valancourt passed in an instant from the impatience of despair to that of joy and tenderness O Emily he exclaimed my own Emily teach me to sustain this moment Let me seal it as the most sacred of my life He pressed her hand to his lips it was cold and trembling and raising her eyes he saw the paleness of her countenance Tears came to her relief and Valancourt watched in anxious silence over her In a few moments she recovered herself and smiling faintly through her tears said Can you excuse this weakness My spirits have not yet I believe recovered from the shock they lately received I cannot excuse myself said Valancourt but I will forbear to renew the subject which may have contributed to agitate them now that I can leave you with the sweet certainty of possessing your esteem Then forgetting his resolution he again spoke of himself You know not said he the many anxious hours I have passed near you lately when you believed me if indeed you honoured me with a thought far away I have wandered near the chateau in the still hours of the night when no eye could observe me It was delightful to know I was so near you and there was something particularly soothing in the thought that I watched round your habitation while you slept These grounds are not entirely new to me Once I ventured within the fence and spent one of the happiest and yet most melancholy hours of my life in walking under what I believed to be your window Emily enquired how long Valancourt had been in the neighbourhood Several days he replied It was my design to avail myself of the permission M saint Aubert had given me I scarcely know how to account for it but though I anxiously wished to do this my resolution always failed when the moment approached and I constantly deferred my visit I lodged in a village at some distance and wandered with my dogs among the scenes of this charming country wishing continually to meet you yet not daring to visit you Having thus continued to converse without perceiving the flight of time Valancourt at length seemed to recollect himself I must go said he mournfully but it is with the hope of seeing you again of being permitted to pay my respects to your family let me hear this hope confirmed by your voice My family will be happy to see any friend of my dear father said Emily Valancourt kissed her hand and still lingered unable to depart while Emily sat silently with her eyes bent on the ground and Valancourt as he gazed on her considered that it would soon be impossible for him to recall even to his memory the exact resemblance of the beautiful countenance he then beheld at this moment an hasty footstep approached from behind the plane tree and turning her eyes Emily saw Madame Cheron She felt a blush steal upon her cheek and her frame trembled with the emotion of her mind but she instantly rose to meet her visitor So niece said Madame Cheron casting a look of surprise and enquiry on Valancourt so niece how do you do But I need not ask your looks tell me you have already recovered your loss My looks do me injustice then Madame my loss I know can never be recovered Well well I will not argue with you I see you have exactly your father s disposition and let me tell you it would have been much happier for him poor man if it had been a different one A look of dignified displeasure with which Emily regarded Madame Cheron while she spoke would have touched almost any other heart she made no other reply but introduced Valancourt who could scarcely stifle the resentment he felt and whose bow Madame Cheron returned with a slight curtsy and a look of supercilious examination After a few moments he took leave of Emily in a manner that hastily expressed his pain both at his own departure and at leaving her to the society of Madame Cheron Who is that young man said her aunt in an accent which equally implied inquisitiveness and censure Some idle admirer of yours I suppose but I believed niece you had a greater sense of propriety than to have received the visits of any young man in your present unfriended situation Let me tell you the world will observe those things and it will talk aye and very freely too Emily extremely shocked at this coarse speech attempted to interrupt it but Madame Cheron would proceed with all the self importance of a person to whom power is new It is very necessary you should be under the eye of some person more able to guide you than yourself I indeed have not much leisure for such a task however since your poor father made it his last request that I should overlook your conduct I must even take you under my care But this let me tell you niece that unless you will determine to be very conformable to my direction I shall not trouble myself longer about you Emily made no attempt to interrupt Madame Cheron a second time grief and the pride of conscious innocence kept her silent till her aunt said I am now come to take you with me to Tholouse I am sorry to find that your poor father died after all in such indifferent circumstances however I shall take you home with me Ah poor man he was always more generous than provident or he would not have left his daughter dependent on his relations Nor has he done so I hope madam said Emily calmly nor did his pecuniary misfortunes arise from that noble generosity which always distinguished him The affairs of M de Motteville may I trust yet be settled without deeply injuring his creditors and in the meantime I should be very happy to remain at La Vallee No doubt you would replied Madame Cheron with a smile of irony and I shall no doubt consent to this since I see how necessary tranquillity and retirement are to restore your spirits I did not think you capable of so much duplicity niece when you pleaded this excuse for remaining here I foolishly believed it to be a just one nor expected to have found with you so agreeable a companion as this M La Val I forget his name Emily could no longer endure these cruel indignities It was a just one madam said she and now indeed I feel more than ever the value of the retirement I then solicited and if the purport of your visit is only to add insult to the sorrows of your brother s child she could well have spared it I see that I have undertaken a very troublesome task said Madame Cheron colouring highly I am sure madam said Emily mildly and endeavouring to restrain her tears I am sure my father did not mean it should be such I have the happiness to reflect that my conduct under his eye was such as he often delighted to approve It would be very painful to me to disobey the sister of such a parent and if you believe the task will really be so troublesome I must lament that it is yours Well niece fine speaking signifies little I am willing in consideration of my poor brother to overlook the impropriety of your late conduct and to try what your future will be Emily interrupted her to beg she would explain what was the impropriety she alluded to What impropriety why that of receiving the visits of a lover unknown to your family replied Madame Cheron not considering the impropriety of which she had herself been guilty in exposing her niece to the possibility of conduct so erroneous A faint blush passed over Emily s countenance pride and anxiety struggled in her breast and till she recollected that appearances did in some degree justify her aunt s suspicions she could not resolve to humble herself so far as to enter into the defence of a conduct which had been so innocent and undesigning on her part She mentioned the manner of Valancourt s introduction to her father the circumstances of his receiving the pistol shot and of their afterwards travelling together with the accidental way in which she had met him on the preceding evening She owned he had declared a partiality for her and that he had asked permission to address her family And who is this young adventurer pray said Madame Cheron and what are his pretensions These he must himself explain madam replied Emily Of his family my father was not ignorant and I believe it is unexceptionable She then proceeded to mention what she knew concerning it Oh then this it seems is a younger brother exclaimed her aunt and of course a beggar A very fine tale indeed And so my brother took a fancy to this young man after only a few days acquaintance but that was so like him In his youth he was always taking these likes and dislikes when no other person saw any reason for them at all nay indeed I have often thought the people he disapproved were much more agreeable than those he admired but there is no accounting for tastes He was always so much influenced by people s countenances now I for my part have no notion of this it is all ridiculous enthusiasm What has a man s face to do with his character Can a man of good character help having a disagreeable face which last sentence Madame Cheron delivered with the decisive air of a person who congratulates herself on having made a grand discovery and believes the question to be unanswerably settled Emily desirous of concluding the conversation enquired if her aunt would accept some refreshment and Madame Cheron accompanied her to the chateau but without desisting from a topic which she discussed with so much complacency to herself and severity to her niece I am sorry to perceive niece said she in allusion to somewhat that Emily had said concerning physiognomy that you have a great many of your father s prejudices and among them those sudden predilections for people from their looks I can perceive that you imagine yourself to be violently in love with this young adventurer after an acquaintance of only a few days There was something too so charmingly romantic in the manner of your meeting Emily checked the tears that trembled in her eyes while she said When my conduct shall deserve this severity madam you will do well to exercise it till then justice if not tenderness should surely restrain it I have never willingly offended you now I have lost my parents you are the only person to whom I can look for kindness Let me not lament more than ever the loss of such parents The last words were almost stifled by her emotions and she burst into tears Remembering the delicacy and the tenderness of saint Aubert the happy happy days she had passed in these scenes and contrasting them with the coarse and unfeeling behaviour of Madame Cheron and from the future hours of mortification she must submit to in her presence a degree of grief seized her that almost reached despair Madame Cheron more offended by the reproof which Emily s words conveyed than touched by the sorrow they expressed said nothing that might soften her grief but notwithstanding an apparent reluctance to receive her niece she desired her company The love of sway was her ruling passion and she knew it would be highly gratified by taking into her house a young orphan who had no appeal from her decisions and on whom she could exercise without controul the capricious humour of the moment On entering the chateau Madame Cheron expressed a desire that she would put up what she thought necessary to take to Tholouse as she meant to set off immediately Emily now tried to persuade her to defer the journey at least till the next day and at length with much difficulty prevailed The day passed in the exercise of petty tyranny on the part of Madame Cheron and in mournful regret and melancholy anticipation on that of Emily who when her aunt retired to her apartment for the night went to take leave of every other room in this her dear native home which she was now quitting for she knew not how long and for a world to which she was wholly a stranger She could not conquer a presentiment which frequently occurred to her this night that she should never more return to La Vallee Having passed a considerable time in what had been her father s study having selected some of his favourite authors to put up with her clothes and shed many tears as she wiped the dust from their covers she seated herself in his chair before the reading desk and sat lost in melancholy reflection till Theresa opened the door to examine as was her custom before she went to bed if was all safe She started on observing her young lady who bade her come in and then gave her some directions for keeping the chateau in readiness for her reception at all times Alas a day that you should leave it said Theresa I think you would be happier here than where you are going if one may judge Emily made no reply to this remark the sorrow Theresa proceeded to express at her departure affected her but she found some comfort in the simple affection of this poor old servant to whom she gave such directions as might best conduce to her comfort during her own absence Having dismissed Theresa to bed Emily wandered through every lonely apartment of the chateau lingering long in what had been her father s bed room indulging melancholy yet not unpleasing emotions and having often returned within the door to take another look at it she withdrew to her own chamber From her window she gazed upon the garden below shewn faintly by the moon rising over the tops of the palm trees and at length the calm beauty of the night increased a desire of indulging the mournful sweetness of bidding farewel to the beloved shades of her childhood till she was tempted to descend Throwing over her the light veil in which she usually walked she silently passed into the garden and hastening towards the distant groves was glad to breathe once more the air of liberty and to sigh unobserved The deep repose of the scene the rich scents that floated on the breeze the grandeur of the wide horizon and of the clear blue arch soothed and gradually elevated her mind to that sublime complacency which renders the vexations of this world so insignificant and mean in our eyes that we wonder they have had power for a moment to disturb us Emily forgot Madame Cheron and all the circumstances of her conduct while her thoughts ascended to the contemplation of those unnumbered worlds that lie scattered in the depths of aether thousands of them hid from human eyes and almost beyond the flight of human fancy As her imagination soared through the regions of space and aspired to that Great First Cause which pervades and governs all being the idea of her father scarcely ever left her but it was a pleasing idea since she resigned him to God in the full confidence of a pure and holy faith She pursued her way through the groves to the terrace often pausing as memory awakened the pang of affection and as reason anticipated the exile into which she was going And now the moon was high over the woods touching their summits with yellow light and darting between the foliage long level beams while on the rapid Garonne below the trembling radiance was faintly obscured by the lightest vapour Emily long watched the playing lustre listened to the soothing murmur of the current and the yet lighter sounds of the air as it stirred at intervals the lofty palm trees How delightful is the sweet breath of these groves said she This lovely scene how often shall I remember and regret it when I am far away Alas what events may occur before I see it again O peaceful happy shades scenes of my infant delights of parental tenderness now lost for ever why must I leave ye In your retreats I should still find safety and repose Sweet hours of my childhood I am now to leave even your last memorials No objects that would revive your impressions will remain for me Then drying her tears and looking up her thoughts rose again to the sublime subject she had contemplated the same divine complacency stole over her heart and hushing its throbs inspired hope and confidence and resignation to the will of the Deity whose works filled her mind with adoration Emily gazed long on the plane tree and then seated herself for the last time on the bench under its shade where she had so often sat with her parents and where only a few hours before she had conversed with Valancourt at the remembrance of whom thus revived a mingled sensation of esteem tenderness and anxiety rose in her breast With this remembrance occurred a recollection of his late confession that he had often wandered near her habitation in the night having even passed the boundary of the garden and it immediately occurred to her that he might be at this moment in the grounds The fear of meeting him particularly after the declaration he had made and of incurring a censure which her aunt might so reasonably bestow if it was known that she was met by her lover at this hour made her instantly leave her beloved plane tree and walk towards the chateau She cast an anxious eye around and often stopped for a moment to examine the shadowy scene before she ventured to proceed but she passed on without perceiving any person till having reached a clump of almond trees not far from the house she rested to take a retrospect of the garden and to sigh forth another adieu As her eyes wandered over the landscape she thought she perceived a person emerge from the groves and pass slowly along a moon light alley that led between them but the distance and the imperfect light would not suffer her to judge with any degree of certainty whether this was fancy or reality She continued to gaze for some time on the spot till on the dead stillness of the air she heard a sudden sound and in the next instant fancied she distinguished footsteps near her Wasting not another moment in conjecture she hurried to the chateau and having reached it retired to her chamber where as she closed her window she looked upon the garden and then again thought she distinguished a figure gliding between the almond trees she had just left She immediately withdrew from the casement and though much agitated sought in sleep the refreshment of a short oblivion CHAPTER XI I leave that flowery path for eye Of childhood where I sported many a day Warbling and sauntering carelessly along Where every face was innocent and gay Each vale romantic tuneful every tongue Sweet wild and artless all THE MINSTREL At an early hour the carriage which was to take Emily and Madame Cheron to Tholouse appeared at the door of the chateau and Madame was already in the breakfast room when her niece entered it The repast was silent and melancholy on the part of Emily and Madame Cheron whose vanity was piqued on observing her dejection reproved her in a manner that did not contribute to remove it It was with much reluctance that Emily s request to take with her the dog which had been a favourite of her father was granted Her aunt impatient to be gone ordered the carriage to draw up and while she passed to the hall door Emily gave another look into the library and another farewell glance over the garden and then followed Old Theresa stood at the door to take leave of her young lady God for ever keep you ma amselle said she while Emily gave her hand in silence and could answer only with a pressure of her hand and a forced smile At the gate which led out of the grounds several of her father s pensioners were assembled to bid her farewell to whom she would have spoken if her aunt would have suffered the driver to stop and having distributed to them almost all the money she had about her she sunk back in the carriage yielding to the melancholy of her heart Soon after she caught between the steep banks of the road another view of the chateau peeping from among the high trees and surrounded by green slopes and tufted groves the Garonne winding its way beneath their shades sometimes lost among the vineyards and then rising in greater majesty in the distant pastures The towering precipices of the Pyrenees that rose to the south gave Emily a thousand interesting recollections of her late journey and these objects of her former enthusiastic admiration now excited only sorrow and regret Having gazed on the chateau and its lovely scenery till the banks again closed upon them her mind became too much occupied by mournful reflections to permit her to attend to the conversation which Madame Cheron had begun on some trivial topic so that they soon travelled in profound silence Valancourt mean while was returned to Estuviere his heart occupied with the image of Emily sometimes indulging in reveries of future happiness but more frequently shrinking with dread of the opposition he might encounter from her family He was the younger son of an ancient family of Gascony and having lost his parents at an early period of his life the care of his education and of his small portion had devolved to his brother the Count de Duvarney his senior by nearly twenty years Valancourt had been educated in all the accomplishments of his age and had an ardour of spirit and a certain grandeur of mind that gave him particular excellence in the exercises then thought heroic His little fortune had been diminished by the necessary expences of his education but M La Valancourt the elder seemed to think that his genius and accomplishments would amply supply the deficiency of his inheritance They offered flattering hopes of promotion in the military profession in those times almost the only one in which a gentleman could engage without incurring a stain on his name and La Valancourt was of course enrolled in the army The general genius of his mind was but little understood by his brother That ardour for whatever is great and good in the moral world as well as in the natural one displayed itself in his infant years and the strong indignation which he felt and expressed at a criminal or a mean action sometimes drew upon him the displeasure of his tutor who reprobated it under the general term of violence of temper and who when haranguing on the virtues of mildness and moderation seemed to forget the gentleness and compassion which always appeared in his pupil towards objects of misfortune He had now obtained leave of absence from his regiment when he made the excursion into the Pyrenees which was the means of introducing him to saint Aubert and as this permission was nearly expired he was the more anxious to declare himself to Emily s family from whom he reasonably apprehended opposition since his fortune though with a moderate addition from hers it would be sufficient to support them would not satisfy the views either of vanity or ambition Valancourt was not without the latter but he saw golden visions of promotion in the army and believed that with Emily he could in the mean time be delighted to live within the limits of his humble income His thoughts were now occupied in considering the means of making himself known to her family to whom however he had yet no address for he was entirely ignorant of Emily s precipitate departure from La Vallee of whom he hoped to obtain it Meanwhile the travellers pursued their journey Emily making frequent efforts to appear cheerful and too often relapsing into silence and dejection Madame Cheron attributing her melancholy solely to the circumstance of her being removed to a distance from her lover and believing that the sorrow which her niece still expressed for the loss of saint Aubert proceeded partly from an affectation of sensibility endeavoured to make it appear ridiculous to her that such deep regret should continue to be felt so long after the period usually allowed for grief At length these unpleasant lectures were interrupted by the arrival of the travellers at Tholouse and Emily who had not been there for many years and had only a very faint recollection of it was surprised at the ostentatious style exhibited in her aunt s house and furniture the more so perhaps because it was so totally different from the modest elegance to which she had been accustomed She followed Madame Cheron through a large hall where several servants in rich liveries appeared to a kind of saloon fitted up with more shew than taste and her aunt complaining of fatigue ordered supper immediately I am glad to find myself in my own house again said she throwing herself on a large settee and to have my own people about me I detest travelling though indeed I ought to like it for what I see abroad always makes me delighted to return to my own chateau What makes you so silent child What is it that disturbs you now Emily suppressed a starting tear and tried to smile away the expression of an oppressed heart she was thinking of HER home and felt too sensibly the arrogance and ostentatious vanity of Madame Cheron s conversation Can this be my father s sister said she to herself and then the conviction that she was so warming her heart with something like kindness towards her she felt anxious to soften the harsh impression her mind had received of her aunt s character and to shew a willingness to oblige her The effort did not entirely fail she listened with apparent cheerfulness while Madame Cheron expatiated on the splendour of her house told of the numerous parties she entertained and what she should expect of Emily whose diffidence assumed the air of a reserve which her aunt believing it to be that of pride and ignorance united now took occasion to reprehend She knew nothing of the conduct of a mind that fears to trust its own powers which possessing a nice judgment and inclining to believe that every other person perceives still more critically fears to commit itself to censure and seeks shelter in the obscurity of silence Emily had frequently blushed at the fearless manners which she had seen admired and the brilliant nothings which she had heard applauded yet this applause so far from encouraging her to imitate the conduct that had won it rather made her shrink into the reserve that would protect her from such absurdity Madame Cheron looked on her niece s diffidence with a feeling very near to contempt and endeavoured to overcome it by reproof rather than to encourage it by gentleness The entrance of supper somewhat interrupted the complacent discourse of Madame Cheron and the painful considerations which it had forced upon Emily When the repast which was rendered ostentatious by the attendance of a great number of servants and by a profusion of plate was over Madame Cheron retired to her chamber and a female servant came to shew Emily to hers Having passed up a large stair case and through several galleries they came to a flight of back stairs which led into a short passage in a remote part of the chateau and there the servant opened the door of a small chamber which she said was Ma amselle Emily s who once more alone indulged the tears she had long tried to restrain Those who know from experience how much the heart becomes attached even to inanimate objects to which it has been long accustomed how unwillingly it resigns them how with the sensations of an old friend it meets them after temporary absence will understand the forlornness of Emily s feelings of Emily shut out from the only home she had known from her infancy and thrown upon a scene and among persons disagreeable for more qualities than their novelty Her father s favourite dog now in the chamber thus seemed to acquire the character and importance of a friend and as the animal fawned over her when she wept and licked her hands Ah poor Manchon said she I have nobody now to love me but you and she wept the more After some time her thoughts returning to her father s injunctions she remembered how often he had blamed her for indulging useless sorrow how often he had pointed out to her the necessity of fortitude and patience assuring her that the faculties of the mind strengthen by exertion till they finally unnerve affliction and triumph over it These recollections dried her tears gradually soothed her spirits and inspired her with the sweet emulation of practising precepts which her father had so frequently inculcated CHAPTER XII Some pow r impart the spear and shield At which the wizard passions fly By which the giant follies die COLLINS Madame Cheron s house stood at a little distance from the city of Tholouse and was surrounded by extensive gardens in which Emily who had risen early amused herself with wandering before breakfast From a terrace that extended along the highest part of them was a wide view over Languedoc On the distant horizon to the south she discovered the wild summits of the Pyrenees and her fancy immediately painted the green pastures of Gascony at their feet Her heart pointed to her peaceful home to the neighbourhood where Valancourt was where saint Aubert had been and her imagination piercing the veil of distance brought that home to her eyes in all its interesting and romantic beauty She experienced an inexpressible pleasure in believing that she beheld the country around it though no feature could be distinguished except the retiring chain of the Pyrenees and inattentive to the scene immediately before her and to the flight of time she continued to lean on the window of a pavilion that terminated the terrace with her eyes fixed on Gascony and her mind occupied with the interesting ideas which the view of it awakened till a servant came to tell her breakfast was ready Her thoughts thus recalled to the surrounding objects the straight walks square parterres and artificial fountains of the garden could not fail as she passed through it to appear the worse opposed to the negligent graces and natural beauties of the grounds of La Vallee upon which her recollection had been so intensely employed Whither have you been rambling so early said Madame Cheron as her niece entered the breakfast room I don t approve of these solitary walks and Emily was surprised when having informed her aunt that she had been no further than the gardens she understood these to be included in the reproof I desire you will not walk there again at so early an hour unattended said Madame Cheron my gardens are very extensive and a young woman who can make assignations by moon light at La Vallee is not to be trusted to her own inclinations elsewhere Emily extremely surprised and shocked had scarcely power to beg an explanation of these words and when she did her aunt absolutely refused to give it though by her severe looks and half sentences she appeared anxious to impress Emily with a belief that she was well informed of some degrading circumstances of her conduct Conscious innocence could not prevent a blush from stealing over Emily s cheek she trembled and looked confusedly under the bold eye of Madame Cheron who blushed also but hers was the blush of triumph such as sometimes stains the countenance of a person congratulating himself on the penetration which had taught him to suspect another and who loses both pity for the supposed criminal and indignation of his guilt in the gratification of his own vanity Emily not doubting that her aunt s mistake arose from the having observed her ramble in the garden on the night preceding her departure from La Vallee now mentioned the motive of it at which Madame Cheron smiled contemptuously refusing either to accept this explanation or to give her reasons for refusing it and soon after she concluded the subject by saying I never trust people s assertions I always judge of them by their actions but I am willing to try what will be your behaviour in future Emily less surprised by her aunt s moderation and mysterious silence than by the accusation she had received deeply considered the latter and scarcely doubted that it was Valancourt whom she had seen at night in the gardens of La Vallee and that he had been observed there by Madame Cheron who now passing from one painful topic only to revive another almost equally so spoke of the situation of her niece s property in the hands of M Motteville While she thus talked with ostentatious pity of Emily s misfortunes she failed not to inculcate the duties of humility and gratitude or to render Emily fully sensible of every cruel mortification who soon perceived that she was to be considered as a dependant not only by her aunt but by her aunt s servants She was now informed that a large party were expected to dinner on which account Madame Cheron repeated the lesson of the preceding night concerning her conduct in company and Emily wished that she might have courage enough to practise it Her aunt then proceeded to examine the simplicity of her dress adding that she expected to see her attired with gaiety and taste after which she condescended to shew Emily the splendour of her chateau and to point out the particular beauty or elegance which she thought distinguished each of her numerous suites of apartments She then withdrew to her toilet the throne of her homage and Emily to her chamber to unpack her books and to try to charm her mind by reading till the hour of dressing When the company arrived Emily entered the saloon with an air of timidity which all her efforts could not overcome and which was increased by the consciousness of Madame Cheron s severe observation Her mourning dress the mild dejection of her beautiful countenance and the retiring diffidence of her manner rendered her a very interesting object to many of the company among whom she distinguished Signor Montoni and his friend Cavigni the late visitors at M Quesnel s who now seemed to converse with Madame Cheron with the familiarity of old acquaintance and she to attend to them with particular pleasure This Signor Montoni had an air of conscious superiority animated by spirit and strengthened by talents to which every person seemed involuntarily to yield The quickness of his perceptions was strikingly expressed on his countenance yet that countenance could submit implicitly to occasion and more than once in this day the triumph of art over nature might have been discerned in it His visage was long and rather narrow yet he was called handsome and it was perhaps the spirit and vigour of his soul sparkling through his features that triumphed for him Emily felt admiration but not the admiration that leads to esteem for it was mixed with a degree of fear she knew not exactly wherefore Cavigni was gay and insinuating as formerly and though he paid almost incessant attention to Madame Cheron he found some opportunities of conversing with Emily to whom he directed at first the sallies of his wit but now and then assumed an air of tenderness which she observed and shrunk from Though she replied but little the gentleness and sweetness of her manners encouraged him to talk and she felt relieved when a young lady of the party who spoke incessantly obtruded herself on his notice This lady who possessed all the sprightliness of a Frenchwoman with all her coquetry affected to understand every subject or rather there was no affectation in the case for never looking beyond the limits of her own ignorance she believed she had nothing to learn She attracted notice from all amused some disgusted others for a moment and was then forgotten This day passed without any material occurrence and Emily though amused by the characters she had seen was glad when she could retire to the recollections which had acquired with her the character of duties A fortnight passed in a round of dissipation and company and Emily who attended Madame Cheron in all her visits was sometimes entertained but oftener wearied She was struck by the apparent talents and knowledge displayed in the various conversations she listened to and it was long before she discovered that the talents were for the most part those of imposture and the knowledge nothing more than was necessary to assist them But what deceived her most was the air of constant gaiety and good spirits displayed by every visitor and which she supposed to arise from content as constant and from benevolence as ready At length from the over acting of some less accomplished than the others she could perceive that though contentment and benevolence are the only sure sources of cheerfulness the immoderate and feverish animation usually exhibited in large parties results partly from an insensibility to the cares which benevolence must sometimes derive from the sufferings of others and partly from a desire to display the appearance of that prosperity which they know will command submission and attention to themselves Emily s pleasantest hours were passed in the pavilion of the terrace to which she retired when she could steal from observation with a book to overcome or a lute to indulge her melancholy There as she sat with her eyes fixed on the far distant Pyrenees and her thoughts on Valancourt and the beloved scenes of Gascony she would play the sweet and melancholy songs of her native province the popular songs she had listened to from her childhood One evening having excused herself from accompanying her aunt abroad she thus withdrew to the pavilion with books and her lute It was the mild and beautiful evening of a sultry day and the windows which fronted the west opened upon all the glory of a setting sun Its rays illuminated with strong splendour the cliffs of the Pyrenees and touched their snowy tops with a roseate hue that remained long after the sun had sunk below the horizon and the shades of twilight had stolen over the landscape Emily touched her lute with that fine melancholy expression which came from her heart The pensive hour and the scene the evening light on the Garonne that flowed at no great distance and whose waves as they passed towards La Vallee she often viewed with a sigh these united circumstances disposed her mind to tenderness and her thoughts were with Valancourt of whom she had heard nothing since her arrival at Tholouse and now that she was removed from him and in uncertainty she perceived all the interest he held in her heart Before she saw Valancourt she had never met a mind and taste so accordant with her own and though Madame Cheron told her much of the arts of dissimulation and that the elegance and propriety of thought which she so much admired in her lover were assumed for the purpose of pleasing her she could scarcely doubt their truth This possibility however faint as it was was sufficient to harass her mind with anxiety and she found that few conditions are more painful than that of uncertainty as to the merit of a beloved object an uncertainty which she would not have suffered had her confidence in her own opinions been greater She was awakened from her musing by the sound of horses feet along a road that wound under the windows of the pavilion and a gentleman passed on horseback whose resemblance to Valancourt in air and figure for the twilight did not permit a view of his features immediately struck her She retired hastily from the lattice fearing to be seen yet wishing to observe further while the stranger passed on without looking up and when she returned to the lattice she saw him faintly through the twilight winding under the high trees that led to Tholouse This little incident so much disturbed her spirits that the temple and its scenery were no longer interesting to her and after walking awhile on the terrace she returned to the chateau Madame Cheron whether she had seen a rival admired had lost at play or had witnessed an entertainment more splendid than her own was returned from her visit with a temper more than usually discomposed and Emily was glad when the hour arrived in which she could retire to the solitude of her own apartment On the following morning she was summoned to Madame Cheron whose countenance was inflamed with resentment and as Emily advanced she held out a letter to her Do you know this hand said she in a severe tone and with a look that was intended to search her heart while Emily examined the letter attentively and assured her that she did not Do not provoke me said her aunt you do know it confess the truth immediately I insist upon your confessing the truth instantly Emily was silent and turned to leave the room but Madame called her back O you are guilty then said she you do know the hand If you was before in doubt of this madam replied Emily calmly why did you accuse me of having told a falsehood Madame Cheron did not blush but her niece did a moment after when she heard the name of Valancourt It was not however with the consciousness of deserving reproof for if she ever had seen his hand writing the present characters did not bring it to her recollection It is useless to deny it said Madame Cheron I see in your countenance that you are no stranger to this letter and I dare say you have received many such from this impertinent young man without my knowledge in my own house Emily shocked at the indelicacy of this accusation still more than by the vulgarity of the former instantly forgot the pride that had imposed silence and endeavoured to vindicate herself from the aspersion but Madame Cheron was not to be convinced I cannot suppose she resumed that this young man would have taken the liberty of writing to me if you had not encouraged him to do so and I must now You will allow me to remind you madam said Emily timidly of some particulars of a conversation we had at La Vallee I then told you truly that I had only not forbade Monsieur Valancourt from addressing my family I will not be interrupted said Madame Cheron interrupting her niece I was going to say I I have forgot what I was going to say But how happened it that you did not forbid him Emily was silent How happened it that you encouraged him to trouble me with this letter A young man that nobody knows an utter stranger in the place a young adventurer no doubt who is looking out for a good fortune However on that point he has mistaken his aim His family was known to my father said Emily modestly and without appearing to be sensible of the last sentence O that is no recommendation at all replied her aunt with her usual readiness upon this topic he took such strange fancies to people He was always judging persons by their countenances and was continually deceived Yet it was but now madam that you judged me guilty by my countenance said Emily with a design of reproving Madame Cheron to which she was induced by this disrespectful mention of her father I called you here resumed her aunt colouring to tell you that I will not be disturbed in my own house by any letters or visits from young men who may take a fancy to flatter you This M de Valantine I think you call him has the impertinence to beg I will permit him to pay his respects to me I shall send him a proper answer And for you Emily I repeat it once for all if you are not contented to conform to my directions and to my way of live I shall give up the task of overlooking your conduct I shall no longer trouble myself with your education but shall send you to board in a convent Dear madam said Emily bursting into tears and overcome by the rude suspicions her aunt had expressed how have I deserved these reproofs She could say no more and so very fearful was she of acting with any degree of impropriety in the affair itself that at the present moment Madame Cheron might perhaps have prevailed with her to bind herself by a promise to renounce Valancourt for ever Her mind weakened by her terrors would no longer suffer her to view him as she had formerly done she feared the error of her own judgment not that of Madame Cheron and feared also that in her former conversation with him at La Vallee she had not conducted herself with sufficient reserve She knew that she did not deserve the coarse suspicions which her aunt had thrown out but a thousand scruples rose to torment her such as would never have disturbed the peace of Madame Cheron Thus rendered anxious to avoid every opportunity of erring and willing to submit to any restrictions that her aunt should think proper she expressed an obedience to which Madame Cheron did not give much confidence and which she seemed to consider as the consequence of either fear or artifice Well then said she promise me that you will neither see this young man nor write to him without my consent Dear madam replied Emily can you suppose I would do either unknown to you I don t know what to suppose there is no knowing how young women will act It is difficult to place any confidence in them for they have seldom sense enough to wish for the respect of the world Alas madam said Emily I am anxious for my own respect my father taught me the value of that he said if I deserved my own esteem that the world would follow of course My brother was a good kind of a man replied Madame Cheron but he did not know the world I am sure I have always felt a proper respect for myself yet she stopped but she might have added that the world had not always shewn respect to her and this without impeaching its judgment Well resumed Madame Cheron you have not give me the promise though that I demand Emily readily gave it and being then suffered to withdraw she walked in the garden tried to compose her spirits and at length arrived at her favourite pavilion at the end of the terrace where seating herself at one of the embowered windows that opened upon a balcony the stillness and seclusion of the scene allowed her to recollect her thoughts and to arrange them so as to form a clearer judgment of her former conduct She endeavoured to review with exactness all the particulars of her conversation with Valancourt at La Vallee had the satisfaction to observe nothing that could alarm her delicate pride and thus to be confirmed in the self esteem which was so necessary to her peace Her mind then became tranquil and she saw Valancourt amiable and intelligent as he had formerly appeared and Madame Cheron neither the one or the other The remembrance of her lover however brought with it many very painful emotions for it by no means reconciled her to the thought of resigning him and Madame Cheron having already shewn how highly she disapproved of the attachment she foresaw much suffering from the opposition of interests yet with all this was mingled a degree of delight which in spite of reason partook of hope She determined however that no consideration should induce her to permit a clandestine correspondence and to observe in her conversation with Valancourt should they ever meet again the same nicety of reserve which had hitherto marked her conduct As she repeated the words should we ever meet again she shrunk as if this was a circumstance which had never before occurred to her and tears came to her eyes which she hastily dried for she heard footsteps approaching and then the door of the pavilion open and on turning she saw Valancourt An emotion of mingled pleasure surprise and apprehension pressed so suddenly upon her heart as almost to overcome her spirits the colour left her cheeks then returned brighter than before and she was for a moment unable to speak or to rise from her chair His countenance was the mirror in which she saw her own emotions reflected and it roused her to self command The joy which had animated his features when he entered the pavilion was suddenly repressed as approaching he perceived her agitation and in a tremulous voice enquired after her health Recovered from her first surprise she answered him with a tempered smile but a variety of opposite emotions still assailed her heart and struggled to subdue the mild dignity of her manner It was difficult to tell which predominated the joy of seeing Valancourt or the terror of her aunt s displeasure when she should hear of this meeting After some short and embarrassed conversation she led him into the gardens and enquired if he had seen Madame Cheron No said he I have not yet seen her for they told me she was engaged and as soon as I learned that you were in the gardens I came hither He paused a moment in great agitation and then added May I venture to tell you the purport of my visit without incurring your displeasure and to hope that you will not accuse me of precipitation in now availing myself of the permission you once gave me of addressing your family Emily who knew not what to reply was spared from further perplexity and was sensible only of fear when on raising her eyes she saw Madame Cheron turn into the avenue As the consciousness of innocence returned this fear was so far dissipated as to permit her to appear tranquil and instead of avoiding her aunt she advanced with Valancourt to meet her The look of haughty and impatient displeasure with which Madame Cheron regarded them made Emily shrink who understood from a single glance that this meeting was believed to have been more than accidental having mentioned Valancourt s name she became again too much agitated to remain with them and returned into the chateau where she awaited long in a state of trembling anxiety the conclusion of the conference She knew not how to account for Valancourt s visit to her aunt before he had received the permission he solicited since she was ignorant of a circumstance which would have rendered the request useless even if Madame Cheron had been inclined to grant it Valancourt in the agitation of his spirits had forgotten to date his letter so that it was impossible for Madame Cheron to return an answer and when he recollected this circumstance he was perhaps not so sorry for the omission as glad of the excuse it allowed him for waiting on her before she could send a refusal Madame Cheron had a long conversation with Valancourt and when she returned to the chateau her countenance expressed ill humour but not the degree of severity which Emily had apprehended I have dismissed this young man at last said she and I hope my house will never again be disturbed with similar visits He assures me that your interview was not preconcerted Dear madam said Emily in extreme emotion you surely did not ask him the question Most certainly I did you could not suppose I should be so imprudent as to neglect it Good God exclaimed Emily what an opinion must he form of me since you Madam could express a suspicion of such ill conduct It is of very little consequence what opinion he may form of you replied her aunt for I have put an end to the affair but I believe he will not form a worse opinion of me for my prudent conduct I let him see that I was not to be trifled with and that I had more delicacy than to permit any clandestine correspondence to be carried on in my house Emily had frequently heard Madame Cheron use the word delicacy but she was now more than usually perplexed to understand how she meant to apply it in this instance in which her whole conduct appeared to merit the very reverse of the term It was very inconsiderate of my brother resumed Madame Cheron to leave the trouble of overlooking your conduct to me I wish you was well settled in life But if I find that I am to be further troubled with such visitors as this M Valancourt I shall place you in a convent at once so remember the alternative This young man has the impertinence to own to me he owns it that his fortune is very small and that he is chiefly dependent on an elder brother and on the profession he has chosen He should have concealed these circumstances at least if he expected to succeed with me Had he the presumption to suppose I would marry my niece to a person such as he describes himself Emily dried her tears when she heard of the candid confession of Valancourt and though the circumstances it discovered were afflicting to her hopes his artless conduct gave her a degree of pleasure that overcame every other emotion But she was compelled even thus early in life to observe that good sense and noble integrity are not always sufficient to cope with folly and narrow cunning and her heart was pure enough to allow her even at this trying moment to look with more pride on the defeat of the former than with mortification on the conquests of the latter Madame Cheron pursued her triumph He has also thought proper to tell me that he will receive his dismission from no person but yourself this favour however I have absolutely refused him He shall learn that it is quite sufficient that I disapprove him And I take this opportunity of repeating that if you concert any means of interview unknown to me you shall leave my house immediately How little do you know me madam that you should think such an injunction necessary said Emily trying to suppress her emotion how little of the dear parents who educated me Madame Cheron now went to dress for an engagement which she had made for the evening and Emily who would gladly have been excused from attending her aunt did not ask to remain at home lest her request should be attributed to an improper motive When she retired to her own room the little fortitude which had supported her in the presence of her relation forsook her she remembered only that Valancourt whose character appeared more amiable from every circumstance that unfolded it was banished from her presence perhaps for ever and she passed the time in weeping which according to her aunt s direction she ought to have employed in dressing This important duty was however quickly dispatched though when she joined Madame Cheron at table her eyes betrayed that she had been in tears and drew upon her a severe reproof Her efforts to appear cheerful did not entirely fail when she joined the company at the house of Madame Clairval an elderly widow lady who had lately come to reside at Tholouse on an estate of her late husband She had lived many years at Paris in a splendid style had naturally a gay temper and since her residence at Tholouse had given some of the most magnificent entertainments that had been seen in that neighbourhood These excited not only the envy but the trifling ambition of Madame Cheron who since she could not rival the splendour of her festivities was desirous of being ranked in the number of her most intimate friends For this purpose she paid her the most obsequious attention and made a point of being disengaged whenever she received an invitation from Madame Clairval of whom she talked wherever she went and derived much self consequence from impressing a belief on her general acquaintance that they were on the most familiar footing The entertainments of this evening consisted of a ball and supper it was a fancy ball and the company danced in groups in the gardens which were very extensive The high and luxuriant trees under which the groups assembled were illuminated with a profusion of lamps disposed with taste and fancy The gay and various dresses of the company some of whom were seated on the turf conversing at their ease observing the cotillons taking refreshments and sometimes touching sportively a guitar the gallant manners of the gentlemen the exquisitely capricious air of the ladies the light fantastic steps of their dances the musicians with the lute the hautboy and the tabor seated at the foot of an elm and the sylvan scenery of woods around were circumstances that unitedly formed a characteristic and striking picture of French festivity Emily surveyed the gaiety of the scene with a melancholy kind of pleasure and her emotion may be imagined when as she stood with her aunt looking at one of the groups she perceived Valancourt saw him dancing with a young and beautiful lady saw him conversing with her with a mixture of attention and familiarity such as she had seldom observed in his manner She turned hastily from the scene and attempted to draw away Madame Cheron who was conversing with Signor Cavigni and neither perceived Valancourt or was willing to be interrupted A faintness suddenly came over Emily and unable to support herself she sat down on a turf bank beneath the trees where several other persons were seated One of these observing the extreme paleness of her countenance enquired if she was ill and begged she would allow him to fetch her a glass of water for which politeness she thanked him but did not accept it Her apprehension lest Valancourt should observe her emotion made her anxious to overcome it and she succeeded so far as to re compose her countenance Madame Cheron was still conversing with Cavigni and the Count Bauvillers who had addressed Emily made some observations upon the scene to which she answered almost unconsciously for her mind was still occupied with the idea of Valancourt to whom it was with extreme uneasiness that she remained so near Some remarks however which the Count made upon the dance obliged her to turn her eyes towards it and at that moment Valancourt s met hers Her colour faded again she felt that she was relapsing into faintness and instantly averted her looks but not before she had observed the altered countenance of Valancourt on perceiving her She would have left the spot immediately had she not been conscious that this conduct would have shewn him more obviously the interest he held in her heart and having tried to attend to the Count s conversation and to join in it she at length recovered her spirits But when he made some observation on Valancourt s partner the fear of shewing that she was interested in the remark would have betrayed it to him had not the Count while he spoke looked towards the person of whom he was speaking The lady said he dancing with that young Chevalier who appears to be accomplished in every thing but in dancing is ranked among the beauties of Tholouse She is handsome and her fortune will be very large I hope she will make a better choice in a partner for life than she has done in a partner for the dance for I observe he has just put the set into great confusion he does nothing but commit blunders I am surprised that with his air and figure he has not taken more care to accomplish himself in dancing Emily whose heart trembled at every word that was now uttered endeavoured to turn the conversation from Valancourt by enquiring the name of the lady with whom he danced but before the Count could reply the dance concluded and Emily perceiving that Valancourt was coming towards her rose and joined Madame Cheron Here is the Chevalier Valancourt madam said she in a whisper pray let us go Her aunt immediately moved on but not before Valancourt had reached them who bowed lowly to Madame Cheron and with an earnest and dejected look to Emily with whom notwithstanding all her effort an air of more than common reserve prevailed The presence of Madame Cheron prevented Valancourt from remaining and he passed on with a countenance whose melancholy reproached her for having increased it Emily was called from the musing fit into which she had fallen by the Count Bauvillers who was known to her aunt I have your pardon to beg ma amselle said he for a rudeness which you will readily believe was quite unintentional I did not know that the Chevalier was your acquaintance when I so freely criticised his dancing Emily blushed and smiled and Madame Cheron spared her the difficulty of replying If you mean the person who has just passed us said she I can assure you he is no acquaintance of either mine or ma amselle saint Aubert s I know nothing of him O that is the Chevalier Valancourt said Cavigni carelessly and looking back You know him then said Madame Cheron I am not acquainted with him replied Cavigni You don t know then the reason I have to call him impertinent he has had the presumption to admire my niece If every man deserves the title of impertinent who admires ma amselle saint Aubert replied Cavigni I fear there are a great many impertinents and I am willing to acknowledge myself one of the number O Signor said Madame Cheron with an affected smile I perceive you have learnt the art of complimenting since you came into France But it is cruel to compliment children since they mistake flattery for truth Cavigni turned away his face for a moment and then said with a studied air Whom then are we to compliment madam for it would be absurd to compliment a woman of refined understanding SHE is above all praise As he finished the sentence he gave Emily a sly look and the smile that had lurked in his eye stole forth She perfectly understood it and blushed for Madame Cheron who replied You are perfectly right signor no woman of understanding can endure compliment I have heard Signor Montoni say rejoined Cavigni that he never knew but one woman who deserved it Well exclaimed Madame Cheron with a short laugh and a smile of unutterable complacency and who could she be O replied Cavigni it is impossible to mistake her for certainly there is not more than one woman in the world who has both the merit to deserve compliment and the wit to refuse it Most women reverse the case entirely He looked again at Emily who blushed deeper than before for her aunt and turned from him with displeasure Well signor said Madame Cheron I protest you are a Frenchman I never heard a foreigner say any thing half so gallant as that True madam said the Count who had been some time silent and with a low bow but the gallantry of the compliment had been utterly lost but for the ingenuity that discovered the application Madame Cheron did not perceive the meaning of this too satirical sentence and she therefore escaped the pain which Emily felt on her account O here comes Signor Montoni himself said her aunt I protest I will tell him all the fine things you have been saying to me The Signor however passed at this moment into another walk Pray who is it that has so much engaged your friend this evening asked Madame Cheron with an air of chagrin I have not seen him once He had a very particular engagement with the Marquis La Riviere replied Cavigni which has detained him I perceive till this moment or he would have done himself the honour of paying his respects to you madam sooner as he commissioned me to say But I know not how it is your conversation is so fascinating that it can charm even memory I think or I should certainly have delivered my friend s apology before The apology sir would have been more satisfactory from himself said Madame Cheron whose vanity was more mortified by Montoni s neglect than flattered by Cavigni s compliment Her manner at this moment and Cavigni s late conversation now awakened a suspicion in Emily s mind which notwithstanding that some recollections served to confirm it appeared preposterous She thought she perceived that Montoni was paying serious addresses to her aunt and that she not only accepted them but was jealously watchful of any appearance of neglect on his part That Madame Cheron at her years should elect a second husband was ridiculous though her vanity made it not impossible but that Montoni with his discernment his figure and pretensions should make a choice of Madame Cheron appeared most wonderful Her thoughts however did not dwell long on the subject nearer interests pressed upon them Valancourt rejected of her aunt and Valancourt dancing with a gay and beautiful partner alternately tormented her mind As she passed along the gardens she looked timidly forward half fearing and half hoping that he might appear in the crowd and the disappointment she felt on not seeing him told her that she had hoped more than she had feared Montoni soon after joined the party He muttered over some short speech about regret for having been so long detained elsewhere when he knew he should have the pleasure of seeing Madame Cheron here and she receiving the apology with the air of a pettish girl addressed herself entirely to Cavigni who looked archly at Montoni as if he would have said I will not triumph over you too much I will have the goodness to bear my honours meekly but look sharp Signor or I shall certainly run away with your prize The supper was served in different pavilions in the gardens as well as in one large saloon of the chateau and with more of taste than either of splendour or even of plenty Madame Cheron and her party supped with Madame Clairval in the saloon and Emily with difficulty disguised her emotion when she saw Valancourt placed at the same table with herself There Madame Cheron having surveyed him with high displeasure said to some person who sat next to her Pray who IS that young man It is the Chevalier Valancourt was the answer Yes I am not ignorant of his name but who is this Chevalier Valancourt that thus intrudes himself at this table The attention of the person who whom she spoke was called off before she received a second reply The table at which they sat was very long and Valancourt being seated with his partner near the bottom and Emily near the top the distance between them may account for his not immediately perceiving her She avoided looking to that end of the table but whenever her eyes happened to glance towards it she observed him conversing with his beautiful companion and the observation did not contribute to restore her peace any more than the accounts she heard of the fortune and accomplishments of this same lady Madame Cheron to whom these remarks were sometimes addressed because they supported topics for trivial conversation seemed indefatigable in her attempts to depreciate Valancourt towards whom she felt all the petty resentment of a narrow pride I admire the lady said she but I must condemn her choice of a partner Oh the Chevalier Valancourt is one of the most accomplished young men we have replied the lady to whom this remark was addressed it is whispered that Mademoiselle D Emery and her large fortune are to be his Impossible exclaimed Madame Cheron reddening with vexation it is impossible that she can be so destitute of taste he has so little the air of a person of condition that if I did not see him at the table of Madame Clairval I should never have suspected him to be one I have besides particular reasons for believing the report to be erroneous I cannot doubt the truth of it replied the lady gravely disgusted by the abrupt contradiction she had received concerning her opinion of Valancourt s merit You will perhaps doubt it said Madame Cheron when I assure you that it was only this morning that I rejected his suit This was said without any intention of imposing the meaning it conveyed but simply from a habit of considering herself to be the most important person in every affair that concerned her niece and because literally she had rejected Valancourt Your reasons are indeed such as cannot be doubted replied the lady with an ironical smile Any more than the discernment of the Chevalier Valancourt added Cavigni who stood by the chair of Madame Cheron and had heard her arrogate to herself as he thought a distinction which had been paid to her niece His discernment MAY be justly questioned Signor said Madame Cheron who was not flattered by what she understood to be an encomium on Emily Alas exclaimed Cavigni surveying Madame Cheron with affected ecstasy how vain is that assertion while that face that shape that air combine to refute it Unhappy Valancourt his discernment has been his destruction Emily looked surprised and embarrassed the lady who had lately spoke astonished and Madame Cheron who though she did not perfectly understand this speech was very ready to believe herself complimented by it said smilingly O Signor you are very gallant but those who hear you vindicate the Chevalier s discernment will suppose that I am the object of it They cannot doubt it replied Cavigni bowing low And would not that be very mortifying Signor Unquestionably it would said Cavigni I cannot endure the thought said Madame Cheron It is not to be endured replied Cavigni What can be done to prevent so humiliating a mistake rejoined Madame Cheron Alas I cannot assist you replied Cavigni with a deliberating air Your only chance of refuting the calumny and of making people understand what you wish them to believe is to persist in your first assertion for when they are told of the Chevalier s want of discernment it is possible they may suppose he never presumed to distress you with his admiration But then again that diffidence which renders you so insensible to your own perfections they will consider this and Valancourt s taste will not be doubted though you arraign it In short they will in spite of your endeavours continue to believe what might very naturally have occurred to them without any hint of mine that the Chevalier has taste enough to admire a beautiful woman All this is very distressing said Madame Cheron with a profound sigh May I be allowed to ask what is so distressing said Madame Clairval who was struck with the rueful countenance and doleful accent with which this was delivered It is a delicate subject replied Madame Cheron a very mortifying one to me I am concerned to hear it said Madame Clairval I hope nothing has occurred this evening particularly to distress you Alas yes within this half hour and I know not where the report may end my pride was never so shocked before but I assure you the report is totally void of foundation Good God exclaimed Madame Clairval what can be done Can you point out any way by which I can assist or console you The only way by which you can do either replied Madame Cheron is to contradict the report wherever you go Well but pray inform me what I am to contradict It is so very humiliating that I know not how to mention it continued Madame Cheron but you shall judge Do you observe that young man seated near the bottom of the table who is conversing with Mademoiselle D Emery Yes I perceive whom you mean You observe how little he has the air of a person of condition I was saying just now that I should not have thought him a gentleman if I had not seen him at this table Well but the report said Madame Clairval let me understand the subject of your distress Ah the subject of my distress replied Madame Cheron this person whom nobody knows I beg pardon madam I did not consider what I said this impertinent young man having had the presumption to address my niece has I fear given rise to a report that he had declared himself my admirer Now only consider how very mortifying such a report must be You I know will feel for my situation A woman of my condition think how degrading even the rumour of such an alliance must be Degrading indeed my poor friend said Madame Clairval You may rely upon it I will contradict the report wherever I go as she said which she turned her attention upon another part of the company and Cavigni who had hitherto appeared a grave spectator of the scene now fearing he should be unable to smother the laugh that convulsed him walked abruptly away I perceive you do not know said the lady who sat near Madame Cheron that the gentleman you have been speaking of is Madame Clairval s nephew Impossible exclaimed Madame Cheron who now began to perceive that she had been totally mistaken in her judgment of Valancourt and to praise him aloud with as much servility as she had before censured him with frivolous malignity Emily who during the greater part of this conversation had been so absorbed in thought as to be spared the pain of hearing it was now extremely surprised by her aunt s praise of Valancourt with whose relationship to Madame Clairval she was unacquainted but she was not sorry when Madame Cheron who though she now tried to appear unconcerned was really much embarrassed prepared to withdraw immediately after supper Montoni then came to hand Madame Cheron to her carriage and Cavigni with an arch solemnity of countenance followed with Emily who as she wished them good night and drew up the glass saw Valancourt among the crowd at the gates Before the carriage drove off he disappeared Madame Cheron forbore to mention him to Emily and as soon as they reached the chateau they separated for the night On the following morning as Emily sat at breakfast with her aunt a letter was brought to her of which she knew the handwriting upon the cover and as she received it with a trembling hand Madame Cheron hastily enquired from whom it came Emily with her leave broke the seal and observing the signature of Valancourt gave it unread to her aunt who received it with impatience and as she looked it over Emily endeavoured to read on her countenance its contents Having returned the letter to her niece whose eyes asked if she might examine it Yes read it child said Madame Cheron in a manner less severe than she had expected and Emily had perhaps never before so willingly obeyed her aunt In this letter Valancourt said little of the interview of the preceding day but concluded with declaring that he would accept his dismission from Emily only and with entreating that she would allow him to wait upon her on the approaching evening When she read this she was astonished at the moderation of Madame Cheron and looked at her with timid expectation as she said sorrowfully What am I to say madam Why we must see the young man I believe replied her aunt and hear what he has further to say for himself You may tell him he may come Emily dared scarcely credit what she heard Yet stay added Madame Cheron I will tell him so myself She called for pen and ink Emily still not daring to trust the emotions she felt and almost sinking beneath them Her surprise would have been less had she overheard on the preceding evening what Madame Cheron had not forgotten that Valancourt was the nephew of Madame Clairval What were the particulars of her aunt s note Emily did not learn but the result was a visit from Valancourt in the evening whom Madame Cheron received alone and they had a long conversation before Emily was called down When she entered the room her aunt was conversing with complacency and she saw the eyes of Valancourt as he impatiently rose animated with hope We have been talking over this affair said Madame Cheron the chevalier has been telling me that the late Monsieur Clairval was the brother of the Countess de Duvarney his mother I only wish he had mentioned his relationship to Madame Clairval before I certainly should have considered that circumstance as a sufficient introduction to my house Valancourt bowed and was going to address Emily but her aunt prevented him I have therefore consented that you shall receive his visits and though I will not bind myself by any promise or say that I shall consider him as my nephew yet I shall permit the intercourse and shall look forward to any further connection as an event which may possibly take place in a course of years provided the chevalier rises in his profession or any circumstance occurs which may make it prudent for him to take a wife But Mons Valancourt will observe and you too Emily that till that happens I positively forbid any thoughts of marrying Emily s countenance during this coarse speech varied every instant and towards its conclusion her distress had so much increased that she was on the point of leaving the room Valancourt meanwhile scarcely less embarrassed did not dare to look at her for whom he was thus distressed but when Madame Cheron was silent he said Flattering madam as your approbation is to me highly as I am honoured by it I have yet so much to fear that I scarcely dare to hope Pray sir explain yourself said Madame Cheron an unexpected requisition which embarrassed Valancourt again and almost overcame him with confusion at circumstances on which had he been only a spectator of the scene he would have smiled Till I receive Mademoiselle saint Aubert s permission to accept your indulgence said he falteringly till she allows me to hope O is that all interrupted Madame Cheron Well I will take upon me to answer for her But at the same time sir give me leave to observe to you that I am her guardian and that I expect in every instance that my will is hers As she said this she rose and quitted the room leaving Emily and Valancourt in a state of mutual embarrassment and when Valancourt s hopes enabled him to overcome his fears and to address her with the zeal and sincerity so natural to him it was a considerable time before she was sufficiently recovered to hear with distinctness his solicitations and inquiries The conduct of Madame Cheron in this affair had been entirely governed by selfish vanity Valancourt in his first interview had with great candour laid open to her the true state of his present circumstances and his future expectancies and she with more prudence than humanity had absolutely and abruptly rejected his suit She wished her niece to marry ambitiously not because she desired to see her in possession of the happiness which rank and wealth are usually believed to bestow but because she desired to partake the importance which such an alliance would give When therefore she discovered that Valancourt was the nephew of a person of so much consequence as Madame Clairval she became anxious for the connection since the prospect it afforded of future fortune and distinction for Emily promised the exaltation she coveted for herself Her calculations concerning fortune in this alliance were guided rather by her wishes than by any hint of Valancourt or strong appearance of probability and when she rested her expectation on the wealth of Madame Clairval she seemed totally to have forgotten that the latter had a daughter Valancourt however had not forgotten this circumstance and the consideration of it had made him so modest in his expectations from Madame Clairval that he had not even named the relationship in his first conversation with Madame Cheron But whatever might be the future fortune of Emily the present distinction which the connection would afford for herself was certain since the splendour of Madame Clairval s establishment was such as to excite the general envy and partial imitation of the neighbourhood Thus had she consented to involve her niece in an engagement to which she saw only a distant and uncertain conclusion with as little consideration of her happiness as when she had so precipitately forbade it for though she herself possessed the means of rendering this union not only certain but prudent yet to do so was no part of her present intention From this period Valancourt made frequent visits to Madame Cheron and Emily passed in his society the happiest hours she had known since the death of her father They were both too much engaged by the present moments to give serious consideration to the future They loved and were beloved and saw not that the very attachment which formed the delight of their present days might possibly occasion the sufferings of years Meanwhile Madame Cheron s intercourse with Madame Clairval became more frequent than before and her vanity was already gratified by the opportunity of proclaiming wherever she went the attachment that subsisted between their nephew and niece Montoni was now also become a daily guest at the chateau and Emily was compelled to observe that he really was a suitor and a favoured suitor to her aunt Thus passed the winter months not only in peace but in happiness to Valancourt and Emily the station of his regiment being so near Tholouse as to allow this frequent intercourse The pavilion on the terrace was the favourite scene of their interviews and there Emily with Madame Cheron would work while Valancourt read aloud works of genius and taste listened to her enthusiasm expressed his own and caught new opportunities of observing that their minds were formed to constitute the happiness of each other the same taste the same noble and benevolent sentiments animating each CHAPTER XIII As when a shepherd of the Hebrid Isles Placed far amid the melancholy main

none	none	 Madame Cheron s avarice at length yielded to her vanity 
3356-132542-0002	train-other-500	Some very splendid entertainments which Madame Clairval had given and the general adulation which was paid her made the former more anxious than before to secure an alliance that would so much exalt her in her own opinion and in that of the world
3356-132542-0003	train-other-500	She proposed terms for the immediate marriage of her niece and offered to give Emily a dower provided Madame Clairval observed equal terms on the part of her nephew Madame Clairval listened to the proposal
3356-132542-0004	train-other-500	and considering that Emily was the apparent heiress of her aunt s wealth accepted it Meanwhile Emily knew nothing of the transaction till Madame Cheron informed her that she must make preparation for the nuptials which would be celebrated without further delay
3356-132542-0005	train-other-500	then astonished and wholly unable to account for this sudden conclusion which Valancourt had not solicited for he was ignorant of what had passed between the elder ladies and had not dared to hope such good fortune she decisively objected to it
3356-132542-0006	train-other-500	Madame Cheron however quite as jealous of contradiction now as she had been formerly contended for a speedy marriage with as much vehemence as she had formerly opposed whatever had the most remote possibility of leading to it
3356-132542-0007	train-other-500	and Emily s scruples disappeared when she again saw Valancourt who was now informed of the happiness designed for him and came to claim a promise of it from herself While preparations were making for these nuptials
none	none	 Montoni became the acknowledged lover of Madame Cheron 
3356-132542-0008	train-other-500	and though Madame Clairval was much displeased when she heard of the approaching connection and was willing to prevent that of Valancourt with Emily her conscience told her that she had no right thus to trifle with their peace
3356-132542-0009	train-other-500	and Madame Clairval though a woman of fashion was far less advanced than her friend in the art of deriving satisfaction from distinction and admiration rather than from conscience
3356-132542-0010	train-other-500	Emily observed with concern the ascendancy which Montoni had acquired over Madame Cheron as well as the increasing frequency of his visits and her own opinion of this Italian was confirmed by that of Valancourt
3356-132542-0011	train-other-500	who had always expressed a dislike of him As she was one morning sitting at work in the pavilion enjoying the pleasant freshness of spring whose colours were now spread upon the landscape and listening to Valancourt who was reading
3356-132542-0012	train-other-500	but who often laid aside the book to converse
none	none	 she received a summons to attend Madame Cheron immediately and had scarcely entered the dressing room when she observed with surprise the dejection of her aunt s countenance and the contrasted gaiety of her dress 
3356-132542-0013	train-other-500	So niece said Madame and she stopped under some degree of embarrassment
none	none	 I sent for you 
3356-132542-0014	train-other-500	I I wished to see you I have news to tell you From this hour you must consider the Signor Montoni as your uncle we were married this morning Astonished
3356-132542-0015	train-other-500	not so much at the marriage as at the secrecy with which it had been concluded and the agitation with which it was announced Emily at length attributed the privacy to the wish of Montoni rather than of her aunt
3356-132542-0016	train-other-500	His wife however intended that the contrary should be believed and therefore added you see I wished to avoid a bustle but now the ceremony is over I shall do so no longer
3356-132542-0017	train-other-500	and I wish to announce to my servants that they must receive the Signor Montoni for their master Emily made a feeble attempt to congratulate her on these apparently imprudent nuptials I shall now celebrate my marriage with some splendour continued Madame Montoni
none	none	 and to save time I shall avail myself of the preparation that has been made for yours 
3356-132542-0018	train-other-500	which will of course be delayed a little while Such of your wedding clothes as are ready I shall expect you will appear in to do honour to this festival I also wish you to inform Monsieur Valancourt that I have changed my name and he will acquaint Madame Clairval
3356-132542-0019	train-other-500	In a few days I shall give a grand entertainment at which I shall request their presence Emily was so lost in surprise and various thought that she made Madame Montoni scarcely any reply
3356-132542-0020	train-other-500	but at her desire she returned to inform Valancourt of what had passed Surprise was not his predominant emotion on hearing of these hasty nuptials and when he learned that they were to be the means of delaying his own
3356-132542-0021	train-other-500	and that the very ornaments of the chateau which had been prepared to grace the nuptial day of his Emily were to be degraded to the celebration of Madame Montoni s grief and indignation agitated him alternately
3356-132542-0022	train-other-500	He could conceal neither from the observation of Emily whose efforts to abstract him from these serious emotions and to laugh at the apprehensive considerations that assailed him were ineffectual and when at length he took leave
3356-132542-0023	train-other-500	there was an earnest tenderness in his manner that extremely affected her she even shed tears when he disappeared at the end of the terrace yet knew not exactly why she should do so Montoni now took possession of the chateau
3356-132542-0024	train-other-500	and the command of its inhabitants with the ease of a man who had long considered it to be his own
none	none	 His friend Cavigni who had been extremely serviceable in having paid Madame Cheron the attention and flattery 
3356-132542-0025	train-other-500	which she required but from which Montoni too often revolted had apartments assigned to him and received from the domestics an equal degree of obedience with the master of the mansion
none	none	 Within a few days Madame Montoni as she had promised gave a magnificent entertainment to a very numerous company 
3356-132542-0026	train-other-500	among whom was Valancourt but at which Madame Clairval excused herself from attending There was a concert ball and supper Valancourt was of course Emily s partner and though when he gave a look to the decorations of the apartments
3356-132542-0027	train-other-500	he could not but remember that they were designed for other festivities than those they now contributed to celebrate he endeavoured to check his concern by considering that a little while only would elapse before they would be given to their original destination
3356-132542-0028	train-other-500	During this evening Madame Montoni danced laughed and talked incessantly while Montoni silent reserved and somewhat haughty seemed weary of the parade and of the frivolous company it had drawn together
3356-132542-0029	train-other-500	This was the first and the last entertainment given in celebration of their nuptials Montoni though the severity of his temper and the gloominess of his pride prevented him from enjoying such festivities was extremely willing to promote them
3356-132542-0030	train-other-500	It was seldom that he could meet in any company a man of more address
none	none	 and still seldomer one of more understanding than himself 
3356-132542-0031	train-other-500	the balance of advantage in such parties or in the connections which might arise from them must therefore be on his side and knowing as he did the selfish purposes for which they are generally frequented
3356-132542-0032	train-other-500	he had no objection to measure his talents of dissimulation with those of any other competitor for distinction and plunder
none	none	 But his wife who when her own interest was immediately concerned 
3356-132542-0033	train-other-500	had sometimes more discernment than vanity acquired a consciousness of her inferiority to other women in personal attractions which uniting with the jealousy natural to the discovery
none	none	 counteracted his readiness for mingling with all the parties Tholouse could afford 
3356-132542-0034	train-other-500	Till she had as she supposed the affections of an husband to lose she had no motive for discovering the unwelcome truth and it had never obtruded itself upon her but now that it influenced her policy
3356-132542-0035	train-other-500	she opposed her husband s inclination for company with the more eagerness because she believed him to be really as well received in the female society of the place as during his addresses to her he had affected to be
3356-132542-0036	train-other-500	A few weeks only had elapsed since the marriage when Madame Montoni informed Emily that the Signor intended to return to Italy as soon as the necessary preparation could be made for so long a journey We shall go to Venice said she
3356-132542-0037	train-other-500	where the Signor has a fine mansion and from thence to his estate in Tuscany
none	none	 Why do you look so grave child You who are so fond of a romantic country and fine views will doubtless be delighted with this journey Am I then to be of the party madam said Emily with extreme surprise and emotion 
3356-132542-0038	train-other-500	Most certainly replied her aunt how could you imagine we should leave you behind
none	none	 But I see you are thinking of the Chevalier 
3356-132542-0039	train-other-500	he is not yet I believe informed of the journey but he very soon will be so Signor Montoni is gone to acquaint Madame Clairval of our journey and to say that the proposed connection between the families must from this time be thought of no more
3356-132542-0040	train-other-500	The unfeeling manner in which Madame Montoni thus informed her niece that she must be separated perhaps for ever from the man with whom she was on the point of being united for life
3356-132542-0041	train-other-500	added to the dismay which she must otherwise have suffered at such intelligence When she could speak she asked the cause of the sudden change in Madame s sentiments towards Valancourt but the only reply she could obtain was that the Signor had forbade the connection
3356-132542-0042	train-other-500	considering it to be greatly inferior to what Emily might reasonably expect I now leave the affair entirely to the Signor added Madame Montoni
none	none	 but I must say that M Valancourt never was a favourite with me 
3356-132542-0043	train-other-500	and I was overpersuaded or I should not have given my consent to the connection I was weak enough I am so foolish sometimes to suffer other people s uneasiness to affect me and so my better judgment yielded to your affliction
3356-132542-0044	train-other-500	But the Signor has very properly pointed out the folly of this and he shall not have to reprove me a second time
none	none	 I am determined that you shall submit to those who know how to guide you better than yourself 
3356-132542-0045	train-other-500	I am determined that you shall be conformable Emily would have been astonished at the assertions of this eloquent speech had not her mind been so overwhelmed by the sudden shock it had received that she scarcely heard a word of what was latterly addressed to her
3356-132542-0046	train-other-500	Whatever were the weaknesses of Madame Montoni she might have avoided to accuse herself with those of compassion and tenderness to the feelings of others and especially to those of Emily
3356-132542-0047	train-other-500	It was the same ambition that lately prevailed upon her to solicit an alliance with Madame Clairval s family which induced her to withdraw from it now that her marriage with Montoni had exalted her self consequence and with it her views for her niece
3356-132542-0048	train-other-500	Emily was at this time too much affected to employ either remonstrance or entreaty on this topic and when at length she attempted the latter her emotion overcame her speech and she retired to her apartment
3356-132542-0049	train-other-500	to think if in the present state of her mind to think was possible upon this sudden and overwhelming subject
none	none	 It was very long before her spirits were sufficiently composed to permit the reflection 
3356-132542-0050	train-other-500	which when it came was dark and even terrible She saw that Montoni sought to aggrandise himself in his disposal of her
none	none	 and it occurred that his friend Cavigni was the person for whom he was interested 
3356-132542-0051	train-other-500	The prospect of going to Italy was still rendered darker when she considered the tumultuous situation of that country then torn by civil commotion where every petty state was at war with its neighbour and even every castle liable to the attack of an invader
3356-132542-0052	train-other-500	She considered the person to whose immediate guidance she would be committed and the vast distance that was to separate her from Valancourt and at the recollection of him every other image vanished from her mind and every thought was again obscured by grief
3356-132542-0053	train-other-500	In this perturbed state she passed some hours and when she was summoned to dinner she entreated permission to remain in her own apartment but Madame Montoni was alone and the request was refused
3356-132542-0054	train-other-500	Emily and her aunt said little during the repast the one occupied by her griefs the other engrossed by the disappointment which the unexpected absence of Montoni occasioned
none	none	 for not only was her vanity piqued by the neglect but her jealousy alarmed by what she considered as a mysterious engagement 
3356-132542-0055	train-other-500	When the cloth was drawn and they were alone Emily renewed the mention of Valancourt but her aunt neither softened to pity or awakened to remorse became enraged that her will should be opposed and the authority of Montoni questioned
3356-132542-0056	train-other-500	though this was done by Emily with her usual gentleness who after a long and torturing conversation retired in tears As she crossed the hall a person entered it by the great door whom as her eyes hastily glanced that way
3356-132542-0057	train-other-500	she imagined to be Montoni and she was passing on with quicker steps when she heard the well known voice of Valancourt Emily O my Emily cried he in a tone faltering with impatience while she turned and as he advanced
none	none	 was alarmed at the expression of his countenance and the eager desperation of his air 
3356-132542-0058	train-other-500	In tears Emily I would speak with you said he
none	none	 I have much to say 
3356-132542-0059	train-other-500	conduct me to where we may converse But you tremble you are ill Let me lead you to a seat He observed the open door of an apartment and hastily took her hand to lead her thither
3356-132542-0060	train-other-500	but she attempted to withdraw it and said with a languid smile I am better already if you wish to see my aunt she is in the dining parlour I must speak with YOU my Emily replied Valancourt
none	none	 Good God is it already come to this Are you indeed so willing to resign me But this is an improper place I am overheard Let me entreat your attention if only for a few minutes When you have seen my aunt said Emily I was wretched enough when I came hither exclaimed Valancourt 
3356-132542-0062	train-other-500	do not increase my misery by this coldness this cruel refusal The despondency with which he spoke this affected her almost to tears
none	none	 but she persisted in refusing to hear him till he had conversed with Madame Montoni Where is her husband where then is Montoni said Valancourt in an altered tone 
3356-132542-0063	train-other-500	it is he to whom I must speak Emily terrified for the consequence of the indignation that flashed in his eyes tremblingly assured him that Montoni was not at home and entreated he would endeavour to moderate his resentment
3356-132542-0064	train-other-500	At the tremulous accents of her voice his eyes softened instantly from wildness into tenderness You are ill Emily said he they will destroy us both Forgive me that I dared to doubt your affection
3356-132542-0065	train-other-500	Emily no longer opposed him as he led her into an adjoining parlour the manner in which he had named Montoni had so much alarmed her for his own safety
none	none	 that she was now only anxious to prevent the consequences of his just resentment 
3356-132542-0066	train-other-500	He listened to her entreaties with attention but replied to them only with looks of despondency and tenderness concealing as much as possible the sentiments he felt towards Montoni that he might soothe the apprehensions which distressed her
none	none	 But she saw the veil he had spread over his resentment 
3356-132542-0067	train-other-500	and his assumed tranquillity only alarming her more she urged at length the impolicy of forcing an interview with Montoni and of taking any measure which might render their separation irremediable
none	none	 Valancourt yielded to these remonstrances 
3356-132542-0068	train-other-500	and her affecting entreaties drew from him a promise that however Montoni might persist in his design of disuniting them he would not seek to redress his wrongs by violence For my sake said Emily
3356-132542-0069	train-other-500	let the consideration of what I should suffer deter you from such a mode of revenge For your sake Emily replied Valancourt his eyes filling with tears of tenderness and grief while he gazed upon her Yes
3356-132542-0070	train-other-500	yes I shall subdue myself But though I have given you my solemn promise to do this do not expect that I can tamely submit to the authority of Montoni if I could I should be unworthy of you Yet O Emily
3356-132542-0071	train-other-500	how long may he condemn me to live without you how long may it be before you return to France Emily endeavoured to sooth him with assurances of her unalterable affection and by representing that in little more than a year she should be her own mistress
3356-132542-0072	train-other-500	as far as related to her aunt from whose guardianship her age would then release her assurances which gave little consolation to Valancourt who considered that she would then be in Italy and in the power of those whose dominion over her would not cease with their rights
3356-132542-0073	train-other-500	but he affected to be consoled by them Emily
none	none	 comforted by the promise she had obtained and by his apparent composure 
3356-132542-0074	train-other-500	was about to leave him when her aunt entered the room She threw a glance of sharp reproof upon her niece who immediately withdrew and of haughty displeasure upon Valancourt This is not the conduct I should have expected from you sir said she
3356-132542-0075	train-other-500	I did not expect to see you in my house after you had been informed that your visits were no longer agreeable much less that you would seek a clandestine interview with my niece and that she would grant one Valancourt perceiving it necessary to vindicate Emily from such a design
3356-132542-0076	train-other-500	explained that the purpose of his own visit had been to request an interview with Montoni and he then entered upon the subject of it with the tempered spirit which the sex rather than the respectability of Madame Montoni demanded
3356-132542-0077	train-other-500	His expostulations were answered with severe rebuke she lamented again that her prudence had ever yielded to what she termed compassion and added that she was so sensible of the folly of her former consent that to prevent the possibility of a repetition
none	none	 she had committed the affair entirely to the conduct of Signor Montoni 
3356-132542-0078	train-other-500	The feeling eloquence of Valancourt however at length made her sensible in some measure of her unworthy conduct and she became susceptible to shame but not remorse she hated Valancourt
3356-132542-0079	train-other-500	who awakened her to this painful sensation and in proportion as she grew dissatisfied with herself her abhorrence of him increased This was also the more inveterate because his tempered words and manner were such as without accusing her
3356-132542-0080	train-other-500	compelled her to accuse herself and neither left her a hope that the odious portrait was the caricature of his prejudice or afforded her an excuse for expressing the violent resentment with which she contemplated it
3356-132542-0081	train-other-500	At length her anger rose to such an height that Valancourt was compelled to leave the house abruptly lest he should forfeit his own esteem by an intemperate reply He was then convinced that from Madame Montoni he had nothing to hope
3356-132542-0082	train-other-500	for what of either pity or justice could be expected from a person who could feel the pain of guilt without the humility of repentance To Montoni he looked with equal despondency
3356-132542-0083	train-other-500	since it was nearly evident that this plan of separation originated with him and it was not probable that he would relinquish his own views to entreaties or remonstrances which he must have foreseen and have been prepared to resist
3356-132542-0084	train-other-500	Yet remembering his promise to Emily and more solicitous concerning his love than jealous of his consequence Valancourt was careful to do nothing that might unnecessarily irritate Montoni he wrote to him therefore
3356-132542-0085	train-other-500	not to demand an interview but to solicit one and having done this he endeavoured to wait with calmness his reply Madame Clairval was passive in the affair When she gave her approbation to Valancourt s marriage
3356-132542-0086	train-other-500	it was in the belief that Emily would be the heiress of Madame Montoni s fortune and though upon the nuptials of the latter when she perceived the fallacy of this expectation her conscience had withheld her from adopting any measure to prevent the union
3356-132542-0087	train-other-500	her benevolence was not sufficiently active to impel her towards any step that might now promote it She was on the contrary secretly pleased that Valancourt was released from an engagement which she considered to be as inferior in point of fortune to his merit
none	none	 as his alliance was thought by Montoni to be humiliating to the beauty of Emily 
3356-132542-0088	train-other-500	and though her pride was wounded by this rejection of a member of her family she disdained to shew resentment otherwise than by silence Montoni in his reply to Valancourt
3356-132542-0089	train-other-500	said that as an interview could neither remove the objections of the one or overcome the wishes of the other it would serve only to produce useless altercation between them He therefore thought proper to refuse it
3356-132542-0090	train-other-500	In consideration of the policy suggested by Emily and of his promise to her
none	none	 Valancourt restrained the impulse that urged him to the house of Montoni to demand what had been denied to his entreaties He only repeated his solicitations to see him 
3356-132542-0091	train-other-500	seconding them with all the arguments his situation could suggest Thus several days passed in remonstrance on one side and inflexible denial on the other for whether it was fear or shame or the hatred which results from both
3356-132542-0092	train-other-500	that made Montoni shun the man he had injured he was peremptory in his refusal and was neither softened to pity by the agony which Valancourt s letters pourtrayed or awakened to a repentance of his own injustice by the strong remonstrances he employed
3356-132542-0093	train-other-500	At length Valancourt s letters were returned unopened and then in the first moments of passionate despair he forgot every promise to Emily except the solemn one which bound him to avoid violence and hastened to Montoni s chateau
3356-132542-0094	train-other-500	determined to see him by whatever other means might be necessary Montoni was denied
none	none	 and Valancourt when he afterwards enquired for Madame and Ma amselle saint Aubert was absolutely refused admittance by the servants 
3356-132542-0095	train-other-500	Not choosing to submit himself to a contest with these he at length departed and returning home in a state of mind approaching to frenzy wrote to Emily of what had passed expressed without restraint all the agony of his heart
3356-132542-0096	train-other-500	and entreated that since he must not otherwise hope to see her immediately she would allow him an interview unknown to Montoni
none	none	 Soon after he had dispatched this his passions becoming more temperate he was sensible of the error he had committed in having given Emily a new subject of distress in the strong mention of his own suffering and would have given half the world had it been his to recover the letter Emily however was spared the pain she must have received from it by the suspicious policy of Madame Montoni who had ordered that all letters addressed to her niece should be delivered to herself and who after having perused this and indulged the expressions of resentment which Valancourt s mention of Montoni provoked had consigned it to the flames Montoni meanwhile every day more impatient to leave France gave repeated orders for dispatch to the servants employed in preparations for the journey and to the persons with whom he was transacting some particular business He preserved a steady silence to the letters in which Valancourt despairing of greater good and having subdued the passion that had transgressed against his policy solicited only the indulgence of being allowed to bid Emily farewell But when the latter Valancourt learned that she was really to set out in a very few days and that it was designed he should see her no more forgetting every consideration of prudence he dared in a second letter to Emily to propose a clandestine marriage This also was transmitted to Madame Montoni and the last day of Emily s stay at Tholouse arrived without affording Valancourt even a line to sooth his sufferings or a hope that he should be allowed a parting interview During this period of torturing suspense to Valancourt Emily was sunk into that kind of stupor with which sudden and irremediable misfortune sometimes overwhelms the mind Loving him with the tenderest affection and having long been accustomed to consider him as the friend and companion of all her future days she had no ideas of happiness that were not connected with him What then must have been her suffering when thus suddenly they were to be separated perhaps for ever certainly to be thrown into distant parts of the world where they could scarcely hear of each other s existence and all this in obedience to the will of a stranger for such as Montoni and of a person who had but lately been anxious to hasten their nuptials It was in vain that she endeavoured to subdue her grief and resign herself to an event which she could not avoid The silence of Valancourt afflicted more than it surprised her since she attributed it to its just occasion but when the day preceding that on which she was to quit Tholouse arrived and she had heard no mention of his being permitted to take leave of her grief overcame every consideration that had made her reluctant to speak of him and she enquired of Madame Montoni whether this consolation had been refused Her aunt informed her that it had adding that after the provocation she had herself received from Valancourt in their last interview and the persecution which the Signor had suffered from his letters no entreaties should avail to procure it If the Chevalier expected this favour from us said she he should have conducted himself in a very different manner he should have waited patiently till he knew whether we were disposed to grant it and not have come and reproved me because I did not think proper to bestow my niece upon him and then have persisted in troubling the Signor because he did not think proper to enter into any dispute about so childish an affair His behaviour throughout has been extremely presumptuous and impertinent and I desire that I may never hear his name repeated and that you will get the better of those foolish sorrows and whims and look like other people and not appear with that dismal countenance as if you were ready to cry For though you say nothing you cannot conceal your grief from my penetration I can see you are ready to cry at this moment though I am reproving you for it aye even now in spite of my commands Emily having turned away to hide her tears quitted the room to indulge them and the day was passed in an intensity of anguish such as she had perhaps never known before When she withdrew to her chamber for the night she remained in the chair where she had placed herself on entering the room absorbed in her grief till long after every member of the family except herself was retired to rest She could not divest herself of a belief that she had parted with Valancourt to meet no more a belief which did not arise merely from foreseen circumstances for though the length of the journey she was about to commence the uncertainty as to the period of her return together with the prohibitions she had received seemed to justify it she yielded also to an impression which she mistook for a pre sentiment that she was going from Valancourt for ever How dreadful to her imagination too was the distance that would separate them the Alps those tremendous barriers would rise and whole countries extend between the regions where each must exist To live in adjoining provinces to live even in the same country though without seeing him was comparative happiness to the conviction of this dreadful length of distance Her mind was at length so much agitated by the consideration of her state and the belief that she had seen Valancourt for the last time that she suddenly became very faint and looking round the chamber for something that might revive her she observed the casements and had just strength to throw one open near which she seated herself The air recalled her spirits and the still moon light that fell upon the elms of a long avenue fronting the window somewhat soothed them and determined her to try whether exercise and the open air would not relieve the intense pain that bound her temples In the chateau all was still and passing down the great stair case into the hall from whence a passage led immediately to the garden she softly and unheard as she thought unlocked the door and entered the avenue Emily passed on with steps now hurried and now faltering as deceived by the shadows among the trees she fancied she saw some person move in the distant perspective and feared that it was a spy of Madame Montoni Her desire however to re visit the pavilion where she had passed so many happy hours with Valancourt and had admired with him the extensive prospect over Languedoc and her native Gascony overcame her apprehension of being observed and she moved on towards the terrace which running along the upper garden commanded the whole of the lower one and communicated with it by a flight of marble steps that terminated the avenue Having reached these steps she paused a moment to look round for her distance from the chateau now increased the fear which the stillness and obscurity of the hour had awakened But perceiving nothing that could justify it she ascended to the terrace where the moon light shewed the long broad walk with the pavilion at its extremity while the rays silvered the foliage of the high trees and shrubs that bordered it on the right and the tufted summits of those that rose to a level with the balustrade on the left from the garden below Her distance from the chateau again alarming her she paused to listen the night was so calm that no sound could have escaped her but she heard only the plaintive sweetness of the nightingale with the light shiver of the leaves and she pursued her way towards the pavilion having reached which its obscurity did not prevent the emotion that a fuller view of its well known scene would have excited The lattices were thrown back and shewed beyond their embowered arch the moon light landscape shadowy and soft its groves and plains extending gradually and indistinctly to the eye its distant mountains catching a stronger gleam and the nearer river reflecting the moon and trembling to her rays Emily as she approached the lattice was sensible of the features of this scene only as they served to bring Valancourt more immediately to her fancy Ah said she with a heavy sigh as she threw herself into a chair by the window how often have we sat together in this spot often have looked upon that landscape Never never more shall we view it together never never more perhaps shall we look upon each other Her tears were suddenly stopped by terror a voice spoke near her in the pavilion she shrieked it spoke again and she distinguished the well known tones of Valancourt It was indeed Valancourt who supported her in his arms For some moments their emotion would not suffer either to speak Emily said Valancourt at length as he pressed her hand in his Emily and he was again silent but the accent in which he had pronounced her name expressed all his tenderness and sorrow O my Emily he resumed after a long pause I do then see you once again and hear again the sound of that voice I have haunted this place these gardens for many many nights with a faint very faint hope of seeing you This was the only chance that remained to me and thank heaven it has at length succeeded I am not condemned to absolute despair Emily said something she scarcely knew what expressive of her unalterable affection and endeavoured to calm the agitation of his mind but Valancourt could for some time only utter incoherent expressions of his emotions and when he was somewhat more composed he said I came hither soon after sun set and have been watching in the gardens and in this pavilion ever since for though I had now given up all hope of seeing you I could not resolve to tear myself from a place so near to you and should probably have lingered about the chateau till morning dawned O how heavily the moments have passed yet with what various emotion have they been marked as I sometimes thought I heard footsteps and fancied you were approaching and then again perceived only a dead and dreary silence But when you opened the door of the pavilion and the darkness prevented my distinguishing with certainty whether it was my love my heart beat so strongly with hopes and fears that I could not speak The instant I heard the plaintive accents of your voice my doubts vanished but not my fears till you spoke of me then losing the apprehension of alarming you in the excess of my emotion I could no longer be silent O Emily these are moments in which joy and grief struggle so powerfully for pre eminence that the heart can scarcely support the contest Emily s heart acknowledged the truth of this assertion but the joy she felt on thus meeting Valancourt at the very moment when she was lamenting that they must probably meet no more soon melted into grief as reflection stole over her thoughts and imagination prompted visions of the future She struggled to recover the calm dignity of mind which was necessary to support her through this last interview and which Valancourt found it utterly impossible to attain for the transports of his joy changed abruptly into those of suffering and he expressed in the most impassioned language his horror of this separation and his despair of their ever meeting again Emily wept silently as she listened to him and then trying to command her own distress and to sooth his she suggested every circumstance that could lead to hope But the energy of his fears led him instantly to detect the friendly fallacies which she endeavoured to impose on herself and him and also to conjure up illusions too powerful for his reason You are going from me said he to a distant country O how distant to new society new friends new admirers with people too who will try to make you forget me and to promote new connections How can I know this and not know that you will never return for me never can be mine His voice was stifled by sighs You believe then said Emily that the pangs I suffer proceed from a trivial and temporary interest you believe Suffer interrupted Valancourt suffer for me O Emily how sweet how bitter are those words what comfort what anguish do they give I ought not to doubt the steadiness of your affection yet such is the inconsistency of real love that it is always awake to suspicion however unreasonable always requiring new assurances from the object of its interest and thus it is that I always feel revived as by a new conviction when your words tell me I am dear to you and wanting these I relapse into doubt and too often into despondency Then seeming to recollect himself he exclaimed But what a wretch am I thus to torture you and in these moments too I who ought to support and comfort you This reflection overcame Valancourt with tenderness but relapsing into despondency he again felt only for himself and lamented again this cruel separation in a voice and words so impassioned that Emily could no longer struggle to repress her own grief or to sooth his Valancourt between these emotions of love and pity lost the power and almost the wish of repressing his agitation and in the intervals of convulsive sobs he at one moment kissed away her tears then told her cruelly that possibly she might never again weep for him and then tried to speak more calmly but only exclaimed O Emily my heart will break I cannot cannot leave you Now I gaze upon that countenance now I hold you in my arms a little while and all this will appear a dream I shall look and cannot see you shall try to recollect your features and the impression will be fled from my imagination to hear the tones of your voice and even memory will be silent I cannot cannot leave you why should we confide the happiness of our whole lives to the will of people who have no right to interrupt and except in giving you to me have no power to promote it O Emily venture to trust your own heart venture to be mine for ever His voice trembled and he was silent Emily continued to weep and was silent also when Valancourt proceeded to propose an immediate marriage and that at an early hour on the following morning she should quit Madame Montoni s house and be conducted by him to the church of the Augustines where a friar should await to unite them The silence with which she listened to a proposal dictated by love and despair and enforced at a moment when it seemed scarcely possible for her to oppose it when her heart was softened by the sorrows of a separation that might be eternal and her reason obscured by the illusions of love and terror encouraged him to hope that it would not be rejected Speak my Emily said Valancourt eagerly let me hear your voice let me hear you confirm my fate she spoke not her cheek was cold and her senses seemed to fail her but she did not faint To Valancourt s terrified imagination she appeared to be dying he called upon her name rose to go to the chateau for assistance and then recollecting her situation feared to go or to leave her for a moment After a few minutes she drew a deep sigh and began to revive The conflict she had suffered between love and the duty she at present owed to her father s sister her repugnance to a clandestine marriage her fear of emerging on the world with embarrassments such as might ultimately involve the object of her affection in misery and repentance all this various interest was too powerful for a mind already enervated by sorrow and her reason had suffered a transient suspension But duty and good sense however hard the conflict at length triumphed over affection and mournful presentiment above all she dreaded to involve Valancourt in obscurity and vain regret which she saw or thought she saw must be the too certain consequence of a marriage in their present circumstances and she acted perhaps with somewhat more than female fortitude when she resolved to endure a present rather than provoke a distant misfortune With a candour that proved how truly she esteemed and loved him and which endeared her to him if possible more than ever she told Valancourt all her reasons for rejecting his proposals Those which influenced her concerning his future welfare he instantly refuted or rather contradicted but they awakened tender considerations for her which the frenzy of passion and despair had concealed before and love which had but lately prompted him to propose a clandestine and immediate marriage now induced him to renounce it The triumph was almost too much for his heart for Emily s sake he endeavoured to stifle his grief but the swelling anguish would not be restrained O Emily said he I must leave you I MUST leave you and I know it is for ever Convulsive sobs again interrupted his words and they wept together in silence till Emily recollecting the danger of being discovered and the impropriety of prolonging an interview which might subject her to censure summoned all her fortitude to utter a last farewell Stay said Valancourt I conjure you stay for I have much to tell you The agitation of my mind has hitherto suffered me to speak only on the subject that occupied it I have forborne to mention a doubt of much importance partly lest it should appear as if I told it with an ungenerous view of alarming you into a compliance with my late proposal Emily much agitated did not leave Valancourt but she led him from the pavilion and as they walked upon the terrace he proceeded as follows This Montoni I have heard some strange hints concerning him Are you certain he is of Madame Quesnel s family and that his fortune is what it appears to be I have no reason to doubt either replied Emily in a voice of alarm Of the first indeed I cannot doubt but I have no certain means of judging of the latter and I entreat you will tell me all you have heard That I certainly will but it is very imperfect and unsatisfactory information I gathered it by accident from an Italian who was speaking to another person of this Montoni They were talking of his marriage the Italian said that if he was the person he meant he was not likely to make Madame Cheron happy He proceeded to speak of him in general terms of dislike and then gave some particular hints concerning his character that excited my curiosity and I ventured to ask him a few questions He was reserved in his replies but after hesitating for some time he owned that he had understood abroad that Montoni was a man of desperate fortune and character He said something of a castle of Montoni s situated among the Apennines and of some strange circumstances that might be mentioned as to his former mode of life I pressed him to inform me further but I believe the strong interest I felt was visible in my manner and alarmed him for no entreaties could prevail with him to give any explanation of the circumstances he had alluded to or to mention any thing further concerning Montoni I observed to him that if Montoni was possessed of a castle in the Apennines it appeared from such a circumstance that he was of some family and also seemed to contradict the report that he was a man of entirely broken fortunes He shook his head and looked as if he could have said a great deal but made no reply A hope of learning something more satisfactory or more positive detained me in his company a considerable time and I renewed the subject repeatedly but the Italian wrapped himself up in reserve said that what he had mentioned he had caught only from a floating report and that reports frequently arose from personal malice and were very little to be depended upon I forbore to press the subject farther since it was obvious that he was alarmed for the consequence of what he had already said and I was compelled to remain in uncertainty on a point where suspense is almost intolerable Think Emily what I must suffer to see you depart for a foreign country committed to the power of a man of such doubtful character as is this Montoni But I will not alarm you unnecessarily it is possible as the Italian said at first that this is not the Montoni he alluded to Yet Emily consider well before you resolve to commit yourself to him O I must not trust myself to speak or I shall renounce all the motives which so lately influenced me to resign the hope of your becoming mine immediately Valancourt walked upon the terrace with hurried steps while Emily remained leaning on the balustrade in deep thought The information she had just received excited perhaps more alarm than it could justify and raised once more the conflict of contrasted interests She had never liked Montoni The fire and keenness of his eye its proud exultation its bold fierceness its sullen watchfulness as occasion and even slight occasion had called forth the latent soul she had often observed with emotion while from the usual expression of his countenance she had always shrunk From such observations she was the more inclined to believe that it was this Montoni of whom the Italian had uttered his suspicious hints The thought of being solely in his power in a foreign land was terrifying to her but it was not by terror alone that she was urged to an immediate marriage with Valancourt The tenderest love had already pleaded his cause but had been unable to overcome her opinion as to her duty her disinterested considerations for Valancourt and the delicacy which made her revolt from a clandestine union It was not to be expected that a vague terror would be more powerful than the united influence of love and grief But it recalled all their energy and rendered a second conquest necessary With Valancourt whose imagination was now awake to the suggestion of every passion whose apprehensions for Emily had acquired strength by the mere mention of them and became every instant more powerful as his mind brooded over them with Valancourt no second conquest was attainable He thought he saw in the clearest light and love assisted the fear that this journey to Italy would involve Emily in misery he determined therefore to persevere in opposing it and in conjuring her to bestow upon him the title of her lawful protector Emily said he with solemn earnestness this is no time for scrupulous distinctions for weighing the dubious and comparatively trifling circumstances that may affect our future comfort I now see much more clearly than before the train of serious dangers you are going to encounter with a man of Montoni s character Those dark hints of the Italian spoke much but not more than the idea I have of Montoni s disposition as exhibited even in his countenance I think I see at this moment all that could have been hinted written there He is the Italian whom I fear and I conjure you for your own sake as well as for mine to prevent the evils I shudder to foresee O Emily let my tenderness my arms withhold you from them give me the right to defend you Emily only sighed while Valancourt proceeded to remonstrate and to entreat with all the energy that love and apprehension could inspire But as his imagination magnified to her the possible evils she was going to meet the mists of her own fancy began to dissipate and allowed her to distinguish the exaggerated images which imposed on his reason She considered that there was no proof of Montoni being the person whom the stranger had meant that even if he was so the Italian had noticed his character and broken fortunes merely from report and that though the countenance of Montoni seemed to give probability to a part of the rumour it was not by such circumstances that an implicit belief of it could be justified These considerations would probably not have arisen so distinctly to her mind at this time had not the terrors of Valancourt presented to her such obvious exaggerations of her danger as incited her to distrust the fallacies of passion But while she endeavoured in the gentlest manner to convince him of his error she plunged him into a new one His voice and countenance changed to an expression of dark despair Emily said he this this moment is the bitterest that is yet come to me You do not cannot love me It would be impossible for you to reason thus coolly thus deliberately if you did I I am torn with anguish at the prospect of our separation and of the evils that may await you in consequence of it I would encounter any hazards to prevent it to save you No Emily no you cannot love me We have now little time to waste in exclamation or assertion said Emily endeavouring to conceal her emotion if you are yet to learn how dear you are and ever must be to my heart no assurances of mine can give you conviction The last words faltered on her lips and her tears flowed fast These words and tears brought once more and with instantaneous force conviction of her love to Valancourt He could only exclaim Emily Emily and weep over the hand he pressed to his lips but she after some moments again roused herself from the indulgence of sorrow and said I must leave you it is late and my absence from the chateau may be discovered Think of me love me when I am far away the belief of this will be my comfort Think of you love you exclaimed Valancourt Try to moderate these transports said Emily for my sake try For your sake Yes for my sake replied Emily in a tremulous voice I cannot leave you thus Then do not leave me said Valancourt with quickness Why should we part or part for longer than till to morrow I am indeed I am unequal to these moments replied Emily you tear my heart but I never can consent to this hasty imprudent proposal If we could command our time my Emily it should not be thus hasty we must submit to circumstances We must indeed I have already told you all my heart my spirits are gone You allowed the force of my objections till your tenderness called up vague terrors which have given us both unnecessary anguish Spare me do not oblige me to repeat the reasons I have already urged Spare you cried Valancourt I am a wretch a very wretch that have felt only for myself I who ought to have shewn the fortitude of a man who ought to have supported you I have increased your sufferings by the conduct of a child Forgive me Emily think of the distraction of my mind now that I am about to part with all that is dear to me and forgive me When you are gone I shall recollect with bitter remorse what I have made you suffer and shall wish in vain that I could see you if only for a moment that I might sooth your grief Tears again interrupted his voice and Emily wept with him I will shew myself more worthy of your love said Valancourt at length I will not prolong these moments My Emily my own Emily never forget me God knows when we shall meet again I resign you to his care O God O God protect and bless her He pressed her hand to his heart Emily sunk almost lifeless on his bosom and neither wept nor spoke Valancourt now commanding his own distress tried to comfort and re assure her but she appeared totally unaffected by what he said and a sigh which she uttered now and then was all that proved she had not fainted He supported her slowly towards the chateau weeping and speaking to her but she answered only in sighs till having reached the gate that terminated the avenue she seemed to have recovered her consciousness and looking round perceived how near they were to the chateau We must part here said she stopping Why prolong these moments Teach me the fortitude I have forgot Valancourt struggled to assume a composed air Farewell my love said he in a voice of solemn tenderness trust me we shall meet again meet for each other meet to part no more His voice faltered but recovering it he proceeded in a firmer tone You know not what I shall suffer till I hear from you I shall omit no opportunity of conveying to you my letters yet I tremble to think how few may occur And trust me love for your dear sake I will try to bear this absence with fortitude O how little I have shewn to night Farewell said Emily faintly When you are gone I shall think of many things I would have said to you And I of many many said Valancourt I never left you yet that I did not immediately remember some question or some entreaty or some circumstance concerning my love that I earnestly wished to mention and feel wretched because I could not O Emily this countenance on which I now gaze will in a moment be gone from my eyes and not all the efforts of fancy will be able to recall it with exactness O what an infinite difference between this moment and the next NOW I am in your presence can behold you THEN all will be a dreary blank and I shall be a wanderer exiled from my only home Valancourt again pressed her to his heart and held her there in silence weeping Tears once again calmed her oppressed mind They again bade each other farewell lingered a moment and then parted Valancourt seemed to force himself from the spot he passed hastily up the avenue and Emily as she moved slowly towards the chateau heard his distant steps She listened to the sounds as they sunk fainter and fainter till the melancholy stillness of night alone remained and then hurried to her chamber to seek repose which alas was fled from her wretchedness VOLUME two CHAPTER I Where er I roam whatever realms I see My heart untravell d still shall turn to thee GOLDSMITH The carriages were at the gates at an early hour the bustle of the domestics passing to and fro in the galleries awakened Emily from harassing slumbers her unquiet mind had during the night presented her with terrific images and obscure circumstances concerning her affection and her future life She now endeavoured to chase away the impressions they had left on her fancy but from imaginary evils she awoke to the consciousness of real ones Recollecting that she had parted with Valancourt perhaps for ever her heart sickened as memory revived But she tried to dismiss the dismal forebodings that crowded on her mind and to restrain the sorrow which she could not subdue efforts which diffused over the settled melancholy of her countenance an expression of tempered resignation as a thin veil thrown over the features of beauty renders them more interesting by a partial concealment But Madame Montoni observed nothing in this countenance except its usual paleness which attracted her censure She told her niece that she had been indulging in fanciful sorrows and begged she would have more regard for decorum than to let the world see that she could not renounce an improper attachment at which Emily s pale cheek became flushed with crimson but it was the blush of pride and she made no answer Soon after Montoni entered the breakfast room spoke little and seemed impatient to be gone The windows of this room opened upon the garden As Emily passed them she saw the spot where she had parted with Valancourt on the preceding night the remembrance pressed heavily on her heart and she turned hastily away from the object that had awakened it The baggage being at length adjusted the travellers entered their carriages and Emily would have left the chateau without one sigh of regret had it not been situated in the neighbourhood of Valancourt s residence From a little eminence she looked back upon Tholouse and the far seen plains of Gascony beyond which the broken summits of the Pyrenees appeared on the distant horizon lighted up by a morning sun Dear pleasant mountains said she to herself how long may it be ere I see ye again and how much may happen to make me miserable in the interval Oh could I now be certain that I should ever return to ye and find that Valancourt still lived for me I should go in peace He will still gaze on ye gaze when I am far away The trees that impended over the high banks of the road and formed a line of perspective with the distant country now threatened to exclude the view of them but the blueish mountains still appeared beyond the dark foliage and Emily continued to lean from the coach window till at length the closing branches shut them from her sight Another object soon caught her attention She had scarcely looked at a person who walked along the bank with his hat in which was the military feather drawn over his eyes before at the sound of wheels he suddenly turned and she perceived that it was Valancourt himself who waved his hand sprung into the road and through the window of the carriage put a letter into her hand He endeavoured to smile through the despair that overspread his countenance as she passed on The remembrance of that smile seemed impressed on Emily s mind for ever She leaned from the window and saw him on a knoll of the broken bank leaning against the high trees that waved over him and pursuing the carriage with his eyes He waved his hand and she continued to gaze till distance confused his figure and at length another turn of the road entirely separated him from her sight Having stopped to take up Signor Cavigni at a chateau on the road the travellers of whom Emily was disrespectfully seated with Madame Montoni s woman in a second carriage pursued their way over the plains of Languedoc The presence of this servant restrained Emily from reading Valancourt s letter for she did not choose to expose the emotions it might occasion to the observation of any person Yet such was her wish to read this his last communication that her trembling hand was every moment on the point of breaking the seal At length they reached the village where they staid only to change horses without alighting and it was not till they stopped to dine that Emily had an opportunity of reading the letter Though she had never doubted the sincerity of Valancourt s affection the fresh assurances she now received of it revived her spirits she wept over his letter in tenderness laid it by to be referred to when they should be particularly depressed and then thought of him with much less anguish than she had done since they parted Among some other requests which were interesting to her because expressive of his tenderness and because a compliance with them seemed to annihilate for a while the pain of absence he entreated she would always think of him at sunset You will then meet me in thought said he I shall constantly watch the sun set and I shall be happy in the belief that your eyes are fixed upon the same object with mine and that our minds are conversing You know not Emily the comfort I promise myself from these moments but I trust you will experience it It is unnecessary to say with what emotion Emily on this evening watched the declining sun over a long extent of plains on which she saw it set without interruption and sink towards the province which Valancourt inhabited After this hour her mind became far more tranquil and resigned than it had been since the marriage of Montoni and her aunt During several days the travellers journeyed over the plains of Languedoc and then entering Dauphiny and winding for some time among the mountains of that romantic province they quitted their carriages and began to ascend the Alps And here such scenes of sublimity opened upon them as no colours of language must dare to paint Emily s mind was even so much engaged with new and wonderful images that they sometimes banished the idea of Valancourt though they more frequently revived it These brought to her recollection the prospects among the Pyrenees which they had admired together and had believed nothing could excel in grandeur How often did she wish to express to him the new emotions which this astonishing scenery awakened and that he could partake of them Sometimes too she endeavoured to anticipate his remarks and almost imagined him present She seemed to have arisen into another world and to have left every trifling thought every trifling sentiment in that below those only of grandeur and sublimity now dilated her mind and elevated the affections of her heart With what emotions of sublimity softened by tenderness did she meet Valancourt in thought at the customary hour of sun set when wandering among the Alps she watched the glorious orb sink amid their summits his last tints die away on their snowy points and a solemn obscurity steal over the scene And when the last gleam had faded she turned her eyes from the west with somewhat of the melancholy regret that is experienced after the departure of a beloved friend while these lonely feelings were heightened by the spreading gloom and by the low sounds heard only when darkness confines attention which make the general stillness more impressive leaves shook by the air the last sigh of the breeze that lingers after sun set or the murmur of distant streams During the first days of this journey among the Alps the scenery exhibited a wonderful mixture of solitude and inhabitation of cultivation and barrenness On the edge of tremendous precipices and within the hollow of the cliffs below which the clouds often floated were seen villages spires and convent towers while green pastures and vineyards spread their hues at the feet of perpendicular rocks of marble or of granite whose points tufted with alpine shrubs or exhibiting only massy crags rose above each other till they terminated in the snow topt mountain whence the torrent fell that thundered along the valley The snow was not yet melted on the summit of Mount Cenis over which the travellers passed but Emily as she looked upon its clear lake and extended plain surrounded by broken cliffs saw in imagination the verdant beauty it would exhibit when the snows should be gone and the shepherds leading up the midsummer flocks from Piedmont to pasture on its flowery summit should add Arcadian figures to Arcadian landscape As she descended on the Italian side the precipices became still more tremendous and the prospects still more wild and majestic over which the shifting lights threw all the pomp of colouring Emily delighted to observe the snowy tops of the mountains under the passing influence of the day blushing with morning glowing with the brightness of noon or just tinted with the purple evening The haunt of man could now only be discovered by the simple hut of the shepherd and the hunter or by the rough pine bridge thrown across the torrent to assist the latter in his chase of the chamois over crags where but for this vestige of man it would have been believed only the chamois or the wolf dared to venture As Emily gazed upon one of these perilous bridges with the cataract foaming beneath it some images came to her mind which she afterwards combined in the following STORIED SONNET The weary traveller who all night long Has climb d among the Alps tremendous steeps Skirting the pathless precipice where throng Wild forms of danger as he onward creeps If chance his anxious eye at distance sees The mountain shepherd s solitary home Peeping from forth the moon illumin d trees What sudden transports to his bosom come But if between some hideous chasm yawn Where the cleft pine a doubtful bridge displays In dreadful silence on the brink forlorn He stands and views in the faint rays Far far below the torrent s rising surge And listens to the wild impetuous roar Still eyes the depth still shudders on the verge Fears to return nor dares to venture o er Desperate at length the tottering plank he tries His weak steps slide he shrieks he sinks he dies Emily often as she travelled among the clouds watched in silent awe their billowy surges rolling below sometimes wholly closing upon the scene they appeared like a world of chaos and at others spreading thinly they opened and admitted partial catches of the landscape the torrent whose astounding roar had never failed tumbling down the rocky chasm huge cliffs white with snow or the dark summits of the pine forests that stretched mid way down the mountains But who may describe her rapture when having passed through a sea of vapour she caught a first view of Italy when from the ridge of one of those tremendous precipices that hang upon Mount Cenis and guard the entrance of that enchanting country she looked down through the lower clouds and as they floated away saw the grassy vales of Piedmont at her feet and beyond the plains of Lombardy extending to the farthest distance at which appeared on the faint horizon the doubtful towers of Turin The solitary grandeur of the objects that immediately surrounded her the mountain region towering above the deep precipices that fell beneath the waving blackness of the forests of pine and oak which skirted their feet or hung within their recesses the headlong torrents that dashing among their cliffs sometimes appeared like a cloud of mist at others like a sheet of ice these were features which received a higher character of sublimity from the reposing beauty of the Italian landscape below stretching to the wide horizon where the same melting blue tint seemed to unite earth and sky Madame Montoni only shuddered as she looked down precipices near whose edge the chairmen trotted lightly and swiftly almost as the chamois bounded and from which Emily too recoiled but with her fears were mingled such various emotions of delight such admiration astonishment and awe as she had never experienced before Meanwhile the carriers having come to a landing place stopped to rest and the travellers being seated on the point of a cliff Montoni and Cavigni renewed a dispute concerning Hannibal s passage over the Alps Montoni contending that he entered Italy by way of Mount Cenis and Cavigni that he passed over Mount saint Bernard The subject brought to Emily s imagination the disasters he had suffered in this bold and perilous adventure She saw his vast armies winding among the defiles and over the tremendous cliffs of the mountains which at night were lighted up by his fires or by the torches which he caused to be carried when he pursued his indefatigable march In the eye of fancy she perceived the gleam of arms through the duskiness of night the glitter of spears and helmets and the banners floating dimly on the twilight while now and then the blast of a distant trumpet echoed along the defile and the signal was answered by a momentary clash of arms She looked with horror upon the mountaineers perched on the higher cliffs assailing the troops below with broken fragments of the mountain on soldiers and elephants tumbling headlong down the lower precipices and as she listened to the rebounding rocks that followed their fall the terrors of fancy yielded to those of reality and she shuddered to behold herself on the dizzy height whence she had pictured the descent of others Madame Montoni meantime as she looked upon Italy was contemplating in imagination the splendour of palaces and the grandeur of castles such as she believed she was going to be mistress of at Venice and in the Apennine and she became in idea little less than a princess Being no longer under the alarms which had deterred her from giving entertainments to the beauties of Tholouse whom Montoni had mentioned with more eclat to his own vanity than credit to their discretion or regard to truth she determined to give concerts though she had neither ear nor taste for music conversazioni though she had no talents for conversation and to outvie if possible in the gaieties of her parties and the magnificence of her liveries all the noblesse of Venice This blissful reverie was somewhat obscured when she recollected the Signor her husband who though he was not averse to the profit which sometimes results from such parties had always shewn a contempt of the frivolous parade that sometimes attends them till she considered that his pride might be gratified by displaying among his own friends in his native city the wealth which he had neglected in France and she courted again the splendid illusions that had charmed her before The travellers as they descended gradually exchanged the region of winter for the genial warmth and beauty of spring The sky began to assume that serene and beautiful tint peculiar to the climate of Italy patches of young verdure fragrant shrubs and flowers looked gaily among the rocks often fringing their rugged brows or hanging in tufts from their broken sides and the buds of the oak and mountain ash were expanding into foliage Descending lower the orange and the myrtle every now and then appeared in some sunny nook with their yellow blossoms peeping from among the dark green of their leaves and mingling with the scarlet flowers of the pomegranate and the paler ones of the arbutus that ran mantling to the crags above while lower still spread the pastures of Piedmont where early flocks were cropping the luxuriant herbage of spring The river Doria which rising on the summit of Mount Cenis had dashed for many leagues over the precipices that bordered the road now began to assume a less impetuous though scarcely less romantic character as it approached the green vallies of Piedmont into which the travellers descended with the evening sun and Emily found herself once more amid the tranquil beauty of pastoral scenery among flocks and herds and slopes tufted with woods of lively verdure and with beautiful shrubs such as she had often seen waving luxuriantly over the alps above The verdure of the pasturage now varied with the hues of early flowers among which were yellow ranunculuses and pansey violets of delicious fragrance she had never seen excelled Emily almost wished to become a peasant of Piedmont to inhabit one of the pleasant embowered cottages which she saw peeping beneath the cliffs and to pass her careless hours among these romantic landscapes To the hours the months she was to pass under the dominion of Montoni she looked with apprehension while those which were departed she remembered with regret and sorrow In the present scenes her fancy often gave her the figure of Valancourt whom she saw on a point of the cliffs gazing with awe and admiration on the imagery around him or wandering pensively along the vale below frequently pausing to look back upon the scenery and then his countenance glowing with the poet s fire pursuing his way to some overhanging heights When she again considered the time and the distance that were to separate them that every step she now took lengthened this distance her heart sunk and the surrounding landscape charmed her no more The travellers passing Novalesa reached after the evening had closed the small and antient town of Susa which had formerly guarded this pass of the Alps into Piedmont The heights which command it had since the invention of artillery rendered its fortifications useless but these romantic heights seen by moon light with the town below surrounded by its walls and watchtowers and partially illumined exhibited an interesting picture to Emily Here they rested for the night at an inn which had little accommodation to boast of but the travellers brought with them the hunger that gives delicious flavour to the coarsest viands and the weariness that ensures repose and here Emily first caught a strain of Italian music on Italian ground As she sat after supper at a little window that opened upon the country observing an effect of the moon light on the broken surface of the mountains and remembering that on such a night as this she once had sat with her father and Valancourt resting upon a cliff of the Pyrenees she heard from below the long drawn notes of a violin of such tone and delicacy of expression as harmonized exactly with the tender emotions she was indulging and both charmed and surprised her Cavigni who approached the window smiled at her surprise This is nothing extraordinary said he you will hear the same perhaps at every inn on our way It is one of our landlord s family who plays I doubt not Emily as she listened thought he could be scarcely less than a professor of music whom she heard and the sweet and plaintive strains soon lulled her into a reverie from which she was very unwillingly roused by the raillery of Cavigni and by the voice of Montoni who gave orders to a servant to have the carriages ready at an early hour on the following morning and added that he meant to dine at Turin Madame Montoni was exceedingly rejoiced to be once more on level ground and after giving a long detail of the various terrors she had suffered which she forgot that she was describing to the companions of her dangers she added a hope that she should soon be beyond the view of these horrid mountains which all the world said she should not tempt me to cross again Complaining of fatigue she soon retired to rest and Emily withdrew to her own room when she understood from Annette her aunt s woman that Cavigni was nearly right in his conjecture concerning the musician who had awakened the violin with so much taste for that he was the son of a peasant inhabiting the neighbouring valley He is going to the Carnival at Venice added Annette for they say he has a fine hand at playing and will get a world of money and the Carnival is just going to begin but for my part I should like to live among these pleasant woods and hills better than in a town and they say Ma moiselle we shall see no woods or hills or fields at Venice for that it is built in the very middle of the sea Emily agreed with the talkative Annette that this young man was making a change for the worse and could not forbear silently lamenting that he should be drawn from the innocence and beauty of these scenes to the corrupt ones of that voluptuous city When she was alone unable to sleep the landscapes of her native home with Valancourt and the circumstances of her departure haunted her fancy she drew pictures of social happiness amidst the grand simplicity of nature such as she feared she had bade farewel to for ever and then the idea of this young Piedmontese thus ignorantly sporting with his happiness returned to her thoughts and glad to escape awhile from the pressure of nearer interests she indulged her fancy in composing the following lines THE PIEDMONTESE Ah merry swain who laugh d along the vales And with your gay pipe made the mountains ring Why leave your cot your woods and thymy gales And friends belov d for aught that wealth can bring He goes to wake o er moon light seas the string Venetian gold his untaught fancy hails Yet oft of home his simple carols sing And his steps pause as the last Alp he scales Once more he turns to view his native scene Far far below as roll the clouds away He spies his cabin mid the pine tops green The well known woods clear brook and pastures gay And thinks of friends and parents left behind Of sylvan revels dance and festive song And hears the faint reed swelling in the wind And his sad sighs the distant notes prolong Thus went the swain till mountain shadows fell And dimm d the landscape to his aching sight And must he leave the vales he loves so well Can foreign wealth and shows his heart delight No happy vales your wild rocks still shall hear His pipe light sounding on the morning breeze Still shall he lead the flocks to streamlet clear And watch at eve beneath the western trees Away Venetian gold your charm is o er And now his swift step seeks the lowland bow rs Where through the leaves his cottage light ONCE MORE Guides him to happy friends and jocund hours Ah merry swain that laugh along the vales And with your gay pipe make the mountains ring Your cot your woods your thymy scented gales And friends belov d more joy than wealth can bring CHAPTER II TITANIA If you will patiently dance in our round And see our moon light revels go with us MIDSUMMER NIGHT S DREAM Early on the following morning the travellers set out for Turin The luxuriant plain that extends from the feet of the Alps to that magnificent city was not then as now shaded by an avenue of trees nine miles in length but plantations of olives mulberry and palms festooned with vines mingled with the pastoral scenery through with the rapid Po after its descent from the mountains wandered to meet the humble Doria at Turin As they advanced towards this city the Alps seen at some distance began to appear in all their awful sublimity chain rising over chain in long succession their higher points darkened by the hovering clouds sometimes hid and at others seen shooting up far above them while their lower steeps broken into fantastic forms were touched with blue and purplish tints which as they changed in light and shade seemed to open new scenes to the eye To the east stretched the plains of Lombardy with the towers of Turin rising at a distance and beyond the Apennines bounding the horizon The general magnificence of that city with its vistas of churches and palaces branching from the grand square each opening to a landscape of the distant Alps or Apennines was not only such as Emily had never seen in France but such as she had never imagined Montoni who had been often at Turin and cared little about views of any kind did not comply with his wife s request that they might survey some of the palaces but staying only till the necessary refreshments could be obtained they set forward for Venice with all possible rapidity Montoni s manner during this journey was grave and even haughty and towards Madame Montoni he was more especially reserved but it was not the reserve of respect so much as of pride and discontent Of Emily he took little notice With Cavigni his conversations were commonly on political or military topics such as the convulsed state of their country rendered at this time particularly interesting Emily observed that at the mention of any daring exploit Montoni s eyes lost their sullenness and seemed instantaneously to gleam with fire yet they still retained somewhat of a lurking cunning and she sometimes thought that their fire partook more of the glare of malice than the brightness of valour though the latter would well have harmonized with the high chivalric air of his figure in which Cavigni with all his gay and gallant manners was his inferior On entering the Milanese the gentlemen exchanged their French hats for the Italian cap of scarlet cloth embroidered and Emily was somewhat surprised to observe that Montoni added to his the military plume while Cavigni retained only the feather which was usually worn with such caps but she at length concluded that Montoni assumed this ensign of a soldier for convenience as a means of passing with more safety through a country over run with parties of the military Over the beautiful plains of this country the devastations of war were frequently visible Where the lands had not been suffered to lie uncultivated they were often tracked with the steps of the spoiler the vines were torn down from the branches that had supported them the olives trampled upon the ground and even the groves of mulberry trees had been hewn by the enemy to light fires that destroyed the hamlets and villages of their owners Emily turned her eyes with a sigh from these painful vestiges of contention to the Alps of the Grison that overlooked them to the north whose awful solitudes seemed to offer to persecuted man a secure asylum The travellers frequently distinguished troops of soldiers moving at a distance and they experienced at the little inns on the road the scarcity of provision and other inconveniences which are a part of the consequence of intestine war but they had never reason to be much alarmed for their immediate safety and they passed on to Milan with little interruption of any kind where they staid not to survey the grandeur of the city or even to view its vast cathedral which was then building Beyond Milan the country wore the aspect of a ruder devastation and though every thing seemed now quiet the repose was like that of death spread over features which retain the impression of the last convulsions It was not till they had passed the eastern limits of the Milanese that the travellers saw any troops since they had left Milan when as the evening was drawing to a close they descried what appeared to be an army winding onward along the distant plains whose spears and other arms caught the last rays of the sun As the column advanced through a part of the road contracted between two hillocks some of the commanders on horseback were distinguished on a small eminence pointing and making signals for the march while several of the officers were riding along the line directing its progress according to the signs communicated by those above and others separating from the vanguard which had emerged from the pass were riding carelessly along the plains at some distance to the right of the army As they drew nearer Montoni distinguishing the feathers that waved in their caps and the banners and liveries of the bands that followed them thought he knew this to be the small army commanded by the famous captain Utaldo with whom as well as with some of the other chiefs he was personally acquainted He therefore gave orders that the carriages should draw up by the side of the road to await their arrival and give them the pass A faint strain of martial music now stole by and gradually strengthening as the troops approached Emily distinguished the drums and trumpets with the clash of cymbals and of arms that were struck by a small party in time to the march Montoni being now certain that these were the bands of the victorious Utaldo leaned from the carriage window and hailed their general by waving his cap in the air which compliment the chief returned by raising his spear and then letting it down again suddenly while some of his officers who were riding at a distance from the troops came up to the carriage and saluted Montoni as an old acquaintance The captain himself soon after arriving his bands halted while he conversed with Montoni whom he appeared much rejoiced to see and from what he said Emily understood that this was a victorious army returning into their own principality while the numerous waggons that accompanied them contained the rich spoils of the enemy their own wounded soldiers and the prisoners they had taken in battle who were to be ransomed when the peace then negociating between the neighbouring states should be ratified The chiefs on the following day were to separate and each taking his share of the spoil was to return with his own band to his castle This was therefore to be an evening of uncommon and general festivity in commemoration of the victory they had accomplished together and of the farewell which the commanders were about to take of each other Emily as these officers conversed with Montoni observed with admiration tinctured with awe their high martial air mingled with the haughtiness of the nobless of those days and heightened by the gallantry of their dress by the plumes towering on their caps the armorial coat Persian sash and ancient Spanish cloak Utaldo telling Montoni that his army were going to encamp for the night near a village at only a few miles distance invited him to turn back and partake of their festivity assuring the ladies also that they should be pleasantly accommodated but Montoni excused himself adding that it was his design to reach Verona that evening and after some conversation concerning the state of the country towards that city they parted The travellers proceeded without any interruption but it was some hours after sun set before they arrived at Verona whose beautiful environs were therefore not seen by Emily till the following morning when leaving that pleasant town at an early hour they set off for Padua where they embarked on the Brenta for Venice Here the scene was entirely changed no vestiges of war such as had deformed the plains of the Milanese appeared on the contrary all was peace and elegance The verdant banks of the Brenta exhibited a continued landscape of beauty gaiety and splendour Emily gazed with admiration on the villas of the Venetian noblesse with their cool porticos and colonnades overhung with poplars and cypresses of majestic height and lively verdure on their rich orangeries whose blossoms perfumed the air and on the luxuriant willows that dipped their light leaves in the wave and sheltered from the sun the gay parties whose music came at intervals on the breeze The Carnival did indeed appear to extend from Venice along the whole line of these enchanting shores the river was gay with boats passing to that city exhibiting the fantastic diversity of a masquerade in the dresses of the people within them and towards evening groups of dancers frequently were seen beneath the trees Cavigni meanwhile informed her of the names of the noblemen to whom the several villas they passed belonged adding light sketches of their characters such as served to amuse rather than to inform exhibiting his own wit instead of the delineation of truth Emily was sometimes diverted by his conversation but his gaiety did not entertain Madame Montoni as it had formerly done she was frequently grave and Montoni retained his usual reserve Nothing could exceed Emily s admiration on her first view of Venice with its islets palaces and towers rising out of the sea whose clear surface reflected the tremulous picture in all its colours The sun sinking in the west tinted the waves and the lofty mountains of Friuli which skirt the northern shores of the Adriatic with a saffron glow while on the marble porticos and colonnades of saint Mark were thrown the rich lights and shades of evening As they glided on the grander features of this city appeared more distinctly its terraces crowned with airy yet majestic fabrics touched as they now were with the splendour of the setting sun appeared as if they had been called up from the ocean by the wand of an enchanter rather than reared by mortal hands The sun soon after sinking to the lower world the shadow of the earth stole gradually over the waves and then up the towering sides of the mountains of Friuli till it extinguished even the last upward beams that had lingered on their summits and the melancholy purple of evening drew over them like a thin veil How deep how beautiful was the tranquillity that wrapped the scene All nature seemed to repose the finest emotions of the soul were alone awake Emily s eyes filled with tears of admiration and sublime devotion as she raised them over the sleeping world to the vast heavens and heard the notes of solemn music that stole over the waters from a distance She listened in still rapture and no person of the party broke the charm by an enquiry The sounds seemed to grow on the air for so smoothly did the barge glide along that its motion was not perceivable and the fairy city appeared approaching to welcome the strangers They now distinguished a female voice accompanied by a few instruments singing a soft and mournful air and its fine expression as sometimes it seemed pleading with the impassioned tenderness of love and then languishing into the cadence of hopeless grief declared that it flowed from no feigned sensibility Ah thought Emily as she sighed and remembered Valancourt those strains come from the heart She looked round with anxious enquiry the deep twilight that had fallen over the scene admitted only imperfect images to the eye but at some distance on the sea she thought she perceived a gondola a chorus of voices and instruments now swelled on the air so sweet so solemn it seemed like the hymn of angels descending through the silence of night Now it died away and fancy almost beheld the holy choir reascending towards heaven then again it swelled with the breeze trembled awhile and again died into silence It brought to Emily s recollection some lines of her late father and she repeated in a low voice Oft I hear Upon the silence of the midnight air Celestial voices swell in holy chorus That bears the soul to heaven The deep stillness that succeeded was as expressive as the strain that had just ceased It was uninterrupted for several minutes till a general sigh seemed to release the company from their enchantment Emily however long indulged the pleasing sadness that had stolen upon her spirits but the gay and busy scene that appeared as the barge approached saint Mark s Place at length roused her attention The rising moon which threw a shadowy light upon the terraces and illumined the porticos and magnificent arcades that crowned them discovered the various company whose light steps soft guitars and softer voices echoed through the colonnades The music they heard before now passed Montoni s barge in one of the gondolas of which several were seen skimming along the moon light sea full of gay parties catching the cool breeze Most of these had music made sweeter by the waves over which it floated and by the measured sound of oars as they dashed the sparkling tide Emily gazed and listened and thought herself in a fairy scene even Madame Montoni was pleased Montoni congratulated himself on his return to Venice which he called the first city in the world and Cavigni was more gay and animated than ever The barge passed on to the grand canal where Montoni s mansion was situated And here other forms of beauty and of grandeur such as her imagination had never painted were unfolded to Emily in the palaces of Sansovino and Palladio as she glided along the waves The air bore no sounds but those of sweetness echoing along each margin of the canal and from gondolas on its surface while groups of masks were seen dancing on the moon light terraces and seemed almost to realize the romance of fairyland The barge stopped before the portico of a large house from whence a servant of Montoni crossed the terrace and immediately the party disembarked From the portico they passed a noble hall to a stair case of marble which led to a saloon fitted up in a style of magnificence that surprised Emily The walls and ceilings were adorned with historical and allegorical paintings in fresco silver tripods depending from chains of the same metal illumined the apartment the floor of which was covered with Indian mats painted in a variety of colours and devices the couches and drapery of the lattices were of pale green silk embroidered and fringed with green and gold Balcony lattices opened upon the grand canal whence rose a confusion of voices and of musical instruments and the breeze that gave freshness to the apartment Emily considering the gloomy temper of Montoni looked upon the splendid furniture of this house with surprise and remembered the report of his being a man of broken fortune with astonishment Ah said she to herself if Valancourt could but see this mansion what peace would it give him He would then be convinced that the report was groundless Madame Montoni seemed to assume the air of a princess but Montoni was restless and discontented and did not even observe the civility of bidding her welcome to her home Soon after his arrival he ordered his gondola and with Cavigni went out to mingle in the scenes of the evening Madame then became serious and thoughtful Emily who was charmed with every thing she saw endeavoured to enliven her but reflection had not with Madame Montoni subdued caprice and ill humour and her answers discovered so much of both that Emily gave up the attempt of diverting her and withdrew to a lattice to amuse herself with the scene without so new and so enchanting The first object that attracted her notice was a group of dancers on the terrace below led by a guitar and some other instruments The girl who struck the guitar and another who flourished a tambourine passed on in a dancing step and with a light grace and gaiety of heart that would have subdued the goddess of spleen in her worst humour After these came a group of fantastic figures some dressed as gondolieri others as minstrels while others seemed to defy all description They sung in parts their voices accompanied by a few soft instruments At a little distance from the portico they stopped and Emily distinguished the verses of Ariosto They sung of the wars of the Moors against Charlemagne and then of the woes of Orlando afterwards the measure changed and the melancholy sweetness of Petrarch succeeded The magic of his grief was assisted by all that Italian music and Italian expression heightened by the enchantments of Venetian moonlight could give Emily as she listened caught the pensive enthusiasm her tears flowed silently while her fancy bore her far away to France and to Valancourt Each succeeding sonnet more full of charming sadness than the last seemed to bind the spell of melancholy with extreme regret she saw the musicians move on and her attention followed the strain till the last faint warble died in air She then remained sunk in that pensive tranquillity which soft music leaves on the mind a state like that produced by the view of a beautiful landscape by moon light or by the recollection of scenes marked with the tenderness of friends lost for ever and with sorrows which time has mellowed into mild regret Such scenes are indeed to the mind like those faint traces which the memory bears of music that is past Other sounds soon awakened her attention it was the solemn harmony of horns that swelled from a distance and observing the gondolas arrange themselves along the margin of the terraces she threw on her veil and stepping into the balcony discerned in the distant perspective of the canal something like a procession floating on the light surface of the water as it approached the horns and other instruments mingled sweetly and soon after the fabled deities of the city seemed to have arisen from the ocean for Neptune with Venice personified as his queen came on the undulating waves surrounded by tritons and sea nymphs The fantastic splendour of this spectacle together with the grandeur of the surrounding palaces appeared like the vision of a poet suddenly embodied and the fanciful images which it awakened in Emily s mind lingered there long after the procession had passed away She indulged herself in imagining what might be the manners and delights of a sea nymph till she almost wished to throw off the habit of mortality and plunge into the green wave to participate them How delightful said she to live amidst the coral bowers and crystal caverns of the ocean with my sister nymphs and listen to the sounding waters above and to the soft shells of the tritons and then after sun set to skim on the surface of the waves round wild rocks and along sequestered shores where perhaps some pensive wanderer comes to weep Then would I soothe his sorrows with my sweet music and offer him from a shell some of the delicious fruit that hangs round Neptune s palace She was recalled from her reverie to a mere mortal supper and could not forbear smiling at the fancies she had been indulging and at her conviction of the serious displeasure which Madame Montoni would have expressed could she have been made acquainted with them After supper her aunt sat late but Montoni did not return and she at length retired to rest If Emily had admired the magnificence of the saloon she was not less surprised on observing the half furnished and forlorn appearance of the apartments she passed in the way to her chamber whither she went through long suites of noble rooms that seemed from their desolate aspect to have been unoccupied for many years On the walls of some were the faded remains of tapestry from others painted in fresco the damps had almost withdrawn both colours and design At length she reached her own chamber spacious desolate and lofty like the rest with high lattices that opened towards the Adriatic It brought gloomy images to her mind but the view of the Adriatic soon gave her others more airy among which was that of the sea nymph whose delights she had before amused herself with picturing and anxious to escape from serious reflections she now endeavoured to throw her fanciful ideas into a train and concluded the hour with composing the following lines THE SEA NYMPH Down down a thousand fathom deep Among the sounding seas I go Play round the foot of ev ry steep Whose cliffs above the ocean grow There within their secret cares I hear the mighty rivers roar And guide their streams through Neptune s waves To bless the green earth s inmost shore And bid the freshen d waters glide For fern crown d nymphs of lake or brook Through winding woods and pastures wide And many a wild romantic nook For this the nymphs at fall of eave Oft dance upon the flow ry banks And sing my name and garlands weave To bear beneath the wave their thanks In coral bow rs I love to lie And hear the surges roll above And through the waters view on high The proud ships sail and gay clouds move And oft at midnight s stillest hour When summer seas the vessel lave I love to prove my charmful pow r While floating on the moon light wave And when deep sleep the crew has bound And the sad lover musing leans O er the ship s side I breathe around Such strains as speak no mortal means O er the dim waves his searching eye Sees but the vessel s lengthen d shade Above the moon and azure sky Entranc d he hears and half afraid Sometimes a single note I swell That softly sweet at distance dies Then wake the magic of my shell And choral voices round me rise The trembling youth charm d by my strain Calls up the crew who silent bend O er the high deck but list in vain My song is hush d my wonders end Within the mountain s woody bay Where the tall bark at anchor rides At twilight hour with tritons gay I dance upon the lapsing tides And with my sister nymphs I sport Till the broad sun looks o er the floods Then swift we seek our crystal court Deep in the wave mid Neptune s woods In cool arcades and glassy halls We pass the sultry hours of noon Beyond wherever sun beam falls Weaving sea flowers in gay festoon The while we chant our ditties sweet To some soft shell that warbles near Join d by the murmuring currents fleet That glide along our halls so clear There the pale pearl and sapphire blue And ruby red and em rald green Dart from the domes a changing hue And sparry columns deck the scene When the dark storm scowls o er the deep And long long peals of thunder sound On some high cliff my watch I keep O er all the restless seas around Till on the ridgy wave afar Comes the lone vessel labouring slow Spreading the white foam in the air With sail and top mast bending low Then plunge I mid the ocean s roar My way by quiv ring lightnings shewn To guide the bark to peaceful shore And hush the sailor s fearful groan And if too late I reach its side To save it from the whelming surge I call my dolphins o er the tide To bear the crew where isles emerge Their mournful spirits soon I cheer While round the desert coast I go With warbled songs they faintly hear Oft as the stormy gust sinks low My music leads to lofty groves That wild upon the sea bank wave Where sweet fruits bloom and fresh spring roves And closing boughs the tempest brave Then from the air spirits obey My potent voice they love so well And on the clouds paint visions gay While strains more sweet at distance swell And thus the lonely hours I cheat Soothing the ship wreck d sailor s heart Till from the waves the storms retreat And o er the east the day beams dart Neptune for this oft binds me fast To rocks below with coral chain Till all the tempest s over past And drowning seamen cry in vain Whoe er ye are that love my lay Come when red sun set tints the wave To the still sands where fairies play There in cool seas I love to lave CHAPTER III He is a great observer and he looks Quite through the deeds of men he loves no plays he hears no music Seldom he smiles and smiles in such a sort As if he mock d himself and scorn d his spirit that could be mov d to smile at any thing Such men as he be never at heart s ease While they behold a greater than themselves JULIUS CAESAR Montoni and his companion did not return home till many hours after the dawn had blushed upon the Adriatic The airy groups which had danced all night along the colonnade of saint Mark dispersed before the morning like so many spirits Montoni had been otherwise engaged his soul was little susceptible of light pleasures He delighted in the energies of the passions the difficulties and tempests of life which wreck the happiness of others roused and strengthened all the powers of his mind and afforded him the highest enjoyments of which his nature was capable Without some object of strong interest life was to him little more than a sleep and when pursuits of real interest failed he substituted artificial ones till habit changed their nature and they ceased to be unreal Of this kind was the habit of gaming which he had adopted first for the purpose of relieving him from the languor of inaction but had since pursued with the ardour of passion In this occupation he had passed the night with Cavigni and a party of young men who had more money than rank and more vice than either Montoni despised the greater part of these for the inferiority of their talents rather than for their vicious inclinations and associated with them only to make them the instruments of his purposes Among these however were some of superior abilities and a few whom Montoni admitted to his intimacy but even towards these he still preserved a decisive and haughty air which while it imposed submission on weak and timid minds roused the fierce hatred of strong ones He had of course many and bitter enemies but the rancour of their hatred proved the degree of his power and as power was his chief aim he gloried more in such hatred than it was possible he could in being esteemed A feeling so tempered as that of esteem he despised and would have despised himself also had he thought himself capable of being flattered by it Among the few whom he distinguished were the Signors Bertolini Orsino and Verezzi The first was a man of gay temper strong passions dissipated and of unbounded extravagance but generous brave and unsuspicious Orsino was reserved and haughty loving power more than ostentation of a cruel and suspicious temper quick to feel an injury and relentless in avenging it cunning and unsearchable in contrivance patient and indefatigable in the execution of his schemes He had a perfect command of feature and of his passions of which he had scarcely any but pride revenge and avarice and in the gratification of these few considerations had power to restrain him few obstacles to withstand the depth of his stratagems This man was the chief favourite of Montoni Verezzi was a man of some talent of fiery imagination and the slave of alternate passions He was gay voluptuous and daring yet had neither perseverance or true courage and was meanly selfish in all his aims Quick to form schemes and sanguine in his hope of success he was the first to undertake and to abandon not only his own plans but those adopted from other persons Proud and impetuous he revolted against all subordination yet those who were acquainted with his character and watched the turn of his passions could lead him like a child Such were the friends whom Montoni introduced to his family and his table on the day after his arrival at Venice There were also of the party a Venetian nobleman Count Morano and a Signora Livona whom Montoni had introduced to his wife as a lady of distinguished merit and who having called in the morning to welcome her to Venice had been requested to be of the dinner party Madame Montoni received with a very ill grace the compliments of the Signors She disliked them because they were the friends of her husband hated them because she believed they had contributed to detain him abroad till so late an hour of the preceding morning and envied them since conscious of her own want of influence she was convinced that he preferred their society to her own The rank of Count Morano procured him that distinction which she refused to the rest of the company The haughty sullenness of her countenance and manner and the ostentatious extravagance of her dress for she had not yet adopted the Venetian habit were strikingly contrasted by the beauty modesty sweetness and simplicity of Emily who observed with more attention than pleasure the party around her The beauty and fascinating manners of Signora Livona however won her involuntary regard while the sweetness of her accents and her air of gentle kindness awakened with Emily those pleasing affections which so long had slumbered In the cool of the evening the party embarked in Montoni s gondola and rowed out upon the sea The red glow of sun set still touched the waves and lingered in the west where the melancholy gleam seemed slowly expiring while the dark blue of the upper aether began to twinkle with stars Emily sat given up to pensive and sweet emotions The smoothness of the water over which she glided its reflected images a new heaven and trembling stars below the waves with shadowy outlines of towers and porticos conspired with the stillness of the hour interrupted only by the passing wave or the notes of distant music to raise those emotions to enthusiasm As she listened to the measured sound of the oars and to the remote warblings that came in the breeze her softened mind returned to the memory of saint Aubert and to Valancourt and tears stole to her eyes The rays of the moon strengthening as the shadows deepened soon after threw a silvery gleam upon her countenance which was partly shaded by a thin black veil and touched it with inimitable softness Hers was the CONTOUR of a Madona with the sensibility of a Magdalen and the pensive uplifted eye with the tear that glittered on her cheek confirmed the expression of the character The last strain of distant music now died in air for the gondola was far upon the waves and the party determined to have music of their own The Count Morano who sat next to Emily and who had been observing her for some time in silence snatched up a lute and struck the chords with the finger of harmony herself while his voice a fine tenor accompanied them in a rondeau full of tender sadness To him indeed might have been applied that beautiful exhortation of an English poet had it then existed Strike up my master But touch the strings with a religious softness Teach sounds to languish through the night s dull ear Till Melancholy starts from off her couch And Carelessness grows concert to attention With such powers of expression the Count sung the following RONDEAU Soft as yon silver ray that sleeps Upon the ocean s trembling tide Soft as the air that lightly sweeps Yon sad that swells in stately pride Soft as the surge s stealing note That dies along the distant shores Or warbled strain that sinks remote So soft the sigh my bosom pours True as the wave to Cynthia s ray True as the vessel to the breeze True as the soul to music s sway Or music to Venetian seas Soft as yon silver beams that sleep Upon the ocean s trembling breast So soft so true fond Love shall weep So soft so true with THEE shall rest The cadence with which he returned from the last stanza to a repetition of the first the fine modulation in which his voice stole upon the first line and the pathetic energy with which it pronounced the last were such as only exquisite taste could give When he had concluded he gave the lute with a sigh to Emily who to avoid any appearance of affectation immediately began to play She sung a melancholy little air one of the popular songs of her native province with a simplicity and pathos that made it enchanting But its well known melody brought so forcibly to her fancy the scenes and the persons among which she had often heard it that her spirits were overcome her voice trembled and ceased and the strings of the lute were struck with a disordered hand till ashamed of the emotion she had betrayed she suddenly passed on to a song so gay and airy that the steps of the dance seemed almost to echo to the notes BRAVISSIMO burst instantly from the lips of her delighted auditors and she was compelled to repeat the air Among the compliments that followed those of the Count were not the least audible and they had not concluded when Emily gave the instrument to Signora Livona whose voice accompanied it with true Italian taste Afterwards the Count Emily Cavigni and the Signora sung canzonettes accompanied by a couple of lutes and a few other instruments Sometimes the instruments suddenly ceased and the voices dropped from the full swell of harmony into a low chant then after a deep pause they rose by degrees the instruments one by one striking up till the loud and full chorus soared again to heaven Meanwhile Montoni who was weary of this harmony was considering how he might disengage himself from his party or withdraw with such of it as would be willing to play to a Casino In a pause of the music he proposed returning to shore a proposal which Orsino eagerly seconded but which the Count and the other gentlemen as warmly opposed Montoni still meditated how he might excuse himself from longer attendance upon the Count for to him only he thought excuse necessary and how he might get to land till the gondolieri of an empty boat returning to Venice hailed his people Without troubling himself longer about an excuse he seized this opportunity of going thither and committing the ladies to the care of his friends departed with Orsino while Emily for the first time saw him go with regret for she considered his presence a protection though she knew not what she should fear He landed at saint Mark s and hurrying to a Casino was soon lost amidst a crowd of gamesters Meanwhile the Count having secretly dispatched a servant in Montoni s boat for his own gondola and musicians Emily heard without knowing his project the gay song of gondolieri approaching as they sat on the stern of the boat and saw the tremulous gleam of the moon light wave which their oars disturbed Presently she heard the sound of instruments and then a full symphony swelled on the air and the boats meeting the gondolieri hailed each other The count then explaining himself the party removed into his gondola which was embellished with all that taste could bestow While they partook of a collation of fruits and ice the whole band following at a distance in the other boat played the most sweet and enchanting strains and the Count who had again seated himself by Emily paid her unremitted attention and sometimes in a low but impassioned voice uttered compliments which she could not misunderstand To avoid them she conversed with Signora Livona and her manner to the Count assumed a mild reserve which though dignified was too gentle to repress his assiduities he could see hear speak to no person but Emily while Cavigni observed him now and then with a look of displeasure and Emily with one of uneasiness She now wished for nothing so much as to return to Venice but it was near mid night before the gondolas approached saint Mark s Place where the voice of gaiety and song was loud The busy hum of mingling sounds was heard at a considerable distance on the water and had not a bright moon light discovered the city with its terraces and towers a stranger would almost have credited the fabled wonders of Neptune s court and believed that the tumult arose from beneath the waves They landed at saint Mark s where the gaiety of the colonnades and the beauty of the night made Madame Montoni willingly submit to the Count s solicitations to join the promenade and afterwards to take a supper with the rest of the party at his Casino If any thing could have dissipated Emily s uneasiness it would have been the grandeur gaiety and novelty of the surrounding scene adorned with Palladio s palaces and busy with parties of masqueraders At length they withdrew to the Casino which was fitted up with infinite taste and where a splendid banquet was prepared but here Emily s reserve made the Count perceive that it was necessary for his interest to win the favour of Madame Montoni which from the condescension she had already shewn to him appeared to be an achievement of no great difficulty He transferred therefore part of his attention from Emily to her aunt who felt too much flattered by the distinction even to disguise her emotion and before the party broke up he had entirely engaged the esteem of Madame Montoni Whenever he addressed her her ungracious countenance relaxed into smiles and to whatever he proposed she assented He invited her with the rest of the party to take coffee in his box at the opera on the following evening and Emily heard the invitation accepted with strong anxiety concerning the means of excusing herself from attending Madame Montoni thither It was very late before their gondola was ordered and Emily s surprise was extreme when on quitting the Casino she beheld the broad sun rising out of the Adriatic while saint Mark s Place was yet crowded with company Sleep had long weighed heavily on her eyes but now the fresh sea breeze revived her and she would have quitted the scene with regret had not the Count been present performing the duty which he had imposed upon himself of escorting them home There they heard that Montoni was not yet returned and his wife retiring in displeasure to her apartment at length released Emily from the fatigue of further attendance Montoni came home late in the morning in a very ill humour having lost considerably at play and before he withdrew to rest had a private conference with Cavigni whose manner on the following day seemed to tell that the subject of it had not been pleasing to him In the evening Madame Montoni who during the day had observed a sullen silence towards her husband received visits from some Venetian ladies with whose sweet manners Emily was particularly charmed They had an air of ease and kindness towards the strangers as if they had been their familiar friends for years and their conversation was by turns tender sentimental and gay Madame though she had no taste for such conversation and whose coarseness and selfishness sometimes exhibited a ludicrous contrast to their excessive refinement could not remain wholly insensible to the captivations of their manner In a pause of conversation a lady who was called Signora Herminia took up a lute and began to play and sing with as much easy gaiety as if she had been alone Her voice was uncommonly rich in tone and various in expression yet she appeared to be entirely unconscious of its powers and meant nothing less than to display them She sung from the gaiety of her heart as she sat with her veil half thrown back holding gracefully the lute under the spreading foliage and flowers of some plants that rose from baskets and interlaced one of the lattices of the saloon Emily retiring a little from the company sketched her figure with the miniature scenery around her and drew a very interesting picture which though it would not perhaps have borne criticism had spirit and taste enough to awaken both the fancy and the heart When she had finished it she presented it to the beautiful original who was delighted with the offering as well as the sentiment it conveyed and assured Emily with a smile of captivating sweetness that she should preserve it as a pledge of her friendship In the evening Cavigni joined the ladies but Montoni had other engagements and they embarked in the gondola for saint Mark s where the same gay company seemed to flutter as on the preceding night The cool breeze the glassy sea the gentle sound of its waves and the sweeter murmur of distant music the lofty porticos and arcades and the happy groups that sauntered beneath them these with every feature and circumstance of the scene united to charm Emily no longer teased by the officious attentions of Count Morano But as she looked upon the moon light sea undulating along the walls of saint Mark and lingering for a moment over those walls caught the sweet and melancholy song of some gondolier as he sat in his boat below waiting for his master her softened mind returned to the memory of her home of her friends and of all that was dear in her native country After walking some time they sat down at the door of a Casino and while Cavigni was accommodating them with coffee and ice were joined by Count Morano He sought Emily with a look of impatient delight who remembering all the attention he had shewn her on the preceding evening was compelled as before to shrink from his assiduities into a timid reserve except when she conversed with Signora Herminia and the other ladies of her party It was near midnight before they withdrew to the opera where Emily was not so charmed but that when she remembered the scene she had just quitted she felt how infinitely inferior all the splendour of art is to the sublimity of nature Her heart was not now affected tears of admiration did not start to her eyes as when she viewed the vast expanse of ocean the grandeur of the heavens and listened to the rolling waters and to the faint music that at intervals mingled with their roar Remembering these the scene before her faded into insignificance Of the evening which passed on without any particular incident she wished the conclusion that she might escape from the attentions of the Count and as opposite qualities frequently attract each other in our thoughts thus Emily when she looked on Count Morano remembered Valancourt and a sigh sometimes followed the recollection Several weeks passed in the course of customary visits during which nothing remarkable occurred Emily was amused by the manners and scenes that surrounded her so different from those of France but where Count Morano too frequently for her comfort contrived to introduce himself His manner figure and accomplishments which were generally admired Emily would perhaps have admired also had her heart been disengaged from Valancourt and had the Count forborne to persecute her with officious attentions during which she observed some traits in his character that prejudiced her against whatever might otherwise be good in it Soon after his arrival at Venice Montoni received a packet from M Quesnel in which the latter mentioned the death of his wife s uncle at his villa on the Brenta and that in consequence of this event he should hasten to take possession of that estate and of other effects bequeathed to him This uncle was the brother of Madame Quesnel s late mother Montoni was related to her by the father s side and though he could have had neither claim nor expectation concerning these possessions he could scarcely conceal the envy which M Quesnel s letter excited Emily had observed with concern that since they left France Montoni had not even affected kindness towards her aunt and that after treating her at first with neglect he now met her with uniform ill humour and reserve She had never supposed that her aunt s foibles could have escaped the discernment of Montoni or that her mind or figure were of a kind to deserve his attention Her surprise therefore at this match had been extreme but since he had made the choice she did not suspect that he would so openly have discovered his contempt of it But Montoni who had been allured by the seeming wealth of Madame Cheron was now severely disappointed by her comparative poverty and highly exasperated by the deceit she had employed to conceal it till concealment was no longer necessary He had been deceived in an affair wherein he meant to be the deceiver out witted by the superior cunning of a woman whose understanding he despised and to whom he had sacrificed his pride and his liberty without saving himself from the ruin which had impended over his head Madame Montoni had contrived to have the greatest part of what she really did possess settled upon herself what remained though it was totally inadequate both to her husband s expectations and to his necessities he had converted into money and brought with him to Venice that he might a little longer delude society and make a last effort to regain the fortunes he had lost The hints which had been thrown out to Valancourt concerning Montoni s character and condition were too true but it was now left to time and occasion to unfold the circumstances both of what had and of what had not been hinted and to time and occasion we commit them Madame Montoni was not of a nature to bear injuries with meekness or to resent them with dignity her exasperated pride displayed itself in all the violence and acrimony of a little or at least of an ill regulated mind She would not acknowledge even to herself that she had in any degree provoked contempt by her duplicity but weakly persisted in believing that she alone was to be pitied and Montoni alone to be censured for as her mind had naturally little perception of moral obligation she seldom understood its force but when it happened to be violated towards herself her vanity had already been severely shocked by a discovery of Montoni s contempt it remained to be farther reproved by a discovery of his circumstances His mansion at Venice though its furniture discovered a part of the truth to unprejudiced persons told nothing to those who were blinded by a resolution to believe whatever they wished Madame Montoni still thought herself little less than a princess possessing a palace at Venice and a castle among the Apennines To the castle di Udolpho indeed Montoni sometimes talked of going for a few weeks to examine into its condition and to receive some rents for it appeared that he had not been there for two years and that during this period it had been inhabited only by an old servant whom he called his steward Emily listened to the mention of this journey with pleasure for she not only expected from it new ideas but a release from the persevering assiduities of Count Morano In the country too she would have leisure to think of Valancourt and to indulge the melancholy which his image and a recollection of the scenes of La Vallee always blessed with the memory of her parents awakened The ideal scenes were dearer and more soothing to her heart than all the splendour of gay assemblies they were a kind of talisman that expelled the poison of temporary evils and supported her hopes of happy days they appeared like a beautiful landscape lighted up by a gleam of sun shine and seen through a perspective of dark and rugged rocks But Count Morano did not long confine himself to silent assiduities he declared his passion to Emily and made proposals to Montoni who encouraged though Emily rejected him with Montoni for his friend and an abundance of vanity to delude him he did not despair of success Emily was astonished and highly disgusted at his perseverance after she had explained her sentiments with a frankness that would not allow him to misunderstand them He now passed the greater part of his time at Montoni s dining there almost daily and attending Madame and Emily wherever they went and all this notwithstanding the uniform reserve of Emily whose aunt seemed as anxious as Montoni to promote this marriage and would never dispense with her attendance at any assembly where the Count proposed to be present Montoni now said nothing of his intended journey of which Emily waited impatiently to hear and he was seldom at home but when the Count or Signor Orsino was there for between himself and Cavigni a coolness seemed to subsist though the latter remained in his house With Orsino Montoni was frequently closeted for hours together and whatever might be the business upon which they consulted it appeared to be of consequence since Montoni often sacrificed to it his favourite passion for play and remained at home the whole night There was somewhat of privacy too in the manner of Orsino s visits which had never before occurred and which excited not only surprise but some degree of alarm in Emily s mind who had unwillingly discovered much of his character when he had most endeavoured to disguise it After these visits Montoni was often more thoughtful than usual sometimes the deep workings of his mind entirely abstracted him from surrounding objects and threw a gloom over his visage that rendered it terrible at others his eyes seemed almost to flash fire and all the energies of his soul appeared to be roused for some great enterprise Emily observed these written characters of his thoughts with deep interest and not without some degree of awe when she considered that she was entirely in his power but forbore even to hint her fears or her observations to Madame Montoni who discerned nothing in her husband at these times but his usual sternness A second letter from M Quesnel announced the arrival of himself and his lady at the Villa Miarenti stated several circumstances of his good fortune respecting the affair that had brought him into Italy and concluded with an earnest request to see Montoni his wife and niece at his new estate Emily received about the same period a much more interesting letter and which soothed for a while every anxiety of her heart Valancourt hoping she might be still at Venice had trusted a letter to the ordinary post that told her of his health and of his unceasing and anxious affection He had lingered at Tholouse for some time after her departure that he might indulge the melancholy pleasure of wandering through the scenes where he had been accustomed to behold her and had thence gone to his brother s chateau which was in the neighbourhood of La Vallee Having mentioned this he added If the duty of attending my regiment did not require my departure I know not when I should have resolution enough to quit the neighbourhood of a place which is endeared by the remembrance of you The vicinity to La Vallee has alone detained me thus long at Estuviere I frequently ride thither early in the morning that I may wander at leisure through the day among scenes which were once your home where I have been accustomed to see you and to hear you converse I have renewed my acquaintance with the good old Theresa who rejoiced to see me that she might talk of you I need not say how much this circumstance attached me to her or how eagerly I listened to her upon her favourite subject You will guess the motive that first induced me to make myself known to Theresa it was indeed no other than that of gaining admittance into the chateau and gardens which my Emily had so lately inhabited here then I wander and meet your image under every shade but chiefly I love to sit beneath the spreading branches of your favourite plane where once Emily we sat together where I first ventured to tell you that I loved O Emily the remembrance of those moments overcomes me I sit lost in reverie I endeavour to see you dimly through my tears in all the heaven of peace and innocence such as you then appeared to me to hear again the accents of that voice which then thrilled my heart with tenderness and hope I lean on the wall of the terrace where we together watched the rapid current of the Garonne below while I described the wild scenery about its source but thought only of you O Emily are these moments passed for ever will they never more return In another part of his letter he wrote thus You see my letter is dated on many different days and if you look back to the first you will perceive that I began to write soon after your departure from France To write was indeed the only employment that withdrew me from my own melancholy and rendered your absence supportable or rather it seemed to destroy absence for when I was conversing with you on paper and telling you every sentiment and affection of my heart you almost appeared to be present This employment has been from time to time my chief consolation and I have deferred sending off my packet merely for the comfort of prolonging it though it was certain that what I had written was written to no purpose till you received it Whenever my mind has been more than usually depressed I have come to pour forth its sorrows to you and have always found consolation and when any little occurrence has interested my heart and given a gleam of joy to my spirits I have hastened to communicate it to you and have received reflected satisfaction Thus my letter is a kind of picture of my life and of my thoughts for the last month and thus though it has been deeply interesting to me while I wrote it and I dare hope will for the same reason be not indifferent to you yet to other readers it would seem to abound only in frivolities Thus it is always when we attempt to describe the finer movements of the heart for they are too fine to be discerned they can only be experienced and are therefore passed over by the indifferent observer while the interested one feels that all description is imperfect and unnecessary except as it may prove the sincerity of the writer and sooth his own sufferings You will pardon all this egotism for I am a lover I have just heard of a circumstance which entirely destroys all my fairy paradise of ideal delight and which will reconcile me to the necessity of returning to my regiment for I must no longer wander beneath the beloved shades where I have been accustomed to meet you in thought La Vallee is let I have reason to believe this is without your knowledge from what Theresa told me this morning and therefore I mention the circumstance She shed tears while she related that she was going to leave the service of her dear mistress and the chateau where she had lived so many happy years and all this added she without even a letter from Mademoiselle to soften the news but it is all Mons Quesnel s doings and I dare say she does not even know what is going forward Theresa added That she had received a letter from him informing her the chateau was let and that as her services would no longer be required she must quit the place on that day week when the new tenant would arrive Theresa had been surprised by a visit from M Quesnel some time before the receipt of this letter who was accompanied by a stranger that viewed the premises with much curiosity Towards the conclusion of his letter which is dated a week after this sentence Valancourt adds I have received a summons from my regiment and I join it without regret since I am shut out from the scenes that are so interesting to my heart I rode to La Vallee this morning and heard that the new tenant was arrived and that Theresa was gone I should not treat the subject thus familiarly if I did not believe you to be uninformed of this disposal of your house for your satisfaction I have endeavoured to learn something of the character and fortune of your tenant but without success He is a gentleman they say and this is all I can hear The place as I wandered round the boundaries appeared more melancholy to my imagination than I had ever seen it I wished earnestly to have got admittance that I might have taken another leave of your favourite plane tree and thought of you once more beneath its shade but I forbore to tempt the curiosity of strangers the fishing house in the woods however was still open to me thither I went and passed an hour which I cannot even look back upon without emotion O Emily surely we are not separated for ever surely we shall live for each other This letter brought many tears to Emily s eyes tears of tenderness and satisfaction on learning that Valancourt was well and that time and absence had in no degree effaced her image from his heart There were passages in this letter which particularly affected her such as those describing his visits to La Vallee and the sentiments of delicate affection that its scenes had awakened It was a considerable time before her mind was sufficiently abstracted from Valancourt to feel the force of his intelligence concerning La Vallee That Mons Quesnel should let it without even consulting her on the measure both surprised and shocked her particularly as it proved the absolute authority he thought himself entitled to exercise in her affairs It is true he had proposed before she left France that the chateau should be let during her absence and to the oeconomical prudence of this she had nothing to object but the committing what had been her father s villa to the power and caprice of strangers and the depriving herself of a sure home should any unhappy circumstances make her look back to her home as an asylum were considerations that made her even then strongly oppose the measure Her father too in his last hour had received from her a solemn promise never to dispose of La Vallee and this she considered as in some degree violated if she suffered the place to be let But it was now evident with how little respect M Quesnel had regarded these objections and how insignificant he considered every obstacle to pecuniary advantage It appeared also that he had not even condescended to inform Montoni of the step he had taken since no motive was evident for Montoni s concealing the circumstance from her if it had been made known to him this both displeased and surprised her but the chief subjects of her uneasiness were the temporary disposal of La Vallee and the dismission of her father s old and faithful servant Poor Theresa said Emily thou hadst not saved much in thy servitude for thou wast always tender towards the poor and believd saint thou shouldst die in the family where thy best years had been spent Poor Theresa now thou art turned out in thy old age to seek thy bread Emily wept bitterly as these thoughts passed over her mind and she determined to consider what could be done for Theresa and to talk very explicitly to M Quesnel on the subject but she much feared that his cold heart could feel only for itself She determined also to enquire whether he had made any mention of her affairs in his letter to Montoni who soon gave her the opportunity she sought by desiring that she would attend him in his study She had little doubt that the interview was intended for the purpose of communicating to her a part of M Quesnel s letter concerning the transactions at La Vallee and she obeyed him immediately Montoni was alone I have just been writing to Mons Quesnel said he when Emily appeared in reply to the letter I received from him a few days ago and I wished to talk to you upon a subject that occupied part of it I also wished to speak with you on this topic sir said Emily It is a subject of some interest to you undoubtedly rejoined Montoni and I think you must see it in the light that I do indeed it will not bear any other I trust you will agree with me that any objection founded on sentiment as they call it ought to yield to circumstances of solid advantage Granting this sir replied Emily modestly those of humanity ought surely to be attended to But I fear it is now too late to deliberate upon this plan and I must regret that it is no longer in my power to reject it It is too late said Montoni but since it is so I am pleased to observe that you submit to reason and necessity without indulging useless complaint I applaud this conduct exceedingly the more perhaps since it discovers a strength of mind seldom observable in your sex When you are older you will look back with gratitude to the friends who assisted in rescuing you from the romantic illusions of sentiment and will perceive that they are only the snares of childhood and should be vanquished the moment you escape from the nursery I have not closed my letter and you may add a few lines to inform your uncle of your acquiescence You will soon see him for it is my intention to take you with Madame Montoni in a few days to Miarenti and you can then talk over the affair Emily wrote on the opposite page of the paper as follows It is now useless sir for me to remonstrate upon the circumstances of which Signor Montoni informs me that he has written I could have wished at least that the affair had been concluded with less precipitation that I might have taught myself to subdue some prejudices as the Signor calls them which still linger in my heart As it is I submit In point of prudence nothing certainly can be objected but though I submit I have yet much to say on some other points of the subject when I shall have the honour of seeing you In the meantime I entreat you will take care of Theresa for the sake of Sir Your affectionate niece EMILY saint AUBERT Montoni smiled satirically at what Emily had written but did not object to it and she withdrew to her own apartment where she sat down to begin a letter to Valancourt in which she related the particulars of her journey and her arrival at Venice described some of the most striking scenes in the passage over the Alps her emotions on her first view of Italy the manners and characters of the people around her and some few circumstances of Montoni s conduct But she avoided even naming Count Morano much more the declaration he had made since she well knew how tremblingly alive to fear is real love how jealously watchful of every circumstance that may affect its interest and she scrupulously avoided to give Valancourt even the slightest reason for believing he had a rival On the following day Count Morano dined again at Montoni s He was in an uncommon flow of spirits and Emily thought there was somewhat of exultation in his manner of addressing her which she had never observed before She endeavoured to repress this by more than her usual reserve but the cold civility of her air now seemed rather to encourage than to depress him He appeared watchful of an opportunity of speaking with her alone and more than once solicited this but Emily always replied that she could hear nothing from him which he would be unwilling to repeat before the whole company In the evening Madame Montoni and her party went out upon the sea and as the Count led Emily to his zendaletto he carried her hand to his lips and thanked her for the condescension she had shown him Emily in extreme surprise and displeasure hastily withdrew her hand and concluded that he had spoken ironically but on reaching the steps of the terrace and observing by the livery that it was the Count s zendaletto which waited below while the rest of the party having arranged themselves in the gondolas were moving on she determined not to permit a separate conversation and wishing him a good evening returned to the portico The Count followed to expostulate and entreat and Montoni who then came out rendered solicitation unnecessary for without condescending to speak he took her hand and led her to the zendaletto Emily was not silent she entreated Montoni in a low voice to consider the impropriety of these circumstances and that he would spare her the mortification of submitting to them he however was inflexible This caprice is intolerable said he and shall not be indulged there is no impropriety in the case At this moment Emily s dislike of Count Morano rose to abhorrence That he should with undaunted assurance thus pursue her notwithstanding all she had expressed on the subject of his addresses and think as it was evident he did that her opinion of him was of no consequence so long as his pretensions were sanctioned by Montoni added indignation to the disgust which she had felt towards him She was somewhat relieved by observing that Montoni was to be of the party who seated himself on one side of her while Morano placed himself on the other There was a pause for some moments as the gondolieri prepared their oars and Emily trembled from apprehension of the discourse that might follow this silence At length she collected courage to break it herself in the hope of preventing fine speeches from Morano and reproof from Montoni To some trivial remark which she made the latter returned a short and disobliging reply but Morano immediately followed with a general observation which he contrived to end with a particular compliment and though Emily passed it without even the notice of a smile he was not discouraged I have been impatient said he addressing Emily to express my gratitude to thank you for your goodness but I must also thank Signor Montoni who has allowed me this opportunity of doing so Emily regarded the Count with a look of mingled astonishment and displeasure Why continued he should you wish to diminish the delight of this moment by that air of cruel reserve Why seek to throw me again into the perplexities of doubt by teaching your eyes to contradict the kindness of your late declaration You cannot doubt the sincerity the ardour of my passion it is therefore unnecessary charming Emily surely unnecessary any longer to attempt a disguise of your sentiments If I ever had disguised them sir said Emily with recollected spirit it would certainly be unnecessary any longer to do so I had hoped sir that you would have spared me any farther necessity of alluding to them but since you do not grant this hear me declare and for the last time that your perseverance has deprived you even of the esteem which I was inclined to believe you merited Astonishing exclaimed Montoni this is beyond even my expectation though I have hitherto done justice to the caprice of the sex But you will observe Mademoiselle Emily that I am no lover though Count Morano is and that I will not be made the amusement of your capricious moments Here is the offer of an alliance which would do honour to any family yours you will recollect is not noble you long resisted my remonstrances but my honour is now engaged and it shall not be trifled with You shall adhere to the declaration which you have made me an agent to convey to the Count I must certainly mistake you sir said Emily my answers on the subject have been uniform it is unworthy of you to accuse me of caprice If you have condescended to be my agent it is an honour I did not solicit I myself have constantly assured Count Morano and you also sir that I never can accept the honour he offers me and I now repeat the declaration The Count looked with an air of surprise and enquiry at Montoni whose countenance also was marked with surprise but it was surprise mingled with indignation Here is confidence as well as caprice said the latter Will you deny your own words Madam Such a question is unworthy of an answer sir said Emily blushing you will recollect yourself and be sorry that you have asked it Speak to the point rejoined Montoni in a voice of increasing vehemence Will you deny your own words will you deny that you acknowledged only a few hours ago that it was too late to recede from your engagements and that you accepted the Count s hand I will deny all this for no words of mine ever imported it Astonishing Will you deny what you wrote to Mons Quesnel your uncle if you do your own hand will bear testimony against you What have you now to say continued Montoni observing the silence and confusion of Emily I now perceive sir that you are under a very great error and that I have been equally mistaken No more duplicity I entreat be open and candid if it be possible I have always been so sir and can claim no merit in such conduct for I have had nothing to conceal How is this Signor cried Morano with trembling emotion Suspend your judgment Count replied Montoni the wiles of a female heart are unsearchable Now Madame your EXPLANATION Excuse me sir if I withhold my explanation till you appear willing to give me your confidence assertion as present can only subject me to insult Your explanation I entreat you said Morano Well well rejoined Montoni I give you my confidence let us hear this explanation Let me lead to it then by asking a question As many as you please said Montoni contemptuously What then was the subject of your letter to Mons Quesnel The same that was the subject of your note to him certainly You did well to stipulate for my confidence before you demanded that question I must beg you will be more explicit sir what was that subject What could it be but the noble offer of Count Morano said Montoni Then sir we entirely misunderstood each other replied Emily We entirely misunderstood each other too I suppose rejoined Montoni in the conversation which preceded the writing of that note I must do you the justice to own that you are very ingenious at this same art of misunderstanding Emily tried to restrain the tears that came to her eyes and to answer with becoming firmness Allow me sir to explain myself fully or to be wholly silent The explanation may now be dispensed with it is anticipated If Count Morano still thinks one necessary I will give him an honest one You have changed your intention since our last conversation and if he can have patience and humility enough to wait till to morrow he will probably find it changed again but as I have neither the patience or the humility which you expect from a lover I warn you of the effect of my displeasure Montoni you are too precipitate said the Count who had listened to this conversation in extreme agitation and impatience Signora I entreat your own explanation of this affair Signor Montoni has said justly replied Emily that all explanation may now be dispensed with after what has passed I cannot suffer myself to give one It is sufficient for me and for you sir that I repeat my late declaration let me hope this is the last time it will be necessary for me to repeat it I never can accept the honour of your alliance Charming Emily exclaimed the Count in an impassioned tone let not resentment make you unjust let me not suffer for the offence of Montoni Revoke Offence interrupted Montoni Count this language is ridiculous this submission is childish speak as becomes a man not as the slave of a pretty tyrant You distract me Signor suffer me to plead my own cause you have already proved insufficient to it All conversation on this subject sir said Emily is worse than useless since it can bring only pain to each of us if you would oblige me pursue it no farther It is impossible Madam that I can thus easily resign the object of a passion which is the delight and torment of my life I must still love still pursue you with unremitting ardour when you shall be convinced of the strength and constancy of my passion your heart must soften into pity and repentance Is this generous sir is this manly can it either deserve or obtain the esteem you solicit thus to continue a persecution from which I have no present means of escaping A gleam of moonlight that fell upon Morano s countenance revealed the strong emotions of his soul and glancing on Montoni discovered the dark resentment which contrasted his features By heaven this is too much suddenly exclaimed the Count Signor Montoni you treat me ill it is from you that I shall look for explanation From me sir you shall have it muttered Montoni if your discernment is indeed so far obscured by passion as to make explanation necessary And for you Madam you should learn that a man of honour is not to be trifled with though you may perhaps with impunity treat a BOY like a puppet This sarcasm roused the pride of Morano and the resentment which he had felt at the indifference of Emily being lost in indignation of the insolence of Montoni he determined to mortify him by defending her This also said he replying to Montoni s last words this also shall not pass unnoticed I bid you learn sir that you have a stronger enemy than a woman to contend with I will protect Signora saint Aubert from your threatened resentment You have misled me and would revenge your disappointed views upon the innocent Misled you retorted Montoni with quickness is my conduct my word then pausing while he seemed endeavouring to restrain the resentment that flashed in his eyes in the next moment he added in a subdued voice Count Morano this is a language a sort of conduct to which I am not accustomed it is the conduct of a passionate boy as such I pass it over in contempt In contempt Signor The respect I owe myself rejoined Montoni requires that I should converse more largely with you upon some points of the subject in dispute Return with me to Venice and I will condescend to convince you of your error Condescend sir but I will not condescend to be so conversed with Montoni smiled contemptuously and Emily now terrified for the consequences of what she saw and heard could no longer be silent She explained the whole subject upon which she had mistaken Montoni in the morning declaring that she understood him to have consulted her solely concerning the disposal of La Vallee and concluding with entreating that he would write immediately to M Quesnel and rectify the mistake But Montoni either was or affected to be still incredulous and Count Morano was still entangled in perplexity While she was speaking however the attention of her auditors had been diverted from the immediate occasion of their resentment and their passion consequently became less Montoni desired the Count would order his servants to row back to Venice that he might have some private conversation with him and Morano somewhat soothed by his softened voice and manner and eager to examine into the full extent of his difficulties complied Emily comforted by this prospect of release employed the present moments in endeavouring with conciliating care to prevent any fatal mischief between the persons who so lately had persecuted and insulted her Her spirits revived when she heard once more the voice of song and laughter resounding from the grand canal and at length entered again between its stately piazzas The zendaletto stopped at Montoni s mansion and the Count hastily led her into the hall where Montoni took his arm and said something in a low voice on which Morano kissed the hand he held notwithstanding Emily s effort to disengage it and wishing her a good evening with an accent and look she could not misunderstand returned to his zendaletto with Montoni Emily in her own apartment considered with intense anxiety all the unjust and tyrannical conduct of Montoni the dauntless perseverance of Morano and her own desolate situation removed from her friends and country She looked in vain to Valancourt confined by his profession to a distant kingdom as her protector but it gave her comfort to know that there was at least one person in the world who would sympathize in her afflictions and whose wishes would fly eagerly to release her Yet she determined not to give him unavailing pain by relating the reasons she had to regret the having rejected his better judgment concerning Montoni reasons however which could not induce her to lament the delicacy and disinterested affection that had made her reject his proposal for a clandestine marriage The approaching interview with her uncle she regarded with some degree of hope for she determined to represent to him the distresses of her situation and to entreat that he would allow her to return to France with him and Madame Quesnel Then suddenly remembering that her beloved La Vallee her only home was no longer at her command her tears flowed anew and she feared that she had little pity to expect from a man who like M Quesnel could dispose of it without deigning to consult with her and could dismiss an aged and faithful servant destitute of either support or asylum But though it was certain that she had herself no longer a home in France and few very few friends there she determined to return if possible that she might be released from the power of Montoni whose particularly oppressive conduct towards herself and general character as to others were justly terrible to her imagination She had no wish to reside with her uncle M Quesnel since his behaviour to her late father and to herself had been uniformly such as to convince her that in flying to him she could only obtain an exchange of oppressors neither had she the slightest intention of consenting to the proposal of Valancourt for an immediate marriage though this would give her a lawful and a generous protector for the chief reasons which had formerly influenced her conduct still existed against it while others which seemed to justify the step would not be done away and his interest his fame were at all times too dear to her to suffer her to consent to a union which at this early period of their lives would probably defeat both One sure and proper asylum however would still be open to her in France She knew that she could board in the convent where she had formerly experienced so much kindness and which had an affecting and solemn claim upon her heart since it contained the remains of her late father Here she could remain in safety and tranquillity till the term for which La Vallee might be let should expire or till the arrangement of M Motteville s affairs enabled her so far to estimate the remains of her fortune as to judge whether it would be prudent for her to reside there Concerning Montoni s conduct with respect to his letters to M Quesnel she had many doubts however he might be at first mistaken on the subject she much suspected that he wilfully persevered in his error as a means of intimidating her into a compliance with his wishes of uniting her to Count Morano Whether this was or was not the fact she was extremely anxious to explain the affair to M Quesnel and looked forward with a mixture of impatience hope and fear to her approaching visit On the following day Madame Montoni being alone with Emily introduced the mention of Count Morano by expressing her surprise that she had not joined the party on the water the preceding evening and at her abrupt departure to Venice Emily then related what had passed expressed her concern for the mutual mistake that had occurred between Montoni and herself and solicited her aunt s kind offices in urging him to give a decisive denial to the count s further addresses but she soon perceived that Madame Montoni had not been ignorant of the late conversation when she introduced the present You have no encouragement to expect from me said her aunt in these notions I have already given my opinion on the subject and think Signor Montoni right in enforcing by any means your consent If young persons will be blind to their interest and obstinately oppose it why the greatest blessings they can have are friends who will oppose their folly Pray what pretensions of any kind do you think you have to such a match as is now offered you Not any whatever Madam replied Emily and therefore at least suffer me to be happy in my humility Nay niece it cannot be denied that you have pride enough my poor brother your father had his share of pride too though let me add his fortune did not justify it Emily somewhat embarrassed by the indignation which this malevolent allusion to her father excited and by the difficulty of rendering her answer as temperate as it should be reprehensive hesitated for some moments in a confusion which highly gratified her aunt At length she said My father s pride Madam had a noble object the happiness which he knew could be derived only from goodness knowledge and charity As it never consisted in his superiority in point of fortune to some persons it was not humbled by his inferiority in that respect to others He never disdained those who were wretched by poverty and misfortune he did sometimes despise persons who with many opportunities of happiness rendered themselves miserable by vanity ignorance and cruelty I shall think it my highest glory to emulate such pride I do not pretend to understand any thing of these high flown sentiments niece you have all that glory to yourself I would teach you a little plain sense and not have you so wise as to despise happiness That would indeed not be wisdom but folly said Emily for wisdom can boast no higher attainment than happiness but you will allow Madam that our ideas of happiness may differ I cannot doubt that you wish me to be happy but I must fear you are mistaken in the means of making me so I cannot boast of a learned education niece such as your father thought proper to give you and therefore do not pretend to understand all these fine speeches about happiness I must be contented to understand only common sense and happy would it have been for you and your father if that had been included in his education Emily was too much shocked by these reflections on her father s memory to despise this speech as it deserved Madame Montoni was about to speak but Emily quitted the room and retired to her own where the little spirit she had lately exerted yielded to grief and vexation and left her only to her tears From every review of her situation she could derive indeed only new sorrow To the discovery which had just been forced upon her of Montoni s unworthiness she had now to add that of the cruel vanity for the gratification of which her aunt was about to sacrifice her of the effrontery and cunning with which at the time that she meditated the sacrifice she boasted of her tenderness or insulted her victim and of the venomous envy which as it did not scruple to attack her father s character could scarcely be expected to withhold from her own During the few days that intervened between this conversation and the departure for Miarenti Montoni did not once address himself to Emily His looks sufficiently declared his resentment but that he should forbear to renew a mention of the subject of it exceedingly surprised her who was no less astonished that during three days Count Morano neither visited Montoni or was named by him Several conjectures arose in her mind Sometimes she feared that the dispute between them had been revived and had ended fatally to the Count Sometimes she was inclined to hope that weariness or disgust at her firm rejection of his suit had induced him to relinquish it and at others she suspected that he had now recourse to stratagem and forbore his visits and prevailed with Montoni to forbear the repetition of his name in the expectation that gratitude and generosity would prevail with her to give him the consent which he could not hope from love Thus passed the time in vain conjecture and alternate hopes and fears till the day arrived when Montoni was to set out for the villa of Miarenti which like the preceding ones neither brought the Count or the mention of him Montoni having determined not to leave Venice till towards evening that he might avoid the heats and catch the cool breezes of night embarked about an hour before sun set with his family in a barge for the Brenta Emily sat alone near the stern of the vessel and as it floated slowly on watched the gay and lofty city lessening from her view till its palaces seemed to sink in the distant waves while its loftier towers and domes illumined by the declining sun appeared on the horizon like those far seen clouds which in more northern climes often linger on the western verge and catch the last light of a summer s evening Soon after even these grew dim and faded in distance from her sight but she still sat gazing on the vast scene of cloudless sky and mighty waters and listening in pleasing awe to the deep sounding waves while as her eyes glanced over the Adriatic towards the opposite shores which were however far beyond the reach of sight she thought of Greece and a thousand classical remembrances stealing to her mind she experienced that pensive luxury which is felt on viewing the scenes of ancient story and on comparing their present state of silence and solitude with that of their former grandeur and animation The scenes of the Illiad illapsed in glowing colours to her fancy scenes once the haunt of heroes now lonely and in ruins but which still shone in the poet s strain in all their youthful splendour As her imagination painted with melancholy touches the deserted plains of Troy such as they appeared in this after day she reanimated the landscape with the following little story STANZAS O er Ilion s plains where once the warrior bled And once the poet rais d his deathless strain O er Ilion s plains a weary driver led His stately camels For the ruin d fane Wide round the lonely scene his glance he threw For now the red cloud faded in the west And twilight o er the silent landscape drew Her deep ning veil eastward his course he prest There on the grey horizon s glimm ring bound Rose the proud columns of deserted Troy And wandering shepherds now a shelter found Within those walls where princes wont to joy Beneath a lofty porch the driver pass d Then from his camels heav d the heavy load Partook with them the simple cool repast And in short vesper gave himself to God From distant lands with merchandise he came His all of wealth his patient servants bore Oft deep drawn sighs his anxious wish proclaim To reach again his happy cottage door For there his wife his little children dwell Their smiles shall pay the toil of many an hour Ev n now warm tears to expectation swell As fancy o er his mind extends her pow r A death like stillness reign d where once the song The song of heroes wak d the midnight air Save when a solemn murmur roll d along That seem d to say for future worlds prepare For Time s imperious voice was frequent heard Shaking the marble temple to its fall By hands he long had conquer d vainly rear d And distant ruins answer d to his call While Hamet slept his camels round him lay Beneath him all his store of wealth was piled And here his cruse and empty wallet lay And there the flute that chear d him in the wild The robber Tartar on his slumber stole For o er the waste at eve he watch d his train Ah who his thirst of plunder shall control Who calls on him for mercy calls in vain A poison d poignard in his belt he wore A crescent sword depended at his side The deathful quiver at his back he bore And infants at his very look had died The moon s cold beam athwart the temple fell And to his sleeping prey the Tartar led But soft a startled camel shook his bell Then stretch d his limbs and rear d his drowsy head Hamet awoke the poignard glitter d high Swift from his couch he sprung and scap d the blow When from an unknown hand the arrows fly That lay the ruffian in his vengeance low He groan d he died from forth a column d gate A fearful shepherd pale and silent crept Who as he watch d his folded flock star late Had mark d the robber steal where Hamet slept He fear d his own and sav d a stranger s life Poor Hamet clasp d him to his grateful heart Then rous d his camels for the dusty strife And with the shepherd hasten d to depart And now aurora breathes her fresh ning gale And faintly trembles on the eastern cloud And now the sun from under twilight s veil Looks gaily forth and melts her airy shroud Wide o er the level plains his slanting beams Dart their long lines on Ilion s tower d site The distant Hellespont with morning gleams And old Scamander winds his waves in light All merry sound the camel bells so gay And merry beats fond Hamet s heart for he E er the dim evening steals upon the day His children wife and happy home shall see As Emily approached the shores of Italy she began to discriminate the rich features and varied colouring of the landscape the purple hills groves of orange pine and cypress shading magnificent villas and towns rising among vineyards and plantations The noble Brenta pouring its broad waves into the sea now appeared and when she reached its mouth the barge stopped that the horses might be fastened which were now to tow it up the stream This done Emily gave a last look to the Adriatic and to the dim sail that from the sky mix d wave Dawns on the sight and the barge slowly glided between the green and luxuriant slopes of the river The grandeur of the Palladian villas that adorn these shores was considerably heightened by the setting rays which threw strong contrasts of light and shade upon the porticos and long arcades and beamed a mellow lustre upon the orangeries and the tall groves of pine and cypress that overhung the buildings The scent of oranges of flowering myrtles and other odoriferous plants was diffused upon the air and often from these embowered retreats a strain of music stole on the calm and softened into silence The sun now sunk below the horizon twilight fell over the landscape and Emily wrapt in musing silence continued to watch its features gradually vanishing into obscurity She remembered her many happy evenings when with saint Aubert she had observed the shades of twilight steal over a scene as beautiful as this from the gardens of La Vallee and a tear fell to the memory of her father Her spirits were softened into melancholy by the influence of the hour by the low murmur of the wave passing under the vessel and the stillness of the air that trembled only at intervals with distant music why else should she at these moments have looked on her attachment to Valancourt with presages so very afflicting since she had but lately received letters from him that had soothed for a while all her anxieties It now seemed to her oppressed mind that she had taken leave of him for ever and that the countries which separated them would never more be re traced by her She looked upon Count Morano with horror as in some degree the cause of this but apart from him a conviction if such that may be called which arises from no proof and which she knew not how to account for seized her mind that she should never see Valancourt again Though she knew that neither Morano s solicitations nor Montoni s commands had lawful power to enforce her obedience she regarded both with a superstitious dread that they would finally prevail Lost in this melancholy reverie and shedding frequent tears Emily was at length roused by Montoni and she followed him to the cabin where refreshments were spread and her aunt was seated alone The countenance of Madame Montoni was inflamed with resentment that appeared to be the consequence of some conversation she had held with her husband who regarded her with a kind of sullen disdain and both preserved for some time a haughty silence Montoni then spoke to Emily of Mons Quesnel You will not I hope persist in disclaiming your knowledge of the subject of my letter to him I had hoped sir that it was no longer necessary for me to disclaim it said Emily I had hoped from your silence that you was convinced of your error You have hoped impossibilities then replied Montoni I might as reasonably have expected to find sincerity and uniformity of conduct in one of your sex as you to convict me of error in this affair Emily blushed and was silent she now perceived too clearly that she had hoped an impossibility for where no mistake had been committed no conviction could follow and it was evident that Montoni s conduct had not been the consequence of mistake but of design Anxious to escape from conversation which was both afflicting and humiliating to her she soon returned to the deck and resumed her station near the stern without apprehension of cold for no vapour rose from the water and the air was dry and tranquil here at least the benevolence of nature allowed her the quiet which Montoni had denied her elsewhere It was now past midnight The stars shed a kind of twilight that served to shew the dark outline of the shores on either hand and the grey surface of the river till the moon rose from behind a high palm grove and shed her mellow lustre over the scene The vessel glided smoothly on amid the stillness of the hour Emily heard now and then the solitary voice of the barge men on the bank as they spoke to their horses while from a remote part of the vessel with melancholy song The sailor sooth d Beneath the trembling moon the midnight wave Emily meanwhile anticipated her reception by Mons and Madame Quesnel considered what she should say on the subject of La Vallee and then to with hold her mind from more anxious topics tried to amuse herself by discriminating the faint drawn features of the landscape reposing in the moon light While her fancy thus wandered she saw at a distance a building peeping between the moon light trees and as the barge approached heard voices speaking and soon distinguished the lofty portico of a villa overshadowed by groves of pine and sycamore which she recollected to be the same that had formerly been pointed out to her as belonging to Madame Quesnel s relative The barge stopped at a flight of marble steps which led up the bank to a lawn Lights appeared between some pillars beyond the portico Montoni sent forward his servant and then disembarked with his family They found Mons and Madame Quesnel with a few friends seated on sofas in the portico enjoying the cool breeze of the night and eating fruits and ices while some of their servants at a little distance on the river s bank were performing a simple serenade Emily was now accustomed to the way of living in this warm country and was not surprised to find Mons and Madame Quesnel in their portico two hours after midnight The usual salutations being over the company seated themselves in the portico and refreshments were brought them from the adjoining hall where a banquet was spread and servants attended When the bustle of this meeting had subsided and Emily had recovered from the little flutter into which it had thrown her spirits she was struck with the singular beauty of the hall so perfectly accommodated to the luxuries of the season It was of white marble and the roof rising into an open cupola was supported by columns of the same material Two opposite sides of the apartment terminating in open porticos admitted to the hall a full view of the gardens and of the river scenery in the centre a fountain continually refreshed the air and seemed to heighten the fragrance that breathed from the surrounding orangeries while its dashing waters gave an agreeable and soothing sound Etruscan lamps suspended from the pillars diffused a brilliant light over the interior part of the hall leaving the remoter porticos to the softer lustre of the moon Mons Quesnel talked apart to Montoni of his own affairs in his usual strain of self importance boasted of his new acquisitions and then affected to pity some disappointments which Montoni had lately sustained Meanwhile the latter whose pride at least enabled him to despise such vanity as this and whose discernment at once detected under this assumed pity the frivolous malignity of Quesnel s mind listened to him in contemptuous silence till he named his niece and then they left the portico and walked away into the gardens Emily however still attended to Madame Quesnel who spoke of France for even the name of her native country was dear to her and she found some pleasure in looking at a person who had lately been in it That country too was inhabited by Valancourt and she listened to the mention of it with a faint hope that he also would be named Madame Quesnel who when she was in France had talked with rapture of Italy now that she was in Italy talked with equal praise of France and endeavoured to excite the wonder and the envy of her auditors by accounts of places which they had not been happy enough to see In these descriptions she not only imposed upon them but upon herself for she never thought a present pleasure equal to one that was passed and thus the delicious climate the fragrant orangeries and all the luxuries which surrounded her slept unnoticed while her fancy wandered over the distant scenes of a northern country Emily listened in vain for the name of Valancourt Madame Montoni spoke in her turn of the delights of Venice and of the pleasure she expected from visiting the fine castle of Montoni on the Apennine which latter mention at least was merely a retaliating boast for Emily well knew that her aunt had no taste for solitary grandeur and particularly for such as the castle of Udolpho promised Thus the party continued to converse and as far as civility would permit to torture each other by mutual boasts while they reclined on sofas in the portico and were environed with delights both from nature and art by which any honest minds would have been tempered to benevolence and happy imaginations would have been soothed into enchantment The dawn soon after trembled in the eastern horizon and the light tints of morning gradually expanding shewed the beautifully declining forms of the Italian mountains and the gleaming landscapes stretched at their feet Then the sun beams shooting up from behind the hills spread over the scene that fine saffron tinge which seems to impart repose to all it touches The landscape no longer gleamed all its glowing colours were revealed except that its remoter features were still softened and united in the mist of distance whose sweet effect was heightened to Emily by the dark verdure of the pines and cypresses that over arched the foreground of the river The market people passing with their boats to Venice now formed a moving picture on the Brenta Most of these had little painted awnings to shelter their owners from the sun beams which together with the piles of fruit and flowers displayed beneath and the tasteful simplicity of the peasant girls who watched the rural treasures rendered them gay and striking objects The swift movement of the boats down the current the quick glance of oars in the water and now and then the passing chorus of peasants who reclined under the sail of their little bark or the tones of some rustic instrument played by a girl as she sat near her sylvan cargo heightened the animation and festivity of the scene When Montoni and M Quesnel had joined the ladies the party left the portico for the gardens where the charming scenery soon withdrew Emily s thoughts from painful subjects The majestic forms and rich verdure of cypresses she had never seen so perfect before groves of cedar lemon and orange the spiry clusters of the pine and poplar the luxuriant chesnut and oriental plane threw all their pomp of shade over these gardens while bowers of flowering myrtle and other spicy shrubs mingled their fragrance with that of flowers whose vivid and various colouring glowed with increased effect beneath the contrasted umbrage of the groves The air also was continually refreshed by rivulets which with more taste than fashion had been suffered to wander among the green recesses Emily often lingered behind the party to contemplate the distant landscape that closed a vista or that gleamed beneath the dark foliage of the foreground the spiral summits of the mountains touched with a purple tint broken and steep above but shelving gradually to their base the open valley marked by no formal lines of art and the tall groves of cypress pine and poplar sometimes embellished by a ruined villa whose broken columns appeared between the branches of a pine that seemed to droop over their fall From other parts of the gardens the character of the view was entirely changed and the fine solitary beauty of the landscape shifted for the crowded features and varied colouring of inhabitation The sun was now gaining fast upon the sky and the party quitted the gardens and retired to repose CHAPTER IV And poor Misfortune feels the lash of Vice THOMSON Emily seized the first opportunity of conversing alone with Mons Quesnel concerning La Vallee His answers to her enquiries were concise and delivered with the air of a man who is conscious of possessing absolute power and impatient of hearing it questioned He declared that the disposal of the place was a necessary measure and that she might consider herself indebted to his prudence for even the small income that remained for her But however added he when this Venetian Count I have forgot his name marries you your present disagreeable state of dependence will cease As a relation to you I rejoice in the circumstance which is so fortunate for you and I may add so unexpected by your friends For some moments Emily was chilled into silence by this speech and when she attempted to undeceive him concerning the purport of the note she had inclosed in Montoni s letter he appeared to have some private reason for disbelieving her assertion and for a considerable time persevered in accusing her of capricious conduct Being at length however convinced that she really disliked Morano and had positively rejected his suit his resentment was extravagant and he expressed it in terms equally pointed and inhuman for secretly flattered by the prospect of a connection with a nobleman whose title he had affected to forget he was incapable of feeling pity for whatever sufferings of his niece might stand in the way of his ambition Emily saw at once in his manner all the difficulties that awaited her and though no oppression could have power to make her renounce Valancourt for Morano her fortitude now trembled at an encounter with the violent passions of her uncle She opposed his turbulence and indignation only by the mild dignity of a superior mind but the gentle firmness of her conduct served to exasperate still more his resentment since it compelled him to feel his own inferiority and when he left her he declared that if she persisted in her folly both himself and Montoni would abandon her to the contempt of the world The calmness she had assumed in his presence failed Emily when alone and she wept bitterly and called frequently upon the name of her departed father whose advice to her from his death bed she then remembered Alas said she I do indeed perceive how much more valuable is the strength of fortitude than the grace of sensibility and I will also endeavour to fulfil the promise I then made I will not indulge in unavailing lamentation but will try to endure with firmness the oppression I cannot elude Somewhat soothed by the consciousness of performing a part of saint Aubert s last request and of endeavouring to pursue the conduct which he would have approved she overcame her tears and when the company met at dinner had recovered her usual serenity of countenance In the cool of the evening the ladies took the FRESCO along the bank of the Brenta in Madame Quesnel s carriage The state of Emily s mind was in melancholy contrast with the gay groups assembled beneath the shades that overhung this enchanting stream Some were dancing under the trees and others reclining on the grass taking ices and coffee and calmly enjoying the effect of a beautiful evening on a luxuriant landscape Emily when she looked at the snow captain Apennines ascending in the distance thought of Montoni s castle and suffered some terror lest he should convey her thither for the purpose of enforcing her obedience but the thought vanished when she considered that she was as much in his power at Venice as she could be elsewhere It was moonlight before the party returned to the villa where supper was spread in the airy hall which had so much enchanted Emily s fancy on the preceding night The ladies seated themselves in the portico till Mons Quesnel Montoni and other gentlemen should join them at table and Emily endeavoured to resign herself to the tranquillity of the hour Presently a barge stopped at the steps that led into the gardens and soon after she distinguished the voices of Montoni and Quesnel and then that of Morano who in the next moment appeared His compliments she received in silence and her cold air seemed at first to discompose him but he soon recovered his usual gaiety of manner though the officious kindness of M and Madame Quesnel Emily perceived disgusted him Such a degree of attention she had scarcely believed could be shewn by M Quesnel for she had never before seen him otherwise than in the presence of his inferiors or equals When she could retire to her own apartment her mind almost involuntarily dwelt on the most probable means of prevailing with the Count to withdraw his suit and to her liberal mind none appeared more probable than that of acknowledging to him a prior attachment and throwing herself upon his generosity for a release When however on the following day he renewed his addresses she shrunk from the adoption of the plan she had formed There was something so repugnant to her just pride in laying open the secret of her heart to such a man as Morano and in suing to him for compassion that she impatiently rejected this design and wondered that she could have paused upon it for a moment The rejection of his suit she repeated in the most decisive terms she could select mingling with it a severe censure of his conduct but though the Count appeared mortified by this he persevered in the most ardent professions of admiration till he was interrupted and Emily released by the presence of Madame Quesnel During her stay at this pleasant villa Emily was thus rendered miserable by the assiduities of Morano together with the cruelly exerted authority of M Quesnel and Montoni who with her aunt seemed now more resolutely determined upon this marriage than they had even appeared to be at Venice M Quesnel finding that both argument and menace were ineffectual in enforcing an immediate conclusion to it at length relinquished his endeavours and trusted to the power of Montoni and to the course of events at Venice Emily indeed looked to Venice with hope for there she would be relieved in some measure from the persecution of Morano who would no longer be an inhabitant of the same house with herself and from that of Montoni whose engagements would not permit him to be continually at home But amidst the pressure of her own misfortunes she did not forget those of poor Theresa for whom she pleaded with courageous tenderness to Quesnel who promised in slight and general terms that she should not be forgotten Montoni in a long conversation with M Quesnel arranged the plan to be pursued respecting Emily and M Quesnel proposed to be at Venice as soon as he should be informed that the nuptials were concluded It was new to Emily to part with any person with whom she was connected without feeling of regret the moment however in which she took leave of M and Madame Quesnel was perhaps the only satisfactory one she had known in their presence Morano returned in Montoni s barge and Emily as she watched her gradual approach to that magic city saw at her side the only person who occasioned her to view it with less than perfect delight They arrived there about midnight when Emily was released from the presence of the Count who with Montoni went to a Casino and she was suffered to retire to her own apartment On the following day Montoni in a short conversation which he held with Emily informed her that he would no longer be TRIFLED with and that since her marriage with the Count would be so highly advantageous to her that folly only could object to it and folly of such extent as was incapable of conviction it should be celebrated without further delay and if that was necessary without her consent Emily who had hitherto tried remonstrance had now recourse to supplication for distress prevented her from foreseeing that with a man of Montoni s disposition supplication would be equally useless She afterwards enquired by what right he exerted this unlimited authority over her a question which her better judgment would have with held her in a calmer moment from making since it could avail her nothing and would afford Montoni another opportunity of triumphing over her defenceless condition By what right cried Montoni with a malicious smile by the right of my will if you can elude that I will not inquire by what right you do so I now remind you for the last time that you are a stranger in a foreign country and that it is your interest to make me your friend you know the means if you compel me to become your enemy I will venture to tell you that the punishment shall exceed your expectation You may know I am not to be trifled with Emily continued for some time after Montoni had left her in a state of despair or rather stupefaction a consciousness of misery was all that remained in her mind In this situation Madame Montoni found her at the sound of whose voice Emily looked up and her aunt somewhat softened by the expression of despair that fixed her countenance spoke in a manner more kind than she had ever yet done Emily s heart was touched she shed tears and after weeping for some time recovered sufficient composure to speak on the subject of her distress and to endeavour to interest Madame Montoni in her behalf But though the compassion of her aunt had been surprised her ambition was not to be overcome and her present object was to be the aunt of a Countess Emily s efforts therefore were as unsuccessful as they had been with Montoni and she withdrew to her apartment to think and weep alone How often did she remember the parting scene with Valancourt and wish that the Italian had mentioned Montoni s character with less reserve When her mind however had recovered from the first shock of this behaviour she considered that it would be impossible for him to compel her alliance with Morano if she persisted in refusing to repeat any part of the marriage ceremony and she persevered in her resolution to await Montoni s threatened vengeance rather than give herself for life to a man whom she must have despised for his present conduct had she never even loved Valancourt yet she trembled at the revenge she thus resolved to brave An affair however soon after occurred which somewhat called off Montoni s attention from Emily The mysterious visits of Orsino were renewed with more frequency since the return of the former to Venice There were others also besides Orsino admitted to these midnight councils and among them Cavigni and Verezzi Montoni became more reserved and austere in his manner than ever and Emily if her own interests had not made her regardless of his might have perceived that something extraordinary was working in his mind One night on which a council was not held Orsino came in great agitation of spirits and dispatched his confidential servant to Montoni who was at a Casino desiring that he would return home immediately but charging the servant not to mention his name Montoni obeyed the summons and on meeting Orsino was informed of the circumstances that occasioned his visit and his visible alarm with a part of which he was already acquainted A Venetian nobleman who had on some late occasion provoked the hatred of Orsino had been way laid and poniarded by hired assassins and as the murdered person was of the first connections the Senate had taken up the affair One of the assassins was now apprehended who had confessed that Orsino was his employer in the atrocious deed and the latter informed of his danger had now come to Montoni to consult on the measures necessary to favour his escape He knew that at this time the officers of the police were upon the watch for him all over the city to leave it at present therefore was impracticable and Montoni consented to secrete him for a few days till the vigilance of justice should relax and then to assist him in quitting Venice He knew the danger he himself incurred by permitting Orsino to remain in his house but such was the nature of his obligations to this man that he did not think it prudent to refuse him an asylum Such was the person whom Montoni had admitted to his confidence and for whom he felt as much friendship as was compatible with his character While Orsino remained concealed in his house Montoni was unwilling to attract public observation by the nuptials of Count Morano but this obstacle was in a few days overcome by the departure of his criminal visitor and he then informed Emily that her marriage was to be celebrated on the following morning To her repeated assurances that it should not take place he replied only by a malignant smile and telling her that the Count and a priest would be at his house early in the morning he advised her no further to dare his resentment by opposition to his will and to her own interest I am now going out for the evening said he remember that I shall give your hand to Count Morano in the morning Emily having ever since his late threats expected that her trials would at length arrive to this crisis was less shocked by the declaration that she otherwise would have been and she endeavoured to support herself by the belief that the marriage could not be valid so long as she refused before the priest to repeat any part of the ceremony Yet as the moment of trial approached her long harassed spirits shrunk almost equally from the encounter of his vengeance and from the hand of Count Morano She was not even perfectly certain of the consequence of her steady refusal at the altar and she trembled more than ever at the power of Montoni which seemed unlimited as his will for she saw that he would not scruple to transgress any law if by so doing he could accomplish his project While her mind was thus suffering and in a state little short of distraction she was informed that Morano asked permission to see her and the servant had scarcely departed with an excuse before she repented that she had sent one In the next moment reverting to her former design and determining to try whether expostulation and entreaty would not succeed where a refusal and a just disdain had failed she recalled the servant and sending a different message prepared to go down to the Count The dignity and assumed composure with which she met him and the kind of pensive resignation that softened her countenance were circumstances not likely to induce him to relinquish her serving as they did to heighten a passion which had already intoxicated his judgment He listened to all she said with an appearance of complacency and of a wish to oblige her but his resolution remained invariably the same and he endeavoured to win her admiration by every insinuating art he so well knew how to practise Being at length assured that she had nothing to hope from his justice she repeated in a solemn and impressive manner her absolute rejection of his suit and quitted him with an assurance that her refusal would be effectually maintained against every circumstance that could be imagined for subduing it A just pride had restrained her tears in his presence but now they flowed from the fulness of her heart She often called upon the name of her late father and often dwelt with unutterable anguish on the idea of Valancourt She did not go down to supper but remained alone in her apartment sometimes yielding to the influence of grief and terror and at others endeavouring to fortify her mind against them and to prepare herself to meet with composed courage the scene of the following morning when all the stratagem of Morano and the violence of Montoni would be united against her The evening was far advanced when Madame Montoni came to her chamber with some bridal ornaments which the Count had sent to Emily She had this day purposely avoided her niece perhaps because her usual insensibility failed her and she feared to trust herself with a view of Emily s distress or possibly though her conscience was seldom audible it now reproached her with her conduct to her brother s orphan child whose happiness had been entrusted to her care by a dying father Emily could not look at these presents and made a last though almost hopeless effort to interest the compassion of Madame Montoni who if she did feel any degree of pity or remorse successfully concealed it and reproached her niece with folly in being miserable concerning a marriage which ought only to make her happy I am sure said she if I was unmarried and the Count had proposed to me I should have been flattered by the distinction and if I should have been so I am sure niece you who have no fortune ought to feel yourself highly honoured and shew a proper gratitude and humility towards the Count for his condescension I am often surprised I must own to observe how humbly he deports himself to you notwithstanding the haughty airs you give yourself I wonder he has patience to humour you so if I was he I know I should often be ready to reprehend you and make you know yourself a little better I would not have flattered you I can tell you for it is this absurd flattery that makes you fancy yourself of so much consequence that you think nobody can deserve you and I often tell the Count so for I have no patience to hear him pay you such extravagant compliments which you believe every word of Your patience madam cannot suffer more cruelly on such occasions than my own said Emily O that is all mere affectation rejoined her aunt I know that his flattery delights you and makes you so vain that you think you may have the whole world at your feet But you are very much mistaken I can assure you niece you will not meet with many such suitors as the Count every other person would have turned upon his heel and left you to repent at your leisure long ago O that the Count had resembled every other person then said Emily with a heavy sigh It is happy for you that he does not rejoined Madame Montoni and what I am now saying is from pure kindness I am endeavouring to convince you of your good fortune and to persuade you to submit to necessity with a good grace It is nothing to me you know whether you like this marriage or not for it must be what I say therefore is from pure kindness I wish to see you happy and it is your own fault if you are not so I would ask you now seriously and calmly what kind of a match you can expect since a Count cannot content your ambition I have no ambition whatever madam replied Emily my only wish is to remain in my present station O that is speaking quite from the purpose said her aunt I see you are still thinking of Mons Valancourt Pray get rid of all those fantastic notions about love and this ridiculous pride and be something like a reasonable creature But however this is nothing to the purpose for your marriage with the Count takes place tomorrow you know whether you approve it or not The Count will be trifled with no longer Emily made no attempt to reply to this curious speech she felt it would be mean and she knew it would be useless Madame Montoni laid the Count s presents upon the table on which Emily was leaning and then desiring she would be ready early in the morning bade her good night Good night madam said Emily with a deep sigh as the door closed upon her aunt and she was left once more to her own sad reflections For some time she sat so lost in thought as to be wholly unconscious where she was at length raising her head and looking round the room its gloom and profound stillness awed her She fixed her eyes on the door through which her aunt had disappeared and listened anxiously for some sound that might relieve the deep dejection of her spirits but it was past midnight and all the family except the servant who sat up for Montoni had retired to bed Her mind long harassed by distress now yielded to imaginary terrors she trembled to look into the obscurity of her spacious chamber and feared she knew not what a state of mind which continued so long that she would have called up Annette her aunt s woman had her fears permitted her to rise from her chair and to cross the apartment These melancholy illusions at length began to disperse and she retired to her bed not to sleep for that was scarcely possible but to try at least to quiet her disturbed fancy and to collect strength of spirits sufficient to bear her through the scene of the approaching morning CHAPTER V Dark power with shudd ring meek submitted thought Be mine to read the visions old Which thy awak ning bards have told And lest they meet my blasted view Hold each strange tale devoutly true COLLINS ODE TO FEAR Emily was recalled from a kind of slumber into which she had at length sunk by a quick knocking at her chamber door She started up in terror for Montoni and Count Morano instantly came to her mind but having listened in silence for some time and recognizing the voice of Annette she rose and opened the door What brings you hither so early said Emily trembling excessively She was unable to support herself and sat down on the bed Dear ma amselle said Annette do not look so pale I am quite frightened to see you Here is a fine bustle below stairs all the servants running to and fro and none of them fast enough Here is a bustle indeed all of a sudden and nobody knows for what Who is below besides them said Emily Annette do not trifle with me Not for the world ma amselle I would not trifle for the world but one cannot help making one s remarks and there is the Signor in such a bustle as I never saw him before and he has sent me to tell you ma am to get ready immediately Good God support me cried Emily almost fainting Count Morano is below then No ma amselle he is not below that I know of replied Annette only his excellenza sent me to desire you would get ready directly to leave Venice for that the gondolas would be at the steps of the canal in a few minutes but I must hurry back to my lady who is just at her wits end and knows not which way to turn for haste Explain Annette explain the meaning of all this before you go said Emily so overcome with surprise and timid hope that she had scarcely breath to speak Nay ma amselle that is more than I can do I only know that the Signor is just come home in a very ill humour that he has had us all called out of our beds and tells us we are all to leave Venice immediately Is Count Morano to go with the signor said Emily and whither are we going I know neither ma am for certain but I heard Ludovico say something about going after we get to terra firma to the signor s castle among some mountains that he talked of The Apennines said Emily eagerly O then I have little to hope That is the very place ma am But cheer up and do not take it so much to heart and think what a little time you have to get ready in and how impatient the Signor is Holy saint Mark I hear the oars on the canal and now they come nearer and now they are dashing at the steps below it is the gondola sure enough Annette hastened from the room and Emily prepared for this unexpected flight as fast as her trembling hands would permit not perceiving that any change in her situation could possibly be for the worse She had scarcely thrown her books and clothes into her travelling trunk when receiving a second summons she went down to her aunt s dressing room where she found Montoni impatiently reproving his wife for delay He went out soon after to give some further orders to his people and Emily then enquired the occasion of this hasty journey but her aunt appeared to be as ignorant as herself and to undertake the journey with more reluctance The family at length embarked but neither Count Morano nor Cavigni was of the party Somewhat revived by observing this Emily when the gondolieri dashed their oars in the water and put off from the steps of the portico felt like a criminal who receives a short reprieve Her heart beat yet lighter when they emerged from the canal into the ocean and lighter still when they skimmed past the walls of saint Mark without having stopped to take up Count Morano The dawn now began to tint the horizon and to break upon the shores of the Adriatic Emily did not venture to ask any questions of Montoni who sat for some time in gloomy silence and then rolled himself up in his cloak as if to sleep while Madame Montoni did the same but Emily who could not sleep undrew one of the little curtains of the gondola and looked out upon the sea The rising dawn now enlightened the mountain tops of Friuli but their lower sides and the distant waves that rolled at their feet were still in deep shadow Emily sunk in tranquil melancholy watched the strengthening light spreading upon the ocean shewing successively Venice and her islets and the shores of Italy along which boats with their pointed latin sails began to move The gondolieri were frequently hailed at this early hour by the market people as they glided by towards Venice and the lagune soon displayed a gay scene of innumerable little barks passing from terra firma with provisions Emily gave a last look to that splendid city but her mind was then occupied by considering the probable events that awaited her in the scenes to which she was removing and with conjectures concerning the motive of this sudden journey It appeared upon calmer consideration that Montoni was removing her to his secluded castle because he could there with more probability of success attempt to terrify her into obedience or that should its gloomy and sequestered scenes fail of this effect her forced marriage with the Count could there be solemnized with the secrecy which was necessary to the honour of Montoni The little spirit which this reprieve had recalled now began to fail and when Emily reached the shore her mind had sunk into all its former depression Montoni did not embark on the Brenta but pursued his way in carriages across the country towards the Apennine during which journey his manner to Emily was so particularly severe that this alone would have confirmed her late conjecture had any such confirmation been necessary Her senses were now dead to the beautiful country through which she travelled Sometimes she was compelled to smile at the naivete of Annette in her remarks on what she saw and sometimes to sigh as a scene of peculiar beauty recalled Valancourt to her thoughts who was indeed seldom absent from them and of whom she could never hope to hear in the solitude to which she was hastening At length the travellers began to ascend among the Apennines The immense pine forests which at that period overhung these mountains and between which the road wound excluded all view but of the cliffs aspiring above except that now and then an opening through the dark woods allowed the eye a momentary glimpse of the country below The gloom of these shades their solitary silence except when the breeze swept over their summits the tremendous precipices of the mountains that came partially to the eye each assisted to raise the solemnity of Emily s feelings into awe she saw only images of gloomy grandeur or of dreadful sublimity around her other images equally gloomy and equally terrible gleamed on her imagination She was going she scarcely knew whither under the dominion of a person from whose arbitrary disposition she had already suffered so much to marry perhaps a man who possessed neither her affection or esteem or to endure beyond the hope of succour whatever punishment revenge and that Italian revenge might dictate The more she considered what might be the motive of the journey the more she became convinced that it was for the purpose of concluding her nuptials with Count Morano with that secrecy which her resolute resistance had made necessary to the honour if not to the safety of Montoni From the deep solitudes into which she was immerging and from the gloomy castle of which she had heard some mysterious hints her sick heart recoiled in despair and she experienced that though her mind was already occupied by peculiar distress it was still alive to the influence of new and local circumstance why else did she shudder at the idea of this desolate castle As the travellers still ascended among the pine forests steep rose over steep the mountains seemed to multiply as they went and what was the summit of one eminence proved to be only the base of another At length they reached a little plain where the drivers stopped to rest the mules whence a scene of such extent and magnificence opened below as drew even from Madame Montoni a note of admiration Emily lost for a moment her sorrows in the immensity of nature Beyond the amphitheatre of mountains that stretched below whose tops appeared as numerous almost as the waves of the sea and whose feet were concealed by the forests extended the campagna of Italy where cities and rivers and woods and all the glow of cultivation were mingled in gay confusion The Adriatic bounded the horizon into which the Po and the Brenta after winding through the whole extent of the landscape poured their fruitful waves Emily gazed long on the splendours of the world she was quitting of which the whole magnificence seemed thus given to her sight only to increase her regret on leaving it for her Valancourt alone was in that world to him alone her heart turned and for him alone fell her bitter tears From this sublime scene the travellers continued to ascend among the pines till they entered a narrow pass of the mountains which shut out every feature of the distant country and in its stead exhibited only tremendous crags impending over the road where no vestige of humanity or even of vegetation appeared except here and there the trunk and scathed branches of an oak that hung nearly headlong from the rock into which its strong roots had fastened This pass which led into the heart of the Apennine at length opened to day and a scene of mountains stretched in long perspective as wild as any the travellers had yet passed Still vast pine forests hung upon their base and crowned the ridgy precipice that rose perpendicularly from the vale while above the rolling mists caught the sun beams and touched their cliffs with all the magical colouring of light and shade The scene seemed perpetually changing and its features to assume new forms as the winding road brought them to the eye in different attitudes while the shifting vapours now partially concealing their minuter beauties and now illuminating them with splendid tints assisted the illusions of the sight Though the deep vallies between these mountains were for the most part clothed with pines sometimes an abrupt opening presented a perspective of only barren rocks with a cataract flashing from their summit among broken cliffs till its waters reaching the bottom foamed along with unceasing fury and sometimes pastoral scenes exhibited their green delights in the narrow vales smiling amid surrounding horror There herds and flocks of goats and sheep browsing under the shade of hanging woods and the shepherd s little cabin reared on the margin of a clear stream presented a sweet picture of repose Wild and romantic as were these scenes their character had far less of the sublime that had those of the Alps which guard the entrance of Italy Emily was often elevated but seldom felt those emotions of indescribable awe which she had so continually experienced in her passage over the Alps Towards the close of day the road wound into a deep valley Mountains whose shaggy steeps appeared to be inaccessible almost surrounded it To the east a vista opened that exhibited the Apennines in their darkest horrors and the long perspective of retiring summits rising over each other their ridges clothed with pines exhibited a stronger image of grandeur than any that Emily had yet seen The sun had just sunk below the top of the mountains she was descending whose long shadow stretched athwart the valley but his sloping rays shooting through an opening of the cliffs touched with a yellow gleam the summits of the forest that hung upon the opposite steeps and streamed in full splendour upon the towers and battlements of a castle that spread its extensive ramparts along the brow of a precipice above The splendour of these illumined objects was heightened by the contrasted shade which involved the valley below There said Montoni speaking for the first time in several hours is Udolpho Emily gazed with melancholy awe upon the castle which she understood to be Montoni s for though it was now lighted up by the setting sun the gothic greatness of its features and its mouldering walls of dark grey stone rendered it a gloomy and sublime object As she gazed the light died away on its walls leaving a melancholy purple tint which spread deeper and deeper as the thin vapour crept up the mountain while the battlements above were still tipped with splendour From those too the rays soon faded and the whole edifice was invested with the solemn duskiness of evening Silent lonely and sublime it seemed to stand the sovereign of the scene and to frown defiance on all who dared to invade its solitary reign As the twilight deepened its features became more awful in obscurity and Emily continued to gaze till its clustering towers were alone seen rising over the tops of the woods beneath whose thick shade the carriages soon after began to ascend The extent and darkness of these tall woods awakened terrific images in her mind and she almost expected to see banditti start up from under the trees At length the carriages emerged upon a heathy rock and soon after reached the castle gates where the deep tone of the portal bell which was struck upon to give notice of their arrival increased the fearful emotions that had assailed Emily While they waited till the servant within should come to open the gates she anxiously surveyed the edifice but the gloom that overspread it allowed her to distinguish little more than a part of its outline with the massy walls of the ramparts and to know that it was vast ancient and dreary From the parts she saw she judged of the heavy strength and extent of the whole The gateway before her leading into the courts was of gigantic size and was defended by two round towers crowned by overhanging turrets embattled where instead of banners now waved long grass and wild plants that had taken root among the mouldering stones and which seemed to sigh as the breeze rolled past over the desolation around them The towers were united by a curtain pierced and embattled also below which appeared the pointed arch of a huge portcullis surmounting the gates from these the walls of the ramparts extended to other towers overlooking the precipice whose shattered outline appearing on a gleam that lingered in the west told of the ravages of war Beyond these all was lost in the obscurity of evening While Emily gazed with awe upon the scene footsteps were heard within the gates and the undrawing of bolts after which an ancient servant of the castle appeared forcing back the huge folds of the portal to admit his lord As the carriage wheels rolled heavily under the portcullis Emily s heart sunk and she seemed as if she was going into her prison the gloomy court into which she passed served to confirm the idea and her imagination ever awake to circumstance suggested even more terrors than her reason could justify Another gate delivered them into the second court grass grown and more wild than the first where as she surveyed through the twilight its desolation its lofty walls overtopt with briony moss and nightshade and the embattled towers that rose above long suffering and murder came to her thoughts One of those instantaneous and unaccountable convictions which sometimes conquer even strong minds impressed her with its horror The sentiment was not diminished when she entered an extensive gothic hall obscured by the gloom of evening which a light glimmering at a distance through a long perspective of arches only rendered more striking As a servant brought the lamp nearer partial gleams fell upon the pillars and the pointed arches forming a strong contrast with their shadows that stretched along the pavement and the walls The sudden journey of Montoni had prevented his people from making any other preparations for his reception than could be had in the short interval since the arrival of the servant who had been sent forward from Venice and this in some measure may account for the air of extreme desolation that everywhere appeared The servant who came to light Montoni bowed in silence and the muscles of his countenance relaxed with no symptom of joy Montoni noticed the salutation by a slight motion of his hand and passed on while his lady following and looking round with a degree of surprise and discontent which she seemed fearful of expressing and Emily surveying the extent and grandeur of the hall in timid wonder approached a marble stair case The arches here opened to a lofty vault from the centre of which hung a tripod lamp which a servant was hastily lighting and the rich fret work of the roof a corridor leading into several upper apartments and a painted window stretching nearly from the pavement to the ceiling of the hall became gradually visible Having crossed the foot of the stair case and passed through an ante room they entered a spacious apartment whose walls wainscoted with black larch wood the growth of the neighbouring mountains were scarcely distinguishable from darkness itself Bring more light said Montoni as he entered The servant setting down his lamp was withdrawing to obey him when Madame Montoni observing that the evening air of this mountainous region was cold and that she should like a fire Montoni ordered that wood might be brought While he paced the room with thoughtful steps and Madame Montoni sat silently on a couch at the upper end of it waiting till the servant returned Emily was observing the singular solemnity and desolation of the apartment viewed as it now was by the glimmer of the single lamp placed near a large Venetian mirror that duskily reflected the scene with the tall figure of Montoni passing slowly along his arms folded and his countenance shaded by the plume that waved in his hat From the contemplation of this scene Emily s mind proceeded to the apprehension of what she might suffer in it till the remembrance of Valancourt far far distant came to her heart and softened it into sorrow A heavy sigh escaped her but trying to conceal her tears she walked away to one of the high windows that opened upon the ramparts below which spread the woods she had passed in her approach to the castle But the night shade sat deeply on the mountains beyond and their indented outline alone could be faintly traced on the horizon where a red streak yet glimmered in the west The valley between was sunk in darkness The scene within upon which Emily turned on the opening of the door was scarcely less gloomy The old servant who had received them at the gates now entered bending under a load of pine branches while two of Montoni s Venetian servants followed with lights Your excellenza is welcome to the castle said the old man as he raised himself from the hearth where he had laid the wood it has been a lonely place a long while but you will excuse it Signor knowing we had but short notice It is near two years come next feast of saint Mark since your excellenza was within these walls You have a good memory old Carlo said Montoni it is there about and how hast thou contrived to live so long A well a day sir with much ado the cold winds that blow through the castle in winter are almost too much for me and I thought sometimes of asking your excellenza to let me leave the mountains and go down into the lowlands But I don t know how it is I am loth to quit these old walls I have lived in so long Well how have you gone on in the castle since I left it said Montoni Why much as usual Signor only it wants a good deal of repairing There is the north tower some of the battlements have tumbled down and had liked one day to have knocked my poor wife God rest her soul on the head Your excellenza must know Well but the repairs interrupted Montoni Aye the repairs said Carlo a part of the roof of the great hall has fallen in and all the winds from the mountains rushed through it last winter and whistled through the whole castle so that there was no keeping one s self warm be where one would There my wife and I used to sit shivering over a great fire in one corner of the little hall ready to die with cold and But there are no more repairs wanted said Montoni impatiently O Lord Your excellenza yes the wall of the rampart has tumbled down in three places then the stairs that lead to the west gallery have been a long time so bad that it is dangerous to go up them and the passage leading to the great oak chamber that overhangs the north rampart one night last winter I ventured to go there by myself and your excellenza Well well enough of this said Montoni with quickness I will talk more with thee to morrow The fire was now lighted Carlo swept the hearth placed chairs wiped the dust from a large marble table that stood near it and then left the room Montoni and his family drew round the fire Madame Montoni made several attempts at conversation but his sullen answers repulsed her while Emily sat endeavouring to acquire courage enough to speak to him At length in a tremulous voice she said May I ask sir the motive of this sudden journey After a long pause she recovered sufficient courage to repeat the question It does not suit me to answer enquiries said Montoni nor does it become you to make them time may unfold them all but I desire I may be no further harassed and I recommend it to you to retire to your chamber and to endeavour to adopt a more rational conduct than that of yielding to fancies and to a sensibility which to call it by the gentlest name is only a weakness Emily rose to withdraw Good night madam said she to her aunt with an assumed composure that could not disguise her emotion Good night my dear said Madame Montoni in a tone of kindness which her niece had never before heard from her and the unexpected endearment brought tears to Emily s eyes She curtsied to Montoni and was retiring But you do not know the way to your chamber said her aunt Montoni called the servant who waited in the ante room and bade him send Madame Montoni s woman with whom in a few minutes Emily withdrew Do you know which is my room said she to Annette as they crossed the hall Yes I believe I do ma amselle but this is such a strange rambling place I have been lost in it already they call it the double chamber over the south rampart and I went up this great stair case to it My lady s room is at the other end of the castle Emily ascended the marble staircase and came to the corridor as they passed through which Annette resumed her chat What a wild lonely place this is ma am I shall be quite frightened to live in it How often and often have I wished myself in France again I little thought when I came with my lady to see the world that I should ever be shut up in such a place as this or I would never have left my own country This way ma amselle down this turning I can almost believe in giants again and such like for this is just like one of their castles and some night or other I suppose I shall see fairies too hopping about in that great old hall that looks more like a church with its huge pillars than any thing else Yes said Emily smiling and glad to escape from more serious thought if we come to the corridor about midnight and look down into the hall we shall certainly see it illuminated with a thousand lamps and the fairies tripping in gay circles to the sound of delicious music for it is in such places as this you know that they come to hold their revels But I am afraid Annette you will not be able to pay the necessary penance for such a sight and if once they hear your voice the whole scene will vanish in an instant O if you will bear me company ma amselle I will come to the corridor this very night and I promise you I will hold my tongue it shall not be my fault if the show vanishes But do you think they will come I cannot promise that with certainty but I will venture to say it will not be your fault if the enchantment should vanish Well ma amselle that is saying more than I expected of you but I am not so much afraid of fairies as of ghosts and they say there are a plentiful many of them about the castle now I should be frightened to death if I should chance to see any of them But hush ma amselle walk softly I have thought several times something passed by me Ridiculous said Emily you must not indulge such fancies O ma am they are not fancies for aught I know Benedetto says these dismal galleries and halls are fit for nothing but ghosts to live in and I verily believe if I LIVE long in them I shall turn to one myself I hope said Emily you will not suffer Signor Montoni to hear of these weak fears they would highly displease him What you know then ma amselle all about it rejoined Annette No no I do know better than to do so though if the Signor can sleep sound nobody else in the castle has any right to lie awake I am sure Emily did not appear to notice this remark Down this passage ma amselle this leads to a back stair case O if I see any thing I shall be frightened out of my wits That will scarcely be possible said Emily smiling as she followed the winding of the passage which opened into another gallery and then Annette perceiving that she had missed her way while she had been so eloquently haranguing on ghosts and fairies wandered about through other passages and galleries till at length frightened by their intricacies and desolation she called aloud for assistance but they were beyond the hearing of the servants who were on the other side of the castle and Emily now opened the door of a chamber on the left O do not go in there ma amselle said Annette you will only lose yourself further Bring the light forward said Emily we may possibly find our way through these rooms Annette stood at the door in an attitude of hesitation with the light held up to shew the chamber but the feeble rays spread through not half of it Why do you hesitate said Emily let me see whither this room leads Annette advanced reluctantly It opened into a suite of spacious and ancient apartments some of which were hung with tapestry and others wainscoted with cedar and black larch wood What furniture there was seemed to be almost as old as the rooms and retained an appearance of grandeur though covered with dust and dropping to pieces with the damps and with age How cold these rooms are ma amselle said Annette nobody has lived in them for many many years they say Do let us go They may open upon the great stair case perhaps said Emily passing on till she came to a chamber hung with pictures and took the light to examine that of a soldier on horseback in a field of battle He was darting his spear upon a man who lay under the feet of the horse and who held up one hand in a supplicating attitude The soldier whose beaver was up regarded him with a look of vengeance and the countenance with that expression struck Emily as resembling Montoni She shuddered and turned from it Passing the light hastily over several other pictures she came to one concealed by a veil of black silk The singularity of the circumstance struck her and she stopped before it wishing to remove the veil and examine what could thus carefully be concealed but somewhat wanting courage Holy Virgin what can this mean exclaimed Annette This is surely the picture they told me of at Venice What picture said Emily Why a picture a picture replied Annette hesitatingly but I never could make out exactly what it was about either Remove the veil Annette What I ma amselle I not for the world Emily turning round saw Annette s countenance grow pale And pray what have you heard of this picture to terrify you so my good girl said she Nothing ma amselle I have heard nothing only let us find our way out Certainly but I wish first to examine the picture take the light Annette while I lift the veil Annette took the light and immediately walked away with it disregarding Emily s call to stay who not choosing to be left alone in the dark chamber at length followed her What is the reason of this Annette said Emily when she overtook her what have you heard concerning that picture which makes you so unwilling to stay when I bid you I don t know what is the reason ma amselle replied Annette nor any thing about the picture only I have heard there is something very dreadful belonging to it and that it has been covered up in black EVER SINCE and that nobody has looked at it for a great many years and it somehow has to do with the owner of this castle before Signor Montoni came to the possession of it and Well Annette said Emily smiling I perceive it is as you say that you know nothing about the picture No nothing indeed ma amselle for they made me promise never to tell but Well rejoined Emily who observed that she was struggling between her inclination to reveal a secret and her apprehension for the consequence I will enquire no further No pray ma am do not Lest you should tell all interrupted Emily Annette blushed and Emily smiled and they passed on to the extremity of this suite of apartments and found themselves after some further perplexity once more at the top of the marble stair case where Annette left Emily while she went to call one of the servants of the castle to shew them to the chamber for which they had been seeking While she was absent Emily s thoughts returned to the picture an unwillingness to tamper with the integrity of a servant had checked her enquiries on this subject as well as concerning some alarming hints which Annette had dropped respecting Montoni though her curiosity was entirely awakened and she had perceived that her questions might easily be answered She was now however inclined to go back to the apartment and examine the picture but the loneliness of the hour and of the place with the melancholy silence that reigned around her conspired with a certain degree of awe excited by the mystery attending this picture to prevent her She determined however when day light should have re animated her spirits to go thither and remove the veil As she leaned from the corridor over the stair case and her eyes wandered round she again observed with wonder the vast strength of the walls now somewhat decayed and the pillars of solid marble that rose from the hall and supported the roof A servant now appeared with Annette and conducted Emily to her chamber which was in a remote part of the castle and at the very end of the corridor from whence the suite of apartments opened through which they had been wandering The lonely aspect of her room made Emily unwilling that Annette should leave her immediately and the dampness of it chilled her with more than fear She begged Caterina the servant of the castle to bring some wood and light a fire Aye lady it s many a year since a fire was lighted here said Caterina You need not tell us that good woman said Annette every room in the castle feels like a well I wonder how you contrive to live here for my part I wish myself at Venice again Emily waved her hand for Caterina to fetch the wood I wonder ma am why they call this the double chamber said Annette while Emily surveyed it in silence and saw that it was lofty and spacious like the others she had seen and like many of them too had its walls lined with dark larch wood The bed and other furniture was very ancient and had an air of gloomy grandeur like all that she had seen in the castle One of the high casements which she opened overlooked a rampart but the view beyond was hid in darkness In the presence of Annette Emily tried to support her spirits and to restrain the tears which every now and then came to her eyes She wished much to enquire when Count Morano was expected at the castle but an unwillingness to ask unnecessary questions and to mention family concerns to a servant withheld her Meanwhile Annette s thoughts were engaged upon another subject she dearly loved the marvellous and had heard of a circumstance connected with the castle that highly gratified this taste Having been enjoined not to mention it her inclination to tell it was so strong that she was every instant on the point of speaking what she had heard Such a strange circumstance too and to be obliged to conceal it was a severe punishment but she knew that Montoni might impose one much severer and she feared to incur it by offending him Caterina now brought the wood and its bright blaze dispelled for a while the gloom of the chamber She told Annette that her lady had enquired for her and Emily was once again left to her own sad reflections Her heart was not yet hardened against the stern manners of Montoni and she was nearly as much shocked now as she had been when she first witnessed them The tenderness and affection to which she had been accustomed till she lost her parents had made her particularly sensible to any degree of unkindness and such a reverse as this no apprehension had prepared her to support To call off her attention from subjects that pressed heavily on her spirits she rose and again examined her room and its furniture As she walked round it she passed a door that was not quite shut and perceiving that it was not the one through which she entered she brought the light forward to discover whither it led She opened it and going forward had nearly fallen down a steep narrow stair case that wound from it between two stone walls She wished to know to what it led and was the more anxious since it communicated so immediately with her apartment but in the present state of her spirits she wanted courage to venture into the darkness alone Closing the door therefore she endeavoured to fasten it but upon further examination perceived that it had no bolts on the chamber side though it had two on the other By placing a heavy chair against it she in some measure remedied the defect yet she was still alarmed at the thought of sleeping in this remote room alone with a door opening she knew not whither and which could not be perfectly fastened on the inside Sometimes she wished to entreat of Madame Montoni that Annette might have leave to remain with her all night but was deterred by an apprehension of betraying what would be thought childish fears and by an unwillingness to increase the apt terrors of Annette Her gloomy reflections were soon after interrupted by a footstep in the corridor and she was glad to see Annette enter with some supper sent by Madame Montoni Having a table near the fire she made the good girl sit down and sup with her and when their little repast was over Annette encouraged by her kindness and stirring the wood into a blaze drew her chair upon the hearth nearer to Emily and said Did you ever hear ma amselle of the strange accident that made the Signor lord of this castle What wonderful story have you now to tell said Emily concealing the curiosity occasioned by the mysterious hints she had formerly heard on that subject I have heard all about it ma amselle said Annette looking round the chamber and drawing closer to Emily Benedetto told it me as we travelled together says he Annette you don t know about this castle here that we are going to No says I mister Benedetto pray what do you know But ma amselle you can keep a secret or I would not tell it you for the world for I promised never to tell and they say that the Signor does not like to have it talked of If you promised to keep this secret said Emily you do right not to mention it Annette paused a moment and then said O but to you ma amselle to you I may tell it safely I know Emily smiled I certainly shall keep it as faithful as yourself Annette Annette replied very gravely that would do and proceeded This castle you must know ma amselle is very old and very strong and has stood out many sieges as they say Now it was not Signor Montoni s always nor his father s no but by some law or other it was to come to the Signor if the lady died unmarried What lady said Emily I am not come to that yet replied Annette it is the lady I am going to tell you about ma amselle but as I was saying this lady lived in the castle and had everything very grand about her as you may suppose ma amselle The Signor used often to come to see her and was in love with her and offered to marry her for though he was somehow related that did not signify But she was in love with somebody else and would not have him which made him very angry as they say and you know ma amselle what an ill looking gentleman he is when he is angry Perhaps she saw him in a passion and therefore would not have him But as I was saying she was very melancholy and unhappy and all that for a long while and Holy Virgin what noise is that did not you hear a sound ma amselle It was only the wind said Emily but do come to the end of your story As I was saying O where was I as I was saying she was very melancholy and unhappy a long while and used to walk about upon the terrace there under the windows by herself and cry so it would have done your heart good to hear her That is I don t mean good but it would have made you cry too as they tell me Well but Annette do tell me the substance of your tale All in good time ma am all this I heard before at Venice but what is to come I never heard till to day This happened a great many years ago when Signor Montoni was quite a young man The lady they called her Signora Laurentini was very handsome but she used to be in great passions too sometimes as well as the Signor Finding he could not make her listen to him what does he do but leave the castle and never comes near it for a long time but it was all one to her she was just as unhappy whether he was here or not till one evening Holy saint Peter ma amselle cried Annette look at that lamp see how blue it burns She looked fearfully round the chamber Ridiculous girl said Emily why will you indulge those fancies Pray let me hear the end of your story I am weary Annette still kept her eyes on the lamp and proceeded in a lower voice It was one evening they say at the latter end of the year it might be about the middle of September I suppose or the beginning of October nay for that matter it might be November for that too is the latter end of the year but that I cannot say for certain because they did not tell me for certain themselves However it was at the latter end of the year this grand lady walked out of the castle into the woods below as she had often done before all alone only her maid was with her The wind blew cold and strewed the leaves about and whistled dismally among those great old chesnut trees that we passed ma amselle as we came to the castle for Benedetto shewed me the trees as he was talking the wind blew cold and her woman would have persuaded her to return but all would not do for she was fond of walking in the woods at evening time and if the leaves were falling about her so much the better Well they saw her go down among the woods but night came and she did not return ten o clock eleven o clock twelve o clock came and no lady Well the servants thought to be sure some accident had befallen her and they went out to seek her They searched all night long but could not find her or any trace of her and from that day to this ma amselle she has never been heard of Is this true Annette said Emily in much surprise True ma am said Annette with a look of horror yes it is true indeed But they do say she added lowering her voice they do say that the Signora has been seen several times since walking in the woods and about the castle in the night several of the old servants who remained here some time after declare they saw her and since then she has been seen by some of the vassals who have happened to be in the castle at night Carlo the old steward could tell such things they say if he would How contradictory is this Annette said Emily you say nothing has been since known of her and yet she has been seen But all this was told me for a great secret rejoined Annette without noticing the remark and I am sure ma am you would not hurt either me or Benedetto so much as to go and tell it again Emily remained silent and Annette repeated her last sentence You have nothing to fear from my indiscretion replied Emily and let me advise you my good Annette be discreet yourself and never mention what you have just told me to any other person Signor Montoni as you say may be angry if he hears of it But what inquiries were made concerning the lady O a great deal indeed ma amselle for the Signor laid claim to the castle directly as being the next heir and they said that is the judges or the senators or somebody of that sort said he could not take possession of it till so many years were gone by and then if after all the lady could not be found why she would be as good as dead and the castle would be his own and so it is his own But the story went round and many strange reports were spread so very strange ma amselle that I shall not tell them That is stranger still Annette said Emily smiling and rousing herself from her reverie But when Signora Laurentini was afterwards seen in the castle did nobody speak to her Speak speak to her cried Annette with a look of terror no to be sure And why not rejoined Emily willing to hear further Holy Mother speak to a spirit But what reason had they to conclude it was a spirit unless they had approached and spoken to it O ma amselle I cannot tell How can you ask such shocking questions But nobody ever saw it come in or go out of the castle and it was in one place now and then the next minute in quite another part of the castle and then it never spoke and if it was alive what should it do in the castle if it never spoke Several parts of the castle have never been gone into since they say for that very reason What because it never spoke said Emily trying to laugh away the fears that began to steal upon her No ma amselle no replied Annette rather angrily but because something has been seen there They say too there is an old chapel adjoining the west side of the castle where any time at midnight you may hear such groans it makes one shudder to think of them and strange sights have been seen there Pr ythee Annette no more of these silly tales said Emily Silly tales ma amselle O but I will tell you one story about this if you please that Caterina told me It was one cold winter s night that Caterina she often came to the castle then she says to keep old Carlo and his wife company and so he recommended her afterwards to the Signor and she has lived here ever since Caterina was sitting with them in the little hall says Carlo I wish we had some of those figs to roast that lie in the store closet but it is a long way off and I am loath to fetch them do Caterina says he for you are young and nimble do bring us some the fire is in nice trim for roasting them they lie says he in such a corner of the store room at the end of the north gallery here take the lamp says he and mind as you go up the great stair case that the wind through the roof does not blow it out So with that Caterina took the lamp Hush ma amselle I surely heard a noise Emily whom Annette had now infected with her own terrors listened attentively but every thing was still and Annette proceeded Caterina went to the north gallery that is the wide gallery we passed ma am before we came to the corridor here As she went with the lamp in her hand thinking of nothing at all There again cried Annette suddenly I heard it again it was not fancy ma amselle Hush said Emily trembling They listened and continuing to sit quite still Emily heard a low knocking against the wall It came repeatedly Annette then screamed loudly and the chamber door slowly opened It was Caterina come to tell Annette that her lady wanted her Emily though she now perceived who it was could not immediately overcome her terror while Annette half laughing half crying scolded Caterina heartily for thus alarming them and was also terrified lest what she had told had been overheard Emily whose mind was deeply impressed by the chief circumstance of Annette s relation was unwilling to be left alone in the present state of her spirits but to avoid offending Madame Montoni and betraying her own weakness she struggled to overcome the illusions of fear and dismissed Annette for the night When she was alone her thoughts recurred to the strange history of Signora Laurentini and then to her own strange situation in the wild and solitary mountains of a foreign country in the castle and the power of a man to whom only a few preceding months she was an entire stranger who had already exercised an usurped authority over her and whose character she now regarded with a degree of terror apparently justified by the fears of others She knew that he had invention equal to the conception and talents to the execution of any project and she greatly feared he had a heart too void of feeling to oppose the perpetration of whatever his interest might suggest She had long observed the unhappiness of Madame Montoni and had often been witness to the stern and contemptuous behaviour she received from her husband To these circumstances which conspired to give her just cause for alarm were now added those thousand nameless terrors which exist only in active imaginations and which set reason and examination equally at defiance Emily remembered all that Valancourt had told her on the eve of her departure from Languedoc respecting Montoni and all that he had said to dissuade her from venturing on the journey His fears had often since appeared to her prophetic now they seemed confirmed Her heart as it gave her back the image of Valancourt mourned in vain regret but reason soon came with a consolation which though feeble at first acquired vigour from reflection She considered that whatever might be her sufferings she had withheld from involving him in misfortune and that whatever her future sorrows could be she was at least free from self reproach Her melancholy was assisted by the hollow sighings of the wind along the corridor and round the castle The cheerful blaze of the wood had long been extinguished and she sat with her eyes fixed on the dying embers till a loud gust that swept through the corridor and shook the doors and casements alarmed her for its violence had moved the chair she had placed as a fastening and the door leading to the private stair case stood half open Her curiosity and her fears were again awakened She took the lamp to the top of the steps and stood hesitating whether to go down but again the profound stillness and the gloom of the place awed her and determining to enquire further when day light might assist the search she closed the door and placed against it a stronger guard She now retired to her bed leaving the lamp burning on the table but its gloomy light instead of dispelling her fear assisted it for by its uncertain rays she almost fancied she saw shapes flit past her curtains and glide into the remote obscurity of her chamber The castle clock struck one before she closed her eyes to sleep CHAPTER VI I think it is the weakness of mine eyes That shapes this monstrous apparition It comes upon me JULIUS CAESAR Daylight dispelled from Emily s mind the glooms of superstition but not those of apprehension The Count Morano was the first image that occurred to her waking thoughts and then came a train of anticipated evils which she could neither conquer nor avoid She rose and to relieve her mind from the busy ideas that tormented it compelled herself to notice external objects From her casement she looked out upon the wild grandeur of the scene closed nearly on all sides by alpine steeps whose tops peeping over each other faded from the eye in misty hues while the promontories below were dark with woods that swept down to their base and stretched along the narrow vallies The rich pomp of these woods was particularly delightful to Emily and she viewed with astonishment the fortifications of the castle spreading along a vast extent of rock and now partly in decay the grandeur of the ramparts below and the towers and battlements and various features of the fabric above From these her sight wandered over the cliffs and woods into the valley along which foamed a broad and rapid stream seen falling among the crags of an opposite mountain now flashing in the sun beams and now shadowed by over arching pines till it was entirely concealed by their thick foliage Again it burst from beneath this darkness in one broad sheet of foam and fell thundering into the vale Nearer towards the west opened the mountain vista which Emily had viewed with such sublime emotion on her approach to the castle a thin dusky vapour that rose from the valley overspread its features with a sweet obscurity As this ascended and caught the sun beams it kindled into a crimson tint and touched with exquisite beauty the woods and cliffs over which it passed to the summit of the mountains then as the veil drew up it was delightful to watch the gleaming objects that progressively disclosed themselves in the valley the green turf dark woods little rocky recesses a few peasants huts the foaming stream a herd of cattle and various images of pastoral beauty Then the pine forests brightened and then the broad breast of the mountains till at length the mist settled round their summit touching them with a ruddy glow The features of the vista now appeared distinctly and the broad deep shadows that fell from the lower cliffs gave strong effect to the streaming splendour above while the mountains gradually sinking in the perspective appeared to shelve into the Adriatic sea for such Emily imagined to be the gleam of blueish light that terminated the view Thus she endeavoured to amuse her fancy and was not unsuccessful The breezy freshness of the morning too revived her She raised her thoughts in prayer which she felt always most disposed to do when viewing the sublimity of nature and her mind recovered its strength When she turned from the casement her eyes glanced upon the door she had so carefully guarded on the preceding night and she now determined to examine whither it led but on advancing to remove the chairs she perceived that they were already moved a little way Her surprise cannot be easily imagined when in the next minute she perceived that the door was fastened She felt as if she had seen an apparition The door of the corridor was locked as she had left it but this door which could be secured only on the outside must have been bolted during the night She became seriously uneasy at the thought of sleeping again in a chamber thus liable to intrusion so remote too as it was from the family and she determined to mention the circumstance to Madame Montoni and to request a change After some perplexity she found her way into the great hall and to the room which she had left on the preceding night where breakfast was spread and her aunt was alone for Montoni had been walking over the environs of the castle examining the condition of its fortifications and talking for some time with Carlo Emily observed that her aunt had been weeping and her heart softened towards her with an affection that shewed itself in her manner rather than in words while she carefully avoided the appearance of having noticed that she was unhappy She seized the opportunity of Montoni s absence to mention the circumstance of the door to request that she might be allowed another apartment and to enquire again concerning the occasion of their sudden journey On the first subject her aunt referred her to Montoni positively refusing to interfere in the affair on the last she professed utter ignorance Emily then with a wish of making her aunt more reconciled to her situation praised the grandeur of the castle and the surrounding scenery and endeavoured to soften every unpleasing circumstance attending it But though misfortune had somewhat conquered the asperities of Madame Montoni s temper and by increasing her cares for herself had taught her to feel in some degree for others the capricious love of rule which nature had planted and habit had nourished in her heart was not subdued She could not now deny herself the gratification of tyrannizing over the innocent and helpless Emily by attempting to ridicule the taste she could not feel Her satirical discourse was however interrupted by the entrance of Montoni and her countenance immediately assumed a mingled expression of fear and resentment while he seated himself at the breakfast table as if unconscious of there being any person but himself in the room Emily as she observed him in silence saw that his countenance was darker and sterner than usual O could I know said she to herself what passes in that mind could I know the thoughts that are known there I should no longer be condemned to this torturing suspense Their breakfast passed in silence till Emily ventured to request that another apartment might be allotted to her and related the circumstance which made her wish it I have no time to attend to these idle whims said Montoni that chamber was prepared for you and you must rest contented with it It is not probable that any person would take the trouble of going to that remote stair case for the purpose of fastening a door If it was not fastened when you entered the chamber the wind perhaps shook the door and made the bolts slide But I know not why I should undertake to account for so trifling an occurrence This explanation was by no means satisfactory to Emily who had observed that the bolts were rusted and consequently could not be thus easily moved but she forbore to say so and repeated her request If you will not release yourself from the slavery of these fears said Montoni sternly at least forbear to torment others by the mention of them Conquer such whims and endeavour to strengthen your mind No existence is more contemptible than that which is embittered by fear As he said this his eye glanced upon Madame Montoni who coloured highly but was still silent Emily wounded and disappointed thought her fears were in this instance too reasonable to deserve ridicule but perceiving that however they might oppress her she must endure them she tried to withdraw her attention from the subject Carlo soon after entered with some fruit Your excellenza is tired after your long ramble said he as he set the fruit upon the table but you have more to see after breakfast There is a place in the vaulted passage leading to Montoni frowned upon him and waved his hand for him to leave the room Carlo stopped looked down and then added as he advanced to the breakfast table and took up the basket of fruit I made bold your excellenza to bring some cherries here for my honoured lady and my young mistress Will your ladyship taste them madam said Carlo presenting the basket they are very fine ones though I gathered them myself and from an old tree that catches all the south sun they are as big as plums your ladyship Very well old Carlo said Madame Montoni I am obliged to you And the young Signora too she may like some of them rejoined Carlo turning with the basket to Emily it will do me good to see her eat some Thank you Carlo said Emily taking some cherries and smiling kindly Come come said Montoni impatiently enough of this Leave the room but be in waiting I shall want you presently Carlo obeyed and Montoni soon after went out to examine further into the state of the castle while Emily remained with her aunt patiently enduring her ill humour and endeavouring with much sweetness to soothe her affliction instead of resenting its effect When Madame Montoni retired to her dressing room Emily endeavoured to amuse herself by a view of the castle Through a folding door she passed from the great hall to the ramparts which extended along the brow of the precipice round three sides of the edifice the fourth was guarded by the high walls of the courts and by the gateway through which she had passed on the preceding evening The grandeur of the broad ramparts and the changing scenery they overlooked excited her high admiration for the extent of the terraces allowed the features of the country to be seen in such various points of view that they appeared to form new landscapes She often paused to examine the gothic magnificence of Udolpho its proud irregularity its lofty towers and battlements its high arched casements and its slender watch towers perched upon the corners of turrets Then she would lean on the wall of the terrace and shuddering measure with her eye the precipice below till the dark summits of the woods arrested it Wherever she turned appeared mountain tops forests of pine and narrow glens opening among the Apennines and retiring from the sight into inaccessible regions While she thus leaned Montoni followed by two men appeared ascending a winding path cut in the rock below He stopped upon a cliff and pointing to the ramparts turned to his followers and talked with much eagerness of gesticulation Emily perceived that one of these men was Carlo the other was in the dress of a peasant and he alone seemed to be receiving the directions of Montoni She withdrew from the walls and pursued her walk till she heard at a distance the sound of carriage wheels and then the loud bell of the portal when it instantly occurred to her that Count Morano was arrived As she hastily passed the folding doors from the terrace towards her own apartment several persons entered the hall by an opposite door She saw them at the extremities of the arcades and immediately retreated but the agitation of her spirits and the extent and duskiness of the hall had prevented her from distinguishing the persons of the strangers Her fears however had but one object and they had called up that object to her fancy she believed that she had seen Count Morano When she thought that they had passed the hall she ventured again to the door and proceeded unobserved to her room where she remained agitated with apprehensions and listening to every distant sound At length hearing voices on the rampart she hastened to her window and observed Montoni with Signor Cavigni walking below conversing earnestly and often stopping and turning towards each other at which time their discourse seemed to be uncommonly interesting Of the several persons who had appeared in the hall here was Cavigni alone but Emily s alarm was soon after heightened by the steps of some one in the corridor who she apprehended brought a message from the Count In the next moment Annette appeared Ah ma amselle said she here is the Signor Cavigni arrived I am sure I rejoiced to see a christian person in this place and then he is so good natured too he always takes so much notice of me And here is also Signor Verezzi and who do you think besides ma amselle I cannot guess Annette tell me quickly Nay ma am do guess once Well then said Emily with assumed composure it is Count Morano I suppose Holy Virgin cried Annette are you ill ma amselle you are going to faint let me get some water Emily sunk into a chair Stay Annette said she feebly do not leave me I shall soon be better open the casement The Count you say he is come then Who I the Count No ma amselle I did not say so He is NOT come then said Emily eagerly No ma amselle You are sure of it Lord bless me said Annette you recover very suddenly ma am why I thought you was dying just now But the Count you are sure is not come O yes quite sure of that ma amselle Why I was looking out through the grate in the north turret when the carriages drove into the court yard and I never expected to see such a goodly sight in this dismal old castle but here are masters and servants too enough to make the place ring again O I was ready to leap through the rusty old bars for joy O who would ever have thought of seeing a christian face in this huge dreary house I could have kissed the very horses that brought them Well Annette well I am better now Yes ma amselle I see you are O all the servants will lead merry lives here now we shall have singing and dancing in the little hall for the Signor cannot hear us there and droll stories Ludovico s come ma am yes there is Ludovico come with them You remember Ludovico ma am a tall handsome young man Signor Cavigni s lacquey who always wears his cloak with such a grace thrown round his left arm and his hat set on so smartly all on one side and No said Emily who was wearied by her loquacity What ma amselle don t you remember Ludovico who rowed the Cavaliero s gondola at the last regatta and won the prize And who used to sing such sweet verses about Orlandos and about the Black a moors too and Charly Charly magne yes that was the name all under my lattice in the west portico on the moon light nights at Venice O I have listened to him I fear to thy peril my good Annette said Emily for it seems his verses have stolen thy heart But let me advise you if it is so keep the secret never let him know it Ah ma amselle how can one keep such a secret as that Well Annette I am now so much better that you may leave me O but ma amselle I forgot to ask how did you sleep in this dreary old chamber last night As well as usual Did you hear no noises None Nor see anything Nothing Well that is surprising Not in the least and now tell me why you ask these questions O ma amselle I would not tell you for the world nor all I have heard about this chamber either it would frighten you so If that is all you have frightened me already and may therefore tell me what you know without hurting your conscience O Lord they say the room is haunted and has been so these many years It is by a ghost then who can draw bolts said Emily endeavouring to laugh away her apprehensions for I left the door open last night and found it fastened this morning Annette turned pale and said not a word Do you know whether any of the servants fastened this door in the morning before I rose No ma am that I will be bound they did not but I don t know shall I go and ask ma amselle said Annette moving hastily towards the corridor Stay Annette I have another question to ask tell me what you have heard concerning this room and whither that stair case leads I will go and ask it all directly ma am besides I am sure my lady wants me I cannot stay now indeed ma am She hurried from the room without waiting Emily s reply whose heart lightened by the certainty that Morano was not arrived allowed her to smile at the superstitious terror which had seized on Annette for though she sometimes felt its influence herself she could smile at it when apparent in other persons Montoni having refused Emily another chamber she determined to bear with patience the evil she could not remove and in order to make the room as comfortable as possible unpacked her books her sweet delight in happier days and her soothing resource in the hours of moderate sorrow but there were hours when even these failed of their effect when the genius the taste the enthusiasm of the sublimest writers were felt no longer Her little library being arranged on a high chest part of the furniture of the room she took out her drawing utensils and was tranquil enough to be pleased with the thought of sketching the sublime scenes beheld from her windows but she suddenly checked this pleasure remembering how often she had soothed herself by the intention of obtaining amusement of this kind and had been prevented by some new circumstance of misfortune How can I suffer myself to be deluded by hope said she and because Count Morano is not yet arrived feel a momentary happiness Alas what is it to me whether he is here to day or to morrow if he comes at all and that he will come it were weakness to doubt To withdraw her thoughts however from the subject of her misfortunes she attempted to read but her attention wandered from the page and at length she threw aside the book and determined to explore the adjoining chambers of the castle Her imagination was pleased with the view of ancient grandeur and an emotion of melancholy awe awakened all its powers as she walked through rooms obscure and desolate where no footsteps had passed probably for many years and remembered the strange history of the former possessor of the edifice This brought to her recollection the veiled picture which had attracted her curiosity on the preceding night and she resolved to examine it As she passed through the chambers that led to this she found herself somewhat agitated its connection with the late lady of the castle and the conversation of Annette together with the circumstance of the veil throwing a mystery over the subject that excited a faint degree of terror But a terror of this nature as it occupies and expands the mind and elevates it to high expectation is purely sublime and leads us by a kind of fascination to seek even the object from which we appear to shrink Emily passed on with faltering steps and having paused a moment at the door before she attempted to open it she then hastily entered the chamber and went towards the picture which appeared to be enclosed in a frame of uncommon size that hung in a dark part of the room She paused again and then with a timid hand lifted the veil but instantly let it fall perceiving that what it had concealed was no picture and before she could leave the chamber she dropped senseless on the floor When she recovered her recollection the remembrance of what she had seen had nearly deprived her of it a second time She had scarcely strength to remove from the room and regain her own and when arrived there wanted courage to remain alone Horror occupied her mind and excluded for a time all sense of past and dread of future misfortune she seated herself near the casement because from thence she heard voices though distant on the terrace and might see people pass and these trifling as they were were reviving circumstances When her spirits had recovered their tone she considered whether she should mention what she had seen to Madame Montoni and various and important motives urged her to do so among which the least was the hope of the relief which an overburdened mind finds in speaking of the subject of its interest But she was aware of the terrible consequences which such a communication might lead to and dreading the indiscretion of her aunt at length endeavoured to arm herself with resolution to observe a profound silence on the subject Montoni and Verezzi soon after passed under the casement speaking cheerfully and their voices revived her Presently the Signors Bertolini and Cavigni joined the party on the terrace and Emily supposing that Madame Montoni was then alone went to seek her for the solitude of her chamber and its proximity to that where she had received so severe a shock again affected her spirit She found her aunt in her dressing room preparing for dinner Emily s pale and affrighted countenance alarmed even Madame Montoni but she had sufficient strength of mind to be silent on the subject that still made her shudder and which was ready to burst from her lips In her aunt s apartment she remained till they both descended to dinner There she met the gentlemen lately arrived who had a kind of busy seriousness in their looks which was somewhat unusual with them while their thoughts seemed too much occupied by some deep interest to suffer them to bestow much attention either on Emily or Madame Montoni They spoke little and Montoni less Emily as she now looked on him shuddered The horror of the chamber rushed on her mind Several times the colour faded from her cheeks and she feared that illness would betray her emotions and compel her to leave the room but the strength of her resolution remedied the weakness of her frame she obliged herself to converse and even tried to look cheerful Montoni evidently laboured under some vexation such as would probably have agitated a weaker mind or a more susceptible heart but which appeared from the sternness of his countenance only to bend up his faculties to energy and fortitude It was a comfortless and silent meal The gloom of the castle seemed to have spread its contagion even over the gay countenance of Cavigni and with this gloom was mingled a fierceness such as she had seldom seen him indicate Count Morano was not named and what conversation there was turned chiefly upon the wars which at that time agitated the Italian states the strength of the Venetian armies and the characters of their generals After dinner when the servants had withdrawn Emily learned that the cavalier who had drawn upon himself the vengeance of Orsino had since died of his wounds and that strict search was still making for his murderer The intelligence seemed to disturb Montoni who mused and then enquired where Orsino had concealed himself His guests who all except Cavigni were ignorant that Montoni had himself assisted him to escape from Venice replied that he had fled in the night with such precipitation and secrecy that his most intimate companions knew not whither Montoni blamed himself for having asked the question for a second thought convinced him that a man of Orsino s suspicious temper was not likely to trust any of the persons present with the knowledge of his asylum He considered himself however as entitled to his utmost confidence and did not doubt that he should soon hear of him Emily retired with Madame Montoni soon after the cloth was withdrawn and left the cavaliers to their secret councils but not before the significant frowns of Montoni had warned his wife to depart who passed from the hall to the ramparts and walked for some time in silence which Emily did not interrupt for her mind was also occupied by interests of its own It required all her resolution to forbear communicating to Madame Montoni the terrible subject which still thrilled her every nerve with horror and sometimes she was on the point of doing so merely to obtain the relief of a moment but she knew how wholly she was in the power of Montoni and considering that the indiscretion of her aunt might prove fatal to them both she compelled herself to endure a present and an inferior evil rather than to tempt a future and a heavier one A strange kind of presentiment frequently on this day occurred to her it seemed as if her fate rested here and was by some invisible means connected with this castle Let me not accelerate it said she to herself for whatever I may be reserved let me at least avoid self reproach As she looked on the massy walls of the edifice her melancholy spirits represented it to be her prison and she started as at a new suggestion when she considered how far distant she was from her native country from her little peaceful home and from her only friend how remote was her hope of happiness how feeble the expectation of again seeing him Yet the idea of Valancourt and her confidence in his faithful love had hitherto been her only solace and she struggled hard to retain them A few tears of agony started to her eyes which she turned aside to conceal While she afterwards leaned on the wall of the rampart some peasants at a little distance were seen examining a breach before which lay a heap of stones as if to repair it and a rusty old cannon that appeared to have fallen from its station above Madame Montoni stopped to speak to the men and enquired what they were going to do To repair the fortifications your ladyship said one of them a labour which she was somewhat surprised that Montoni should think necessary particularly since he had never spoken of the castle as of a place at which he meant to reside for any considerable time but she passed on towards a lofty arch that led from the south to the east rampart and which adjoined the castle on one side while on the other it supported a small watch tower that entirely commanded the deep valley below As she approached this arch she saw beyond it winding along the woody descent of a distant mountain a long troop of horse and foot whom she knew to be soldiers only by the glitter of their pikes and other arms for the distance did not allow her to discover the colour of their liveries As she gazed the vanguard issued from the woods into the valley but the train still continued to pour over the remote summit of the mountain in endless succession while in the front the military uniform became distinguishable and the commanders riding first and seeming by their gestures to direct the march of those that followed at length approached very near to the castle Such a spectacle in these solitary regions both surprised and alarmed Madame Montoni and she hastened towards some peasants who were employed in raising bastions before the south rampart where the rock was less abrupt than elsewhere These men could give no satisfactory answers to her enquiries but being roused by them gazed in stupid astonishment upon the long cavalcade Madame Montoni then thinking it necessary to communicate further the object of her alarm sent Emily to say that she wished to speak to Montoni an errand her niece did not approve for she dreaded his frowns which she knew this message would provoke but she obeyed in silence As she drew near the apartment in which he sat with his guests she heard them in earnest and loud dispute and she paused a moment trembling at the displeasure which her sudden interruption would occasion In the next their voices sunk all together she then ventured to open the door and while Montoni turned hastily and looked at her without speaking she delivered her message Tell Madam Montoni I am engaged said he Emily then thought it proper to mention the subject of her alarm Montoni and his companions rose instantly and went to the windows but these not affording them a view of the troops they at length proceeded to the ramparts where Cavigni conjectured it to be a legion of condottieri on their march towards Modena One part of the cavalcade now extended along the valley and another wound among the mountains towards the north while some troops still lingered on the woody precipices where the first had appeared so that the great length of the procession seemed to include an whole army While Montoni and his family watched its progress they heard the sound of trumpets and the clash of cymbals in the vale and then others answering from the heights Emily listened with emotion to the shrill blast that woke the echoes of the mountains and Montoni explained the signals with which he appeared to be well acquainted and which meant nothing hostile The uniforms of the troops and the kind of arms they bore confirmed to him the conjecture of Cavigni and he had the satisfaction to see them pass by without even stopping to gaze upon his castle He did not however leave the rampart till the bases of the mountains had shut them from his view and the last murmur of the trumpet floated away on the wind Cavigni and Verezzi were inspirited by this spectacle which seemed to have roused all the fire of their temper Montoni turned into the castle in thoughtful silence Emily s mind had not yet sufficiently recovered from its late shock to endure the loneliness of her chamber and she remained upon the ramparts for Madame Montoni had not invited her to her dressing room whither she had gone evidently in low spirits and Emily from her late experience had lost all wish to explore the gloomy and mysterious recesses of the castle The ramparts therefore were almost her only retreat and here she lingered till the gray haze of evening was again spread over the scene The cavaliers supped by themselves and Madame Montoni remained in her apartment whither Emily went before she retired to her own She found her aunt weeping and in much agitation The tenderness of Emily was naturally so soothing that it seldom failed to give comfort to the drooping heart but Madame Montoni s was torn and the softest accents of Emily s voice were lost upon it With her usual delicacy she did not appear to observe her aunt s distress but it gave an involuntary gentleness to her manners and an air of solicitude to her countenance which Madame Montoni was vexed to perceive who seemed to feel the pity of her niece to be an insult to her pride and dismissed her as soon as she properly could Emily did not venture to mention again the reluctance she felt to her gloomy chamber but she requested that Annette might be permitted to remain with her till she retired to rest and the request was somewhat reluctantly granted Annette however was now with the servants and Emily withdrew alone With light and hasty steps she passed through the long galleries while the feeble glimmer of the lamp she carried only shewed the gloom around her and the passing air threatened to extinguish it The lonely silence that reigned in this part of the castle awed her now and then indeed she heard a faint peal of laughter rise from a remote part of the edifice where the servants were assembled but it was soon lost and a kind of breathless stillness remained As she passed the suite of rooms which she had visited in the morning her eyes glanced fearfully on the door and she almost fancied she heard murmuring sounds within but she paused not a moment to enquire Having reached her own apartment where no blazing wood on the hearth dissipated the gloom she sat down with a book to enliven her attention till Annette should come and a fire could be kindled She continued to read till her light was nearly expired but Annette did not appear and the solitude and obscurity of her chamber again affected her spirits the more because of its nearness to the scene of horror that she had witnessed in the morning Gloomy and fantastic images came to her mind She looked fearfully towards the door of the stair case and then examining whether it was still fastened found that it was so Unable to conquer the uneasiness she felt at the prospect of sleeping again in this remote and insecure apartment which some person seemed to have entered during the preceding night her impatience to see Annette whom she had bidden to enquire concerning this circumstance became extremely painful She wished also to question her as to the object which had excited so much horror in her own mind and which Annette on the preceding evening had appeared to be in part acquainted with though her words were very remote from the truth and it appeared plainly to Emily that the girl had been purposely misled by a false report above all she was surprised that the door of the chamber which contained it should be left unguarded Such an instance of negligence almost surpassed belief But her light was now expiring the faint flashes it threw upon the walls called up all the terrors of fancy and she rose to find her way to the habitable part of the castle before it was quite extinguished As she opened the chamber door she heard remote voices and soon after saw a light issue upon the further end of the corridor which Annette and another servant approached I am glad you are come said Emily what has detained you so long Pray light me a fire immediately My lady wanted me ma amselle replied Annette in some confusion I will go and get the wood No said Caterina that is my business and left the room instantly while Annette would have followed but being called back she began to talk very loud and laugh and seemed afraid to trust a pause of silence Caterina soon returned with the wood and then when the cheerful blaze once more animated the room and this servant had withdrawn Emily asked Annette whether she had made the enquiry she bade her Yes ma amselle said Annette but not a soul knows any thing about the matter and old Carlo I watched him well for they say he knows strange things old Carlo looked so as I don t know how to tell and he asked me again and again if I was sure the door was ever unfastened Lord says I am I sure I am alive And as for me ma am I am all astounded as one may say and would no more sleep in this chamber than I would on the great cannon at the end of the east rampart And what objection have you to that cannon more than to any of the rest said Emily smiling the best would be rather a hard bed Yes ma amselle any of them would be hard enough for that matter but they do say that something has been seen in the dead of night standing beside the great cannon as if to guard it Well my good Annette the people who tell such stories are happy in having you for an auditor for I perceive you believe them all Dear ma amselle I will shew you the very cannon you can see it from these windows Well said Emily but that does not prove that an apparition guards it What not if I shew you the very cannon Dear ma am you will believe nothing Nothing probably upon this subject but what I see said Emily Well ma am but you shall see it if you will only step this way to the casement Emily could not forbear laughing and Annette looked surprised Perceiving her extreme aptitude to credit the marvellous Emily forbore to mention the subject she had intended lest it should overcome her with idle terrors and she began to speak on a lively topic the regattas of Venice Aye ma amselle those rowing matches said Annette and the fine moon light nights are all that are worth seeing in Venice To be sure the moon is brighter than any I ever saw and then to hear such sweet music too as Ludovico has often and often sung under the lattice by the west portico Ma amselle it was Ludovico that told me about that picture which you wanted so to look at last night and What picture said Emily wishing Annette to explain herself O that terrible picture with the black veil over it You never saw it then said Emily Who I No ma amselle I never did But this morning continued Annette lowering her voice and looking round the room this morning as it was broad daylight do you know ma am I took a strange fancy to see it as I had heard such odd hints about it and I got as far as the door and should have opened it if it had not been locked Emily endeavouring to conceal the emotion this circumstance occasioned enquired at what hour she went to the chamber and found that it was soon after herself had been there She also asked further questions and the answers convinced her that Annette and probably her informer were ignorant of the terrible truth though in Annette s account something very like the truth now and then mingled with the falsehood Emily now began to fear that her visit to the chamber had been observed since the door had been closed so immediately after her departure and dreaded lest this should draw upon her the vengeance of Montoni Her anxiety also was excited to know whence and for what purpose the delusive report which had been imposed upon Annette had originated since Montoni could only have wished for silence and secrecy but she felt that the subject was too terrible for this lonely hour and she compelled herself to leave it to converse with Annette whose chat simple as it was she preferred to the stillness of total solitude Thus they sat till near midnight but not without many hints from Annette that she wished to go The embers were now nearly burnt out and Emily heard at a distance the thundering sound of the hall doors as they were shut for the night She therefore prepared for rest but was still unwilling that Annette should leave her At this instant the great bell of the portal sounded They listened in fearful expectation when after a long pause of silence it sounded again Soon after they heard the noise of carriage wheels in the court yard Emily sunk almost lifeless in her chair It is the Count said she What at this time of night ma am said Annette no my dear lady But for that matter it is a strange time of night for any body to come Nay pr ythee good Annette stay not talking said Emily in a voice of agony Go pr ythee go and see who it is Annette left the room and carried with her the light leaving Emily in darkness which a few moments before would have terrified her in this room but was now scarcely observed by her She listened and waited in breathless expectation and heard distant noises but Annette did not return Her patience at length exhausted she tried to find her way to the corridor but it was long before she could touch the door of the chamber and when she had opened it the total darkness without made her fear to proceed Voices were now heard and Emily even thought she distinguished those of Count Morano and Montoni Soon after she heard steps approaching and then a ray of light streamed through the darkness and Annette appeared whom Emily went to meet Yes ma amselle said she you was right it is the Count sure enough It is he exclaimed Emily lifting her eyes towards heaven and supporting herself by Annette s arm Good Lord my dear lady don t be in such a FLUSTER and look so pale we shall soon hear more We shall indeed said Emily moving as fast as she was able towards her apartment I am not well give me air Annette opened a casement and brought water The faintness soon left Emily but she desired Annette would not go till she heard from Montoni Dear ma amselle he surely will not disturb you at this time of night why he must think you are asleep Stay with me till I am so then said Emily who felt temporary relief from this suggestion which appeared probable enough though her fears had prevented its occurring to her Annette with secret reluctance consented to stay and Emily was now composed enough to ask her some questions among others whether she had seen the Count Yes ma am I saw him alight for I went from hence to the grate in the north turret that overlooks the inner court yard you know There I saw the Count s carriage and the Count in it waiting at the great door for the porter was just gone to bed with several men on horseback all by the light of the torches they carried Emily was compelled to smile When the door was opened the Count said something that I could not make out and then got out and another gentleman with him I thought to be sure the Signor was gone to bed and I hastened away to my lady s dressing room to see what I could hear But in the way I met Ludovico and he told me that the Signor was up counselling with his master and the other Signors in the room at the end of the north gallery and Ludovico held up his finger and laid it on his lips as much as to say There is more going on than you think of Annette but you must hold your tongue And so I did hold my tongue ma amselle and came away to tell you directly Emily enquired who the cavalier was that accompanied the Count and how Montoni received them but Annette could not inform her Ludovico she added had just been to call Signor Montoni s valet that he might tell him they were arrived when I met him Emily sat musing for some time and then her anxiety was so much increased that she desired Annette would go to the servants hall where it was possible she might hear something of the Count s intention respecting his stay at the castle Yes ma am said Annette with readiness but how am I to find the way if I leave the lamp with you Emily said she would light her and they immediately quitted the chamber When they had reached the top of the great stair case Emily recollected that she might be seen by the Count and to avoid the great hall Annette conducted her through some private passages to a back stair case which led directly to that of the servants As she returned towards her chamber Emily began to fear that she might again lose herself in the intricacies of the castle and again be shocked by some mysterious spectacle and though she was already perplexed by the numerous turnings she feared to open one of the many doors that offered While she stepped thoughtfully along she fancied that she heard a low moaning at no great distance and having paused a moment she heard it again and distinctly Several doors appeared on the right hand of the passage She advanced and listened When she came to the second she heard a voice apparently in complaint within to which she continued to listen afraid to open the door and unwilling to leave it Convulsive sobs followed and then the piercing accents of an agonizing spirit burst forth Emily stood appalled and looked through the gloom that surrounded her in fearful expectation The lamentations continued Pity now began to subdue terror it was possible she might administer comfort to the sufferer at least by expressing sympathy and she laid her hand on the door While she hesitated she thought she knew this voice disguised as it was by tones of grief Having therefore set down the lamp in the passage she gently opened the door within which all was dark except that from an inner apartment a partial light appeared and she stepped softly on Before she reached it the appearance of Madame Montoni leaning on her dressing table weeping and with a handkerchief held to her eyes struck her and she paused Some person was seated in a chair by the fire but who it was she could not distinguish He spoke now and then in a low voice that did not allow Emily to hear what was uttered but she thought that Madame Montoni at those times wept the more who was too much occupied by her own distress to observe Emily while the latter though anxious to know what occasioned this and who was the person admitted at so late an hour to her aunt s dressing room forbore to add to her sufferings by surprising her or to take advantage of her situation by listening to a private discourse She therefore stepped softly back and after some further difficulty found the way to her own chamber where nearer interests at length excluded the surprise and concern she had felt respecting Madame Montoni Annette however returned without satisfactory intelligence for the servants among whom she had been were either entirely ignorant or affected to be so concerning the Count s intended stay at the castle They could talk only of the steep and broken road they had just passed and of the numerous dangers they had escaped and express wonder how their lord could choose to encounter all these in the darkness of night for they scarcely allowed that the torches had served for any other purpose but that of shewing the dreariness of the mountains Annette finding she could gain no information left them making noisy petitions for more wood on the fire and more supper on the table And now ma amselle added she I am so sleepy I am sure if you was so sleepy you would not desire me to sit up with you Emily indeed began to think it was cruel to wish it she had also waited so long without receiving a summons from Montoni that it appeared he did not mean to disturb her at this late hour and she determined to dismiss Annette But when she again looked round her gloomy chamber and recollected certain circumstances fear seized her spirits and she hesitated And yet it were cruel of me to ask you to stay till I am asleep Annette said she for I fear it will be very long before I forget myself in sleep I dare say it will be very long ma amselle said Annette But before you go rejoined Emily let me ask you Had Signor Montoni left Count Morano when you quitted the hall O no ma am they were alone together Have you been in my aunt s dressing room since you left me No ma amselle I called at the door as I passed but it was fastened so I thought my lady was gone to bed Who then was with your lady just now said Emily forgetting in surprise her usual prudence Nobody I believe ma am replied Annette nobody has been with her I believe since I left you Emily took no further notice of the subject and after some struggle with imaginary fears her good nature prevailed over them so far that she dismissed Annette for the night She then sat musing upon her own circumstances and those of Madame Montoni till her eye rested on the miniature picture which she had found after her father s death among the papers he had enjoined her to destroy It was open upon the table before her among some loose drawings having with them been taken out of a little box by Emily some hours before The sight of it called up many interesting reflections but the melancholy sweetness of the countenance soothed the emotions which these had occasioned It was the same style of countenance as that of her late father and while she gazed on it with fondness on this account she even fancied a resemblance in the features But this tranquillity was suddenly interrupted when she recollected the words in the manuscript that had been found with this picture and which had formerly occasioned her so much doubt and horror At length she roused herself from the deep reverie into which this remembrance had thrown her but when she rose to undress the silence and solitude to which she was left at this midnight hour for not even a distant sound was now heard conspired with the impression the subject she had been considering had given to her mind to appall her Annette s hints too concerning this chamber simple as they were had not failed to affect her since they followed a circumstance of peculiar horror which she herself had witnessed and since the scene of this was a chamber nearly adjoining her own The door of the stair case was perhaps a subject of more reasonable alarm and she now began to apprehend such was the aptitude of her fears that this stair case had some private communication with the apartment which she shuddered even to remember Determined not to undress she lay down to sleep in her clothes with her late father s dog the faithful MANCHON at the foot of the bed whom she considered as a kind of guard Thus circumstanced she tried to banish reflection but her busy fancy would still hover over the subjects of her interest and she heard the clock of the castle strike two before she closed her eyes From the disturbed slumber into which she then sunk she was soon awakened by a noise which seemed to arise within her chamber but the silence that prevailed as she fearfully listened inclined her to believe that she had been alarmed by such sounds as sometimes occur in dreams and she laid her head again upon the pillow A return of the noise again disturbed her it seemed to come from that part of the room which communicated with the private stair case and she instantly remembered the odd circumstance of the door having been fastened during the preceding night by some unknown hand Her late alarming suspicion concerning its communication also occurred to her Her heart became faint with terror Half raising herself from the bed and gently drawing aside the curtain she looked towards the door of the stair case but the lamp that burnt on the hearth spread so feeble a light through the apartment that the remote parts of it were lost in shadow The noise however which she was convinced came from the door continued It seemed like that made by the undrawing of rusty bolts and often ceased and was then renewed more gently as if the hand that occasioned it was restrained by a fear of discovery While Emily kept her eyes fixed on the spot she saw the door move and then slowly open and perceived something enter the room but the extreme duskiness prevented her distinguishing what it was Almost fainting with terror she had yet sufficient command over herself to check the shriek that was escaping from her lips and letting the curtain drop from her hand continued to observe in silence the motions of the mysterious form she saw It seemed to glide along the remote obscurity of the apartment then paused and as it approached the hearth she perceived in the stronger light what appeared to be a human figure Certain remembrances now struck upon her heart and almost subdued the feeble remains of her spirits she continued however to watch the figure which remained for some time motionless but then advancing slowly towards the bed stood silently at the feet where the curtains being a little open allowed her still to see it terror however had now deprived her of the power of discrimination as well as of that of utterance Having continued there a moment the form retreated towards the hearth when it took the lamp held it up surveyed the chamber for a few moments and then again advanced towards the bed The light at that instant awakening the dog that had slept at Emily s feet he barked loudly and jumping to the floor flew at the stranger who struck the animal smartly with a sheathed sword and springing towards the bed Emily discovered Count Morano She gazed at him for a moment in speechless affright while he throwing himself on his knee at the bed side besought her to fear nothing and having thrown down his sword would have taken her hand when the faculties that terror had suspended suddenly returned and she sprung from the bed in the dress which surely a kind of prophetic apprehension had prevented her on this night from throwing aside Morano rose followed her to the door through which he had entered and caught her hand as she reached the top of the stair case but not before she had discovered by the gleam of a lamp another man half way down the steps She now screamed in despair and believing herself given up by Montoni saw indeed no possibility of escape The Count who still held her hand led her back into the chamber Why all this terror said he in a tremulous voice Hear me Emily I come not to alarm you no by Heaven I love you too well too well for my own peace Emily looked at him for a moment in fearful doubt Then leave me sir said she leave me instantly Hear me Emily resumed Morano hear me I love and am in despair yes in despair How can I gaze upon you and know that it is perhaps for the last time without suffering all the phrensy of despair But it shall not be so you shall be mine in spite of Montoni and all his villany In spite of Montoni cried Emily eagerly what is it I hear You hear that Montoni is a villain exclaimed Morano with vehemence a villain who would have sold you to my love Who And is he less who would have bought me said Emily fixing on the Count an eye of calm contempt Leave the room sir instantly she continued in a voice trembling between joy and fear or I will alarm the family and you may receive that from Signor Montoni s vengeance which I have vainly supplicated from his pity But Emily knew that she was beyond the hearing of those who might protect her You can never hope any thing from his pity said Morano he has used me infamously and my vengeance shall pursue him And for you Emily for you he has new plans more profitable than the last no doubt The gleam of hope which the Count s former speech had revived was now nearly extinguished by the latter and while Emily s countenance betrayed the emotions of her mind he endeavoured to take advantage of the discovery I lose time said he I came not to exclaim against Montoni I came to solicit to plead to Emily to tell her all I suffer to entreat her to save me from despair and herself from destruction Emily the schemes of Montoni are insearchable but I warn you they are terrible he has no principle when interest or ambition leads Can I love you and abandon you to his power Fly then fly from this gloomy prison with a lover who adores you I have bribed a servant of the castle to open the gates and before tomorrow s dawn you shall be far on the way to Venice Emily overcome by the sudden shock she had received at the moment too when she had begun to hope for better days now thought she saw destruction surround her on every side Unable to reply and almost to think she threw herself into a chair pale and breathless That Montoni had formerly sold her to Morano was very probable that he had now withdrawn his consent to the marriage was evident from the Count s present conduct and it was nearly certain that a scheme of stronger interest only could have induced the selfish Montoni to forego a plan which he had hitherto so strenuously pursued These reflections made her tremble at the hints which Morano had just given which she no longer hesitated to believe and while she shrunk from the new scenes of misery and oppression that might await her in the castle of Udolpho she was compelled to observe that almost her only means of escaping them was by submitting herself to the protection of this man with whom evils more certain and not less terrible appeared evils upon which she could not endure to pause for an instant Her silence though it was that of agony encouraged the hopes of Morano who watched her countenance with impatience took again the resisting hand she had withdrawn and as he pressed it to his heart again conjured her to determine immediately Every moment we lose will make our departure more dangerous said he these few moments lost may enable Montoni to overtake us I beseech you sir be silent said Emily faintly I am indeed very wretched and wretched I must remain Leave me I command you leave me to my fate Never cried the Count vehemently let me perish first But forgive my violence the thought of losing you is madness You cannot be ignorant of Montoni s character you may be ignorant of his schemes nay you must be so or you would not hesitate between my love and his power Nor do I hesitate said Emily Let us go then said Morano eagerly kissing her hand and rising my carriage waits below the castle walls You mistake me sir said Emily Allow me to thank you for the interest you express in my welfare and to decide by my own choice I shall remain under the protection of Signor Montoni Under his protection exclaimed Morano proudly his PROTECTION Emily why will you suffer yourself to be thus deluded I have already told you what you have to expect from his PROTECTION And pardon me sir if in this instance I doubt mere assertion and to be convinced require something approaching to proof I have now neither the time or the means of adducing proof replied the Count Nor have I sir the inclination to listen to it if you had But you trifle with my patience and my distress continued Morano Is a marriage with a man who adores you so very terrible in your eyes that you would prefer to it all the misery to which Montoni may condemn you in this remote prison Some wretch must have stolen those affections which ought to be mine or you would not thus obstinately persist in refusing an offer that would place you beyond the reach of oppression Morano walked about the room with quick steps and a disturbed air This discourse Count Morano sufficiently proves that my affections ought not to be yours said Emily mildly and this conduct that I should not be placed beyond the reach of oppression so long as I remained in your power If you wish me to believe otherwise cease to oppress me any longer by your presence If you refuse this you will compel me to expose you to the resentment of Signor Montoni Yes let him come cried Morano furiously and brave MY resentment Let him dare to face once more the man he has so courageously injured danger shall teach him morality and vengeance justice let him come and receive my sword in his heart The vehemence with which this was uttered gave Emily new cause of alarm who arose from her chair but her trembling frame refused to support her and she resumed her seat the words died on her lips and when she looked wistfully towards the door of the corridor which was locked she considered it was impossible for her to leave the apartment before Morano would be apprised of and able to counteract her intention Without observing her agitation he continued to pace the room in the utmost perturbation of spirits His darkened countenance expressed all the rage of jealousy and revenge and a person who had seen his features under the smile of ineffable tenderness which he so lately assumed would now scarcely have believed them to be the same Count Morano said Emily at length recovering her voice calm I entreat you these transports and listen to reason if you will not to pity You have equally misplaced your love and your hatred I never could have returned the affection with which you honour me and certainly have never encouraged it neither has Signor Montoni injured you for you must have known that he had no right to dispose of my hand had he even possessed the power to do so Leave then leave the castle while you may with safety Spare yourself the dreadful consequences of an unjust revenge and the remorse of having prolonged to me these moments of suffering Is it for mine or for Montoni s safety that you are thus alarmed said Morano coldly and turning towards her with a look of acrimony For both replied Emily in a trembling voice Unjust revenge cried the Count resuming the abrupt tones of passion Who that looks upon that face can imagine a punishment adequate to the injury he would have done me Yes I will leave the castle but it shall not be alone I have trifled too long Since my prayers and my sufferings cannot prevail force shall I have people in waiting who shall convey you to my carriage Your voice will bring no succour it cannot be heard from this remote part of the castle submit therefore in silence to go with me This was an unnecessary injunction at present for Emily was too certain that her call would avail her nothing and terror had so entirely disordered her thoughts that she knew not how to plead to Morano but sat mute and trembling in her chair till he advanced to lift her from it when she suddenly raised herself and with a repulsive gesture and a countenance of forced serenity said Count Morano I am now in your power but you will observe that this is not the conduct which can win the esteem you appear so solicitous to obtain and that you are preparing for yourself a load of remorse in the miseries of a friendless orphan which can never leave you Do you believe your heart to be indeed so hardened that you can look without emotion on the suffering to which you would condemn me Emily was interrupted by the growling of the dog who now came again from the bed and Morano looked towards the door of the stair case where no person appearing he called aloud Cesario Emily said the Count why will you reduce me to adopt this conduct How much more willingly would I persuade than compel you to become my wife but by Heaven I will not leave you to be sold by Montoni Yet a thought glances across my mind that brings madness with it I know not how to name it It is preposterous it cannot be Yet you tremble you grow pale It is it is so you you love Montoni cried Morano grasping Emily s wrist and stamping his foot on the floor An involuntary air of surprise appeared on her countenance If you have indeed believed so said she believe so still That look those words confirm it exclaimed Morano furiously No no no Montoni had a richer prize in view than gold But he shall not live to triumph over me This very instant He was interrupted by the loud barking of the dog Stay Count Morano said Emily terrified by his words and by the fury expressed in his eyes I will save you from this error Of all men Signor Montoni is not your rival though if I find all other means of saving myself vain I will try whether my voice may not arouse his servants to my succour Assertion replied Morano at such a moment is not to be depended upon How could I suffer myself to doubt even for an instant that he could see you and not love But my first care shall be to convey you from the castle Cesario ho Cesario A man now appeared at the door of the stair case and other steps were heard ascending Emily uttered a loud shriek as Morano hurried her across the chamber and at the same moment she heard a noise at the door that opened upon the corridor The Count paused an instant as if his mind was suspended between love and the desire of vengeance and in that instant the door gave way and Montoni followed by the old steward and several other persons burst into the room Draw cried Montoni to the Count who did not pause for a second bidding but giving Emily into the hands of the people that appeared from the stair case turned fiercely round This in thine heart villain said he as he made a thrust at Montoni with his sword who parried the blow and aimed another while some of the persons who had followed him into the room endeavoured to part the combatants and others rescued Emily from the hands of Morano s servants Was it for this Count Morano said Montoni in a cool sarcastic tone of voice that I received you under my roof and permitted you though my declared enemy to remain under it for the night Was it that you might repay my hospitality with the treachery of a fiend and rob me of my niece Who talks of treachery said Morano in a tone of unrestrained vehemence Let him that does shew an unblushing face of innocence Montoni you are a villain If there is treachery in this affair look to yourself as the author of it IF do I say I whom you have wronged with unexampled baseness whom you have injured almost beyond redress But why do I use words Come on coward and receive justice at my hands Coward cried Montoni bursting from the people who held him and rushing on the Count when they both retreated into the corridor where the fight continued so desperately that none of the spectators dared approach them Montoni swearing that the first who interfered should fall by his sword Jealousy and revenge lent all their fury to Morano while the superior skill and the temperance of Montoni enabled him to wound his adversary whom his servants now attempted to seize but he would not be restrained and regardless of his wound continued to fight He seemed to be insensible both of pain and loss of blood and alive only to the energy of his passions Montoni on the contrary persevered in the combat with a fierce yet wary valour he received the point of Morano s sword on his arm but almost in the same instant severely wounded and disarmed him The Count then fell back into the arms of his servant while Montoni held his sword over him and bade him ask his life Morano sinking under the anguish of his wound had scarcely replied by a gesture and by a few words feebly articulated that he would not when he fainted and Montoni was then going to have plunged the sword into his breast as he lay senseless but his arm was arrested by Cavigni To the interruption he yielded without much difficulty but his complexion changed almost to blackness as he looked upon his fallen adversary and ordered that he should be carried instantly from the castle In the mean time Emily who had been with held from leaving the chamber during the affray now came forward into the corridor and pleaded a cause of common humanity with the feelings of the warmest benevolence when she entreated Montoni to allow Morano the assistance in the castle which his situation required But Montoni who had seldom listened to pity now seemed rapacious of vengeance and with a monster s cruelty again ordered his defeated enemy to be taken from the castle in his present state though there were only the woods or a solitary neighbouring cottage to shelter him from the night The Count s servants having declared that they would not move him till he revived Montoni s stood inactive Cavigni remonstrating and Emily superior to Montoni s menaces giving water to Morano and directing the attendants to bind up his wound At length Montoni had leisure to feel pain from his own hurt and he withdrew to examine it The Count meanwhile having slowly recovered the first object he saw on raising his eyes was Emily bending over him with a countenance strongly expressive of solicitude He surveyed her with a look of anguish I have deserved this said he but not from Montoni It is from you Emily that I have deserved punishment yet I receive only pity He paused for he had spoken with difficulty After a moment he proceeded I must resign you but not to Montoni Forgive me the sufferings I have already occasioned you But for THAT villain his infamy shall not go unpunished Carry me from this place said he to his servants I am in no condition to travel you must therefore take me to the nearest cottage for I will not pass the night under his roof although I may expire on the way from it Cesario proposed to go out and enquire for a cottage that might receive his master before he attempted to remove him but Morano was impatient to be gone the anguish of his mind seemed to be even greater than that of his wound and he rejected with disdain the offer of Cavigni to entreat Montoni that he might be suffered to pass the night in the castle Cesario was now going to call up the carriage to the great gate but the Count forbade him I cannot bear the motion of a carriage said he call some others of my people that they may assist in bearing me in their arms At length however Morano submitted to reason and consented that Cesario should first prepare some cottage to receive him Emily now that he had recovered his senses was about to withdraw from the corridor when a message from Montoni commanded her to do so and also that the Count if he was not already gone should quit the castle immediately Indignation flashed from Morano s eyes and flushed his cheeks Tell Montoni said he that I shall go when it suits my own convenience that I quit the castle he dares to call his as I would the nest of a serpent and that this is not the last he shall hear from me Tell him I will not leave ANOTHER murder on his conscience if I can help it Count Morano do you know what you say said Cavigni Yes Signor I know well what I say and he will understand well what I mean His conscience will assist his understanding on this occasion Count Morano said Verezzi who had hitherto silently observed him dare again to insult my friend and I will plunge this sword in your body It would be an action worthy the friend of a villain said Morano as the strong impulse of his indignation enabled him to raise himself from the arms of his servants but the energy was momentary and he sunk back exhausted by the effort Montoni s people meanwhile held Verezzi who seemed inclined even in this instant to execute his threat and Cavigni who was not so depraved as to abet the cowardly malignity of Verezzi endeavoured to withdraw him from the corridor and Emily whom a compassionate interest had thus long detained was now quitting it in new terror when the supplicating voice of Morano arrested her and by a feeble gesture he beckoned her to draw nearer She advanced with timid steps but the fainting languor of his countenance again awakened her pity and overcame her terror I am going from hence for ever said he perhaps I shall never see you again I would carry with me your forgiveness Emily nay more I would also carry your good wishes You have my forgiveness then said Emily and my sincere wishes for your recovery And only for my recovery said Morano with a sigh For your general welfare added Emily Perhaps I ought to be contented with this he resumed I certainly have not deserved more but I would ask you Emily sometimes to think of me and forgetting my offence to remember only the passion which occasioned it I would ask alas impossibilities I would ask you to love me At this moment when I am about to part with you and that perhaps for ever I am scarcely myself Emily may you never know the torture of a passion like mine What do I say O that for me you might be sensible of such a passion Emily looked impatient to be gone I entreat you Count to consult your own safety said she and linger here no longer I tremble for the consequences of Signor Verezzi s passion and of Montoni s resentment should he learn that you are still here Morano s face was overspread with a momentary crimson his eyes sparkled but he seemed endeavouring to conquer his emotion and replied in a calm voice Since you are interested for my safety I will regard it and be gone But before I go let me again hear you say that you wish me well said he fixing on her an earnest and mournful look Emily repeated her assurances He took her hand which she scarcely attempted to withdraw and put it to his lips Farewell Count Morano said Emily and she turned to go when a second message arrived from Montoni and she again conjured Morano as he valued his life to quit the castle immediately He regarded her in silence with a look of fixed despair But she had no time to enforce her compassionate entreaties and not daring to disobey the second command of Montoni she left the corridor to attend him He was in the cedar parlour that adjoined the great hall laid upon a couch and suffering a degree of anguish from his wound which few persons could have disguised as he did His countenance which was stern but calm expressed the dark passion of revenge but no symptom of pain bodily pain indeed he had always despised and had yielded only to the strong and terrible energies of the soul He was attended by old Carlo and by Signor Bertolini but Madame Montoni was not with him Emily trembled as she approached and received his severe rebuke for not having obeyed his first summons and perceived also that he attributed her stay in the corridor to a motive that had not even occurred to her artless mind This is an instance of female caprice said he which I ought to have foreseen Count Morano whose suit you obstinately rejected so long as it was countenanced by me you favour it seems since you find I have dismissed him Emily looked astonished I do not comprehend you sir said she You certainly do not mean to imply that the design of the Count to visit the double chamber was founded upon any approbation of mine To that I reply nothing said Montoni but it must certainly be a more than common interest that made you plead so warmly in his cause and that could detain you thus long in his presence contrary to my express order in the presence of a man whom you have hitherto on all occasions most scrupulously shunned I fear sir it was a more than common interest that detained me said Emily calmly for of late I have been inclined to think that of compassion is an uncommon one But how could I could YOU sir witness Count Morano s deplorable condition and not wish to relieve it You add hypocrisy to caprice said Montoni frowning and an attempt at satire to both but before you undertake to regulate the morals of other persons you should learn and practise the virtues which are indispensable to a woman sincerity uniformity of conduct and obedience Emily who had always endeavoured to regulate her conduct by the nicest laws and whose mind was finely sensible not only of what is just in morals but of whatever is beautiful in the female character was shocked by these words yet in the next moment her heart swelled with the consciousness of having deserved praise instead of censure and she was proudly silent Montoni acquainted with the delicacy of her mind knew how keenly she would feel his rebuke but he was a stranger to the luxury of conscious worth and therefore did not foresee the energy of that sentiment which now repelled his satire Turning to a servant who had lately entered the room he asked whether Morano had quitted the castle The man answered that his servants were then removing him on a couch to a neighbouring cottage Montoni seemed somewhat appeased on hearing this and when Ludovico appeared a few moments after and said that Morano was gone he told Emily she might retire to her apartment She withdrew willingly from his presence but the thought of passing the remainder of the night in a chamber which the door from the stair case made liable to the intrusion of any person now alarmed her more than ever and she determined to call at Madame Montoni s room and request that Annette might be permitted to be with her On reaching the great gallery she heard voices seemingly in dispute and her spirits now apt to take alarm she paused but soon distinguished some words of Cavigni and Verezzi and went towards them in the hope of conciliating their difference They were alone Verezzi s face was still flushed with rage and as the first object of it was now removed from him he appeared willing to transfer his resentment to Cavigni who seemed to be expostulating rather than disputing with him Verezzi was protesting that he would instantly inform Montoni of the insult which Morano had thrown out against him and above all that wherein he had accused him of murder There is no answering said Cavigni for the words of a man in a passion little serious regard ought to be paid to them If you persist in your resolution the consequences may be fatal to both We have now more serious interests to pursue than those of a petty revenge Emily joined her entreaties to Cavigni s arguments and they at length prevailed so far as that Verezzi consented to retire without seeing Montoni On calling at her aunt s apartment she found it fastened In a few minutes however it was opened by Madame Montoni herself It may be remembered that it was by a door leading into the bedroom from a back passage that Emily had secretly entered a few hours preceding She now conjectured by the calmness of Madame Montoni s air that she was not apprised of the accident which had befallen her husband and was beginning to inform her of it in the tenderest manner she could when her aunt interrupted her by saying she was acquainted with the whole affair Emily knew indeed that she had little reason to love Montoni but could scarcely have believed her capable of such perfect apathy as she now discovered towards him having obtained permission however for Annette to sleep in her chamber she went thither immediately A track of blood appeared along the corridor leading to it and on the spot where the Count and Montoni had fought the whole floor was stained Emily shuddered and leaned on Annette as she passed When she reached her apartment she instantly determined since the door of the stair case had been left open and that Annette was now with her to explore whither it led a circumstance now materially connected with her own safety Annette accordingly half curious and half afraid proposed to descend the stairs but on approaching the door they perceived that it was already fastened without and their care was then directed to the securing it on the inside also by placing against it as much of the heavy furniture of the room as they could lift Emily then retired to bed and Annette continued on a chair by the hearth where some feeble embers remained CHAPTER VII Of aery tongues that syllable men s names On sands and shores and desert wildernesses MILTON It is now necessary to mention some circumstances which could not be related amidst the events of Emily s hasty departure from Venice or together with those which so rapidly succeeded to her arrival in the castle On the morning of her journey Count Morano had gone at the appointed hour to the mansion of Montoni to demand his bride When he reached it he was somewhat surprised by the silence and solitary air of the portico where Montoni s lacqueys usually loitered but surprise was soon changed to astonishment and astonishment to the rage of disappointment when the door was opened by an old woman who told his servants that her master and his family had left Venice early in the morning for terra firma Scarcely believing what his servants told he left his gondola and rushed into the hall to enquire further The old woman who was the only person left in care of the mansion persisted in her story which the silent and deserted apartments soon convinced him was no fiction He then seized her with a menacing air as if he meant to wreak all his vengeance upon her at the same time asking her twenty questions in a breath and all these with a gesticulation so furious that she was deprived of the power of answering them then suddenly letting her go he stamped about the hall like a madman cursing Montoni and his own folly When the good woman was at liberty and had somewhat recovered from her fright she told him all she knew of the affair which was indeed very little but enough to enable Morano to discover that Montoni was gone to his castle on the Apennine Thither he followed as soon as his servants could complete the necessary preparation for the journey accompanied by a friend and attended by a number of his people determined to obtain Emily or a full revenge on Montoni When his mind had recovered from the first effervescence of rage and his thoughts became less obscured his conscience hinted to him certain circumstances which in some measure explained the conduct of Montoni but how the latter could have been led to suspect an intention which he had believed was known only to himself he could not even guess On this occasion however he had been partly betrayed by that sympathetic intelligence which may be said to exist between bad minds and which teaches one man to judge what another will do in the same circumstances Thus it was with Montoni who had now received indisputable proof of a truth which he had some time suspected that Morano s circumstances instead of being affluent as he had been bidden to believe were greatly involved Montoni had been interested in his suit by motives entirely selfish those of avarice and pride the last of which would have been gratified by an alliance with a Venetian nobleman the former by Emily s estate in Gascony which he had stipulated as the price of his favour should be delivered up to him from the day of her marriage In the meantime he had been led to suspect the consequence of the Count s boundless extravagance but it was not till the evening preceding the intended nuptials that he obtained certain information of his distressed circumstances He did not hesitate then to infer that Morano designed to defraud him of Emily s estate and in this supposition he was confirmed and with apparent reason by the subsequent conduct of the Count who after having appointed to meet him on that night for the purpose of signing the instrument which was to secure to him his reward failed in his engagement Such a circumstance indeed in a man of Morano s gay and thoughtless character and at a time when his mind was engaged by the bustle of preparation for his nuptials might have been attributed to a cause less decisive than design but Montoni did not hesitate an instant to interpret it his own way and after vainly waiting the Count s arrival for several hours he gave orders for his people to be in readiness to set off at a moment s notice By hastening to Udolpho he intended to remove Emily from the reach of Morano as well as to break off the affair without submitting himself to useless altercation and if the Count meant what he called honourably he would doubtless follow Emily and sign the writings in question If this was done so little consideration had Montoni for her welfare that he would not have scrupled to sacrifice her to a man of ruined fortune since by that means he could enrich himself and he forbore to mention to her the motive of his sudden journey lest the hope it might revive should render her more intractable when submission would be required With these considerations he had left Venice and with others totally different Morano had soon after pursued his steps across the rugged Apennines When his arrival was announced at the castle Montoni did not believe that he would have presumed to shew himself unless he had meant to fulfil his engagement and he therefore readily admitted him but the enraged countenance and expressions of Morano as he entered the apartment instantly undeceived him and when Montoni had explained in part the motives of his abrupt departure from Venice the Count still persisted in demanding Emily and reproaching Montoni without even naming the former stipulation Montoni at length weary of the dispute deferred the settling of it till the morrow and Morano retired with some hope suggested by Montoni s apparent indecision When however in the silence of his own apartment he began to consider the past conversation the character of Montoni and some former instances of his duplicity the hope which he had admitted vanished and he determined not to neglect the present possibility of obtaining Emily by other means To his confidential valet he told his design of carrying away Emily and sent him back to Montoni s servants to find out one among them who might enable him to execute it The choice of this person he entrusted to the fellow s own discernment and not imprudently for he discovered a man whom Montoni had on some former occasion treated harshly and who was now ready to betray him This man conducted Cesario round the castle through a private passage to the stair case that led to Emily s chamber then shewed him a short way out of the building and afterwards procured him the keys that would secure his retreat The man was well rewarded for his trouble how the Count was rewarded for his treachery had already appeared Meanwhile old Carlo had overheard two of Morano s servants who had been ordered to be in waiting with the carriage beyond the castle walls expressing their surprise at their master s sudden and secret departure for the valet had entrusted them with no more of Morano s designs than it was necessary for them to execute They however indulged themselves in surmises and in expressing them to each other and from these Carlo had drawn a just conclusion But before he ventured to disclose his apprehensions to Montoni he endeavoured to obtain further confirmation of them and for this purpose placed himself with one of his fellow servants at the door of Emily s apartment that opened upon the corridor He did not watch long in vain though the growling of the dog had once nearly betrayed him When he was convinced that Morano was in the room and had listened long enough to his conversation to understand his scheme he immediately alarmed Montoni and thus rescued Emily from the designs of the Count Montoni on the following morning appeared as usual except that he wore his wounded arm in a sling he went out upon the ramparts overlooked the men employed in repairing them gave orders for additional workmen and then came into the castle to give audience to several persons who were just arrived and who were shewn into a private apartment where he communicated with them for near an hour Carlo was then summoned and ordered to conduct the strangers to a part of the castle which in former times had been occupied by the upper servants of the family and to provide them with every necessary refreshment When he had done this he was bidden to return to his master Meanwhile the Count remained in a cottage in the skirts of the woods below suffering under bodily and mental pain and meditating deep revenge against Montoni His servant whom he had dispatched for a surgeon to the nearest town which was however at a considerable distance did not return till the following day when his wounds being examined and dressed the practitioner refused to deliver any positive opinion concerning the degree of danger attending them but giving his patient a composing draught and ordering him to be quiet remained at the cottage to watch the event Emily for the remainder of the late eventful night had been suffered to sleep undisturbed and when her mind recovered from the confusion of slumber and she remembered that she was now released from the addresses of Count Morano her spirits were suddenly relieved from a part of the terrible anxiety that had long oppressed them that which remained arose chiefly from a recollection of Morano s assertions concerning the schemes of Montoni He had said that plans of the latter concerning Emily were insearchable yet that he knew them to be terrible At the time he uttered this she almost believed it to be designed for the purpose of prevailing with her to throw herself into his protection and she still thought it might be chiefly so accounted for but his assertions had left an impression on her mind which a consideration of the character and former conduct of Montoni did not contribute to efface She however checked her propensity to anticipate evil and determined to enjoy this respite from actual misfortune tried to dismiss thought took her instruments for drawing and placed herself at a window to select into a landscape some features of the scenery without As she was thus employed she saw walking on the rampart below the men who had so lately arrived at the castle The sight of strangers surprised her but still more of strangers such as these There was a singularity in their dress and a certain fierceness in their air that fixed all her attention She withdrew from the casement while they passed but soon returned to observe them further Their figures seemed so well suited to the wildness of the surrounding objects that as they stood surveying the castle she sketched them for banditti amid the mountain view of her picture when she had finished which she was surprised to observe the spirit of her group But she had copied from nature Carlo when he had placed refreshment before these men in the apartment assigned to them returned as he was ordered to Montoni who was anxious to discover by what servant the keys of the castle had been delivered to Morano on the preceding night But this man though he was too faithful to his master quietly to see him injured would not betray a fellow servant even to justice he therefore pretended to be ignorant who it was that had conspired with Count Morano and related as before that he had only overheard some of the strangers describing the plot Montoni s suspicions naturally fell upon the porter whom he ordered now to attend Carlo hesitated and then with slow steps went to seek him Barnardine the porter denied the accusation with a countenance so steady and undaunted that Montoni could scarcely believe him guilty though he knew not how to think him innocent At length the man was dismissed from his presence and though the real offender escaped detection Montoni then went to his wife s apartment whither Emily followed soon after but finding them in high dispute was instantly leaving the room when her aunt called her back and desired her to stay You shall be a witness said she of my opposition Now sir repeat the command I have so often refused to obey Montoni turned with a stern countenance to Emily and bade her quit the apartment while his wife persisted in desiring that she would stay Emily was eager to escape from this scene of contention and anxious also to serve her aunt but she despaired of conciliating Montoni in whose eyes the rising tempest of his soul flashed terribly Leave the room said he in a voice of thunder Emily obeyed and walking down to the rampart which the strangers had now left continued to meditate on the unhappy marriage of her father s sister and on her own desolate situation occasioned by the ridiculous imprudence of her whom she had always wished to respect and love Madame Montoni s conduct had indeed rendered it impossible for Emily to do either but her gentle heart was touched by her distress and in the pity thus awakened she forgot the injurious treatment she had received from her As she sauntered on the rampart Annette appeared at the hall door looked cautiously round and then advanced to meet her Dear ma amselle I have been looking for you all over the castle said she If you will step this way I will shew you a picture A picture exclaimed Emily and shuddered Yes ma am a picture of the late lady of this place Old Carlo just now told me it was her and I thought you would be curious to see it As to my lady you know ma amselle one cannot talk about such things to her And so said Emily smilingly as you must talk of them to somebody Why yes ma amselle what can one do in such a place as this if one must not talk If I was in a dungeon if they would let me talk it would be some comfort nay I would talk if it was only to the walls But come ma amselle we lose time let me shew you to the picture Is it veiled said Emily pausing Dear ma amselle said Annette fixing her eyes on Emily s face what makes you look so pale are you ill No Annette I am well enough but I have no desire to see this picture return into the hall What ma am not to see the lady of this castle said the girl the lady who disappeared to strangely Well now I would have run to the furthest mountain we can see yonder to have got a sight of such a picture and to speak my mind that strange story is all that makes me care about this old castle though it makes me thrill all over as it were whenever I think of it Yes Annette you love the wonderful but do you know that unless you guard against this inclination it will lead you into all the misery of superstition Annette might have smiled in her turn at this sage observation of Emily who could tremble with ideal terrors as much as herself and listen almost as eagerly to the recital of a mysterious story Annette urged her request Are you sure it is a picture said Emily Have you seen it Is it veiled Holy Maria ma amselle yes no yes I am sure it is a picture I have seen it and it is not veiled The tone and look of surprise with which this was uttered recalled Emily s prudence who concealed her emotion under a smile and bade Annette lead her to the picture It was in an obscure chamber adjoining that part of the castle allotted to the servants Several other portraits hung on the walls covered like this with dust and cobweb That is it ma amselle said Annette in a low voice and pointing Emily advanced and surveyed the picture It represented a lady in the flower of youth and beauty her features were handsome and noble full of strong expression but had little of the captivating sweetness that Emily had looked for and still less of the pensive mildness she loved It was a countenance which spoke the language of passion rather than that of sentiment a haughty impatience of misfortune not the placid melancholy of a spirit injured yet resigned How many years have passed since this lady disappeared Annette said Emily Twenty years ma amselle or thereabout as they tell me I know it is a long while ago Emily continued to gaze upon the portrait I think resumed Annette the Signor would do well to hang it in a better place than this old chamber Now in my mind he ought to place the picture of a lady who gave him all these riches in the handsomest room in the castle But he may have good reasons for what he does and some people do say that he has lost his riches as well as his gratitude But hush ma am not a word added Annette laying her finger on her lips Emily was too much absorbed in thought to hear what she said Tis a handsome lady I am sure continued Annette the Signor need not be ashamed to put her in the great apartment where the veiled picture hangs Emily turned round But for that matter she would be as little seen there as here for the door is always locked I find Let us leave this chamber said Emily and let me caution you again Annette be guarded in your conversation and never tell that you know any thing of that picture Holy Mother exclaimed Annette it is no secret why all the servants have seen it already Emily started How is this said she Have seen it When how Dear ma amselle there is nothing surprising in that we had all a little more CURIOUSNESS than you had I thought you told me the door was kept locked said Emily If that was the case ma amselle replied Annette looking about her how could we get here Oh you mean THIS picture said Emily with returning calmness Well Annette here is nothing more to engage my attention we will go Emily as she passed to her own apartment saw Montoni go down to the hall and she turned into her aunt s dressing room whom she found weeping and alone grief and resentment struggling on her countenance Pride had hitherto restrained complaint Judging of Emily s disposition from her own and from a consciousness of what her treatment of her deserved she had believed that her griefs would be cause of triumph to her niece rather than of sympathy that she would despise not pity her But she knew not the tenderness and benevolence of Emily s heart that had always taught her to forget her own injuries in the misfortunes of her enemy The sufferings of others whoever they might be called forth her ready compassion which dissipated at once every obscuring cloud to goodness that passion or prejudice might have raised in her mind Madame Montoni s sufferings at length rose above her pride and when Emily had before entered the room she would have told them all had not her husband prevented her now that she was no longer restrained by his presence she poured forth all her complaints to her niece O Emily she exclaimed I am the most wretched of women I am indeed cruelly treated Who with my prospects of happiness could have foreseen such a wretched fate as this who could have thought when I married such a man as the Signor I should ever have to bewail my lot But there is no judging what is for the best there is no knowing what is for our good The most flattering prospects often change the best judgments may be deceived who could have foreseen when I married the Signor that I should ever repent my GENEROSITY Emily thought she might have foreseen it but this was not a thought of triumph She placed herself in a chair near her aunt took her hand and with one of those looks of soft compassion which might characterize the countenance of a guardian angel spoke to her in the tenderest accents But these did not sooth Madame Montoni whom impatience to talk made unwilling to listen She wanted to complain not to be consoled and it was by exclamations of complaint only that Emily learned the particular circumstances of her affliction Ungrateful man said Madame Montoni he has deceived me in every respect and now he has taken me from my country and friends to shut me up in this old castle and here he thinks he can compel me to do whatever he designs But he shall find himself mistaken he shall find that no threats can alter But who would have believed who would have supposed that a man of his family and apparent wealth had absolutely no fortune no scarcely a sequin of his own I did all for the best I thought he was a man of consequence of great property or I am sure I would never have married him ungrateful artful man She paused to take breath Dear Madam be composed said Emily the Signor may not be so rich as you had reason to expect but surely he cannot be very poor since this castle and the mansion at Venice are his May I ask what are the circumstances that particularly affect you What are the circumstances exclaimed Madame Montoni with resentment why is it not sufficient that he had long ago ruined his own fortune by play and that he has since lost what I brought him and that now he would compel me to sign away my settlement it was well I had the chief of my property settled on myself that he may lose this also or throw it away in wild schemes which nobody can understand but himself And and is not all this sufficient It is indeed said Emily but you must recollect dear madam that I knew nothing of all this Well and is it not sufficient rejoined her aunt that he is also absolutely ruined that he is sunk deeply in debt and that neither this castle or the mansion at Venice is his own if all his debts honourable and dishonourable were paid I am shocked by what you tell me madam said Emily And is it not enough interrupted Madame Montoni that he has treated me with neglect with cruelty because I refused to relinquish my settlements and instead of being frightened by his menaces resolutely defied him and upbraided him with his shameful conduct But I bore all meekly you know niece I never uttered a word of complaint till now no That such a disposition as mine should be so imposed upon That I whose only faults are too much kindness too much generosity should be chained for life to such a vile deceitful cruel monster Want of breath compelled Madame Montoni to stop If any thing could have made Emily smile in these moments it would have been this speech of her aunt delivered in a voice very little below a scream and with a vehemence of gesticulation and of countenance that turned the whole into burlesque Emily saw that her misfortunes did not admit of real consolation and contemning the commonplace terms of superficial comfort she was silent while Madame Montoni jealous of her own consequence mistook this for the silence of indifference or of contempt and reproached her with want of duty and feeling O I suspected what all this boasted sensibility would prove to be rejoined she I thought it would not teach you to feel either duty or affection for your relations who have treated you like their own daughter Pardon me madam said Emily mildly it is not natural to me to boast and if it was I am sure I would not boast of sensibility a quality perhaps more to be feared than desired Well well niece I will not dispute with you But as I said Montoni threatens me with violence if I any longer refuse to sign away my settlements and this was the subject of our contest when you came into the room before Now I am determined no power on earth shall make me do this Neither will I bear all this tamely He shall hear his true character from me I will tell him all he deserves in spite of his threats and cruel treatment Emily seized a pause of Madame Montoni s voice to speak Dear madam said she but will not this serve to irritate the Signor unnecessarily will it not provoke the harsh treatment you dread I do not care replied Madame Montoni it does not signify I will not submit to such usage You would have me give up my settlements too I suppose No madam I do not exactly mean that What is it you do mean then You spoke of reproaching the Signor said Emily with hesitation Why does he not deserve reproaches said her aunt Certainly he does but will it be prudent in you madam to make them Prudent exclaimed Madame Montoni Is this a time to talk of prudence when one is threatened with all sorts of violence It is to avoid that violence that prudence is necessary said Emily Of prudence continued Madame Montoni without attending to her of prudence towards a man who does not scruple to break all the common ties of humanity in his conduct to me And is it for me to consider prudence in my behaviour towards him I am not so mean It is for your own sake not for the Signor s madam said Emily modestly that you should consult prudence Your reproaches however just cannot punish him but they may provoke him to further violence against you What would you have me submit then to whatever he commands would you have me kneel down at his feet and thank him for his cruelties Would you have me give up my settlements How much you mistake me madam said Emily I am unequal to advise you on a point so important as the last but you will pardon me for saying that if you consult your own peace you will try to conciliate Signor Montoni rather than to irritate him by reproaches Conciliate indeed I tell you niece it is utterly impossible I disdain to attempt it Emily was shocked to observe the perverted understanding and obstinate temper of Madame Montoni but not less grieved for her sufferings she looked round for some alleviating circumstance to offer her Your situation is perhaps not so desperate dear madam said Emily as you may imagine The Signor may represent his affairs to be worse than they are for the purpose of pleading a stronger necessity for his possession of your settlement Besides so long as you keep this you may look forward to it as a resource at least that will afford you a competence should the Signor s future conduct compel you to sue for separation Madame Montoni impatiently interrupted her Unfeeling cruel girl said she and so you would persuade me that I have no reason to complain that the Signor is in very flourishing circumstances that my future prospects promise nothing but comfort and that my griefs are as fanciful and romantic as your own Is it the way to console me to endeavour to persuade me out of my senses and my feelings because you happen to have no feelings yourself I thought I was opening my heart to a person who could sympathize in my distress but I find that your people of sensibility can feel for nobody but themselves You may retire to your chamber Emily without replying immediately left the room with a mingled emotion of pity and contempt and hastened to her own where she yielded to the mournful reflections which a knowledge of her aunt s situation had occasioned The conversation of the Italian with Valancourt in France again occurred to her His hints respecting the broken fortunes of Montoni were now completely justified those also concerning his character appeared not less so though the particular circumstances connected with his fame to which the stranger had alluded yet remained to be explained Notwithstanding that her own observations and the words of Count Morano had convinced her that Montoni s situation was not what it formerly appeared to be the intelligence she had just received from her aunt on this point struck her with all the force of astonishment which was not weakened when she considered the present style of Montoni s living the number of servants he maintained and the new expences he was incurring by repairing and fortifying his castle Her anxiety for her aunt and for herself increased with reflection Several assertions of Morano which on the preceding night she had believed were prompted either by interest or by resentment now returned to her mind with the strength of truth She could not doubt that Montoni had formerly agreed to give her to the Count for a pecuniary reward his character and his distressed circumstances justified the belief these also seemed to confirm Morano s assertion that he now designed to dispose of her more advantageously for himself to a richer suitor Amidst the reproaches which Morano had thrown out against Montoni he had said he would not quit the castle HE DARED TO CALL HIS nor willingly leave ANOTHER murder on his conscience hints which might have no other origin than the passion of the moment but Emily was now inclined to account for them more seriously and she shuddered to think that she was in the hands of a man to whom it was even possible they could apply At length considering that reflection could neither release her from her melancholy situation or enable her to bear it with greater fortitude she tried to divert her anxiety and took down from her little library a volume of her favourite Ariosto but his wild imagery and rich invention could not long enchant her attention his spells did not reach her heart and over her sleeping fancy they played without awakening it She now put aside the book and took her lute for it was seldom that her sufferings refused to yield to the magic of sweet sounds when they did so she was oppressed by sorrow that came from excess of tenderness and regret and there were times when music had increased such sorrow to a degree that was scarcely endurable when if it had not suddenly ceased she might have lost her reason Such was the time when she mourned for her father and heard the midnight strains that floated by her window near the convent in Languedoc on the night that followed his death She continued to play till Annette brought dinner into her chamber at which Emily was surprised and enquired whose order she obeyed My lady s ma amselle replied Annette the Signor ordered her dinner to be carried to her own apartment and so she has sent you yours There have been sad doings between them worse than ever I think Emily not appearing to notice what she said sat down to the little table that was spread for her But Annette was not to be silenced thus easily While she waited she told of the arrival of the men whom Emily had observed on the ramparts and expressed much surprise at their strange appearance as well as at the manner in which they had been attended by Montoni s order Do they dine with the Signor then said Emily No ma amselle they dined long ago in an apartment at the north end of the castle but I know not when they are to go for the Signor told old Carlo to see them provided with every thing necessary They have been walking all about the castle and asking questions of the workmen on the ramparts I never saw such strange looking men in my life I am frightened whenever I see them Emily enquired if she had heard of Count Morano and whether he was likely to recover but Annette only knew that he was lodged in a cottage in the wood below and that every body said he must die Emily s countenance discovered her emotion Dear ma amselle said Annette to see how young ladies will disguise themselves when they are in love I thought you hated the Count or I am sure I would not have told you and I am sure you have cause enough to hate him I hope I hate nobody replied Emily trying to smile but certainly I do not love Count Morano I should be shocked to hear of any person dying by violent means Yes ma amselle but it is his own fault Emily looked displeased and Annette mistaking the cause of her displeasure immediately began to excuse the Count in her way To be sure it was very ungenteel behaviour said she to break into a lady s room and then when he found his discoursing was not agreeable to her to refuse to go and then when the gentleman of the castle comes to desire him to walk about his business to turn round and draw his sword and swear he ll run him through the body To be sure it was very ungenteel behaviour but then he was disguised in love and so did not know what he was about Enough of this said Emily who now smiled without an effort and Annette returned to a mention of the disagreement between Montoni and her lady It is nothing new said she we saw and heard enough of this at Venice though I never told you of it ma amselle Well Annette it was very prudent of you not to mention it then be as prudent now the subject is an unpleasant one Ah dear ma amselle to see now how considerate you can be about some folks who care so little about you I cannot bear to see you so deceived and I must tell you But it is all for your own good and not to spite my lady though to speak truth I have little reason to love her but You are not speaking thus of my aunt I hope Annette said Emily gravely Yes ma amselle but I am though and if you knew as much as I do you would not look so angry I have often and often heard the Signor and her talking over your marriage with the Count and she always advised him never to give up to your foolish whims as she was pleased to call them but to be resolute and compel you to be obedient whether you would or no And I am sure my heart has ached a thousand times and I have thought when she was so unhappy herself she might have felt a little for other people and I thank you for your pity Annette said Emily interrupting her but my aunt was unhappy then and that disturbed her temper perhaps or I think I am sure You may take away Annette I have done Dear ma amselle you have eat nothing at all Do try and take a little bit more Disturbed her temper truly why her temper is always disturbed I think And at Tholouse too I have heard my lady talking of you and Mons Valancourt to Madame Merveille and Madame Vaison often and often in a very ill natured way as I thought telling them what a deal of trouble she had to keep you in order and what a fatigue and distress it was to her and that she believed you would run away with Mons Valancourt if she was not to watch you closely and that you connived at his coming about the house at night and Good God exclaimed Emily blushing deeply it is surely impossible my aunt could thus have represented me Indeed ma am I say nothing more than the truth and not all of that But I thought myself she might have found something better to discourse about than the faults of her own niece even if you had been in fault ma amselle but I did not believe a word of what she said But my lady does not care what she says against any body for that matter However that may be Annette interrupted Emily recovering her composure it does not become you to speak of the faults of my aunt to me I know you have meant well but say no more I have quite dined Annette blushed looked down and then began slowly to clear the table Is this then the reward of my ingenuousness said Emily when she was alone the treatment I am to receive from a relation an aunt who ought to have been the guardian not the slanderer of my reputation who as a woman ought to have respected the delicacy of female honour and as a relation should have protected mine But to utter falsehoods on so nice a subject to repay the openness and I may say with honest pride the propriety of my conduct with slanders required a depravity of heart such as I could scarcely have believed existed such as I weep to find in a relation O what a contrast does her character present to that of my beloved father while envy and low cunning form the chief traits of hers his was distinguished by benevolence and philosophic wisdom But now let me only remember if possible that she is unfortunate Emily threw her veil over her and went down to walk upon the ramparts the only walk indeed which was open to her though she often wished that she might be permitted to ramble among the woods below and still more that she might sometimes explore the sublime scenes of the surrounding country But as Montoni would not suffer her to pass the gates of the castle she tried to be contented with the romantic views she beheld from the walls The peasants who had been employed on the fortifications had left their work and the ramparts were silent and solitary Their lonely appearance together with the gloom of a lowering sky assisted the musings of her mind and threw over it a kind of melancholy tranquillity such as she often loved to indulge She turned to observe a fine effect of the sun as his rays suddenly streaming from behind a heavy cloud lighted up the west towers of the castle while the rest of the edifice was in deep shade except that through a lofty gothic arch adjoining the tower which led to another terrace the beams darted in full splendour and shewed the three strangers she had observed in the morning Perceiving them she started and a momentary fear came over her as she looked up the long rampart and saw no other persons While she hesitated they approached The gate at the end of the terrace whither they were advancing she knew was always locked and she could not depart by the opposite extremity without meeting them but before she passed them she hastily drew a thin veil over her face which did indeed but ill conceal her beauty They looked earnestly at her and spoke to each other in bad Italian of which she caught only a few words but the fierceness of their countenances now that she was near enough to discriminate them struck her yet more than the wild singularity of their air and dress had formerly done It was the countenance and figure of him who walked between the other two that chiefly seized her attention which expressed a sullen haughtiness and a kind of dark watchful villany that gave a thrill of horror to her heart All this was so legibly written on his features as to be seen by a single glance for she passed the group swiftly and her timid eyes scarcely rested on them a moment Having reached the terrace she stopped and perceived the strangers standing in the shadow of one of the turrets gazing after her and seemingly by their action in earnest conversation She immediately left the rampart and retired to her apartment In the evening Montoni sat late carousing with his guests in the cedar chamber His recent triumph over Count Morano or perhaps some other circumstance contributed to elevate his spirits to an unusual height He filled the goblet often and gave a loose to merriment and talk The gaiety of Cavigni on the contrary was somewhat clouded by anxiety He kept a watchful eye upon Verezzi whom with the utmost difficulty he had hitherto restrained from exasperating Montoni further against Morano by a mention of his late taunting words One of the company exultingly recurred to the event of the preceding evening Verezzi s eyes sparkled The mention of Morano led to that of Emily of whom they were all profuse in the praise except Montoni who sat silent and then interrupted the subject When the servants had withdrawn Montoni and his friends entered into close conversation which was sometimes checked by the irascible temper of Verezzi but in which Montoni displayed his conscious superiority by that decisive look and manner which always accompanied the vigour of his thought and to which most of his companions submitted as to a power that they had no right to question though of each other s self importance they were jealously scrupulous Amidst this conversation one of them imprudently introduced again the name of Morano and Verezzi now more heated by wine disregarded the expressive looks of Cavigni and gave some dark hints of what had passed on the preceding night These however Montoni did not appear to understand for he continued silent in his chair without discovering any emotion while the choler of Verezzi increasing with the apparent insensibility of Montoni he at length told the suggestion of Morano that this castle did not lawfully belong to him and that he would not willingly leave another murder on his conscience Am I to be insulted at my own table and by my own friends said Montoni with a countenance pale in anger Why are the words of that madman repeated to me Verezzi who had expected to hear Montoni s indignation poured forth against Morano and answered by thanks to himself looked with astonishment at Cavigni who enjoyed his confusion Can you be weak enough to credit the assertions of a madman rejoined Montoni or what is the same thing a man possessed by the spirit of vengeance But he has succeeded too well you believe what he said Signor said Verezzi we believe only what we know How interrupted Montoni sternly produce your proof We believe only what we know repeated Verezzi and we know nothing of what Morano asserts Montoni seemed to recover himself I am hasty my friends said he with respect to my honour no man shall question it with impunity you did not mean to question it These foolish words are not worth your remembrance or my resentment Verezzi here is to your first exploit Success to your first exploit re echoed the whole company Noble Signor replied Verezzi glad to find he had escaped Montoni s resentment with my good will you shall build your ramparts of gold Pass the goblet cried Montoni We will drink to Signora saint Aubert said Cavigni By your leave we will first drink to the lady of the castle said Bertolini Montoni was silent To the lady of the castle said his guests He bowed his head It much surprises me Signor said Bertolini that you have so long neglected this castle it is a noble edifice It suits our purpose replied Montoni and IS a noble edifice You know not it seems by what mischance it came to me It was a lucky mischance be it what it may Signor replied Bertolini smiling I would that one so lucky had befallen me Montoni looked gravely at him If you will attend to what I say he resumed you shall hear the story The countenances of Bertolini and Verezzi expressed something more than curiosity Cavigni who seemed to feel none had probably heard the relation before It is now near twenty years said Montoni since this castle came into my possession I inherit it by the female line The lady my predecessor was only distantly related to me I am the last of her family She was beautiful and rich I wooed her but her heart was fixed upon another and she rejected me It is probable however that she was herself rejected of the person whoever he might be on whom she bestowed her favour for a deep and settled melancholy took possession of her and I have reason to believe she put a period to her own life I was not at the castle at the time but as there are some singular and mysterious circumstances attending that event I shall repeat them Repeat them said a voice Montoni was silent the guests looked at each other to know who spoke but they perceived that each was making the same enquiry Montoni at length recovered himself We are overheard said he we will finish this subject another time Pass the goblet The cavaliers looked round the wide chamber Here is no person but ourselves said Verezzi pray Signor proceed Did you hear any thing said Montoni We did said Bertolini It could be only fancy said Verezzi looking round again We see no person besides ourselves and the sound I thought I heard seemed within the room Pray Signor go on Montoni paused a moment and then proceeded in a lowered voice while the cavaliers drew nearer to attend Ye are to know Signors that the Lady Laurentini had for some months shewn symptoms of a dejected mind nay of a disturbed imagination Her mood was very unequal sometimes she was sunk in calm melancholy and at others as I have been told she betrayed all the symptoms of frantic madness It was one night in the month of October after she had recovered from one of those fits of excess and had sunk again into her usual melancholy that she retired alone to her chamber and forbade all interruption It was the chamber at the end of the corridor Signors where we had the affray last night From that hour she was seen no more How seen no more said Bertolini was not her body found in the chamber Were her remains never found cried the rest of the company all together Never replied Montoni What reasons were there to suppose she destroyed herself then said Bertolini Aye what reasons said Verezzi How happened it that her remains were never found Although she killed herself she could not bury herself Montoni looked indignantly at Verezzi who began to apologize Your pardon Signor said he I did not consider that the lady was your relative when I spoke of her so lightly Montoni accepted the apology But the Signor will oblige us with the reasons which urged him to believe that the lady committed suicide Those I will explain hereafter said Montoni at present let me relate a most extraordinary circumstance This conversation goes no further Signors Listen then to what I am going to say Listen said a voice They were all again silent and the countenance of Montoni changed This is no illusion of the fancy said Cavigni at length breaking the profound silence No said Bertolini I heard it myself now Yet here is no person in the room but ourselves This is very extraordinary said Montoni suddenly rising This is not to be borne here is some deception some trick I will know what it means All the company rose from their chairs in confusion It is very odd said Bertolini Here is really no stranger in the room If it is a trick Signor you will do well to punish the author of it severely A trick what else can it be said Cavigni affecting a laugh The servants were now summoned and the chamber was searched but no person was found The surprise and consternation of the company increased Montoni was discomposed We will leave this room said he and the subject of our conversation also it is too solemn His guests were equally ready to quit the apartment but the subject had roused their curiosity and they entreated Montoni to withdraw to another chamber and finish it no entreaties could however prevail with him Notwithstanding his efforts to appear at ease he was visibly and greatly disordered Why Signor you are not superstitious cried Verezzi jeeringly you who have so often laughed at the credulity of others I am not superstitious replied Montoni regarding him with stern displeasure though I know how to despise the common place sentences which are frequently uttered against superstition I will enquire further into this affair He then left the room and his guests separating for the night retired to their respective apartments CHAPTER VIII He wears the rose of youth upon his cheek SHAKESPEARE We now return to Valancourt who it may be remembered remained at Tholouse some time after the departure of Emily restless and miserable Each morrow that approached he designed should carry him from thence yet to morrow and to morrow came and still saw him lingering in the scene of his former happiness He could not immediately tear himself from the spot where he had been accustomed to converse with Emily or from the objects they had viewed together which appeared to him memorials of her affection as well as a kind of surety for its faithfulness and next to the pain of bidding her adieu was that of leaving the scenes which so powerfully awakened her image Sometimes he had bribed a servant who had been left in the care of Madame Montoni s chateau to permit him to visit the gardens and there he would wander for hours together rapt in a melancholy not unpleasing The terrace and the pavilion at the end of it where he had taken leave of Emily on the eve of her departure from Tholouse were his most favourite haunts There as he walked or leaned from the window of the building he would endeavour to recollect all she had said on that night to catch the tones of her voice as they faintly vibrated on his memory and to remember the exact expression of her countenance which sometimes came suddenly to his fancy like a vision that beautiful countenance which awakened as by instantaneous magic all the tenderness of his heart and seemed to tell with irresistible eloquence that he had lost her forever At these moments his hurried steps would have discovered to a spectator the despair of his heart The character of Montoni such as he had received from hints and such as his fears represented it would rise to his view together with all the dangers it seemed to threaten to Emily and to his love He blamed himself that he had not urged these more forcibly to her while it might have been in his power to detain her and that he had suffered an absurd and criminal delicacy as he termed it to conquer so soon the reasonable arguments he had opposed to this journey Any evil that might have attended their marriage seemed so inferior to those which now threatened their love or even to the sufferings that absence occasioned that he wondered how he could have ceased to urge his suit till he had convinced her of its propriety and he would certainly now have followed her to Italy if he could have been spared from his regiment for so long a journey His regiment indeed soon reminded him that he had other duties to attend than those of love A short time after his arrival at his brother s house he was summoned to join his brother officers and he accompanied a battalion to Paris where a scene of novelty and gaiety opened upon him such as till then he had only a faint idea of But gaiety disgusted and company fatigued his sick mind and he became an object of unceasing raillery to his companions from whom whenever he could steal an opportunity he escaped to think of Emily The scenes around him however and the company with whom he was obliged to mingle engaged his attention though they failed to amuse his fancy and thus gradually weakened the habit of yielding to lamentation till it appeared less a duty to his love to indulge it Among his brother officers were many who added to the ordinary character of a French soldier s gaiety some of those fascinating qualities which too frequently throw a veil over folly and sometimes even soften the features of vice into smiles To these men the reserved and thoughtful manners of Valancourt were a kind of tacit censure on their own for which they rallied him when present and plotted against him when absent they gloried in the thought of reducing him to their own level and considering it to be a spirited frolic determined to accomplish it Valancourt was a stranger to the gradual progress of scheme and intrigue against which he could not be on his guard He had not been accustomed to receive ridicule and he could ill endure its sting he resented it and this only drew upon him a louder laugh To escape from such scenes he fled into solitude and there the image of Emily met him and revived the pangs of love and despair He then sought to renew those tasteful studies which had been the delight of his early years but his mind had lost the tranquillity which is necessary for their enjoyment To forget himself and the grief and anxiety which the idea of her recalled he would quit his solitude and again mingle in the crowd glad of a temporary relief and rejoicing to snatch amusement for the moment Thus passed weeks after weeks time gradually softening his sorrow and habit strengthening his desire of amusement till the scenes around him seemed to awaken into a new character and Valancourt to have fallen among them from the clouds His figure and address made him a welcome visitor wherever he had been introduced and he soon frequented the most gay and fashionable circles of Paris Among these was the assembly of the Countess Lacleur a woman of eminent beauty and captivating manners She had passed the spring of youth but her wit prolonged the triumph of its reign and they mutually assisted the fame of each other for those who were charmed by her loveliness spoke with enthusiasm of her talents and others who admired her playful imagination declared that her personal graces were unrivalled But her imagination was merely playful and her wit if such it could be called was brilliant rather than just it dazzled and its fallacy escaped the detection of the moment for the accents in which she pronounced it and the smile that accompanied them were a spell upon the judgment of the auditors Her petits soupers were the most tasteful of any in Paris and were frequented by many of the second class of literati She was fond of music was herself a scientific performer and had frequently concerts at her house Valancourt who passionately loved music and who sometimes assisted at these concerts admired her execution but remembered with a sigh the eloquent simplicity of Emily s songs and the natural expression of her manner which waited not to be approved by the judgment but found their way at once to the heart Madame La Comtesse had often deep play at her house which she affected to restrain but secretly encouraged and it was well known among her friends that the splendour of her establishment was chiefly supplied from the profits of her tables But her petits soupers were the most charming imaginable Here were all the delicacies of the four quarters of the world all the wit and the lighter efforts of genius all the graces of conversation the smiles of beauty and the charm of music and Valancourt passed his pleasantest as well as most dangerous hours in these parties His brother who remained with his family in Gascony had contented himself with giving him letters of introduction to such of his relations residing at Paris as the latter was not already known to All these were persons of some distinction and as neither the person mind or manners of Valancourt the younger threatened to disgrace their alliance they received him with as much kindness as their nature hardened by uninterrupted prosperity would admit of but their attentions did not extend to acts of real friendship for they were too much occupied by their own pursuits to feel any interest in his and thus he was set down in the midst of Paris in the pride of youth with an open unsuspicious temper and ardent affections without one friend to warn him of the dangers to which he was exposed Emily who had she been present would have saved him from these evils by awakening his heart and engaging him in worthy pursuits now only increased his danger it was to lose the grief which the remembrance of her occasioned that he first sought amusement and for this end he pursued it till habit made it an object of abstract interest There was also a Marchioness Champfort a young widow at whose assemblies he passed much of his time She was handsome still more artful gay and fond of intrigue The society which she drew round her was less elegant and more vicious than that of the Countess Lacleur but as she had address enough to throw a veil though but a slight one over the worst part of her character she was still visited by many persons of what is called distinction Valancourt was introduced to her parties by two of his brother officers whose late ridicule he had now forgiven so far that he could sometimes join in the laugh which a mention of his former manners would renew The gaiety of the most splendid court in Europe the magnificence of the palaces entertainments and equipages that surrounded him all conspired to dazzle his imagination and re animate his spirits and the example and maxims of his military associates to delude his mind Emily s image indeed still lived there but it was no longer the friend the monitor that saved him from himself and to which he retired to weep the sweet yet melancholy tears of tenderness When he had recourse to it it assumed a countenance of mild reproach that wrung his soul and called forth tears of unmixed misery his only escape from which was to forget the object of it and he endeavoured therefore to think of Emily as seldom as he could Thus dangerously circumstanced was Valancourt at the time when Emily was suffering at Venice from the persecuting addresses of Count Morano and the unjust authority of Montoni at which period we leave him CHAPTER IX The image of a wicked heinous fault Lives in his eye that close aspect of his Does shew the mood of a much troubled breast KING JOHN Leaving the gay scenes of Paris we return to those of the gloomy Apennine where Emily s thoughts were still faithful to Valancourt Looking to him as to her only hope she recollected with jealous exactness every assurance and every proof she had witnessed of his affection read again and again the letters she had received from him weighed with intense anxiety the force of every word that spoke of his attachment and dried her tears as she trusted in his truth Montoni meanwhile had made strict enquiry concerning the strange circumstance of his alarm without obtaining information and was at length obliged to account for it by the reasonable supposition that it was a mischievous trick played off by one of his domestics His disagreements with Madame Montoni on the subject of her settlements were now more frequent than ever he even confined her entirely to her own apartment and did not scruple to threaten her with much greater severity should she persevere in a refusal Reason had she consulted it would now have perplexed her in the choice of a conduct to be adopted It would have pointed out the danger of irritating by further opposition a man such as Montoni had proved himself to be and to whose power she had so entirely committed herself and it would also have told her of what extreme importance to her future comfort it was to reserve for herself those possessions which would enable her to live independently of Montoni should she ever escape from his immediate controul But she was directed by a more decisive guide than reason the spirit of revenge which urged her to oppose violence to violence and obstinacy to obstinacy Wholly confined to the solitude of her apartment she was now reduced to solicit the society she had lately rejected for Emily was the only person except Annette with whom she was permitted to converse Generously anxious for her peace Emily therefore tried to persuade when she could not convince and sought by every gentle means to induce her to forbear that asperity of reply which so greatly irritated Montoni The pride of her aunt did sometimes soften to the soothing voice of Emily and there even were moments when she regarded her affectionate attentions with goodwill The scenes of terrible contention to which Emily was frequently compelled to be witness exhausted her spirits more than any circumstances that had occurred since her departure from Tholouse The gentleness and goodness of her parents together with the scenes of her early happiness often stole on her mind like the visions of a higher world while the characters and circumstances now passing beneath her eye excited both terror and surprise She could scarcely have imagined that passions so fierce and so various as those which Montoni exhibited could have been concentrated in one individual yet what more surprised her was that on great occasions he could bend these passions wild as they were to the cause of his interest and generally could disguise in his countenance their operation on his mind but she had seen him too often when he had thought it unnecessary to conceal his nature to be deceived on such occasions Her present life appeared like the dream of a distempered imagination or like one of those frightful fictions in which the wild genius of the poets sometimes delighted Reflection brought only regret and anticipation terror How often did she wish to steal the lark s wing and mount the swiftest gale that Languedoc and repose might once more be hers Of Count Morano s health she made frequent enquiry but Annette heard only vague reports of his danger and that his surgeon had said he would never leave the cottage alive while Emily could not but be shocked to think that she however innocently might be the means of his death and Annette who did not fail to observe her emotion interpreted it in her own way But a circumstance soon occurred which entirely withdrew Annette s attention from this subject and awakened the surprise and curiosity so natural to her Coming one day to Emily s apartment with a countenance full of importance What can all this mean ma amselle said she Would I was once safe in Languedoc again they should never catch me going on my travels any more I must think it a fine thing truly to come abroad and see foreign parts I little thought I was coming to be catched up in a old castle among such dreary mountains with the chance of being murdered or what is as good having my throat cut What can all this mean indeed Annette said Emily in astonishment Aye ma amselle you may look surprised but you won t believe it perhaps till they have murdered you too You would not believe about the ghost I told you of though I shewed you the very place where it used to appear You will believe nothing ma amselle Not till you speak more reasonably Annette for Heaven s sake explain your meaning You spoke of murder Aye ma amselle they are coming to murder us all perhaps but what signifies explaining you will not believe Emily again desired her to relate what she had seen or heard O I have seen enough ma am and heard too much as Ludovico can prove Poor soul they will murder him too I little thought when he sung those sweet verses under my lattice at Venice Emily looked impatient and displeased Well ma amselle as I was saying these preparations about the castle and these strange looking people that are calling here every day and the Signor s cruel usage of my lady and his odd goings on all these as I told Ludovico can bode no good And he bid me hold my tongue So says I the Signor s strangely altered Ludovico in this gloomy castle to what he was in France there all so gay Nobody so gallant to my lady then and he could smile too upon a poor servant sometimes and jeer her too good naturedly enough I remember once when he said to me as I was going out of my lady s dressing room Annette says he Never mind what the Signor said interrupted Emily but tell me at once the circumstance which has thus alarmed you Aye ma amselle rejoined Annette that is just what Ludovico said says he Never mind what the Signor says to you So I told him what I thought about the Signor He is so strangely altered said I for now he is so haughty and so commanding and so sharp with my lady and if he meets one he ll scarcely look at one unless it be to frown So much the better says Ludovico so much the better And to tell you the truth ma amselle I thought this was a very ill natured speech of Ludovico but I went on And then says I he is always knitting his brows and if one speaks to him he does not hear and then he sits up counselling so of a night with the other Signors there they are till long past midnight discoursing together Aye but says Ludovico you don t know what they are counselling about No said I but I can guess it is about my young lady Upon that Ludovico burst out a laughing quite loud so he put me in a huff for I did not like that either I or you ma amselle should be laughed at and I turned away quick but he stopped me Don t be affronted Annette said he but I cannot help laughing and with that he laughed again What says he do you think the Signors sit up night after night only to counsel about thy young lady No no there is something more in the wind than that And these repairs about the castle and these preparations about the ramparts they are not making about young ladies Why surely said I the Signor my master is not going to make war Make war said Ludovico what upon the mountains and the woods for here is no living soul to make war upon that I see What are these preparations for then said I why surely nobody is coming to take away my master s castle Then there are so many ill looking fellows coming to the castle every day says Ludovico without answering my question and the Signor sees them all and talks with them all and they all stay in the neighbourhood By holy saint Marco some of them are the most cut throat looking dogs I ever set my eyes upon I asked Ludovico again if he thought they were coming to take away my master s castle and he said No he did not think they were but he did not know for certain Then yesterday said he but you must not tell this ma amselle yesterday a party of these men came and left all their horses in the castle stables where it seems they are to stay for the Signor ordered them all to be entertained with the best provender in the manger but the men are most of them in the neighbouring cottages So ma amselle I came to tell you all this for I never heard any thing so strange in my life But what can these ill looking men be come about if it is not to murder us And the Signor knows this or why should he be so civil to them And why should he fortify the castle and counsel so much with the other Signors and be so thoughtful Is this all you have to tell Annette said Emily Have you heard nothing else that alarms you Nothing else ma amselle said Annette why is not this enough Quite enough for my patience Annette but not quite enough to convince me we are all to be murdered though I acknowledge here is sufficient food for curiosity She forbore to speak her apprehensions because she would not encourage Annette s wild terrors but the present circumstances of the castle both surprised and alarmed her Annette having told her tale left the chamber on the wing for new wonders In the evening Emily had passed some melancholy hours with Madame Montoni and was retiring to rest when she was alarmed by a strange and loud knocking at her chamber door and then a heavy weight fell against it that almost burst it open She called to know who was there and receiving no answer repeated the call but a chilling silence followed It occurred to her for at this moment she could not reason on the probability of circumstances that some one of the strangers lately arrived at the castle had discovered her apartment and was come with such intent as their looks rendered too possible to rob perhaps to murder her The moment she admitted this possibility terror supplied the place of conviction and a kind of instinctive remembrance of her remote situation from the family heightened it to a degree that almost overcame her senses She looked at the door which led to the staircase expecting to see it open and listening in fearful silence for a return of the noise till she began to think it had proceeded from this door and a wish of escaping through the opposite one rushed upon her mind She went to the gallery door and then fearing to open it lest some person might be silently lurking for her without she stopped but with her eyes fixed in expectation upon the opposite door of the stair case As thus she stood she heard a faint breathing near her and became convinced that some person was on the other side of the door which was already locked She sought for other fastening but there was none While she yet listened the breathing was distinctly heard and her terror was not soothed when looking round her wide and lonely chamber she again considered her remote situation As she stood hesitating whether to call for assistance the continuance of the stillness surprised her and her spirits would have revived had she not continued to hear the faint breathing that convinced her the person whoever it was had not quitted the door At length worn out with anxiety she determined to call loudly for assistance from her casement and was advancing to it when whether the terror of her mind gave her ideal sounds or that real ones did come she thought footsteps were ascending the private stair case and expecting to see its door unclose she forgot all other cause of alarm and retreated towards the corridor Here she endeavoured to make her escape but on opening the door was very near falling over a person who lay on the floor without She screamed and would have passed but her trembling frame refused to support her and the moment in which she leaned against the wall of the gallery allowed her leisure to observe the figure before her and to recognise the features of Annette Fear instantly yielded to surprise She spoke in vain to the poor girl who remained senseless on the floor and then losing all consciousness of her own weakness hurried to her assistance When Annette recovered she was helped by Emily into the chamber but was still unable to speak and looked round her as if her eyes followed some person in the room Emily tried to sooth her disturbed spirits and forbore at present to ask her any questions but the faculty of speech was never long with held from Annette and she explained in broken sentences and in her tedious way the occasion of her disorder She affirmed and with a solemnity of conviction that almost staggered the incredulity of Emily that she had seen an apparition as she was passing to her bedroom through the corridor I had heard strange stories of that chamber before said Annette but as it was so near yours ma amselle I would not tell them to you because they would frighten you The servants had told me often and often that it was haunted and that was the reason why it was shut up nay for that matter why the whole string of these rooms here are shut up I quaked whenever I went by and I must say I did sometimes think I heard odd noises within it But as I said as I was passing along the corridor and not thinking a word about the matter or even of the strange voice that the Signors heard the other night all of a sudden comes a great light and looking behind me there was a tall figure I saw it as plainly ma amselle as I see you at this moment a tall figure gliding along Oh I cannot describe how into the room that is always shut up and nobody has the key of it but the Signor and the door shut directly Then it doubtless was the Signor said Emily O no ma amselle it could not be him for I left him busy a quarrelling in my lady s dressing room You bring me strange tales Annette said Emily it was but this morning that you would have terrified me with the apprehension of murder and now you would persuade me you have seen a ghost These wonderful stories come too quickly Nay ma amselle I will say no more only if I had not been frightened I should not have fainted dead away so I ran as fast as I could to get to your door but what was worst of all I could not call out then I thought something must be strangely the matter with me and directly I dropt down Was it the chamber where the black veil hangs said Emily O no ma amselle it was one nearer to this What shall I do to get to my room I would not go out into the corridor again for the whole world Emily whose spirits had been severely shocked and who therefore did not like the thought of passing the night alone told her she might sleep where she was O no ma amselle replied Annette I would not sleep in the room now for a thousand sequins Wearied and disappointed Emily first ridiculed though she shared her fears and then tried to sooth them but neither attempt succeeded and the girl persisted in believing and affirming that what she had seen was nothing human It was not till some time after Emily had recovered her composure that she recollected the steps she had heard on the stair case a remembrance however which made her insist that Annette should pass the night with her and with much difficulty she at length prevailed assisted by that part of the girl s fear which concerned the corridor Early on the following morning as Emily crossed the hall to the ramparts she heard a noisy bustle in the court yard and the clatter of horses hoofs Such unusual sounds excited her curiosity and instead of going to the ramparts she went to an upper casement from whence she saw in the court below a large party of horsemen dressed in a singular but uniform habit and completely though variously armed They wore a kind of short jacket composed of black and scarlet and several of them had a cloak of plain black which covering the person entirely hung down to the stirrups As one of these cloaks glanced aside she saw beneath daggers apparently of different sizes tucked into the horseman s belt She further observed that these were carried in the same manner by many of the horsemen without cloaks most of whom bore also pikes or javelins On their heads were the small Italian caps some of which were distinguished by black feathers Whether these caps gave a fierce air to the countenance or that the countenances they surmounted had naturally such an appearance Emily thought she had never till then seen an assemblage of faces so savage and terrific While she gazed she almost fancied herself surrounded by banditti and a vague thought glanced athwart her fancy that Montoni was the captain of the group before her and that this castle was to be the place of rendezvous The strange and horrible supposition was but momentary though her reason could supply none more probable and though she discovered among the band the strangers she had formerly noticed with so much alarm who were now distinguished by the black plume While she continued gazing Cavigni Verezzi and Bertolini came forth from the hall habited like the rest except that they wore hats with a mixed plume of black and scarlet and that their arms differed from those of the rest of the party As they mounted their horses Emily was struck with the exulting joy expressed on the visage of Verezzi while Cavigni was gay yet with a shade of thought on his countenance and as he managed his horse with dexterity his graceful and commanding figure which exhibited the majesty of a hero had never appeared to more advantage Emily as she observed him thought he somewhat resembled Valancourt in the spirit and dignity of his person but she looked in vain for the noble benevolent countenance the soul s intelligence which overspread the features of the latter As she was hoping she scarcely knew why that Montoni would accompany the party he appeared at the hall door but un accoutred Having carefully observed the horsemen conversed awhile with the cavaliers and bidden them farewel the band wheeled round the court and led by Verezzi issued forth under the portcullis Montoni following to the portal and gazing after them for some time Emily then retired from the casement and now certain of being unmolested went to walk on the ramparts from whence she soon after saw the party winding among the mountains to the west appearing and disappearing between the woods till distance confused their figures consolidated their numbers and only a dingy mass appeared moving along the heights Emily observed that no workmen were on the ramparts and that the repairs of the fortifications seemed to be completed While she sauntered thoughtfully on she heard distant footsteps and raising her eyes saw several men lurking under the castle walls who were evidently not workmen but looked as if they would have accorded well with the party which was gone Wondering where Annette had hid herself so long who might have explained some of the late circumstances and then considering that Madame Montoni was probably risen she went to her dressing room where she mentioned what had occurred but Madame Montoni either would not or could not give any explanation of the event The Signor s reserve to his wife on this subject was probably nothing more than usual yet to Emily it gave an air of mystery to the whole affair that seemed to hint there was danger if not villany in his schemes Annette presently came and as usual was full of alarm to her lady s eager enquiries of what she had heard among the servants she replied Ah madam nobody knows what it is all about but old Carlo he knows well enough I dare say but he is as close as his master Some say the Signor is going out to frighten the enemy as they call it but where is the enemy Then others say he is going to take away some body s castle but I am sure he has room enough in his own without taking other people s and I am sure I should like it a great deal better if there were more people to fill it Ah you will soon have your wish I fear replied Madame Montoni No madam but such ill looking fellows are not worth having I mean such gallant smart merry fellows as Ludovico who is always telling droll stories to make one laugh It was but yesterday he told me such a HUMOURSOME tale I can t help laughing at it now Says he Well we can dispense with the story said her lady Ah continued Annette he sees a great way further than other people Now he sees into all the Signor s meaning without knowing a word about the matter How is that said Madame Montoni Why he says but he made me promise not to tell and I would not disoblige him for the world What is it he made you promise not to tell said her lady sternly I insist upon knowing immediately what is it he made you promise O madam cried Annette I would not tell for the universe I insist upon your telling this instant said Madame Montoni O dear madam I would not tell for a hundred sequins You would not have me forswear myself madam exclaimed Annette I will not wait another moment said Madame Montoni Annette was silent The Signor shall be informed of this directly rejoined her mistress he will make you discover all It is Ludovico who has discovered said Annette but for mercy s sake madam don t tell the Signor and you shall know all directly Madame Montoni said that she would not Well then madam Ludovico says that the Signor my master is is that is he only thinks so and any body you know madam is free to think that the Signor my master is is Is what said her lady impatiently That the Signor my master is going to be a great robber that is he is going to rob on his own account to be but I am sure I don t understand what he means to be a captain of robbers Art thou in thy senses Annette said Madame Montoni or is this a trick to deceive me Tell me this instant what Ludovico DID say to thee no equivocation this instant Nay madam cried Annette if this is all I am to get for having told the secret Her mistress thus continued to insist and Annette to protest till Montoni himself appeared who bade the latter leave the room and she withdrew trembling for the fate of her story Emily also was retiring but her aunt desired she would stay and Montoni had so often made her a witness of their contention that he no longer had scruples on that account I insist upon knowing this instant Signor what all this means said his wife what are all these armed men whom they tell me of gone out about Montoni answered her only with a look of scorn and Emily whispered something to her It does not signify said her aunt I will know and I will know too what the castle has been fortified for Come come said Montoni other business brought me here I must be trifled with no longer I have immediate occasion for what I demand those estates must be given up without further contention or I may find a way They never shall be given up interrupted Madame Montoni they never shall enable you to carry on your wild schemes but what are these I will know Do you expect the castle to be attacked Do you expect enemies Am I to be shut up here to be killed in a siege Sign the writings said Montoni and you shall know more What enemy can be coming continued his wife Have you entered into the service of the state Am I to be blocked up here to die That may possibly happen said Montoni unless you yield to my demand for come what may you shall not quit the castle till then Madame Montoni burst into loud lamentation which she as suddenly checked considering that her husband s assertions might be only artifices employed to extort her consent She hinted this suspicion and in the next moment told him also that his designs were not so honourable as to serve the state and that she believed he had only commenced a captain of banditti to join the enemies of Venice in plundering and laying waste the surrounding country Montoni looked at her for a moment with a steady and stern countenance while Emily trembled and his wife for once thought she had said too much You shall be removed this night said he to the east turret there perhaps you may understand the danger of offending a man who has an unlimited power over you Emily now fell at his feet and with tears of terror supplicated for her aunt who sat trembling with fear and indignation now ready to pour forth execrations and now to join the intercessions of Emily Montoni however soon interrupted these entreaties with an horrible oath and as he burst from Emily leaving his cloak in her hand she fell to the floor with a force that occasioned her a severe blow on the forehead But he quitted the room without attempting to raise her whose attention was called from herself by a deep groan from Madame Montoni who continued otherwise unmoved in her chair and had not fainted Emily hastening to her assistance saw her eyes rolling and her features convulsed Having spoken to her without receiving an answer she brought water and supported her head while she held it to her lips but the increasing convulsions soon compelled Emily to call for assistance On her way through the hall in search of Annette she met Montoni whom she told what had happened and conjured to return and comfort her aunt but he turned silently away with a look of indifference and went out upon the ramparts At length she found old Carlo and Annette and they hastened to the dressing room where Madame Montoni had fallen on the floor and was lying in strong convulsions Having lifted her into the adjoining room and laid her on the bed the force of her disorder still made all their strength necessary to hold her while Annette trembled and sobbed and old Carlo looked silently and piteously on as his feeble hands grasped those of his mistress till turning his eyes upon Emily he exclaimed Good God Signora what is the matter Emily looked calmly at him and saw his enquiring eyes fixed on her and Annette looking up screamed loudly for Emily s face was stained with blood which continued to fall slowly from her forehead but her attention had been so entirely occupied by the scene before her that she had felt no pain from the wound She now held an handkerchief to her face and notwithstanding her faintness continued to watch Madame Montoni the violence of whose convulsions was abating till at length they ceased and left her in a kind of stupor My aunt must remain quiet said Emily Go good Carlo if we should want your assistance I will send for you In the mean time if you have an opportunity speak kindly of your mistress to your master Alas said Carlo I have seen too much I have little influence with the Signor But do dear young lady take some care of yourself that is an ugly wound and you look sadly Thank you my friend for your consideration said Emily smiling kindly the wound is trifling it came by a fall Carlo shook his head and left the room and Emily with Annette continued to watch by her aunt Did my lady tell the Signor what Ludovico said ma amselle asked Annette in a whisper but Emily quieted her fears on the subject I thought what this quarrelling would come to continued Annette I suppose the Signor has been beating my lady No no Annette you are totally mistaken nothing extra ordinary has happened Why extraordinary things happen here so often ma amselle that there is nothing in them Here is another legion of those ill looking fellows come to the castle this morning Hush Annette you will disturb my aunt we will talk of that by and bye They continued watching silently till Madame Montoni uttered a low sigh when Emily took her hand and spoke soothingly to her but the former gazed with unconscious eyes and it was long before she knew her niece Her first words then enquired for Montoni to which Emily replied by an entreaty that she would compose her spirits and consent to be kept quiet adding that if she wished any message to be conveyed to him she would herself deliver it No said her aunt faintly no I have nothing new to tell him Does he persist in saying I shall be removed from my chamber Emily replied that he had not spoken on the subject since Madame Montoni heard him and then she tried to divert her attention to some other topic but her aunt seemed to be inattentive to what she said and lost in secret thoughts Emily having brought her some refreshment now left her to the care of Annette and went in search of Montoni whom she found on a remote part of the rampart conversing among a group of the men described by Annette They stood round him with fierce yet subjugated looks while he speaking earnestly and pointing to the walls did not perceive Emily who remained at some distance waiting till he should be at leisure and observing involuntarily the appearance of one man more savage than his fellows who stood resting on his pike and looking over the shoulders of a comrade at Montoni to whom he listened with uncommon earnestness This man was apparently of low condition yet his looks appeared not to acknowledge the superiority of Montoni as did those of his companions and sometimes they even assumed an air of authority which the decisive manner of the Signor could not repress Some few words of Montoni then passed in the wind and as the men were separating she heard him say This evening then begin the watch at sun set At sun set Signor replied one or two of them and walked away while Emily approached Montoni who appeared desirous of avoiding her but though she observed this she had courage to proceed She endeavoured to intercede once more for her aunt represented to him her sufferings and urged the danger of exposing her to a cold apartment in her present state She suffers by her own folly said Montoni and is not to be pitied she knows how she may avoid these sufferings in future if she is removed to the turret it will be her own fault Let her be obedient and sign the writings you heard of and I will think no more of it When Emily ventured still to plead he sternly silenced and rebuked her for interfering in his domestic affairs but at length dismissed her with this concession That he would not remove Madame Montoni on the ensuing night but allow her till the next to consider whether she would resign her settlements or be imprisoned in the east turret of the castle where she shall find he added a punishment she may not expect Emily then hastened to inform her aunt of this short respite and of the alternative that awaited her to which the latter made no reply but appeared thoughtful while Emily in consideration of her extreme languor wished to sooth her mind by leading it to less interesting topics and though these efforts were unsuccessful and Madame Montoni became peevish her resolution on the contended point seemed somewhat to relax and Emily recommended as her only means of safety that she should submit to Montoni s demand You know not what you advise said her aunt Do you understand that these estates will descend to you at my death if I persist in a refusal I was ignorant of that circumstance madam replied Emily but the knowledge of it cannot with hold me from advising you to adopt the conduct which not only your peace but I fear your safety requires and I entreat that you will not suffer a consideration comparatively so trifling to make you hesitate a moment in resigning them Are you sincere niece Is it possible you can doubt it madam Her aunt appeared to be affected You are not unworthy of these estates niece said she I would wish to keep them for your sake you shew a virtue I did not expect How have I deserved this reproof madam said Emily sorrowfully Reproof replied Madame Montoni I meant to praise your virtue Alas here is no exertion of virtue rejoined Emily for here is no temptation to be overcome Yet Monsieur Valancourt said her aunt O madam interrupted Emily anticipating what she would have said do not let me glance on that subject do not let my mind be stained with a wish so shockingly self interested She immediately changed the topic and continued with Madame Montoni till she withdrew to her apartment for the night At that hour the castle was perfectly still and every inhabitant of it except herself seemed to have retired to rest As she passed along the wide and lonely galleries dusky and silent she felt forlorn and apprehensive of she scarcely knew what but when entering the corridor she recollected the incident of the preceding night a dread seized her lest a subject of alarm similar to that which had befallen Annette should occur to her and which whether real or ideal would she felt have an almost equal effect upon her weakened spirits The chamber to which Annette had alluded she did not exactly know but understood it to be one of those she must pass in the way to her own and sending a fearful look forward into the gloom she stepped lightly and cautiously along till coming to a door from whence issued a low sound she hesitated and paused and during the delay of that moment her fears so much increased that she had no power to move from the spot Believing that she heard a human voice within she was somewhat revived but in the next moment the door was opened and a person whom she conceived to be Montoni appeared who instantly started back and closed it though not before she had seen by the light that burned in the chamber another person sitting in a melancholy attitude by the fire Her terror vanished but her astonishment only began which was now roused by the mysterious secrecy of Montoni s manner and by the discovery of a person whom he thus visited at midnight in an apartment which had long been shut up and of which such extraordinary reports were circulated While she thus continued hesitating strongly prompted to watch Montoni s motions yet fearing to irritate him by appearing to notice them the door was again opened cautiously and as instantly closed as before She then stepped softly to her chamber which was the next but one to this but having put down her lamp returned to an obscure corner of the corridor to observe the proceedings of this half seen person and to ascertain whether it was indeed Montoni Having waited in silent expectation for a few minutes with her eyes fixed on the door it was again opened and the same person appeared whom she now knew to be Montoni He looked cautiously round without perceiving her then stepping forward closed the door and left the corridor Soon after Emily heard the door fastened on the inside and she withdrew to her chamber wondering at what she had witnessed It was now twelve o clock As she closed her casement she heard footsteps on the terrace below and saw imperfectly through the gloom several persons advancing who passed under the casement She then heard the clink of arms and in the next moment the watch word when recollecting the command she had overheard from Montoni and the hour of the night she understood that these men were for the first time relieving guard in the castle Having listened till all was again still she retired to sleep CHAPTER X And shall no lay of death With pleasing murmur sooth Her parted soul Shall no tear wet her grave SAYERS On the following morning Emily went early to the apartment of Madame Montoni who had slept well and was much recovered Her spirits had also returned with her health and her resolution to oppose Montoni s demands revived though it yet struggled with her fears which Emily who trembled for the consequence of further opposition endeavoured to confirm Her aunt as has been already shewn had a disposition which delighted in contradiction and which taught her when unpleasant circumstances were offered to her understanding not to enquire into their truth but to seek for arguments by which she might make them appear false Long habit had so entirely confirmed this natural propensity that she was not conscious of possessing it Emily s remonstrances and representations therefore roused her pride instead of alarming or convincing her judgment and she still relied upon the discovery of some means by which she might yet avoid submitting to the demand of her husband Considering that if she could once escape from his castle she might defy his power and obtaining a decisive separation live in comfort on the estates that yet remained for her she mentioned this to her niece who accorded with her in the wish but differed from her as to the probability of its completion She represented the impossibility of passing the gates secured and guarded as they were and the extreme danger of committing her design to the discretion of a servant who might either purposely betray or accidentally disclose it Montoni s vengeance would also disdain restraint if her intention was detected and though Emily wished as fervently as she could do to regain her freedom and return to France she consulted only Madame Montoni s safety and persevered in advising her to relinquish her settlement without braving further outrage The struggle of contrary emotions however continued to rage in her aunt s bosom and she still brooded over the chance of effecting an escape While she thus sat Montoni entered the room and without noticing his wife s indisposition said that he came to remind her of the impolicy of trifling with him and that he gave her only till the evening to determine whether she would consent to his demand or compel him by a refusal to remove her to the east turret He added that a party of cavaliers would dine with him that day and that he expected that she would sit at the head of the table where Emily also must be present Madame Montoni was now on the point of uttering an absolute refusal but suddenly considering that her liberty during this entertainment though circumscribed might favour her further plans she acquiesced with seeming reluctance and Montoni soon after left the apartment His command struck Emily with surprise and apprehension who shrank from the thought of being exposed to the gaze of strangers such as her fancy represented these to be and the words of Count Morano now again recollected did not sooth her fears When she withdrew to prepare for dinner she dressed herself with even more simplicity than usual that she might escape observation a policy which did not avail her for as she re passed to her aunt s apartment she was met by Montoni who censured what he called her prudish appearance and insisted that she should wear the most splendid dress she had even that which had been prepared for her intended nuptials with Count Morano and which it now appeared her aunt had carefully brought with her from Venice This was made not in the Venetian but in the Neapolitan fashion so as to set off the shape and figure to the utmost advantage In it her beautiful chestnut tresses were negligently bound up in pearls and suffered to fall back again on her neck The simplicity of a better taste than Madame Montoni s was conspicuous in this dress splendid as it was and Emily s unaffected beauty never had appeared more captivatingly She had now only to hope that Montoni s order was prompted not by any extraordinary design but by an ostentation of displaying his family richly attired to the eyes of strangers yet nothing less than his absolute command could have prevailed with her to wear a dress that had been designed for such an offensive purpose much less to have worn it on this occasion As she descended to dinner the emotion of her mind threw a faint blush over her countenance and heightened its interesting expression for timidity had made her linger in her apartment till the utmost moment and when she entered the hall in which a kind of state dinner was spread Montoni and his guests were already seated at the table She was then going to place herself by her aunt but Montoni waved his hand and two of the cavaliers rose and seated her between them The eldest of these was a tall man with strong Italian features an aquiline nose and dark penetrating eyes that flashed with fire when his mind was agitated and even in its state of rest retained somewhat of the wildness of the passions His visage was long and narrow and his complexion of a sickly yellow The other who appeared to be about forty had features of a different cast yet Italian and his look was slow subtle and penetrating his eyes of a dark grey were small and hollow his complexion was a sun burnt brown and the contour of his face though inclined to oval was irregular and ill formed Eight other guests sat round the table who were all dressed in an uniform and had all an expression more or less of wild fierceness of subtle design or of licentious passions As Emily timidly surveyed them she remembered the scene of the preceding morning and again almost fancied herself surrounded by banditti then looking back to the tranquillity of her early life she felt scarcely less astonishment than grief at her present situation The scene in which they sat assisted the illusion it was an antient hall gloomy from the style of its architecture from its great extent and because almost the only light it received was from one large gothic window and from a pair of folding doors which being open admitted likewise a view of the west rampart with the wild mountains of the Apennine beyond The middle compartment of this hall rose into a vaulted roof enriched with fretwork and supported on three sides by pillars of marble beyond these long colonnades retired in gloomy grandeur till their extent was lost in twilight The lightest footsteps of the servants as they advanced through these were returned in whispering echoes and their figures seen at a distance imperfectly through the dusk frequently awakened Emily s imagination She looked alternately at Montoni at his guests and on the surrounding scene and then remembering her dear native province her pleasant home and the simplicity and goodness of the friends whom she had lost grief and surprise again occupied her mind When her thoughts could return from these considerations she fancied she observed an air of authority towards his guests such as she had never before seen him assume though he had always been distinguished by an haughty carriage there was something also in the manners of the strangers that seemed perfectly though not servilely to acknowledge his superiority During dinner the conversation was chiefly on war and politics They talked with energy of the state of Venice its dangers the character of the reigning Doge and of the chief senators and then spoke of the state of Rome When the repast was over they rose and each filling his goblet with wine from the gilded ewer that stood beside him drank Success to our exploits Montoni was lifting his goblet to his lips to drink this toast when suddenly the wine hissed rose to the brim and as he held the glass from him it burst into a thousand pieces To him who constantly used that sort of Venice glass which had the quality of breaking upon receiving poisoned liquor a suspicion that some of his guests had endeavoured to betray him instantly occurred and he ordered all the gates to be closed drew his sword and looking round on them who stood in silent amazement exclaimed Here is a traitor among us let those that are innocent assist in discovering the guilty Indignation flashed from the eyes of the cavaliers who all drew their swords and Madame Montoni terrified at what might ensue was hastening from the hall when her husband commanded her to stay but his further words could not now be distinguished for the voice of every person rose together His order that all the servants should appear was at length obeyed and they declared their ignorance of any deceit a protestation which could not be believed for it was evident that as Montoni s liquor and his only had been poisoned a deliberate design had been formed against his life which could not have been carried so far towards its accomplishment without the connivance of the servant who had the care of the wine ewers This man with another whose face betrayed either the consciousness of guilt or the fear of punishment Montoni ordered to be chained instantly and confined in a strong room which had formerly been used as a prison Thither likewise he would have sent all his guests had he not foreseen the consequence of so bold and unjustifiable a proceeding As to those therefore he contented himself with swearing that no man should pass the gates till this extraordinary affair had been investigated and then sternly bade his wife retire to her apartment whither he suffered Emily to attend her In about half an hour he followed to the dressing room and Emily observed with horror his dark countenance and quivering lip and heard him denounce vengeance on her aunt It will avail you nothing said he to his wife to deny the fact I have proof of your guilt Your only chance of mercy rests on a full confession there is nothing to hope from sullenness or falsehood your accomplice has confessed all Emily s fainting spirits were roused by astonishment as she heard her aunt accused of a crime so atrocious and she could not for a moment admit the possibility of her guilt Meanwhile Madame Montoni s agitation did not permit her to reply alternately her complexion varied from livid paleness to a crimson flush and she trembled but whether with fear or with indignation it were difficult to decide Spare your words said Montoni seeing her about to speak your countenance makes full confession of your crime You shall be instantly removed to the east turret This accusation said Madame Montoni speaking with difficulty is used only as an excuse for your cruelty I disdain to reply to it You do not believe me guilty Signor said Emily solemnly this dreadful charge I would answer with my life is false Nay Signor she added observing the severity of his countenance this is no moment for restraint on my part I do not scruple to tell you that you are deceived most wickedly deceived by the suggestion of some person who aims at the ruin of my aunt it is impossible that you could yourself have imagined a crime so hideous Montoni his lips trembling more than before replied only If you value your own safety addressing Emily you will be silent I shall know how to interpret your remonstrances should you persevere in them Emily raised her eyes calmly to heaven Here is indeed then nothing to hope said she Peace cried Montoni or you shall find there is something to fear He turned to his wife who had now recovered her spirits and who vehemently and wildly remonstrated upon this mysterious suspicion but Montoni s rage heightened with her indignation and Emily dreading the event of it threw herself between them and clasped his knees in silence looking up in his face with an expression that might have softened the heart of a fiend Whether his was hardened by a conviction of Madame Montoni s guilt or that a bare suspicion of it made him eager to exercise vengeance he was totally and alike insensible to the distress of his wife and to the pleading looks of Emily whom he made no attempt to raise but was vehemently menacing both when he was called out of the room by some person at the door As he shut the door Emily heard him turn the lock and take out the key so that Madame Montoni and herself were now prisoners and she saw that his designs became more and more terrible Her endeavours to explain his motives for this circumstance were almost as ineffectual as those to sooth the distress of her aunt whose innocence she could not doubt but she at length accounted for Montoni s readiness to suspect his wife by his own consciousness of cruelty towards her and for the sudden violence of his present conduct against both before even his suspicions could be completely formed by his general eagerness to effect suddenly whatever he was led to desire and his carelessness of justice or humanity in accomplishing it Madame Montoni after some time again looked round in search of a possibility of escape from the castle and conversed with Emily on the subject who was now willing to encounter any hazard though she forbore to encourage a hope in her aunt which she herself did not admit How strongly the edifice was secured and how vigilantly guarded she knew too well and trembled to commit their safety to the caprice of the servant whose assistance they must solicit Old Carlo was compassionate but he seemed to be too much in his master s interest to be trusted by them Annette could of herself do little and Emily knew Ludovico only from her report At present however these considerations were useless Madame Montoni and her niece being shut up from all intercourse even with the persons whom there might be these reasons to reject In the hall confusion and tumult still reigned Emily as she listened anxiously to the murmur that sounded along the gallery sometimes fancied she heard the clashing of swords and when she considered the nature of the provocation given by Montoni and his impetuosity it appeared probable that nothing less than arms would terminate the contention Madame Montoni having exhausted all her expressions of indignation and Emily hers of comfort they remained silent in that kind of breathless stillness which in nature often succeeds to the uproar of conflicting elements a stillness like the morning that dawns upon the ruins of an earthquake An uncertain kind of terror pervaded Emily s mind the circumstances of the past hour still came dimly and confusedly to her memory and her thoughts were various and rapid though without tumult From this state of waking visions she was recalled by a knocking at the chamber door and enquiring who was there heard the whispering voice of Annette Dear madam let me come in I have a great deal to say said the poor girl The door is locked answered the lady Yes ma am but do pray open it The Signor has the key said Madame Montoni O blessed Virgin what will become of us exclaimed Annette Assist us to escape said her mistress Where is Ludovico Below in the hall ma am amongst them all fighting with the best of them Fighting Who are fighting cried Madame Montoni Why the Signor ma am and all the Signors and a great many more Is any person much hurt said Emily in a tremulous voice Hurt Yes ma amselle there they lie bleeding and the swords are clashing and O holy saints Do let me in ma am they are coming this way I shall be murdered Fly cried Emily fly we cannot open the door Annette repeated that they were coming and in the same moment fled Be calm madam said Emily turning to her aunt I entreat you to be calm I am not frightened not frightened in the least do not you be alarmed You can scarcely support yourself replied her aunt Merciful God what is it they mean to do with us They come perhaps to liberate us said Emily Signor Montoni perhaps is is conquered The belief of his death gave her spirits a sudden shock and she grew faint as she saw him in imagination expiring at her feet They are coming cried Madame Montoni I hear their steps they are at the door Emily turned her languid eyes to the door but terror deprived her of utterance The key sounded in the lock the door opened and Montoni appeared followed by three ruffian like men Execute your orders said he turning to them and pointing to his wife who shrieked but was immediately carried from the room while Emily sunk senseless on a couch by which she had endeavoured to support herself When she recovered she was alone and recollected only that Madame Montoni had been there together with some unconnected particulars of the preceding transaction which were however sufficient to renew all her terror She looked wildly round the apartment as if in search of some means of intelligence concerning her aunt while neither her own danger or an idea of escaping from the room immediately occurred When her recollection was more complete she raised herself and went but with only a faint hope to examine whether the door was unfastened It was so and she then stepped timidly out into the gallery but paused there uncertain which way she should proceed Her first wish was to gather some information as to her aunt and she at length turned her steps to go to the lesser hall where Annette and the other servants usually waited Every where as she passed she heard from a distance the uproar of contention and the figures and faces which she met hurrying along the passages struck her mind with dismay Emily might now have appeared like an angel of light encompassed by fiends At length she reached the lesser hall which was silent and deserted but panting for breath she sat down to recover herself The total stillness of this place was as awful as the tumult from which she had escaped but she had now time to recall her scattered thoughts to remember her personal danger and to consider of some means of safety She perceived that it was useless to seek Madame Montoni through the wide extent and intricacies of the castle now too when every avenue seemed to be beset by ruffians in this hall she could not resolve to stay for she knew not how soon it might become their place of rendezvous and though she wished to go to her chamber she dreaded again to encounter them on the way Thus she sat trembling and hesitating when a distant murmur broke on the silence and grew louder and louder till she distinguished voices and steps approaching She then rose to go but the sounds came along the only passage by which she could depart and she was compelled to await in the hall the arrival of the persons whose steps she heard As these advanced she distinguished groans and then saw a man borne slowly along by four others Her spirits faltered at the sight and she leaned against the wall for support The bearers meanwhile entered the hall and being too busily occupied to detain or even notice Emily she attempted to leave it but her strength failed and she again sat down on the bench A damp chillness came over her her sight became confused she knew not what had passed or where she was yet the groans of the wounded person still vibrated on her heart In a few moments the tide of life seemed again to flow she began to breathe more freely and her senses revived She had not fainted nor had ever totally lost her consciousness but had contrived to support herself on the bench still without courage to turn her eyes upon the unfortunate object which remained near her and about whom the men were yet too much engaged to attend to her When her strength returned she rose and was suffered to leave the hall though her anxiety having produced some vain enquiries concerning Madame Montoni had thus made a discovery of herself Towards her chamber she now hastened as fast as her steps would bear her for she still perceived upon her passage the sounds of confusion at a distance and she endeavoured by taking her way through some obscure rooms to avoid encountering the persons whose looks had terrified her before as well as those parts of the castle where the tumult might still rage At length she reached her chamber and having secured the door of the corridor felt herself for a moment in safety A profound stillness reigned in this remote apartment which not even the faint murmur of the most distant sounds now reached She sat down near one of the casements and as she gazed on the mountain view beyond the deep repose of its beauty struck her with all the force of contrast and she could scarcely believe herself so near a scene of savage discord The contending elements seemed to have retired from their natural spheres and to have collected themselves into the minds of men for there alone the tempest now reigned Emily tried to tranquillize her spirits but anxiety made her constantly listen for some sound and often look out upon the ramparts where all however was lonely and still As a sense of her own immediate danger had decreased her apprehension concerning Madame Montoni heightened who she remembered had been fiercely threatened with confinement in the east turret and it was possible that her husband had satisfied his present vengeance with this punishment She therefore determined when night should return and the inhabitants of the castle should be asleep to explore the way to the turret which as the direction it stood in was mentioned appeared not very difficult to be done She knew indeed that although her aunt might be there she could afford her no effectual assistance but it might give her some comfort even to know that she was discovered and to hear the sound of her niece s voice for herself any certainty concerning Madame Montoni s fate appeared more tolerable than this exhausting suspense Meanwhile Annette did not appear and Emily was surprised and somewhat alarmed for her whom in the confusion of the late scene various accidents might have befallen and it was improbable that she would have failed to come to her apartment unless something unfortunate had happened Thus the hours passed in solitude in silence and in anxious conjecturing Being not once disturbed by a message or a sound it appeared that Montoni had wholly forgotten her and it gave her some comfort to find that she could be so unnoticed She endeavoured to withdraw her thoughts from the anxiety that preyed upon them but they refused controul she could neither read or draw and the tones of her lute were so utterly discordant with the present state of her feelings that she could not endure them for a moment The sun at length set behind the western mountains his fiery beams faded from the clouds and then a dun melancholy purple drew over them and gradually involved the features of the country below Soon after the sentinels passed on the rampart to commence the watch Twilight had now spread its gloom over every object the dismal obscurity of her chamber recalled fearful thoughts but she remembered that to procure a light she must pass through a great extent of the castle and above all through the halls where she had already experienced so much horror Darkness indeed in the present state of her spirits made silence and solitude terrible to her it would also prevent the possibility of her finding her way to the turret and condemn her to remain in suspense concerning the fate of her aunt yet she dared not to venture forth for a lamp Continuing at the casement that she might catch the last lingering gleam of evening a thousand vague images of fear floated on her fancy What if some of these ruffians said she should find out the private stair case and in the darkness of night steal into my chamber Then recollecting the mysterious inhabitant of the neighbouring apartment her terror changed its object He is not a prisoner said she though he remains in one chamber for Montoni did not fasten the door when he left it the unknown person himself did this it is certain therefore he can come out when he pleases She paused for notwithstanding the terrors of darkness she considered it to be very improbable whoever he was that he could have any interest in intruding upon her retirement and again the subject of her emotion changed when remembering her nearness to the chamber where the veil had formerly disclosed a dreadful spectacle she doubted whether some passage might not communicate between it and the insecure door of the stair case It was now entirely dark and she left the casement As she sat with her eyes fixed on the hearth she thought she perceived there a spark of light it twinkled and disappeared and then again was visible At length with much care she fanned the embers of a wood fire that had been lighted in the morning into flame and having communicated it to a lamp which always stood in her room felt a satisfaction not to be conceived without a review of her situation Her first care was to guard the door of the stair case for which purpose she placed against it all the furniture she could move and she was thus employed for some time at the end of which she had another instance how much more oppressive misfortune is to the idle than to the busy for having then leisure to think over all the circumstances of her present afflictions she imagined a thousand evils for futurity and these real and ideal subjects of distress alike wounded her mind Thus heavily moved the hours till midnight when she counted the sullen notes of the great clock as they rolled along the rampart unmingled with any sound except the distant foot fall of a sentinel who came to relieve guard She now thought she might venture towards the turret and having gently opened the chamber door to examine the corridor and to listen if any person was stirring in the castle found all around in perfect stillness Yet no sooner had she left the room than she perceived a light flash on the walls of the corridor and without waiting to see by whom it was carried she shrunk back and closed her door No one approaching she conjectured that it was Montoni going to pay his mid night visit to her unknown neighbour and she determined to wait till he should have retired to his own apartment When the chimes had tolled another half hour she once more opened the door and perceiving that no person was in the corridor hastily crossed into a passage that led along the south side of the castle towards the stair case whence she believed she could easily find her way to the turret Often pausing on her way listening apprehensively to the murmurs of the wind and looking fearfully onward into the gloom of the long passages she at length reached the stair case but there her perplexity began Two passages appeared of which she knew not how to prefer one and was compelled at last to decide by chance rather than by circumstances That she entered opened first into a wide gallery along which she passed lightly and swiftly for the lonely aspect of the place awed her and she started at the echo of her own steps On a sudden she thought she heard a voice and not distinguishing from whence it came feared equally to proceed or to return For some moments she stood in an attitude of listening expectation shrinking almost from herself and scarcely daring to look round her The voice came again but though it was now near her terror did not allow her to judge exactly whence it proceeded She thought however that it was the voice of complaint and her belief was soon confirmed by a low moaning sound that seemed to proceed from one of the chambers opening into the gallery It instantly occurred to her that Madame Montoni might be there confined and she advanced to the door to speak but was checked by considering that she was perhaps going to commit herself to a stranger who might discover her to Montoni for though this person whoever it was seemed to be in affliction it did not follow that he was a prisoner While these thoughts passed over her mind and left her still in hesitation the voice spoke again and calling Ludovico she then perceived it to be that of Annette on which no longer hesitating she went in joy to answer her Ludovico cried Annette sobbing Ludovico It is not Ludovico it is I Mademoiselle Emily Annette ceased sobbing and was silent If you can open the door let me in said Emily here is no person to hurt you Ludovico O Ludovico cried Annette Emily now lost her patience and her fear of being overheard increasing she was even nearly about to leave the door when she considered that Annette might possibly know something of the situation of Madame Montoni or direct her to the turret At length she obtained a reply though little satisfactory to her questions for Annette knew nothing of Madame Montoni and only conjured Emily to tell her what was become of Ludovico Of him she had no information to give and she again asked who had shut Annette up Ludovico said the poor girl Ludovico shut me up When I ran away from the dressing room door to day I went I scarcely knew where for safety and in this gallery here I met Ludovico who hurried me into this chamber and locked me up to keep me out of harm as he said But he was in such a hurry himself he hardly spoke ten words but he told me he would come and let me out when all was quiet and he took away the key with him Now all these hours are passed and I have neither seen or heard a word of him they have murdered him I know they have Emily suddenly remembered the wounded person whom she had seen borne into the servants hall and she scarcely doubted that he was Ludovico but she concealed the circumstance from Annette and endeavoured to comfort her Then impatient to learn something of her aunt she again enquired the way to the turret O you are not going ma amselle said Annette for Heaven s sake do not go and leave me here by myself Nay Annette you do not think I can wait in the gallery all night replied Emily Direct me to the turret in the morning I will endeavour to release you O holy Mary exclaimed Annette am I to stay here by myself all night I shall be frightened out of my senses and I shall die of hunger I have had nothing to eat since dinner Emily could scarcely forbear smiling at the heterogeneous distresses of Annette though she sincerely pitied them and said what she could to sooth her At length she obtained something like a direction to the east turret and quitted the door from whence after many intricacies and perplexities she reached the steep and winding stairs of the turret at the foot of which she stopped to rest and to re animate her courage with a sense of her duty As she surveyed this dismal place she perceived a door on the opposite side of the stair case and anxious to know whether it would lead her to Madame Montoni she tried to undraw the bolts which fastened it A fresher air came to her face as she unclosed the door which opened upon the east rampart and the sudden current had nearly extinguished her light which she now removed to a distance and again looking out upon the obscure terrace she perceived only the faint outline of the walls and of some towers while above heavy clouds borne along the wind seemed to mingle with the stars and wrap the night in thicker darkness As she gazed now willing to defer the moment of certainty from which she expected only confirmation of evil a distant footstep reminded her that she might be observed by the men on watch and hastily closing the door she took her lamp and passed up the stair case Trembling came upon her as she ascended through the gloom To her melancholy fancy this seemed to be a place of death and the chilling silence that reigned confirmed its character Her spirits faltered Perhaps said she I am come hither only to learn a dreadful truth or to witness some horrible spectacle I feel that my senses would not survive such an addition of horror The image of her aunt murdered murdered perhaps by the hand of Montoni rose to her mind she trembled gasped for breath repented that she had dared to venture hither and checked her steps But after she had paused a few minutes the consciousness of her duty returned and she went on Still all was silent At length a track of blood upon a stair caught her eye and instantly she perceived that the wall and several other steps were stained She paused again struggled to support herself and the lamp almost fell from her trembling hand Still no sound was heard no living being seemed to inhabit the turret a thousand times she wished herself again in her chamber dreaded to enquire farther dreaded to encounter some horrible spectacle and yet could not resolve now that she was so near the termination of her efforts to desist from them Having again collected courage to proceed after ascending about half way up the turret she came to another door but here again she stopped in hesitation listened for sounds within and then summoning all her resolution unclosed it and entered a chamber which as her lamp shot its feeble rays through the darkness seemed to exhibit only dew stained and deserted walls As she stood examining it in fearful expectation of discovering the remains of her unfortunate aunt she perceived something lying in an obscure corner of the room and struck with an horrible conviction she became for an instant motionless and nearly insensible Then with a kind of desperate resolution she hurried towards the object that excited her terror when perceiving the clothes of some person on the floor she caught hold of them and found in her grasp the old uniform of a soldier beneath which appeared a heap of pikes and other arms Scarcely daring to trust her sight she continued for some moments to gaze on the object of her late alarm and then left the chamber so much comforted and occupied by the conviction that her aunt was not there that she was going to descend the turret without enquiring farther when on turning to do so she observed upon some steps on the second flight an appearance of blood and remembering that there was yet another chamber to be explored she again followed the windings of the ascent Still as she ascended the track of blood glared upon the stairs It led her to the door of a landing place that terminated them but she was unable to follow it farther Now that she was so near the sought for certainty she dreaded to know it even more than before and had not fortitude sufficient to speak or to attempt opening the door Having listened in vain for some sound that might confirm or destroy her fears she at length laid her hand on the lock and finding it fastened called on Madame Montoni but only a chilling silence ensued She is dead she cried murdered her blood is on the stairs Emily grew very faint could support herself no longer and had scarcely presence of mind to set down the lamp and place herself on a step When her recollection returned she spoke again at the door and again attempted to open it and having lingered for some time without receiving any answer or hearing a sound she descended the turret and with all the swiftness her feebleness would permit sought her own apartment As she turned into the corridor the door of a chamber opened from whence Montoni came forth but Emily more terrified than ever to behold him shrunk back into the passage soon enough to escape being noticed and heard him close the door which she had perceived was the same she formerly observed Having here listened to his departing steps till their faint sound was lost in distance she ventured to her apartment and securing it once again retired to her bed leaving the lamp burning on the hearth But sleep was fled from her harassed mind to which images of horror alone occurred She endeavoured to think it possible that Madame Montoni had not been taken to the turret but when she recollected the former menaces of her husband and the terrible spirit of vengeance which he had displayed on a late occasion when she remembered his general character the looks of the men who had forced Madame Montoni from her apartment and the written traces on the stairs of the turret she could not doubt that her aunt had been carried thither and could scarcely hope that she had not been carried to be murdered The grey of morning had long dawned through her casements before Emily closed her eyes in sleep when wearied nature at length yielded her a respite from suffering CHAPTER XI Who rears the bloody hand SAYERS Emily remained in her chamber on the following morning without receiving any notice from Montoni or seeing a human being except the armed men who sometimes passed on the terrace below Having tasted no food since the dinner of the preceding day extreme faintness made her feel the necessity of quitting the asylum of her apartment to obtain refreshment and she was also very anxious to procure liberty for Annette Willing however to defer venturing forth as long as possible and considering whether she should apply to Montoni or to the compassion of some other person her excessive anxiety concerning her aunt at length overcame her abhorrence of his presence and she determined to go to him and to entreat that he would suffer her to see Madame Montoni Meanwhile it was too certain from the absence of Annette that some accident had befallen Ludovico and that she was still in confinement Emily therefore resolved also to visit the chamber where she had spoken to her on the preceding night and if the poor girl was yet there to inform Montoni of her situation It was near noon before she ventured from her apartment and went first to the south gallery whither she passed without meeting a single person or hearing a sound except now and then the echo of a distant footstep It was unnecessary to call Annette whose lamentations were audible upon the first approach to the gallery and who bewailing her own and Ludovico s fate told Emily that she should certainly be starved to death if she was not let out immediately Emily replied that she was going to beg her release of Montoni but the terrors of hunger now yielded to those of the Signor and when Emily left her she was loudly entreating that her place of refuge might be concealed from him As Emily drew near the great hall the sounds she heard and the people she met in the passages renewed her alarm The latter however were peaceable and did not interrupt her though they looked earnestly at her as she passed and sometimes spoke On crossing the hall towards the cedar room where Montoni usually sat she perceived on the pavement fragments of swords some tattered garments stained with blood and almost expected to have seen among them a dead body but from such a spectacle she was at present spared As she approached the room the sound of several voices issued from within and a dread of appearing before many strangers as well as of irritating Montoni by such an intrusion made her pause and falter from her purpose She looked up through the long arcades of the hall in search of a servant who might bear a message but no one appeared and the urgency of what she had to request made her still linger near the door The voices within were not in contention though she distinguished those of several of the guests of the preceding day but still her resolution failed whenever she would have tapped at the door and she had determined to walk in the hall till some person should appear who might call Montoni from the room when as she turned from the door it was suddenly opened by himself Emily trembled and was confused while he almost started with surprise and all the terrors of his countenance unfolded themselves She forgot all she would have said and neither enquired for her aunt or entreated for Annette but stood silent and embarrassed After closing the door he reproved her for a meanness of which she had not been guilty and sternly questioned her what she had overheard an accusation which revived her recollection so far that she assured him she had not come thither with an intention to listen to his conversation but to entreat his compassion for her aunt and for Annette Montoni seemed to doubt this assertion for he regarded her with a scrutinizing look and the doubt evidently arose from no trifling interest Emily then further explained herself and concluded with entreating him to inform her where her aunt was placed and to permit that she might visit her but he looked upon her only with a malignant smile which instantaneously confirmed her worst fears for her aunt and at that moment she had not courage to renew her entreaties For Annette said he if you go to Carlo he will release the girl the foolish fellow who shut her up died yesterday Emily shuddered But my aunt Signor said she O tell me of my aunt She is taken care of replied Montoni hastily I have no time to answer idle questions He would have passed on but Emily in a voice of agony that could not be wholly resisted conjured him to tell her where Madame Montoni was while he paused and she anxiously watched his countenance a trumpet sounded and in the next moment she heard the heavy gates of the portal open and then the clattering of horses hoofs in the court with the confusion of many voices She stood for a moment hesitating whether she should follow Montoni who at the sound of the trumpet had passed through the hall and turning her eyes whence it came she saw through the door that opened beyond a long perspective of arches into the courts a party of horsemen whom she judged as well as the distance and her embarrassment would allow to be the same she had seen depart a few days before But she staid not to scrutinize for when the trumpet sounded again the chevaliers rushed out of the cedar room and men came running into the hall from every quarter of the castle Emily once more hurried for shelter to her own apartment Thither she was still pursued by images of horror She re considered Montoni s manner and words when he had spoken of his wife and they served only to confirm her most terrible suspicions Tears refused any longer to relieve her distress and she had sat for a considerable time absorbed in thought when a knocking at the chamber door aroused her on opening which she found old Carlo Dear young lady said he I have been so flurried I never once thought of you till just now I have brought you some fruit and wine and I am sure you must stand in need of them by this time Thank you Carlo said Emily this is very good of you Did the Signor remind you of me No Signora replied Carlo his excellenza has business enough on his hands Emily then renewed her enquiries concerning Madame Montoni but Carlo had been employed at the other end of the castle during the time that she was removed and he had heard nothing since concerning her While he spoke Emily looked steadily at him for she scarcely knew whether he was really ignorant or concealed his knowledge of the truth from a fear of offending his master To several questions concerning the contentions of yesterday he gave very limited answers but told that the disputes were now amicably settled and that the Signor believed himself to have been mistaken in his suspicions of his guests The fighting was about that Signora said Carlo but I trust I shall never see such another day in this castle though strange things are about to be done On her enquiring his meaning Ah Signora added he it is not for me to betray secrets or tell all I think but time will tell She then desired him to release Annette and having described the chamber in which the poor girl was confined he promised to obey her immediately and was departing when she remembered to ask who were the persons just arrived Her late conjecture was right it was Verezzi with his party Her spirits were somewhat soothed by this short conversation with Carlo for in her present circumstances it afforded some comfort to hear the accents of compassion and to meet the look of sympathy An hour passed before Annette appeared who then came weeping and sobbing O Ludovico Ludovico cried she My poor Annette said Emily and made her sit down Who could have foreseen this ma amselle O miserable wretched day that ever I should live to see it and she continued to moan and lament till Emily thought it necessary to check her excess of grief We are continually losing dear friends by death said she with a sigh that came from her heart We must submit to the will of Heaven our tears alas cannot recall the dead Annette took the handkerchief from her face You will meet Ludovico in a better world I hope added Emily Yes yes ma amselle sobbed Annette but I hope I shall meet him again in this though he is so wounded Wounded exclaimed Emily does he live Yes ma am but but he has a terrible wound and could not come to let me out They thought him dead at first and he has not been rightly himself till within this hour Well Annette I rejoice to hear he lives Lives Holy Saints why he will not die surely Emily said she hoped not but this expression of hope Annette thought implied fear and her own increased in proportion as Emily endeavoured to encourage her To enquiries concerning Madame Montoni she could give no satisfactory answers I quite forgot to ask among the servants ma amselle said she for I could think of nobody but poor Ludovico Annette s grief was now somewhat assuaged and Emily sent her to make enquiries concerning her lady of whom however she could obtain no intelligence some of the people she spoke with being really ignorant of her fate and others having probably received orders to conceal it This day passed with Emily in continued grief and anxiety for her aunt but she was unmolested by any notice from Montoni and now that Annette was liberated she obtained food without exposing herself to danger or impertinence Two following days passed in the same manner unmarked by any occurrence during which she obtained no information of Madame Montoni On the evening of the second having dismissed Annette and retired to bed her mind became haunted by the most dismal images such as her long anxiety concerning her aunt suggested and unable to forget herself for a moment or to vanquish the phantoms that tormented her she rose from her bed and went to one of the casements of her chamber to breathe a freer air All without was silent and dark unless that could be called light which was only the faint glimmer of the stars shewing imperfectly the outline of the mountains the western towers of the castle and the ramparts below where a solitary sentinel was pacing What an image of repose did this scene present The fierce and terrible passions too which so often agitated the inhabitants of this edifice seemed now hushed in sleep those mysterious workings that rouse the elements of man s nature into tempest were calm Emily s heart was not so but her sufferings though deep partook of the gentle character of her mind Hers was a silent anguish weeping yet enduring not the wild energy of passion inflaming imagination bearing down the barriers of reason and living in a world of its own The air refreshed her and she continued at the casement looking on the shadowy scene over which the planets burned with a clear light amid the deep blue aether as they silently moved in their destined course She remembered how often she had gazed on them with her dear father how often he had pointed out their way in the heavens and explained their laws and these reflections led to others which in an almost equal degree awakened her grief and astonishment They brought a retrospect of all the strange and mournful events which had occurred since she lived in peace with her parents And to Emily who had been so tenderly educated so tenderly loved who once knew only goodness and happiness to her the late events and her present situation in a foreign land in a remote castle surrounded by vice and violence seemed more like the visions of a distempered imagination than the circumstances of truth She wept to think of what her parents would have suffered could they have foreseen the events of her future life While she raised her streaming eyes to heaven she observed the same planet which she had seen in Languedoc on the night preceding her father s death rise above the eastern towers of the castle while she remembered the conversation which has passed concerning the probable state of departed souls remembered also the solemn music she had heard and to which the tenderness of her spirits had in spite of her reason given a superstitious meaning At these recollections she wept again and continued musing when suddenly the notes of sweet music passed on the air A superstitious dread stole over her she stood listening for some moments in trembling expectation and then endeavoured to re collect her thoughts and to reason herself into composure but human reason cannot establish her laws on subjects lost in the obscurity of imagination any more than the eye can ascertain the form of objects that only glimmer through the dimness of night Her surprise on hearing such soothing and delicious sounds was at least justifiable for it was long very long since she had listened to any thing like melody The fierce trumpet and the shrill fife were the only instruments she had heard since her arrival at Udolpho When her mind was somewhat more composed she tried to ascertain from what quarter the sounds proceeded and thought they came from below but whether from a room of the castle or from the terrace she could not with certainty judge Fear and surprise now yielded to the enchantment of a strain that floated on the silent night with the most soft and melancholy sweetness Suddenly it seemed removed to a distance trembled faintly and then entirely ceased She continued to listen sunk in that pleasing repose which soft music leaves on the mind but it came no more Upon this strange circumstance her thoughts were long engaged for strange it certainly was to hear music at midnight when every inhabitant of the castle had long since retired to rest and in a place where nothing like harmony had been heard before probably for many years Long suffering had made her spirits peculiarly sensible to terror and liable to be affected by the illusions of superstition It now seemed to her as if her dead father had spoken to her in that strain to inspire her with comfort and confidence on the subject which had then occupied her mind Yet reason told her that this was a wild conjecture and she was inclined to dismiss it but with the inconsistency so natural when imagination guides the thoughts she then wavered towards a belief as wild She remembered the singular event connected with the castle which had given it into the possession of its present owner and when she considered the mysterious manner in which its late possessor had disappeared and that she had never since been heard of her mind was impressed with an high degree of solemn awe so that though there appeared no clue to connect that event with the late music she was inclined fancifully to think they had some relation to each other At this conjecture a sudden chillness ran through her frame she looked fearfully upon the duskiness of her chamber and the dead silence that prevailed there heightened to her fancy its gloomy aspect At length she left the casement but her steps faltered as she approached the bed and she stopped and looked round The single lamp that burned in her spacious chamber was expiring for a moment she shrunk from the darkness beyond and then ashamed of the weakness which however she could not wholly conquer went forward to the bed where her mind did not soon know the soothings of sleep She still mused on the late occurrence and looked with anxiety to the next night when at the same hour she determined to watch whether the music returned If those sounds were human said she I shall probably hear them again CHAPTER XII Then oh you blessed ministers above Keep me in patience and in ripen d time Unfold the evil which is here wrapt up In countenance SHAKESPEARE Annette came almost breathless to Emily s apartment in the morning O ma amselle said she in broken sentences what news I have to tell I have found out who the prisoner is but he was no prisoner neither he that was shut up in the chamber I told you of I must think him a ghost forsooth Who was the prisoner enquired Emily while her thoughts glanced back to the circumstance of the preceding night You mistake ma am said Annette he was not a prisoner after all Who is the person then Holy Saints rejoined Annette How I was surprised I met him just now on the rampart below there I never was so surprised in my life Ah ma amselle this is a strange place I should never have done wondering if I was to live here an hundred years But as I was saying I met him just now on the rampart and I was thinking of nobody less than of him This trifling is insupportable said Emily prythee Annette do not torture my patience any longer Nay ma amselle guess guess who it was it was somebody you know very well I cannot guess said Emily impatiently Nay ma amselle I ll tell you something to guess by A tall Signor with a longish face who walks so stately and used to wear such a high feather in his hat and used often to look down upon the ground when people spoke to him and to look at people from under his eyebrows as it were all so dark and frowning You have seen him often and often at Venice ma am Then he was so intimate with the Signor too And now I think of it I wonder what he could be afraid of in this lonely old castle that he should shut himself up for But he is come abroad now for I met him on the rampart just this minute I trembled when I saw him for I always was afraid of him somehow but I determined I would not let him see it so I went up to him and made him a low curtesy You are welcome to the castle Signor Orsino said I O it was Signor Orsino then said Emily Yes ma amselle Signor Orsino himself who caused that Venetian gentleman to be killed and has been popping about from place to place ever since as I hear Good God exclaimed Emily recovering from the shock of this intelligence and is HE come to Udolpho He does well to endeavour to conceal himself Yes ma amselle but if that was all this desolate place would conceal him without his shutting himself up in one room Who would think of coming to look for him here I am sure I should as soon think of going to look for any body in the other world There is some truth in that said Emily who would now have concluded it was Orsino s music which she had heard on the preceding night had she not known that he had neither taste or skill in the art But though she was unwilling to add to the number of Annette s surprises by mentioning the subject of her own she enquired whether any person in the castle played on a musical instrument O yes ma amselle there is Benedetto plays the great drum to admiration and then there is Launcelot the trumpeter nay for that matter Ludovico himself can play on the trumpet but he is ill now I remember once Emily interrupted her Have you heard no other music since you came to the castle none last night Why did YOU hear any last night ma amselle Emily evaded this question by repeating her own Why no ma am replied Annette I never heard any music here I must say but the drums and the trumpet and as for last night I did nothing but dream I saw my late lady s ghost Your LATE lady s said Emily in a tremulous voice you have heard more then Tell me tell me all Annette I entreat tell me the worst at once Nay ma amselle you know the worst already I know nothing said Emily Yes you do ma amselle you know that nobody knows any thing about her and it is plain therefore she is gone the way of the first lady of the castle nobody ever knew any thing about her Emily leaned her head upon her hand and was for some time silent then telling Annette she wished to be alone the latter left the room The remark of Annette had revived Emily s terrible suspicion concerning the fate of Madame Montoni and she resolved to make another effort to obtain certainty on this subject by applying to Montoni once more When Annette returned a few hours after she told Emily that the porter of the castle wished very much to speak with her for that he had something of importance to say her spirits had however of late been so subject to alarm that any new circumstance excited it and this message from the porter when her first surprise was over made her look round for some lurking danger the more suspiciously perhaps because she had frequently remarked the unpleasant air and countenance of this man She now hesitated whether to speak with him doubting even that this request was only a pretext to draw her into some danger but a little reflection shewed her the improbability of this and she blushed at her weak fears I will speak to him Annette said she desire him to come to the corridor immediately Annette departed and soon after returned Barnardine ma amselle said she dare not come to the corridor lest he should be discovered it is so far from his post and he dare not even leave the gates for a moment now but if you will come to him at the portal through some roundabout passages he told me of without crossing the courts he has that to tell which will surprise you But you must not come through the courts lest the Signor should see you Emily neither approving these roundabout passage nor the other part of the request now positively refused to go Tell him said she if he has any thing of consequence to impart I will hear him in the corridor whenever he has an opportunity of coming thither Annette went to deliver this message and was absent a considerable time When she returned It won t do ma amselle said she Barnardine has been considering all this time what can be done for it is as much as his place is worth to leave his post now But if you will come to the east rampart in the dusk of the evening he can perhaps steal away and tell you all he has to say Emily was surprised and alarmed at the secrecy which this man seemed to think so necessary and hesitated whether to meet him till considering that he might mean to warn her of some serious danger she resolved to go Soon after sun set said she I will be at the end of the east rampart But then the watch will be set she added recollecting herself and how can Barnardine pass unobserved That is just what I said to him ma am and he answered me that he had the key of the gate at the end of the rampart that leads towards the courts and could let himself through that way and as for the sentinels there were none at this end of the terrace because the place is guarded enough by the high walls of the castle and the east turret and he said those at the other end were too far off to see him if it was pretty duskyish Well said Emily I must hear what he has to tell and therefore desire you will go with me to the terrace this evening He desired it might be pretty duskyish ma amselle repeated Annette because of the watch Emily paused and then said she would be on the terrace an hour after sun set and tell Barnardine she added to be punctual to the time for that I also may be observed by Signor Montoni Where is the Signor I would speak with him He is in the cedar chamber ma am counselling with the other Signors He is going to give them a sort of treat to day to make up for what passed at the last I suppose the people are all very busy in the kitchen Emily now enquired if Montoni expected any new guests and Annette believed that he did not Poor Ludovico added she he would be as merry as the best of them if he was well but he may recover yet Count Morano was wounded as bad as he and he is got well again and is gone back to Venice Is he so said Emily when did you hear this I heard it last night ma amselle but I forgot to tell it Emily asked some further questions and then desiring Annette would observe and inform her when Montoni was alone the girl went to deliver her message to Barnardine Montoni was however so much engaged during the whole day that Emily had no opportunity of seeking a release from her terrible suspense concerning her aunt Annette was employed in watching his steps and in attending upon Ludovico whom she assisted by Caterina nursed with the utmost care and Emily was of course left much alone Her thoughts dwelt often on the message of the porter and were employed in conjecturing the subject that occasioned it which she sometimes imagined concerned the fate of Madame Montoni at others that it related to some personal danger which threatened herself The cautious secrecy which Barnardine observed in his conduct inclined her to believe the latter As the hour of appointment drew near her impatience increased At length the sun set she heard the passing steps of the sentinels going to their posts and waited only for Annette to accompany her to the terrace who soon after came and they descended together When Emily expressed apprehensions of meeting Montoni or some of his guests O there is no fear of that ma amselle said Annette they are all set in to feasting yet and that Barnardine knows They reached the first terrace where the sentinels demanded who passed and Emily having answered walked on to the east rampart at the entrance of which they were again stopped and having again replied were permitted to proceed But Emily did not like to expose herself to the discretion of these men at such an hour and impatient to withdraw from the situation she stepped hastily on in search of Barnardine He was not yet come She leaned pensively on the wall of the rampart and waited for him The gloom of twilight sat deep on the surrounding objects blending in soft confusion the valley the mountains and the woods whose tall heads stirred by the evening breeze gave the only sounds that stole on silence except a faint faint chorus of distant voices that arose from within the castle What voices are those said Emily as she fearfully listened It is only the Signor and his guests carousing replied Annette Good God thought Emily can this man s heart be so gay when he has made another being so wretched if indeed my aunt is yet suffered to feel her wretchedness O whatever are my own sufferings may my heart never never be hardened against those of others She looked up with a sensation of horror to the east turret near which she then stood a light glimmered through the grates of the lower chamber but those of the upper one were dark Presently she perceived a person moving with a lamp across the lower room but this circumstance revived no hope concerning Madame Montoni whom she had vainly sought in that apartment which had appeared to contain only soldiers accoutrements Emily however determined to attempt the outer door of the turret as soon as Barnardine should withdraw and if it was unfastened to make another effort to discover her aunt The moments passed but still Barnardine did not appear and Emily becoming uneasy hesitated whether to wait any longer She would have sent Annette to the portal to hasten him but feared to be left alone for it was now almost dark and a melancholy streak of red that still lingered in the west was the only vestige of departed day The strong interest however which Barnardine s message had awakened overcame other apprehensions and still detained her While she was conjecturing with Annette what could thus occasion his absence they heard a key turn in the lock of the gate near them and presently saw a man advancing It was Barnardine of whom Emily hastily enquired what he had to communicate and desired that he would tell her quickly for I am chilled with this evening air said she You must dismiss your maid lady said the man in a voice the deep tone of which shocked her what I have to tell is to you only Emily after some hesitation desired Annette to withdraw to a little distance Now my friend what would you say He was silent a moment as if considering and then said That which would cost me my place at least if it came to the Signor s ears You must promise lady that nothing shall ever make you tell a syllable of the matter I have been trusted in this affair and if it was known that I betrayed my trust my life perhaps might answer it But I was concerned for you lady and I resolved to tell you He paused Emily thanked him assured him that he might repose on her discretion and entreated him to dispatch Annette told us in the hall how unhappy you was about Signora Montoni and how much you wished to know what was become of her Most true said Emily eagerly and you can inform me I conjure you tell me the worst without hesitation She rested her trembling arm upon the wall I can tell you said Barnardine and paused Emily had no power to enforce her entreaties I CAN tell you resumed Barnardine but But what exclaimed Emily recovering her resolution Here I am ma amselle said Annette who having heard the eager tone in which Emily pronounced these words came running towards her Retire said Barnardine sternly you are not wanted and as Emily said nothing Annette obeyed I CAN tell you repeated the porter but I know not how you was afflicted before I am prepared for the worst my friend said Emily in a firm and solemn voice I can support any certainty better than this suspense Well Signora if that is the case you shall hear You know I suppose that the Signor and his lady used sometimes to disagree It is none of my concerns to enquire what it was about but I believe you know it was so Well said Emily proceed The Signor it seems had lately been very wrath against her I saw all and heard all a great deal more than people thought for but it was none of my business so I said nothing A few days ago the Signor sent for me Barnardine says he you are an honest man I think I can trust you I assured his excellenza that he could Then says he as near as I can remember I have an affair in hand which I want you to assist me in Then he told me what I was to do but that I shall say nothing about it concerned only the Signora O Heavens exclaimed Emily what have you done Barnardine hesitated and was silent What fiend could tempt him or you to such an act cried Emily chilled with horror and scarcely able to support her fainting spirits It was a fiend said Barnardine in a gloomy tone of voice They were now both silent Emily had not courage to enquire further and Barnardine seemed to shrink from telling more At length he said It is of no use to think of the past the Signor was cruel enough but he would be obeyed What signified my refusing He would have found others who had no scruples You have murdered her then said Emily in a hollow and inward voice I am talking with a murderer Barnardine stood silent while Emily turned from him and attempted to leave the place Stay lady said he You deserve to think so still since you can believe me capable of such a deed If you are innocent tell me quickly said Emily in faint accents for I feel I shall not be able to hear you long I will tell you no more said he and walked away Emily had just strength enough to bid him stay and then to call Annette on whose arm she leaned and they walked slowly up the rampart till they heard steps behind them It was Barnardine again Send away the girl said he and I will tell you more She must not go said Emily what you have to say she may hear May she so lady said he You shall know no more then and he was going though slowly when Emily s anxiety overcoming the resentment and fear which the man s behaviour had roused she desired him to stay and bade Annette retire The Signora is alive said he for me She is my prisoner though his excellenza has shut her up in the chamber over the great gates of the court and I have the charge of her I was going to have told you you might see her but now Emily relieved from an unutterable load of anguish by this speech had now only to ask Barnardine s forgiveness and to conjure that he would let her visit her aunt He complied with less reluctance than she expected and told her that if she would repair on the following night when the Signor was retired to rest to the postern gate of the castle she should perhaps see Madame Montoni Amid all the thankfulness which Emily felt for this concession she thought she observed a malicious triumph in his manner when he pronounced the last words but in the next moment she dismissed the thought and having again thanked him commended her aunt to his pity and assured him that she would herself reward him and would be punctual to her appointment she bade him good night and retired unobserved to her chamber It was a considerable time before the tumult of joy which Barnardine s unexpected intelligence had occasioned allowed Emily to think with clearness or to be conscious of the real dangers that still surrounded Madame Montoni and herself When this agitation subsided she perceived that her aunt was yet the prisoner of a man to whose vengeance or avarice she might fall a sacrifice and when she further considered the savage aspect of the person who was appointed to guard Madame Montoni her doom appeared to be already sealed for the countenance of Barnardine seemed to bear the stamp of a murderer and when she had looked upon it she felt inclined to believe that there was no deed however black which he might not be prevailed upon to execute These reflections brought to her remembrance the tone of voice in which he had promised to grant her request to see his prisoner and she mused upon it long in uneasiness and doubt Sometimes she even hesitated whether to trust herself with him at the lonely hour he had appointed and once and only once it struck her that Madame Montoni might be already murdered and that this ruffian was appointed to decoy herself to some secret place where her life also was to be sacrificed to the avarice of Montoni who then would claim securely the contested estates in Languedoc The consideration of the enormity of such guilt did at length relieve her from the belief of its probability but not from all the doubts and fears which a recollection of Barnardine s manner had occasioned From these subjects her thoughts at length passed to others and as the evening advanced she remembered with somewhat more than surprise the music she had heard on the preceding night and now awaited its return with more than curiosity She distinguished till a late hour the distant carousals of Montoni and his companions the loud contest the dissolute laugh and the choral song that made the halls re echo At length she heard the heavy gates of the castle shut for the night and those sounds instantly sunk into a silence which was disturbed only by the whispering steps of persons passing through the galleries to their remote rooms Emily now judging it to be about the time when she had heard the music on the preceding night dismissed Annette and gently opened the casement to watch for its return The planet she had so particularly noticed at the recurrence of the music was not yet risen but with superstitious weakness she kept her eyes fixed on that part of the hemisphere where it would rise almost expecting that when it appeared the sounds would return At length it came serenely bright over the eastern towers of the castle Her heart trembled when she perceived it and she had scarcely courage to remain at the casement lest the returning music should confirm her terror and subdue the little strength she yet retained The clock soon after struck one and knowing this to be about the time when the sounds had occurred she sat down in a chair near the casement and endeavoured to compose her spirits but the anxiety of expectation yet disturbed them Every thing however remained still she heard only the solitary step of a sentinel and the lulling murmur of the woods below and she again leaned from the casement and again looked as if for intelligence to the planet which was now risen high above the towers Emily continued to listen but no music came Those were surely no mortal sounds said she recollecting their entrancing melody No inhabitant of this castle could utter such and where is the feeling that could modulate such exquisite expression We all know that it has been affirmed celestial sounds have sometimes been heard on earth Father Pierre and Father Antoine declared that they had sometimes heard them in the stillness of night when they alone were waking to offer their orisons to heaven Nay my dear father himself once said that soon after my mother s death as he lay watchful in grief sounds of uncommon sweetness called him from his bed and on opening his window he heard lofty music pass along the midnight air It soothed him he said he looked up with confidence to heaven and resigned her to his God Emily paused to weep at this recollection Perhaps resumed she perhaps those strains I heard were sent to comfort to encourage me Never shall I forget those I heard at this hour in Languedoc Perhaps my father watches over me at this moment She wept again in tenderness Thus passed the hour in watchfulness and solemn thought but no sounds returned and after remaining at the casement till the light tint of dawn began to edge the mountain tops and steal upon the night shade she concluded that they would not return and retired reluctantly to repose VOLUME three CHAPTER I I will advise you where to plant yourselves Acquaint you with the perfect spy o the time The moment on t for t must be done to night MACBETH Emily was somewhat surprised on the following day to find that Annette had heard of Madame Montoni s confinement in the chamber over the portal as well as of her purposed visit there on the approaching night That the circumstance which Barnardine had so solemnly enjoined her to conceal he had himself told to so indiscreet an hearer as Annette appeared very improbable though he had now charged her with a message concerning the intended interview He requested that Emily would meet him unattended on the terrace at a little after midnight when he himself would lead her to the place he had promised a proposal from which she immediately shrunk for a thousand vague fears darted athwart her mind such as had tormented her on the preceding night and which she neither knew how to trust or to dismiss It frequently occurred to her that Barnardine might have deceived her concerning Madame Montoni whose murderer perhaps he really was and that he had deceived her by order of Montoni the more easily to draw her into some of the desperate designs of the latter The terrible suspicion that Madame Montoni no longer lived thus came accompanied by one not less dreadful for herself Unless the crime by which the aunt had suffered was instigated merely by resentment unconnected with profit a motive upon which Montoni did not appear very likely to act its object must be unattained till the niece was also dead to whom Montoni knew that his wife s estates must descend Emily remembered the words which had informed her that the contested estates in France would devolve to her if Madame Montoni died without consigning them to her husband and the former obstinate perseverance of her aunt made it too probable that she had to the last withheld them At this instant recollecting Barnardine s manner on the preceding night she now believed what she had then fancied that it expressed malignant triumph She shuddered at the recollection which confirmed her fears and determined not to meet him on the terrace Soon after she was inclined to consider these suspicions as the extravagant exaggerations of a timid and harassed mind and could not believe Montoni liable to such preposterous depravity as that of destroying from one motive his wife and her niece She blamed herself for suffering her romantic imagination to carry her so far beyond the bounds of probability and determined to endeavour to check its rapid flights lest they should sometimes extend into madness Still however she shrunk from the thought of meeting Barnardine on the terrace at midnight and still the wish to be relieved from this terrible suspense concerning her aunt to see her and to sooth her sufferings made her hesitate what to do Yet how is it possible Annette I can pass to the terrace at that hour said she recollecting herself the sentinels will stop me and Signor Montoni will hear of the affair O ma amselle that is well thought of replied Annette That is what Barnardine told me about He gave me this key and bade me say it unlocks the door at the end of the vaulted gallery that opens near the end of the east rampart so that you need not pass any of the men on watch He bade me say too that his reason for requesting you to come to the terrace was because he could take you to the place you want to go to without opening the great doors of the hall which grate so heavily Emily s spirits were somewhat calmed by this explanation which seemed to be honestly given to Annette But why did he desire I would come alone Annette said she Why that was what I asked him myself ma amselle Says I Why is my young lady to come alone Surely I may come with her What harm can I do But he said No no I tell you not in his gruff way Nay says I I have been trusted in as great affairs as this I warrant and it s a hard matter if I can t keep a secret now Still he would say nothing but No no no Well says I if you will only trust me I will tell you a great secret that was told me a month ago and I have never opened my lips about it yet so you need not be afraid of telling me But all would not do Then ma amselle I went so far as to offer him a beautiful new sequin that Ludovico gave me for a keep sake and I would not have parted with it for all saint Marco s Place but even that would not do Now what can be the reason of this But I know you know ma am who you are going to see Pray did Barnardine tell you this He No ma amselle that he did not Emily enquired who did but Annette shewed that she COULD keep a secret During the remainder of the day Emily s mind was agitated with doubts and fears and contrary determinations on the subject of meeting this Barnardine on the rampart and submitting herself to his guidance she scarcely knew whither Pity for her aunt and anxiety for herself alternately swayed her determination and night came before she had decided upon her conduct She heard the castle clock strike eleven twelve and yet her mind wavered The time however was now come when she could hesitate no longer and then the interest she felt for her aunt overcame other considerations and bidding Annette follow her to the outer door of the vaulted gallery and there await her return she descended from her chamber The castle was perfectly still and the great hall where so lately she had witnessed a scene of dreadful contention now returned only the whispering footsteps of the two solitary figures gliding fearfully between the pillars and gleamed only to the feeble lamp they carried Emily deceived by the long shadows of the pillars and by the catching lights between often stopped imagining she saw some person moving in the distant obscurity of the perspective and as she passed these pillars she feared to turn her eyes toward them almost expecting to see a figure start out from behind their broad shaft She reached however the vaulted gallery without interruption but unclosed its outer door with a trembling hand and charging Annette not to quit it and to keep it a little open that she might be heard if she called she delivered to her the lamp which she did not dare to take herself because of the men on watch and alone stepped out upon the dark terrace Every thing was so still that she feared lest her own light steps should be heard by the distant sentinels and she walked cautiously towards the spot where she had before met Barnardine listening for a sound and looking onward through the gloom in search of him At length she was startled by a deep voice that spoke near her and she paused uncertain whether it was his till it spoke again and she then recognized the hollow tones of Barnardine who had been punctual to the moment and was at the appointed place resting on the rampart wall After chiding her for not coming sooner and saying that he had been waiting nearly half an hour he desired Emily who made no reply to follow him to the door through which he had entered the terrace While he unlocked it she looked back to that she had left and observing the rays of the lamp stream through a small opening was certain that Annette was still there But her remote situation could little befriend Emily after she had quitted the terrace and when Barnardine unclosed the gate the dismal aspect of the passage beyond shewn by a torch burning on the pavement made her shrink from following him alone and she refused to go unless Annette might accompany her This however Barnardine absolutely refused to permit mingling at the same time with his refusal such artful circumstances to heighten the pity and curiosity of Emily towards her aunt that she at length consented to follow him alone to the portal He then took up the torch and led her along the passage at the extremity of which he unlocked another door whence they descended a few steps into a chapel which as Barnardine held up the torch to light her Emily observed to be in ruins and she immediately recollected a former conversation of Annette concerning it with very unpleasant emotions She looked fearfully on the almost roofless walls green with damps and on the gothic points of the windows where the ivy and the briony had long supplied the place of glass and ran mantling among the broken capitals of some columns that had once supported the roof Barnardine stumbled over the broken pavement and his voice as he uttered a sudden oath was returned in hollow echoes that made it more terrific Emily s heart sunk but she still followed him and he turned out of what had been the principal aisle of the chapel Down these steps lady said Barnardine as he descended a flight which appeared to lead into the vaults but Emily paused on the top and demanded in a tremulous tone whither he was conducting her To the portal said Barnardine Cannot we go through the chapel to the portal said Emily No Signora that leads to the inner court which I don t choose to unlock This way and we shall reach the outer court presently Emily still hesitated fearing not only to go on but since she had gone thus far to irritate Barnardine by refusing to go further Come lady said the man who had nearly reached the bottom of the flight make a little haste I cannot wait here all night Whither do these steps lead said Emily yet pausing To the portal repeated Barnardine in an angry tone I will wait no longer As he said this he moved on with the light and Emily fearing to provoke him by further delay reluctantly followed From the steps they proceeded through a passage adjoining the vaults the walls of which were dropping with unwholesome dews and the vapours that crept along the ground made the torch burn so dimly that Emily expected every moment to see it extinguished and Barnardine could scarcely find his way As they advanced these vapours thickened and Barnardine believing the torch was expiring stopped for a moment to trim it As he then rested against a pair of iron gates that opened from the passage Emily saw by uncertain flashes of light the vaults beyond and near her heaps of earth that seemed to surround an open grave Such an object in such a scene would at any time have disturbed her but now she was shocked by an instantaneous presentiment that this was the grave of her unfortunate aunt and that the treacherous Barnardine was leading herself to destruction The obscure and terrible place to which he had conducted her seemed to justify the thought it was a place suited for murder a receptacle for the dead where a deed of horror might be committed and no vestige appear to proclaim it Emily was so overwhelmed with terror that for a moment she was unable to determine what conduct to pursue She then considered that it would be vain to attempt an escape from Barnardine by flight since the length and the intricacy of the way she had passed would soon enable him to overtake her who was unacquainted with the turnings and whose feebleness would not suffer her to run long with swiftness She feared equally to irritate him by a disclosure of her suspicions which a refusal to accompany him further certainly would do and since she was already as much in his power as it was possible she could be if she proceeded she at length determined to suppress as far as she could the appearance of apprehension and to follow silently whither he designed to lead her Pale with horror and anxiety she now waited till Barnardine had trimmed the torch and as her sight glanced again upon the grave she could not forbear enquiring for whom it was prepared He took his eyes from the torch and fixed them upon her face without speaking She faintly repeated the question but the man shaking the torch passed on and she followed trembling to a second flight of steps having ascended which a door delivered them into the first court of the castle As they crossed it the light shewed the high black walls around them fringed with long grass and dank weeds that found a scanty soil among the mouldering stones the heavy buttresses with here and there between them a narrow grate that admitted a freer circulation of air to the court the massy iron gates that led to the castle whose clustering turrets appeared above and opposite the huge towers and arch of the portal itself In this scene the large uncouth person of Barnardine bearing the torch formed a characteristic figure This Barnardine was wrapt in a long dark cloak which scarcely allowed the kind of half boots or sandals that were laced upon his legs to appear and shewed only the point of a broad sword which he usually wore slung in a belt across his shoulders On his head was a heavy flat velvet cap somewhat resembling a turban in which was a short feather the visage beneath it shewed strong features and a countenance furrowed with the lines of cunning and darkened by habitual discontent The view of the court however reanimated Emily who as she crossed silently towards the portal began to hope that her own fears and not the treachery of Barnardine had deceived her She looked anxiously up at the first casement that appeared above the lofty arch of the portcullis but it was dark and she enquired whether it belonged to the chamber where Madame Montoni was confined Emily spoke low and Barnardine perhaps did not hear her question for he returned no answer and they soon after entered the postern door of the gate way which brought them to the foot of a narrow stair case that wound up one of the towers Up this stair case the Signora lies said Barnardine Lies repeated Emily faintly as she began to ascend She lies in the upper chamber said Barnardine As they passed up the wind which poured through the narrow cavities in the wall made the torch flare and it threw a stronger gleam upon the grim and sallow countenance of Barnardine and discovered more fully the desolation of the place the rough stone walls the spiral stairs black with age and a suit of antient armour with an iron visor that hung upon the walls and appeared a trophy of some former victory Having reached a landing place You may wait here lady said he applying a key to the door of a chamber while I go up and tell the Signora you are coming That ceremony is unnecessary replied Emily my aunt will rejoice to see me I am not so sure of that said Barnardine pointing to the room he had opened Come in here lady while I step up Emily surprised and somewhat shocked did not dare to oppose him further but as he was turning away with the torch desired he would not leave her in darkness He looked around and observing a tripod lamp that stood on the stairs lighted and gave it to Emily who stepped forward into a large old chamber and he closed the door As she listened anxiously to his departing steps she thought he descended instead of ascending the stairs but the gusts of wind that whistled round the portal would not allow her to hear distinctly any other sound Still however she listened and perceiving no step in the room above where he had affirmed Madame Montoni to be her anxiety increased though she considered that the thickness of the floor in this strong building might prevent any sound reaching her from the upper chamber The next moment in a pause of the wind she distinguished Barnardine s step descending to the court and then thought she heard his voice but the rising gust again overcoming other sounds Emily to be certain on this point moved softly to the door which on attempting to open it she discovered was fastened All the horrid apprehensions that had lately assailed her returned at this instant with redoubled force and no longer appeared like the exaggerations of a timid spirit but seemed to have been sent to warn her of her fate She now did not doubt that Madame Montoni had been murdered perhaps in this very chamber or that she herself was brought hither for the same purpose The countenance the manners and the recollected words of Barnardine when he had spoken of her aunt confirmed her worst fears For some moments she was incapable of considering of any means by which she might attempt an escape Still she listened but heard footsteps neither on the stairs or in the room above she thought however that she again distinguished Barnardine s voice below and went to a grated window that opened upon the court to enquire further Here she plainly heard his hoarse accents mingling with the blast that swept by but they were lost again so quickly that their meaning could not be interpreted and then the light of a torch which seemed to issue from the portal below flashed across the court and the long shadow of a man who was under the arch way appeared upon the pavement Emily from the hugeness of this sudden portrait concluded it to be that of Barnardine but other deep tones which passed in the wind soon convinced her he was not alone and that his companion was not a person very liable to pity When her spirits had overcome the first shock of her situation she held up the lamp to examine if the chamber afforded a possibility of an escape It was a spacious room whose walls wainscoted with rough oak shewed no casement but the grated one which Emily had left and no other door than that by which she had entered The feeble rays of the lamp however did not allow her to see at once its full extent she perceived no furniture except indeed an iron chair fastened in the centre of the chamber immediately over which depending on a chain from the ceiling hung an iron ring Having gazed upon these for some time with wonder and horror she next observed iron bars below made for the purpose of confining the feet and on the arms of the chair were rings of the same metal As she continued to survey them she concluded that they were instruments of torture and it struck her that some poor wretch had once been fastened in this chair and had there been starved to death She was chilled by the thought but what was her agony when in the next moment it occurred to her that her aunt might have been one of these victims and that she herself might be the next An acute pain seized her head she was scarcely able to hold the lamp and looking round for support was seating herself unconsciously in the iron chair itself but suddenly perceiving where she was she started from it in horror and sprung towards a remote end of the room Here again she looked round for a seat to sustain her and perceived only a dark curtain which descending from the ceiling to the floor was drawn along the whole side of the chamber Ill as she was the appearance of this curtain struck her and she paused to gaze upon it in wonder and apprehension It seemed to conceal a recess of the chamber she wished yet dreaded to lift it and to discover what it veiled twice she was withheld by a recollection of the terrible spectacle her daring hand had formerly unveiled in an apartment of the castle till suddenly conjecturing that it concealed the body of her murdered aunt she seized it in a fit of desperation and drew it aside Beyond appeared a corpse stretched on a kind of low couch which was crimsoned with human blood as was the floor beneath The features deformed by death were ghastly and horrible and more than one livid wound appeared in the face Emily bending over the body gazed for a moment with an eager frenzied eye but in the next the lamp dropped from her hand and she fell senseless at the foot of the couch When her senses returned she found herself surrounded by men among whom was Barnardine who were lifting her from the floor and then bore her along the chamber She was sensible of what passed but the extreme languor of her spirits did not permit her to speak or move or even to feel any distinct fear They carried her down the stair case by which she had ascended when having reached the arch way they stopped and one of the men taking the torch from Barnardine opened a small door that was cut in the great gate and as he stepped out upon the road the light he bore shewed several men on horseback in waiting Whether it was the freshness of the air that revived Emily or that the objects she now saw roused the spirit of alarm she suddenly spoke and made an ineffectual effort to disengage herself from the grasp of the ruffians who held her Barnardine meanwhile called loudly for the torch while distant voices answered and several persons approached and in the same instant a light flashed upon the court of the castle Again he vociferated for the torch and the men hurried Emily through the gate At a short distance under the shelter of the castle walls she perceived the fellow who had taken the light from the porter holding it to a man busily employed in altering the saddle of a horse round which were several horsemen looking on whose harsh features received the full glare of the torch while the broken ground beneath them the opposite walls with the tufted shrubs that overhung their summits and an embattled watch tower above were reddened with the gleam which fading gradually away left the remoter ramparts and the woods below to the obscurity of night What do you waste time for there said Barnardine with an oath as he approached the horsemen Dispatch dispatch The saddle will be ready in a minute replied the man who was buckling it at whom Barnardine now swore again for his negligence and Emily calling feebly for help was hurried towards the horses while the ruffians disputed on which to place her the one designed for her not being ready At this moment a cluster of lights issued from the great gates and she immediately heard the shrill voice of Annette above those of several other persons who advanced In the same moment she distinguished Montoni and Cavigni followed by a number of ruffian faced fellows to whom she no longer looked with terror but with hope for at this instant she did not tremble at the thought of any dangers that might await her within the castle whence so lately and so anxiously she had wished to escape Those which threatened her from without had engrossed all her apprehensions A short contest ensued between the parties in which that of Montoni however were presently victors and the horsemen perceiving that numbers were against them and being perhaps not very warmly interested in the affair they had undertaken galloped off while Barnardine had run far enough to be lost in the darkness and Emily was led back into the castle As she re passed the courts the remembrance of what she had seen in the portal chamber came with all its horror to her mind and when soon after she heard the gate close that shut her once more within the castle walls she shuddered for herself and almost forgetting the danger she had escaped could scarcely think that any thing less precious than liberty and peace was to be found beyond them Montoni ordered Emily to await him in the cedar parlour whither he soon followed and then sternly questioned her on this mysterious affair Though she now viewed him with horror as the murderer of her aunt and scarcely knew what she said in reply to his impatient enquiries her answers and her manner convinced him that she had not taken a voluntary part in the late scheme and he dismissed her upon the appearance of his servants whom he had ordered to attend that he might enquire further into the affair and discover those who had been accomplices in it Emily had been some time in her apartment before the tumult of her mind allowed her to remember several of the past circumstances Then again the dead form which the curtain in the portal chamber had disclosed came to her fancy and she uttered a groan which terrified Annette the more as Emily forbore to satisfy her curiosity on the subject of it for she feared to trust her with so fatal a secret lest her indiscretion should call down the immediate vengeance of Montoni on herself Thus compelled to bear within her own mind the whole horror of the secret that oppressed it her reason seemed to totter under the intolerable weight She often fixed a wild and vacant look on Annette and when she spoke either did not hear her or answered from the purpose Long fits of abstraction succeeded Annette spoke repeatedly but her voice seemed not to make any impression on the sense of the long agitated Emily who sat fixed and silent except that now and then she heaved a heavy sigh but without tears Terrified at her condition Annette at length left the room to inform Montoni of it who had just dismissed his servants without having made any discoveries on the subject of his enquiry The wild description which this girl now gave of Emily induced him to follow her immediately to the chamber At the sound of his voice Emily turned her eyes and a gleam of recollection seemed to shoot athwart her mind for she immediately rose from her seat and moved slowly to a remote part of the room He spoke to her in accents somewhat softened from their usual harshness but she regarded him with a kind of half curious half terrified look and answered only yes to whatever he said Her mind still seemed to retain no other impression than that of fear Of this disorder Annette could give no explanation and Montoni having attempted for some time to persuade Emily to talk retired after ordering Annette to remain with her during the night and to inform him in the morning of her condition When he was gone Emily again came forward and asked who it was that had been there to disturb her Annette said it was the Signor Signor Montoni Emily repeated the name after her several times as if she did not recollect it and then suddenly groaned and relapsed into abstraction With some difficulty Annette led her to the bed which Emily examined with an eager frenzied eye before she lay down and then pointing turned with shuddering emotion to Annette who now more terrified went towards the door that she might bring one of the female servants to pass the night with them but Emily observing her going called her by name and then in the naturally soft and plaintive tone of her voice begged that she too would not forsake her For since my father died added she sighing every body forsakes me Your father ma amselle said Annette he was dead before you knew me He was indeed rejoined Emily and her tears began to flow She now wept silently and long after which becoming quite calm she at length sunk to sleep Annette having had discretion enough not to interrupt her tears This girl as affectionate as she was simple lost in these moments all her former fears of remaining in the chamber and watched alone by Emily during the whole night CHAPTER II unfold What worlds or what vast regions hold Th immortal mind that hath forsook Her mansion in this fleshly nook IL PENSEROSO Emily s mind was refreshed by sleep On waking in the morning she looked with surprise on Annette who sat sleeping in a chair beside the bed and then endeavoured to recollect herself but the circumstances of the preceding night were swept from her memory which seemed to retain no trace of what had passed and she was still gazing with surprise on Annette when the latter awoke O dear ma amselle do you know me cried she Know you Certainly replied Emily you are Annette but why are you sitting by me thus O you have been very ill ma amselle very ill indeed and I am sure I thought This is very strange said Emily still trying to recollect the past But I think I do remember that my fancy has been haunted by frightful dreams Good God she added suddenly starting surely it was nothing more than a dream She fixed a terrified look upon Annette who intending to quiet her said Yes ma amselle it was more than a dream but it is all over now She IS murdered then said Emily in an inward voice and shuddering instantaneously Annette screamed for being ignorant of the circumstance to which Emily referred she attributed her manner to a disordered fancy but when she had explained to what her own speech alluded Emily recollecting the attempt that had been made to carry her off asked if the contriver of it had been discovered Annette replied that he had not though he might easily be guessed at and then told Emily she might thank her for her deliverance who endeavouring to command the emotion which the remembrance of her aunt had occasioned appeared calmly to listen to Annette though in truth she heard scarcely a word that was said And so ma amselle continued the latter I was determined to be even with Barnardine for refusing to tell me the secret by finding it out myself so I watched you on the terrace and as soon as he had opened the door at the end I stole out from the castle to try to follow you for says I I am sure no good can be planned or why all this secrecy So sure enough he had not bolted the door after him and when I opened it I saw by the glimmer of the torch at the other end of the passage which way you were going I followed the light at a distance till you came to the vaults of the chapel and there I was afraid to go further for I had heard strange things about these vaults But then again I was afraid to go back all in darkness by myself so by the time Barnardine had trimmed the light I had resolved to follow you and I did so till you came to the great court and there I was afraid he would see me so I stopped at the door again and watched you across to the gates and when you was gone up the stairs I whipt after There as I stood under the gate way I heard horses feet without and several men talking and I heard them swearing at Barnardine for not bringing you out and just then he had like to have caught me for he came down the stairs again and I had hardly time to get out of his way But I had heard enough of his secret now and I determined to be even with him and to save you too ma amselle for I guessed it to be some new scheme of Count Morano though he was gone away I ran into the castle but I had hard work to find my way through the passage under the chapel and what is very strange I quite forgot to look for the ghosts they had told me about though I would not go into that place again by myself for all the world Luckily the Signor and Signor Cavigni were up so we had soon a train at our heels sufficient to frighten that Barnardine and his rogues all together Annette ceased to speak but Emily still appeared to listen At length she said suddenly I think I will go to him myself where is he Annette asked who was meant Signor Montoni replied Emily I would speak with him and Annette now remembering the order he had given on the preceding night respecting her young lady rose and said she would seek him herself This honest girl s suspicions of Count Morano were perfectly just Emily too when she thought on the scheme had attributed it to him and Montoni who had not a doubt on this subject also began to believe that it was by the direction of Morano that poison had formerly been mingled with his wine The professions of repentance which Morano had made to Emily under the anguish of his wound was sincere at the moment he offered them but he had mistaken the subject of his sorrow for while he thought he was condemning the cruelty of his late design he was lamenting only the state of suffering to which it had reduced him As these sufferings abated his former views revived till his health being re established he again found himself ready for enterprise and difficulty The porter of the castle who had served him on a former occasion willingly accepted a second bribe and having concerted the means of drawing Emily to the gates Morano publicly left the hamlet whither he had been carried after the affray and withdrew with his people to another at several miles distance From thence on a night agreed upon by Barnardine who had discovered from the thoughtless prattle of Annette the most probable means of decoying Emily the Count sent back his servants to the castle while he awaited her arrival at the hamlet with an intention of carrying her immediately to Venice How this his second scheme was frustrated has already appeared but the violent and various passions with which this Italian lover was now agitated on his return to that city can only be imagined Annette having made her report to Montoni of Emily s health and of her request to see him he replied that she might attend him in the cedar room in about an hour It was on the subject that pressed so heavily on her mind that Emily wished to speak to him yet she did not distinctly know what good purpose this could answer and sometimes she even recoiled in horror from the expectation of his presence She wished also to petition though she scarcely dared to believe the request would be granted that he would permit her since her aunt was no more to return to her native country As the moment of interview approached her agitation increased so much that she almost resolved to excuse herself under what could scarcely be called a pretence of illness and when she considered what could be said either concerning herself or the fate of her aunt she was equally hopeless as to the event of her entreaty and terrified as to its effect upon the vengeful spirit of Montoni Yet to pretend ignorance of her death appeared in some degree to be sharing its criminality and indeed this event was the only ground on which Emily could rest her petition for leaving Udolpho While her thoughts thus wavered a message was brought importing that Montoni could not see her till the next day and her spirits were then relieved for a moment from an almost intolerable weight of apprehension Annette said she fancied the Chevaliers were going out to the wars again for the court yard was filled with horses and she heard that the rest of the party who went out before were expected at the castle And I heard one of the soldiers too added she say to his comrade that he would warrant they d bring home a rare deal of booty So thinks I if the Signor can with a safe conscience send his people out a robbing why it is no business of mine I only wish I was once safe out of this castle and if it had not been for poor Ludovico s sake I would have let Count Morano s people run away with us both for it would have been serving you a good turn ma amselle as well as myself Annette might have continued thus talking for hours for any interruption she would have received from Emily who was silent inattentive absorbed in thought and passed the whole of this day in a kind of solemn tranquillity such as is often the result of faculties overstrained by suffering When night returned Emily recollected the mysterious strains of music that she had lately heard in which she still felt some degree of interest and of which she hoped to hear again the soothing sweetness The influence of superstition now gained on the weakness of her long harassed mind she looked with enthusiastic expectation to the guardian spirit of her father and having dismissed Annette for the night determined to watch alone for their return It was not yet however near the time when she had heard the music on a former night and anxious to call off her thoughts from distressing subjects she sat down with one of the few books that she had brought from France but her mind refusing controul became restless and agitated and she went often to the casement to listen for a sound Once she thought she heard a voice but then every thing without the casement remaining still she concluded that her fancy had deceived her Thus passed the time till twelve o clock soon after which the distant sounds that murmured through the castle ceased and sleep seemed to reign over all Emily then seated herself at the casement where she was soon recalled from the reverie into which she sunk by very unusual sounds not of music but like the low mourning of some person in distress As she listened her heart faltered in terror and she became convinced that the former sound was more than imaginary Still at intervals she heard a kind of feeble lamentation and sought to discover whence it came There were several rooms underneath adjoining the rampart which had been long shut up and as the sound probably rose from one of these she leaned from the casement to observe whether any light was visible there The chambers as far as she could perceive were quite dark but at a little distance on the rampart below she thought she saw something moving The faint twilight which the stars shed did not enable her to distinguish what it was but she judged it to be a sentinel on watch and she removed her light to a remote part of the chamber that she might escape notice during her further observation The same object still appeared Presently it advanced along the rampart towards her window and she then distinguished something like a human form but the silence with which it moved convinced her it was no sentinel As it drew near she hesitated whether to retire a thrilling curiosity inclined her to stay but a dread of she scarcely knew what warned her to withdraw While she paused the figure came opposite to her casement and was stationary Every thing remained quiet she had not heard even a foot fall and the solemnity of this silence with the mysterious form she saw subdued her spirits so that she was moving from the casement when on a sudden she observed the figure start away and glide down the rampart after which it was soon lost in the obscurity of night Emily continued to gaze for some time on the way it had passed and then retired within her chamber musing on this strange circumstance and scarcely doubting that she had witnessed a supernatural appearance When her spirits recovered composure she looked round for some other explanation Remembering what she had heard of the daring enterprises of Montoni it occurred to her that she had just seen some unhappy person who having been plundered by his banditti was brought hither a captive and that the music she had formerly heard came from him Yet if they had plundered him it still appeared improbable that they should have brought him to the castle and it was also more consistent with the manners of banditti to murder those they rob than to make them prisoners But what more than any other circumstance contradicted the supposition that it was a prisoner was that it wandered on the terrace without a guard a consideration which made her dismiss immediately her first surmise Afterwards she was inclined to believe that Count Morano had obtained admittance into the castle but she soon recollected the difficulties and dangers that must have opposed such an enterprise and that if he had so far succeeded to come alone and in silence to her casement at midnight was not the conduct he would have adopted particularly since the private stair case communicating with her apartment was known to him neither would he have uttered the dismal sounds she had heard Another suggestion represented that this might be some person who had designs upon the castle but the mournful sounds destroyed also that probability Thus enquiry only perplexed her Who or what it could be that haunted this lonely hour complaining in such doleful accents and in such sweet music for she was still inclined to believe that the former strains and the late appearance were connected she had no means of ascertaining and imagination again assumed her empire and roused the mysteries of superstition She determined however to watch on the following night when her doubts might perhaps be cleared up and she almost resolved to address the figure if it should appear again CHAPTER III Such are those thick and gloomy shadows damp Oft seen in charnel vaults and sepulchres Lingering and sitting by a new made grave MILTON On the following day Montoni sent a second excuse to Emily who was surprised at the circumstance This is very strange said she to herself His conscience tells him the purport of my visit and he defers it to avoid an explanation She now almost resolved to throw herself in his way but terror checked the intention and this day passed as the preceding one with Emily except that a degree of awful expectation concerning the approaching night now somewhat disturbed the dreadful calmness that had pervaded her mind Towards evening the second part of the band which had made the first excursion among the mountains returned to the castle where as they entered the courts Emily in her remote chamber heard their loud shouts and strains of exultation like the orgies of furies over some horrid sacrifice She even feared they were about to commit some barbarous deed a conjecture from which however Annette soon relieved her by telling that the people were only exulting over the plunder they had brought with them This circumstance still further confirmed her in the belief that Montoni had really commenced to be a captain of banditti and meant to retrieve his broken fortunes by the plunder of travellers Indeed when she considered all the circumstances of his situation in an armed and almost inaccessible castle retired far among the recesses of wild and solitary mountains along whose distant skirts were scattered towns and cities whither wealthy travellers were continually passing this appeared to be the situation of all others most suited for the success of schemes of rapine and she yielded to the strange thought that Montoni was become a captain of robbers His character also unprincipled dauntless cruel and enterprising seemed to fit him for the situation Delighting in the tumult and in the struggles of life he was equally a stranger to pity and to fear his very courage was a sort of animal ferocity not the noble impulse of a principle such as inspirits the mind against the oppressor in the cause of the oppressed but a constitutional hardiness of nerve that cannot feel and that therefore cannot fear Emily s supposition however natural was in part erroneous for she was a stranger to the state of this country and to the circumstances under which its frequent wars were partly conducted The revenues of the many states of Italy being at that time insufficient to the support of standing armies even during the short periods which the turbulent habits both of the governments and the people permitted to pass in peace an order of men arose not known in our age and but faintly described in the history of their own Of the soldiers disbanded at the end of every war few returned to the safe but unprofitable occupations then usual in peace Sometimes they passed into other countries and mingled with armies which still kept the field Sometimes they formed themselves into bands of robbers and occupied remote fortresses where their desperate character the weakness of the governments which they offended and the certainty that they could be recalled to the armies when their presence should be again wanted prevented them from being much pursued by the civil power and sometimes they attached themselves to the fortunes of a popular chief by whom they were led into the service of any state which could settle with him the price of their valour From this latter practice arose their name CONDOTTIERI a term formidable all over Italy for a period which concluded in the earlier part of the seventeenth century but of which it is not so easy to ascertain the commencement Contests between the smaller states were then for the most part affairs of enterprize alone and the probabilities of success were estimated not from the skill but from the personal courage of the general and the soldiers The ability which was necessary to the conduct of tedious operations was little valued It was enough to know how a party might be led towards their enemies with the greatest secrecy or conducted from them in the compactest order The officer was to precipitate himself into a situation where but for his example the soldiers might not have ventured and as the opposed parties knew little of each other s strength the event of the day was frequently determined by the boldness of the first movements In such services the condottieri were eminent and in these where plunder always followed success their characters acquired a mixture of intrepidity and profligacy which awed even those whom they served When they were not thus engaged their chief had usually his own fortress in which or in its neighbourhood they enjoyed an irksome rest and though their wants were at one time partly supplied from the property of the inhabitants the lavish distribution of their plunder at others prevented them from being obnoxious and the peasants of such districts gradually shared the character of their warlike visitors The neighbouring governments sometimes professed but seldom endeavoured to suppress these military communities both because it was difficult to do so and because a disguised protection of them ensured for the service of their wars a body of men who could not otherwise be so cheaply maintained or so perfectly qualified The commanders sometimes even relied so far upon this policy of the several powers as to frequent their capitals and Montoni having met them in the gaming parties of Venice and Padua conceived a desire to emulate their characters before his ruined fortunes tempted him to adopt their practices It was for the arrangement of his present plan of life that the midnight councils were held at his mansion in Venice and at which Orsino and some other members of the present community then assisted with suggestions which they had since executed with the wreck of their fortunes On the return of night Emily resumed her station at the casement There was now a moon and as it rose over the tufted woods its yellow light served to shew the lonely terrace and the surrounding objects more distinctly than the twilight of the stars had done and promised Emily to assist her observations should the mysterious form return On this subject she again wavered in conjecture and hesitated whether to speak to the figure to which a strong and almost irresistible interest urged her but terror at intervals made her reluctant to do so If this is a person who has designs upon the castle said she my curiosity may prove fatal to me yet the mysterious music and the lamentations I heard must surely have proceeded from him if so he cannot be an enemy She then thought of her unfortunate aunt and shuddering with grief and horror the suggestions of imagination seized her mind with all the force of truth and she believed that the form she had seen was supernatural She trembled breathed with difficulty an icy coldness touched her cheeks and her fears for a while overcame her judgment Her resolution now forsook her and she determined if the figure should appear not to speak to it Thus the time passed as she sat at her casement awed by expectation and by the gloom and stillness of midnight for she saw obscurely in the moon light only the mountains and woods a cluster of towers that formed the west angle of the castle and the terrace below and heard no sound except now and then the lonely watch word passed by the centinels on duty and afterwards the steps of the men who came to relieve guard and whom she knew at a distance on the rampart by their pikes that glittered in the moonbeam and then by the few short words in which they hailed their fellows of the night Emily retired within her chamber while they passed the casement When she returned to it all was again quiet It was now very late she was wearied with watching and began to doubt the reality of what she had seen on the preceding night but she still lingered at the window for her mind was too perturbed to admit of sleep The moon shone with a clear lustre that afforded her a complete view of the terrace but she saw only a solitary centinel pacing at one end of it and at length tired with expectation she withdrew to seek rest Such however was the impression left on her mind by the music and the complaining she had formerly heard as well as by the figure which she fancied she had seen that she determined to repeat the watch on the following night Montoni on the next day took no notice of Emily s appointed visit but she more anxious than before to see him sent Annette to enquire at what hour he would admit her He mentioned eleven o clock and Emily was punctual to the moment at which she called up all her fortitude to support the shock of his presence and the dreadful recollections it enforced He was with several of his officers in the cedar room on observing whom she paused and her agitation increased while he continued to converse with them apparently not observing her till some of his officers turning round saw Emily and uttered an exclamation She was hastily retiring when Montoni s voice arrested her and in a faultering accent she said I would speak with you Signor Montoni if you are at leisure These are my friends he replied whatever you would say they may hear Emily without replying turned from the rude gaze of the chevaliers and Montoni then followed her to the hall whence he led her to a small room of which he shut the door with violence As she looked on his dark countenance she again thought she saw the murderer of her aunt and her mind was so convulsed with horror that she had not power to recall thought enough to explain the purport of her visit and to trust herself with the mention of Madame Montoni was more than she dared Montoni at length impatiently enquired what she had to say I have no time for trifling he added my moments are important Emily then told him that she wished to return to France and came to beg that he would permit her to do so But when he looked surprised and enquired for the motive of the request she hesitated became paler than before trembled and had nearly sunk at his feet He observed her emotion with apparent indifference and interrupted the silence by telling her he must be gone Emily however recalled her spirits sufficiently to enable her to repeat her request And when Montoni absolutely refused it her slumbering mind was roused I can no longer remain here with propriety sir said she and I may be allowed to ask by what right you detain me It is my will that you remain here said Montoni laying his hand on the door to go let that suffice you Emily considering that she had no appeal from this will forbore to dispute his right and made a feeble effort to persuade him to be just While my aunt lived sir said she in a tremulous voice my residence here was not improper but now that she is no more I may surely be permitted to depart My stay cannot benefit you sir and will only distress me Who told you that Madame Montoni was dead said Montoni with an inquisitive eye Emily hesitated for nobody had told her so and she did not dare to avow the having seen that spectacle in the portal chamber which had compelled her to the belief Who told you so he repeated more sternly Alas I know it too well replied Emily spare me on this terrible subject She sat down on a bench to support herself If you wish to see her said Montoni you may she lies in the east turret He now left the room without awaiting her reply and returned to the cedar chamber where such of the chevaliers as had not before seen Emily began to rally him on the discovery they had made but Montoni did not appear disposed to bear this mirth and they changed the subject Having talked with the subtle Orsino on the plan of an excursion which he meditated for a future day his friend advised that they should lie in wait for the enemy which Verezzi impetuously opposed reproached Orsino with want of spirit and swore that if Montoni would let him lead on fifty men he would conquer all that should oppose him Orsino smiled contemptuously Montoni smiled too but he also listened Verezzi then proceeded with vehement declamation and assertion till he was stopped by an argument of Orsino which he knew not how to answer better than by invective His fierce spirit detested the cunning caution of Orsino whom he constantly opposed and whose inveterate though silent hatred he had long ago incurred And Montoni was a calm observer of both whose different qualifications he knew and how to bend their opposite character to the perfection of his own designs But Verezzi in the heat of opposition now did not scruple to accuse Orsino of cowardice at which the countenance of the latter while he made no reply was overspread with a livid paleness and Montoni who watched his lurking eye saw him put his hand hastily into his bosom But Verezzi whose face glowing with crimson formed a striking contrast to the complexion of Orsino remarked not the action and continued boldly declaiming against cowards to Cavigni who was slily laughing at his vehemence and at the silent mortification of Orsino when the latter retiring a few steps behind drew forth a stilletto to stab his adversary in the back Montoni arrested his half extended arm and with a significant look made him return the poinard into his bosom unseen by all except himself for most of the party were disputing at a distant window on the situation of a dell where they meant to form an ambuscade When Verezzi had turned round the deadly hatred expressed on the features of his opponent raising for the first time a suspicion of his intention he laid his hand on his sword and then seeming to recollect himself strode up to Montoni Signor said he with a significant look at Orsino we are not a band of assassins if you have business for brave men employ me on this expedition you shall have the last drop of my blood if you have only work for cowards keep him pointing to Orsino and let me quit Udolpho Orsino still more incensed again drew forth his stilletto and rushed towards Verezzi who at the same instant advanced with his sword when Montoni and the rest of the party interfered and separated them This is the conduct of a boy said Montoni to Verezzi not of a man be more moderate in your speech Moderation is the virtue of cowards retorted Verezzi they are moderate in every thing but in fear I accept your words said Montoni turning upon him with a fierce and haughty look and drawing his sword out of the scabbard With all my heart cried Verezzi though I did not mean them for you He directed a pass at Montoni and while they fought the villain Orsino made another attempt to stab Verezzi and was again prevented The combatants were at length separated and after a very long and violent dispute reconciled Montoni then left the room with Orsino whom he detained in private consultation for a considerable time Emily meanwhile stunned by the last words of Montoni forgot for the moment his declaration that she should continue in the castle while she thought of her unfortunate aunt who he had said was laid in the east turret In suffering the remains of his wife to lie thus long unburied there appeared a degree of brutality more shocking than she had suspected even Montoni could practise After a long struggle she determined to accept his permission to visit the turret and to take a last look of her ill fated aunt with which design she returned to her chamber and while she waited for Annette to accompany her endeavoured to acquire fortitude sufficient to support her through the approaching scene for though she trembled to encounter it she knew that to remember the performance of this last act of duty would hereafter afford her consoling satisfaction Annette came and Emily mentioned her purpose from which the former endeavoured to dissuade her though without effect and Annette was with much difficulty prevailed upon to accompany her to the turret but no consideration could make her promise to enter the chamber of death They now left the corridor and having reached the foot of the stair case which Emily had formerly ascended Annette declared she would go no further and Emily proceeded alone When she saw the track of blood which she had before observed her spirits fainted and being compelled to rest on the stairs she almost determined to proceed no further The pause of a few moments restored her resolution and she went on As she drew near the landing place upon which the upper chamber opened she remembered that the door was formerly fastened and apprehended that it might still be so In this expectation however she was mistaken for the door opened at once into a dusky and silent chamber round which she fearfully looked and then slowly advanced when a hollow voice spoke Emily who was unable to speak or to move from the spot uttered no sound of terror The voice spoke again and then thinking that it resembled that of Madame Montoni Emily s spirits were instantly roused she rushed towards a bed that stood in a remote part of the room and drew aside the curtains Within appeared a pale and emaciated face She started back then again advanced shuddered as she took up the skeleton hand that lay stretched upon the quilt then let it drop and then viewed the face with a long unsettled gaze It was that of Madame Montoni though so changed by illness that the resemblance of what it had been could scarcely be traced in what it now appeared She was still alive and raising her heavy eyes she turned them on her niece Where have you been so long said she in the same tone I thought you had forsaken me Do you indeed live said Emily at length or is this but a terrible apparition she received no answer and again she snatched up the hand This is substance she exclaimed but it is cold cold as marble She let it fall O if you really live speak said Emily in a voice of desperation that I may not lose my senses say you know me I do live replied Madame Montoni but I feel that I am about to die Emily clasped the hand she held more eagerly and groaned They were both silent for some moments Then Emily endeavoured to soothe her and enquired what had reduced her to this present deplorable state Montoni when he removed her to the turret under the improbable suspicion of having attempted his life had ordered the men employed on the occasion to observe a strict secrecy concerning her To this he was influenced by a double motive He meant to debar her from the comfort of Emily s visits and to secure an opportunity of privately dispatching her should any new circumstances occur to confirm the present suggestions of his suspecting mind His consciousness of the hatred he deserved it was natural enough should at first led him to attribute to her the attempt that had been made upon his life and though there was no other reason to believe that she was concerned in that atrocious design his suspicions remained he continued to confine her in the turret under a strict guard and without pity or remorse had suffered her to lie forlorn and neglected under a raging fever till it had reduced her to the present state The track of blood which Emily had seen on the stairs had flowed from the unbound wound of one of the men employed to carry Madame Montoni and which he had received in the late affray At night these men having contented themselves with securing the door of their prisoner s room had retired from guard and then it was that Emily at the time of her first enquiry had found the turret so silent and deserted When she had attempted to open the door of the chamber her aunt was sleeping and this occasioned the silence which had contributed to delude her into a belief that she was no more yet had her terror permitted her to persevere longer in the call she would probably have awakened Madame Montoni and have been spared much suffering The spectacle in the portal chamber which afterwards confirmed Emily s horrible suspicion was the corpse of a man who had fallen in the affray and the same which had been borne into the servants hall where she took refuge from the tumult This man had lingered under his wounds for some days and soon after his death his body had been removed on the couch on which he died for interment in the vault beneath the chapel through which Emily and Barnardine had passed to the chamber Emily after asking Madame Montoni a thousand questions concerning herself left her and sought Montoni for the more solemn interest she felt for her aunt made her now regardless of the resentment her remonstrances might draw upon herself and of the improbability of his granting what she meant to entreat Madame Montoni is now dying sir said Emily as soon as she saw him Your resentment surely will not pursue her to the last moment Suffer her to be removed from that forlorn room to her own apartment and to have necessary comforts administered Of what service will that be if she is dying said Montoni with apparent indifference The service at leave of saving you sir from a few of those pangs of conscience you must suffer when you shall be in the same situation said Emily with imprudent indignation of which Montoni soon made her sensible by commanding her to quit his presence Then forgetting her resentment and impressed only by compassion for the piteous state of her aunt dying without succour she submitted to humble herself to Montoni and to adopt every persuasive means that might induce him to relent towards his wife For a considerable time he was proof against all she said and all she looked but at length the divinity of pity beaming in Emily s eyes seemed to touch his heart He turned away ashamed of his better feelings half sullen and half relenting but finally consented that his wife should be removed to her own apartment and that Emily should attend her Dreading equally that this relief might arrive too late and that Montoni might retract his concession Emily scarcely staid to thank him for it but assisted by Annette she quickly prepared Madame Montoni s bed and they carried her a cordial that might enable her feeble frame to sustain the fatigue of a removal Madame was scarcely arrived in her own apartment when an order was given by her husband that she should remain in the turret but Emily thankful that she had made such dispatch hastened to inform him of it as well as that a second removal would instantly prove fatal and he suffered his wife to continue where she was During this day Emily never left Madame Montoni except to prepare such little nourishing things as she judged necessary to sustain her and which Madame Montoni received with quiet acquiescence though she seemed sensible that they could not save her from approaching dissolution and scarcely appeared to wish for life Emily meanwhile watched over her with the most tender solicitude no longer seeing her imperious aunt in the poor object before her but the sister of her late beloved father in a situation that called for all her compassion and kindness When night came she determined to sit up with her aunt but this the latter positively forbade commanding her to retire to rest and Annette alone to remain in her chamber Rest was indeed necessary to Emily whose spirits and frame were equally wearied by the occurrences and exertions of the day but she would not leave Madame Montoni till after the turn of midnight a period then thought so critical by the physicians Soon after twelve having enjoined Annette to be wakeful and to call her should any change appear for the worse Emily sorrowfully bade Madame Montoni good night and withdrew to her chamber Her spirits were more than usually depressed by the piteous condition of her aunt whose recovery she scarcely dared to expect To her own misfortunes she saw no period inclosed as she was in a remote castle beyond the reach of any friends had she possessed such and beyond the pity even of strangers while she knew herself to be in the power of a man capable of any action which his interest or his ambition might suggest Occupied by melancholy reflections and by anticipations as sad she did not retire immediately to rest but leaned thoughtfully on her open casement The scene before her of woods and mountains reposing in the moon light formed a regretted contrast with the state of her mind but the lonely murmur of these woods and the view of this sleeping landscape gradually soothed her emotions and softened her to tears She continued to weep for some time lost to every thing but to a gentle sense of her misfortunes When she at length took the handkerchief from her eyes she perceived before her on the terrace below the figure she had formerly observed which stood fixed and silent immediately opposite to her casement On perceiving it she started back and terror for some time overcame curiosity at length she returned to the casement and still the figure was before it which she now compelled herself to observe but was utterly unable to speak as she had formerly intended The moon shone with a clear light and it was perhaps the agitation of her mind that prevented her distinguishing with any degree of accuracy the form before her It was still stationary and she began to doubt whether it was really animated Her scattered thoughts were now so far returned as to remind her that her light exposed her to dangerous observation and she was stepping back to remove it when she perceived the figure move and then wave what seemed to be its arm as if to beckon her and while she gazed fixed in fear it repeated the action She now attempted to speak but the words died on her lips and she went from the casement to remove her light as she was doing which she heard from without a faint groan Listening but not daring to return she presently heard it repeated Good God what can this mean said she Again she listened but the sound came no more and after a long interval of silence she recovered courage enough to go to the casement when she again saw the same appearance It beckoned again and again uttered a low sound That groan was surely human said she I WILL speak Who is it cried Emily in a faint voice that wanders at this late hour The figure raised its head but suddenly started away and glided down the terrace She watched it for a long while passing swiftly in the moon light but heard no footstep till a sentinel from the other extremity of the rampart walked slowly along The man stopped under her window and looking up called her by name She was retiring precipitately but a second summons inducing her to reply the soldier then respectfully asked if she had seen any thing pass On her answering that she had he said no more but walked away down the terrace Emily following him with her eyes till he was lost in the distance But as he was on guard she knew he could not go beyond the rampart and therefore resolved to await his return Soon after his voice was heard at a distance calling loudly and then a voice still more distant answered and in the next moment the watch word was given and passed along the terrace As the soldiers moved hastily under the casement she called to enquire what had happened but they passed without regarding her Emily s thoughts returning to the figure she had seen It cannot be a person who has designs upon the castle said she such an one would conduct himself very differently He would not venture where sentinels were on watch nor fix himself opposite to a window where he perceived he must be observed much less would he beckon or utter a sound of complaint Yet it cannot be a prisoner for how could he obtain the opportunity to wander thus If she had been subject to vanity she might have supposed this figure to be some inhabitant of the castle who wandered under her casement in the hope of seeing her and of being allowed to declare his admiration but this opinion never occurred to Emily and if it had she would have dismissed it as improbable on considering that when the opportunity of speaking had occurred it had been suffered to pass in silence and that even at the moment in which she had spoken the form had abruptly quitted the place While she mused two sentinels walked up the rampart in earnest conversation of which she caught a few words and learned from these that one of their comrades had fallen down senseless Soon after three other soldiers appeared slowly advancing from the bottom of the terrace but she heard only a low voice that came at intervals As they drew near she perceived this to be the voice of him who walked in the middle apparently supported by his comrades and she again called to them enquiring what had happened At the sound of her voice they stopped and looked up while she repeated her question and was told that Roberto their fellow of the watch had been seized with a fit and that his cry as he fell had caused a false alarm Is he subject to fits said Emily Yes Signora replied Roberto but if I had not what I saw was enough to have frightened the Pope himself What was it enquired Emily trembling I cannot tell what it was lady or what I saw or how it vanished replied the soldier who seemed to shudder at the recollection Was it the person whom you followed down the rampart that has occasioned you this alarm said Emily endeavouring to conceal her own Person exclaimed the man it was the devil and this is not the first time I have seen him Nor will it be the last observed one of his comrades laughing No no I warrant not said another Well rejoined Roberto you may be as merry now as you please you was none so jocose the other night Sebastian when you was on watch with Launcelot Launcelot need not talk of that replied Sebastian let him remember how he stood trembling and unable to give the WORD till the man was gone If the man had not come so silently upon us I would have seized him and soon made him tell who he was What man enquired Emily It was no man lady said Launcelot who stood by but the devil himself as my comrade says What man who does not live in the castle could get within the walls at midnight Why I might just as well pretend to march to Venice and get among all the Senators when they are counselling and I warrant I should have more chance of getting out again alive than any fellow that we should catch within the gates after dark So I think I have proved plainly enough that this can be nobody that lives out of the castle and now I will prove that it can be nobody that lives in the castle for if he did why should he be afraid to be seen So after this I hope nobody will pretend to tell me it was anybody No I say again by holy Pope it was the devil and Sebastian there knows this is not the first time we have seen him When did you see the figure then before said Emily half smiling who though she thought the conversation somewhat too much felt an interest which would not permit her to conclude it About a week ago lady said Sebastian taking up the story And where On the rampart lady higher up Did you pursue it that it fled No Signora Launcelot and I were on watch together and every thing was so still you might have heard a mouse stir when suddenly Launcelot says Sebastian do you see nothing I turned my head a little to the left as it might be thus No says I Hush said Launcelot look yonder just by the last cannon on the rampart I looked and then thought I did see something move but there being no light but what the stars gave I could not be certain We stood quite silent to watch it and presently saw something pass along the castle wall just opposite to us Why did you not seize it then cried a soldier who had scarcely spoken till now Aye why did you not seize it said Roberto You should have been there to have done that replied Sebastian You would have been bold enough to have taken it by the throat though it had been the devil himself we could not take such a liberty perhaps because we are not so well acquainted with him as you are But as I was saying it stole by us so quickly that we had not time to get rid of our surprise before it was gone Then we knew it was in vain to follow We kept constant watch all that night but we saw it no more Next morning we told some of our comrades who were on duty on other parts of the ramparts what we had seen but they had seen nothing and laughed at us and it was not till to night that the same figure walked again Where did you lose it friend said Emily to Roberto When I left you lady replied the man you might see me go down the rampart but it was not till I reached the east terrace that I saw any thing Then the moon shining bright I saw something like a shadow flitting before me as it were at some distance I stopped when I turned the corner of the east tower where I had seen this figure not a moment before but it was gone As I stood looking through the old arch which leads to the east rampart and where I am sure it had passed I heard all of a sudden such a sound it was not like a groan or a cry or a shout or any thing I ever heard in my life I heard it only once and that was enough for me for I know nothing that happened after till I found my comrades here about me Come said Sebastian let us go to our posts the moon is setting Good night lady Aye let us go rejoined Roberto Good night lady Good night the holy mother guard you said Emily as she closed her casement and retired to reflect upon the strange circumstance that had just occurred connecting which with what had happened on former nights she endeavoured to derive from the whole something more positive than conjecture But her imagination was inflamed while her judgment was not enlightened and the terrors of superstition again pervaded her mind CHAPTER IV There is one within Besides the things that we have heard and seen Recounts most horrid sights seen by the watch JULIUS CAESAR In the morning Emily found Madame Montoni nearly in the same condition as on the preceding night she had slept little and that little had not refreshed her she smiled on her niece and seemed cheered by her presence but spoke only a few words and never named Montoni who however soon after entered the room His wife when she understood that he was there appeared much agitated but was entirely silent till Emily rose from a chair at the bed side when she begged in a feeble voice that she would not leave her The visit of Montoni was not to sooth his wife whom he knew to be dying or to console or to ask her forgiveness but to make a last effort to procure that signature which would transfer her estates in Languedoc after her death to him rather than to Emily This was a scene that exhibited on his part his usual inhumanity and on that of Madame Montoni a persevering spirit contending with a feeble frame while Emily repeatedly declared to him her willingness to resign all claim to those estates rather than that the last hours of her aunt should be disturbed by contention Montoni however did not leave the room till his wife exhausted by the obstinate dispute had fainted and she lay so long insensible that Emily began to fear that the spark of life was extinguished 
957_132568_000006_000003	train-clean-360	At length she revived and looking feebly up at her niece whose tears were falling over her made an effort to speak but her words were unintelligible and Emily again apprehended she was dying 
957_132568_000006_000004	train-clean-360	Afterwards however she recovered her speech and being somewhat restored by a cordial conversed for a considerable time on the subject of her estates in France with clearness and precision 
none	none	She directed her niece where to find some papers relative to them which she had hitherto concealed from the search of Montoni and earnestly charged her never to suffer these papers to escape her Soon after this conversation Madame Montoni sunk into a dose and continued slumbering till evening when she seemed better than she had been since her removal from the turret Emily never left her for a moment till long after midnight and even then would not have quitted the room had not her aunt entreated that she would retire to rest She then obeyed the more willingly because her patient appeared somewhat recruited by sleep and giving Annette the same injunction as on the preceding night she withdrew to her own apartment 
957_132568_000007_000003	train-clean-360	But her spirits were wakeful and agitated and finding it impossible to sleep she determined to watch once more for the mysterious appearance that had so much interested and alarmed her 
none	none	It was now the second watch of the night and about the time when the figure had before appeared Emily heard the passing steps of the sentinels on the rampart as they changed guard and when all was again silent she took her station at the casement leaving her lamp in a remote part of the chamber that she might escape notice from without The moon gave a faint and uncertain light for heavy vapours surrounded it and often rolling over the disk left the scene below in total darkness 
957_132568_000008_000002	train-clean-360	It was in one of these moments of obscurity that she observed a small and lambent flame moving at some distance on the terrace 
957_132568_000008_000003	train-clean-360	While she gazed it disappeared and the moon again emerging from the lurid and heavy thunder clouds she turned her attention to the heavens where the vivid lightnings darted from cloud to cloud and flashed silently on the woods below 
none	none	She loved to catch in the momentary gleam the gloomy landscape Sometimes a cloud opened its light upon a distant mountain and while the sudden splendour illumined all its recesses of rock and wood the rest of the scene remained in deep shadow at others partial features of the castle were revealed by the glimpse the antient arch leading to the east rampart the turret above or the fortifications beyond and then perhaps the whole edifice with all its towers its dark massy walls and pointed casements would appear and vanish in an instant 
957_132568_000009_000000	train-clean-360	Emily looking again upon the rampart perceived the flame she had seen before it moved onward and soon after she thought she heard a footstep 
957_132568_000009_000001	train-clean-360	The light appeared and disappeared frequently while as she watched it glided under her casements and at the same instant she was certain that a footstep passed but the darkness did not permit her to distinguish any object except the flame 
957_132568_000009_000002	train-clean-360	It moved away and then by a gleam of lightning she perceived some person on the terrace 
none	none	All the anxieties of the preceding night returned 
957_132568_000009_000004	train-clean-360	This person advanced and the playing flame alternately appeared and vanished 
957_132568_000009_000005	train-clean-360	Emily wished to speak to end her doubts whether this figure were human or supernatural but her courage failed as often as she attempted utterance till the light moved again under the casement and she faintly demanded who passed 
none	none	A friend replied a voice What friend said Emily somewhat encouraged who are you and what is that light you carry I am Anthonio one of the Signor s soldiers replied the voice And what is that tapering light you bear said Emily see how it darts upwards and now it vanishes
957_132568_000014_000000	train-clean-360	 This light lady said the soldier has appeared to night as you see it on the point of my lance ever since I have been on watch but what it means I cannot tell 
none	none	This is very strange said Emily My fellow guard continued the man has the same flame on his arms he says he has sometimes seen it before I never did I am but lately come to the castle for I have not been long a soldier
957_132568_000017_000000	train-clean-360	 How does your comrade account for it said Emily 
none	none	He says it is an omen lady and bodes no good
957_132568_000019_000000	train-clean-360	 And what harm can it bode rejoined Emily 
957_132568_000020_000000	train-clean-360	 He knows not so much as that lady 
none	none	Whether Emily was alarmed by this omen or not she certainly was relieved from much terror by discovering this man to be only a soldier on duty and it immediately occurred to her that it might be he who had occasioned so much alarm on the preceding night There were however some circumstances that still required explanation As far as she could judge by the faint moon light that had assisted her observation the figure she had seen did not resemble this man either in shape or size besides she was certain it had carried no arms The silence of its steps if steps it had the moaning sounds too which it had uttered and its strange disappearance were circumstances of mysterious import that did not apply with probability to a soldier engaged in the duty of his guard She now enquired of the sentinel whether he had seen any person besides his fellow watch walking on the terrace about midnight and then briefly related what she had herself observed I was not on guard that night lady replied the man but I heard of what happened 
957_132568_000023_000001	train-clean-360	There are amongst us who believe strange things 
957_132568_000023_000002	train-clean-360	Strange stories too have long been told of this castle but it is no business of mine to repeat them and for my part I have no reason to complain our Chief does nobly by us 
none	none	I commend your prudence said Emily Good night and accept this from me she added throwing him a small piece of coin and then closing the casement to put an end to the discourse 
957_132568_000025_000000	train-clean-360	When he was gone she opened it again listened with a gloomy pleasure to the distant thunder that began to murmur among the mountains and watched the arrowy lightnings which broke over the remoter scene 
957_132568_000025_000001	train-clean-360	The pealing thunder rolled onward and then reverbed by the mountains other thunder seemed to answer from the opposite horizon while the accumulating clouds entirely concealing the moon assumed a red sulphureous tinge that foretold a violent storm 
none	none	Emily remained at her casement till the vivid lightning that now every instant revealed the wide horizon and the landscape below made it no longer safe to do so and she went to her couch but unable to compose her mind to sleep still listened in silent awe to the tremendous sounds that seemed to shake the castle to its foundation 
957_132568_000027_000000	train-clean-360	She had continued thus for a considerable time when amidst the uproar of the storm she thought she heard a voice and raising herself to listen saw the chamber door open and Annette enter with a countenance of wild affright 
none	none	She is dying ma amselle my lady is dying said she Emily started up and ran to Madame Montoni s room 
957_132568_000029_000001	train-clean-360	When she entered her aunt appeared to have fainted for she was quite still and insensible and Emily with a strength of mind that refused to yield to grief while any duty required her activity applied every means that seemed likely to restore her 
none	none	But the last struggle was over she was gone for ever 
957_132568_000030_000000	train-clean-360	When Emily perceived that all her efforts were ineffectual she interrogated the terrified Annette and learned that Madame Montoni had fallen into a doze soon after Emily s departure in which she had continued until a few minutes before her death 
none	none	I wondered ma amselle said Annette what was the reason my lady did not seem frightened at the thunder when I was so terrified and I went often to the bed to speak to her but she appeared to be asleep till presently I heard a strange noise and on going to her saw she was dying 
957_132568_000032_000000	train-clean-360	Emily at this recital shed tears 
957_132568_000032_000001	train-clean-360	She had no doubt but that the violent change in the air which the tempest produced had effected this fatal one on the exhausted frame of Madame Montoni 
none	none	After some deliberation she determined that Montoni should not be informed of this event till the morning for she considered that he might perhaps utter some inhuman expressions such as in the present temper of her spirits she could not bear 
957_132568_000033_000001	train-clean-360	With Annette alone therefore whom she encouraged by her own example she performed some of the last solemn offices for the dead and compelled herself to watch during the night by the body of her deceased aunt 
none	none	During this solemn period rendered more awful by the tremendous storm that shook the air she frequently addressed herself to Heaven for support and protection and her pious prayers we may believe were accepted of the God that giveth comfort CHAPTER V The midnight clock has toll d and hark the bell Of Death beats slow heard ye the note profound It pauses now and now with rising knell Flings to the hollow gale its sullen sound MASON When Montoni was informed of the death of his wife and considered that she had died without giving him the signature so necessary to the accomplishment of his wishes no sense of decency restrained the expression of his resentment Emily anxiously avoided his presence and watched during two days and two nights with little intermission by the corpse of her late aunt Her mind deeply impressed with the unhappy fate of this object she forgot all her faults her unjust and imperious conduct to herself and remembering only her sufferings thought of her only with tender compassion Sometimes however she could not avoid musing upon the strange infatuation that had proved so fatal to her aunt and had involved herself in a labyrinth of misfortune from which she saw no means of escaping the marriage with Montoni But when she considered this circumstance it was more in sorrow than in anger more for the purpose of indulging lamentation than reproach In her pious cares she was not disturbed by Montoni who not only avoided the chamber where the remains of his wife were laid but that part of the castle adjoining to it as if he had apprehended a contagion in death He seemed to have given no orders respecting the funeral and Emily began to fear he meant to offer a new insult to the memory of Madame Montoni but from this apprehension she was relieved when on the evening of the second day Annette informed her that the interment was to take place that night She knew that Montoni would not attend and it was so very grievous to her to think that the remains of her unfortunate aunt would pass to the grave without one relative or friend to pay them the last decent rites that she determined to be deterred by no considerations for herself from observing this duty She would otherwise have shrunk from the circumstance of following them to the cold vault to which they were to be carried by men whose air and countenances seemed to stamp them for murderers at the midnight hour of silence and privacy which Montoni had chosen for committing if possible to oblivion the reliques of a woman whom his harsh conduct had at least contributed to destroy Emily shuddering with emotions of horror and grief assisted by Annette prepared the corpse for interment and having wrapt it in cerements and covered it with a winding sheet they watched beside it till past midnight when they heard the approaching footsteps of the men who were to lay it in its earthy bed It was with difficulty that Emily overcame her emotion when the door of the chamber being thrown open their gloomy countenances were seen by the glare of the torch they carried and two of them without speaking lifted the body on their shoulders while the third preceding them with the light descended through the castle towards the grave which was in the lower vault of the chapel within the castle walls They had to cross two courts towards the east wing of the castle which adjoining the chapel was like it in ruins but the silence and gloom of these courts had now little power over Emily s mind occupied as it was with more mournful ideas and she scarcely heard the low and dismal hooting of the night birds that roosted among the ivyed battlements of the ruin or perceived the still flittings of the bat which frequently crossed her way But when having entered the chapel and passed between the mouldering pillars of the aisles the bearers stopped at a flight of steps that led down to a low arched door and their comrade having descended to unlock it she saw imperfectly the gloomy abyss beyond saw the corpse of her aunt carried down these steps and the ruffian like figure that stood with a torch at the bottom to receive it all her fortitude was lost in emotions of inexpressible grief and terror She turned to lean upon Annette who was cold and trembling like herself and she lingered so long on the summit of the flight that the gleam of the torch began to die away on the pillars of the chapel and the men were almost beyond her view Then the gloom around her awakening other fears and a sense of what she considered to be her duty overcoming her reluctance she descended to the vaults following the echo of footsteps and the faint ray that pierced the darkness till the harsh grating of a distant door that was opened to receive the corpse again appalled her After the pause of a moment she went on and as she entered the vaults saw between the arches at some distance the men lay down the body near the edge of an open grave where stood another of Montoni s men and a priest whom she did not observe till he began the burial service then lifting her eyes from the ground she saw the venerable figure of the friar and heard him in a low voice equally solemn and affecting perform the service for the dead At the moment in which they let down the body into the earth the scene was such as only the dark pencil of a Domenichino perhaps could have done justice to The fierce features and wild dress of the condottieri bending with their torches over the grave into which the corpse was descending were contrasted by the venerable figure of the monk wrapt in long black garments his cowl thrown back from his pale face on which the light gleaming strongly shewed the lines of affliction softened by piety and the few grey locks which time had spared on his temples while beside him stood the softer form of Emily who leaned for support upon Annette her face half averted and shaded by a thin veil that fell over her figure and her mild and beautiful countenance fixed in grief so solemn as admitted not of tears while she thus saw committed untimely to the earth her last relative and friend The gleams thrown between the arches of the vaults where here and there the broken ground marked the spots in which other bodies had been recently interred and the general obscurity beyond were circumstances that alone would have led on the imagination of a spectator to scenes more horrible than even that which was pictured at the grave of the misguided and unfortunate Madame Montoni When the service was over the friar regarded Emily with attention and surprise and looked as if he wished to speak to her but was restrained by the presence of the condottieri who as they now led the way to the courts amused themselves with jokes upon his holy order which he endured in silence demanding only to be conducted safely to his convent and to which Emily listened with concern and even horror When they reached the court the monk gave her his blessing and after a lingering look of pity turned away to the portal whither one of the men carried a torch while Annette lighting another preceded Emily to her apartment The appearance of the friar and the expression of tender compassion with which he had regarded her had interested Emily who though it was at her earnest supplication that Montoni had consented to allow a priest to perform the last rites for his deceased wife knew nothing concerning this person till Annette now informed her that he belonged to a monastery situated among the mountains at a few miles distance The Superior who regarded Montoni and his associates not only with aversion but with terror had probably feared to offend him by refusing his request and had therefore ordered a monk to officiate at the funeral who with the meek spirit of a christian had overcome his reluctance to enter the walls of such a castle by the wish of performing what he considered to be his duty and as the chapel was built on consecrated ground had not objected to commit to it the remains of the late unhappy Madame Montoni Several days passed with Emily in total seclusion and in a state of mind partaking both of terror for herself and grief for the departed She at length determined to make other efforts to persuade Montoni to permit her return to France Why he should wish to detain her she could scarcely dare to conjecture but it was too certain that he did so and the absolute refusal he had formerly given to her departure allowed her little hope that he would now consent to it But the horror which his presence inspired made her defer from day to day the mention of this subject and at last she was awakened from her inactivity only by a message from him desiring her attendance at a certain hour She began to hope he meant to resign now that her aunt was no more the authority he had usurped over her till she recollected that the estates which had occasioned so much contention were now hers and she then feared Montoni was about to employ some stratagem for obtaining them and that he would detain her his prisoner till he succeeded This thought instead of overcoming her with despondency roused all the latent powers of her fortitude into action and the property which she would willingly have resigned to secure the peace of her aunt she resolved that no common sufferings of her own should ever compel her to give to Montoni For Valancourt s sake also she determined to preserve these estates since they would afford that competency by which she hoped to secure the comfort of their future lives As she thought of this she indulged the tenderness of tears and anticipated the delight of that moment when with affectionate generosity she might tell him they were his own She saw the smile that lighted up his features the affectionate regard which spoke at once his joy and thanks and at this instant she believed she could brave any suffering which the evil spirit of Montoni might be preparing for her Remembering then for the first time since her aunt s death the papers relative to the estates in question she determined to search for them as soon as her interview with Montoni was over With these resolutions she met him at the appointed time and waited to hear his intention before she renewed her request With him were Orsino and another officer and both were standing near a table covered with papers which he appeared to be examining I sent for you Emily said Montoni raising his head that you might be a witness in some business which I am transacting with my friend Orsino All that is required of you will be to sign your name to this paper he then took one up hurried unintelligibly over some lines and laying it before her on the table offered her a pen She took it and was going to write when the design of Montoni came upon her mind like a flash of lightning she trembled let the pen fall and refused to sign what she had not read Montoni affected to laugh at her scruples and taking up the paper again pretended to read but Emily who still trembled on perceiving her danger and was astonished that her own credulity had so nearly betrayed her positively refused to sign any paper whatever Montoni for some time persevered in affecting to ridicule this refusal but when he perceived by her steady perseverance that she understood his design he changed his manner and bade her follow him to another room There he told her that he had been willing to spare himself and her the trouble of useless contest in an affair where his will was justice and where she should find it law and had therefore endeavoured to persuade rather than to compel her to the practice of her duty I as the husband of the late Signora Montoni he added am the heir of all she possessed the estates therefore which she refused to me in her life time can no longer be withheld and for your own sake I would undeceive you respecting a foolish assertion she once made to you in my hearing that these estates would be yours if she died without resigning them to me She knew at that moment she had no power to withhold them from me after her decease and I think you have more sense than to provoke my resentment by advancing an unjust claim I am not in the habit of flattering and you will therefore receive as sincere the praise I bestow when I say that you possess an understanding superior to that of your sex and that you have none of those contemptible foibles that frequently mark the female character such as avarice and the love of power which latter makes women delight to contradict and to tease when they cannot conquer If I understand your disposition and your mind you hold in sovereign contempt these common failings of your sex Montoni paused and Emily remained silent and expecting for she knew him too well to believe he would condescend to such flattery unless he thought it would promote his own interest and though he had forborne to name vanity among the foibles of women it was evident that he considered it to be a predominant one since he designed to sacrifice to hers the character and understanding of her whole sex Judging as I do resumed Montoni I cannot believe you will oppose where you know you cannot conquer or indeed that you would wish to conquer or be avaricious of any property when you have not justice on your side I think it proper however to acquaint you with the alternative If you have a just opinion of the subject in question you shall be allowed a safe conveyance to France within a short period but if you are so unhappy as to be misled by the late assertion of the Signora you shall remain my prisoner till you are convinced of your error Emily calmly said I am not so ignorant Signor of the laws on this subject as to be misled by the assertion of any person The law in the present instance gives me the estates in question and my own hand shall never betray my right I have been mistaken in my opinion of you it appears rejoined Montoni sternly You speak boldly and presumptuously upon a subject which you do not understand For once I am willing to pardon the conceit of ignorance the weakness of your sex too from which it seems you are not exempt claims some allowance but if you persist in this strain you have every thing to fear from my justice From your justice Signor rejoined Emily I have nothing to fear I have only to hope Montoni looked at her with vexation and seemed considering what to say I find that you are weak enough he resumed to credit the idle assertion I alluded to For your own sake I lament this as to me it is of little consequence Your credulity can punish only yourself and I must pity the weakness of mind which leads you to so much suffering as you are compelling me to prepare for you You may find perhaps Signor said Emily with mild dignity that the strength of my mind is equal to the justice of my cause and that I can endure with fortitude when it is in resistance of oppression You speak like a heroine said Montoni contemptuously we shall see whether you can suffer like one Emily was silent and he left the room Recollecting that it was for Valancourt s sake she had thus resisted she now smiled complacently upon the threatened sufferings and retired to the spot which her aunt had pointed out as the repository of the papers relative to the estates where she found them as described and since she knew of no better place of concealment than this returned them without examining their contents being fearful of discovery while she should attempt a perusal To her own solitary chamber she once more returned and there thought again of the late conversation with Montoni and of the evil she might expect from opposition to his will But his power did not appear so terrible to her imagination as it was wont to do a sacred pride was in her heart that taught it to swell against the pressure of injustice and almost to glory in the quiet sufferance of ills in a cause which had also the interest of Valancourt for its object For the first time she felt the full extent of her own superiority to Montoni and despised the authority which till now she had only feared As she sat musing a peal of laughter rose from the terrace and on going to the casement she saw with inexpressible surprise three ladies dressed in the gala habit of Venice walking with several gentlemen below She gazed in an astonishment that made her remain at the window regardless of being observed till the group passed under it and one of the strangers looking up she perceived the features of Signora Livona with whose manners she had been so much charmed the day after her arrival at Venice and who had been there introduced at the table of Montoni This discovery occasioned her an emotion of doubtful joy for it was matter of joy and comfort to know that a person of a mind so gentle as that of Signora Livona seemed to be was near her yet there was something so extraordinary in her being at this castle circumstanced as it now was and evidently by the gaiety of her air with her own consent that a very painful surmise arose concerning her character But the thought was so shocking to Emily whose affection the fascinating manners of the Signora had won and appeared so improbable when she remembered these manners that she dismissed it almost instantly On Annette s appearance however she enquired concerning these strangers and the former was as eager to tell as Emily was to learn They are just come ma amselle said Annette with two Signors from Venice and I was glad to see such Christian faces once again But what can they mean by coming here They must surely be stark mad to come freely to such a place as this Yet they do come freely for they seem merry enough I am sure They were taken prisoners perhaps said Emily Taken prisoners exclaimed Annette no indeed ma amselle not they I remember one of them very well at Venice she came two or three times to the Signor s you know ma amselle and it was said but I did not believe a word of it it was said that the Signor liked her better than he should do Then why says I bring her to my lady Very true said Ludovico but he looked as if he knew more too Emily desired Annette would endeavour to learn who these ladies were as well as all she could concerning them and she then changed the subject and spoke of distant France Ah ma amselle we shall never see it more said Annette almost weeping I must come on my travels forsooth Emily tried to sooth and to cheer her with a hope in which she scarcely herself indulged How how ma amselle could you leave France and leave Mons Valancourt too said Annette sobbing I I am sure if Ludovico had been in France I would never have left it Why do you lament quitting France then said Emily trying to smile since if you had remained there you would not have found Ludovico Ah ma amselle I only wish I was out of this frightful castle serving you in France and I would care about nothing else Thank you my good Annette for your affectionate regard the time will come I hope when you may remember the expression of that wish with pleasure Annette departed on her business and Emily sought to lose the sense of her own cares in the visionary scenes of the poet but she had again to lament the irresistible force of circumstances over the taste and powers of the mind and that it requires a spirit at ease to be sensible even to the abstract pleasures of pure intellect The enthusiasm of genius with all its pictured scenes now appeared cold and dim As she mused upon the book before her she involuntarily exclaimed Are these indeed the passages that have so often given me exquisite delight Where did the charm exist Was it in my mind or in the imagination of the poet It lived in each said she pausing But the fire of the poet is vain if the mind of his reader is not tempered like his own however it may be inferior to his in power Emily would have pursued this train of thinking because it relieved her from more painful reflection but she found again that thought cannot always be controlled by will and hers returned to the consideration of her own situation In the evening not choosing to venture down to the ramparts where she would be exposed to the rude gaze of Montoni s associates she walked for air in the gallery adjoining her chamber on reaching the further end of which she heard distant sounds of merriment and laughter It was the wild uproar of riot not the cheering gaiety of tempered mirth and seemed to come from that part of the castle where Montoni usually was Such sounds at this time when her aunt had been so few days dead particularly shocked her consistent as they were with the late conduct of Montoni As she listened she thought she distinguished female voices mingling with the laughter and this confirmed her worst surmise concerning the character of Signora Livona and her companions It was evident that they had not been brought hither by compulsion and she beheld herself in the remote wilds of the Apennine surrounded by men whom she considered to be little less than ruffians and their worst associates amid scenes of vice from which her soul recoiled in horror It was at this moment when the scenes of the present and the future opened to her imagination that the image of Valancourt failed in its influence and her resolution shook with dread She thought she understood all the horrors which Montoni was preparing for her and shrunk from an encounter with such remorseless vengeance as he could inflict The disputed estates she now almost determined to yield at once whenever he should again call upon her that she might regain safety and freedom but then the remembrance of Valancourt would steal to her heart and plunge her into the distractions of doubt She continued walking in the gallery till evening threw its melancholy twilight through the painted casements and deepened the gloom of the oak wainscoting around her while the distant perspective of the corridor was so much obscured as to be discernible only by the glimmering window that terminated it Along the vaulted halls and passages below peals of laughter echoed faintly at intervals to this remote part of the castle and seemed to render the succeeding stillness more dreary Emily however unwilling to return to her more forlorn chamber whither Annette was not yet come still paced the gallery As she passed the door of the apartment where she had once dared to lift the veil which discovered to her a spectacle so horrible that she had never after remembered it but with emotions of indescribable awe this remembrance suddenly recurred It now brought with it reflections more terrible than it had yet done which the late conduct of Montoni occasioned and hastening to quit the gallery while she had power to do so she heard a sudden step behind her It might be that of Annette but turning fearfully to look she saw through the gloom a tall figure following her and all the horrors of that chamber rushed upon her mind In the next moment she found herself clasped in the arms of some person and heard a deep voice murmur in her ear When she had power to speak or to distinguish articulated sounds she demanded who detained her It is I replied the voice Why are you thus alarmed She looked on the face of the person who spoke but the feeble light that gleamed through the high casement at the end of the gallery did not permit her to distinguish the features Whoever you are said Emily in a trembling voice for heaven s sake let me go My charming Emily said the man why will you shut yourself up in this obscure place when there is so much gaiety below Return with me to the cedar parlour where you will be the fairest ornament of the party you shall not repent the exchange Emily disdained to reply and still endeavoured to liberate herself Promise that you will come he continued and I will release you immediately but first give me a reward for so doing Who are you demanded Emily in a tone of mingled terror and indignation while she still struggled for liberty who are you that have the cruelty thus to insult me Why call me cruel said the man I would remove you from this dreary solitude to a merry party below Do you not know me Emily now faintly remembered that he was one of the officers who were with Montoni when she attended him in the morning I thank you for the kindness of your intention she replied without appearing to understand him but I wish for nothing so much as that you would leave me Charming Emily said he give up this foolish whim for solitude and come with me to the company and eclipse the beauties who make part of it you only are worthy of my love He attempted to kiss her hand but the strong impulse of her indignation gave her power to liberate herself and she fled towards the chamber She closed the door before he reached it having secured which she sunk in a chair overcome by terror and by the exertion she had made while she heard his voice and his attempts to open the door without having the power to raise herself At length she perceived him depart and had remained listening for a considerable time and was somewhat revived by not hearing any sound when suddenly she remembered the door of the private stair case and that he might enter that way since it was fastened only on the other side She then employed herself in endeavouring to secure it in the manner she had formerly done It appeared to her that Montoni had already commenced his scheme of vengeance by withdrawing from her his protection and she repented of the rashness that had made her brave the power of such a man To retain the estates seemed to be now utterly impossible and to preserve her life perhaps her honour she resolved if she should escape the horrors of this night to give up all claims to the estates on the morrow provided Montoni would suffer her to depart from Udolpho When she had come to this decision her mind became more composed though she still anxiously listened and often started at ideal sounds that appeared to issue from the stair case Having sat in darkness for some hours during all which time Annette did not appear she began to have serious apprehensions for her but not daring to venture down into the castle was compelled to remain in uncertainty as to the cause of this unusual absence Emily often stole to the stair case door to listen if any step approached but still no sound alarmed her determining however to watch during the night she once more rested on her dark and desolate couch and bathed the pillow with innocent tears She thought of her deceased parents and then of the absent Valancourt and frequently called upon their names for the profound stillness that now reigned was propitious to the musing sorrow of her mind While she thus remained her ear suddenly caught the notes of distant music to which she listened attentively and soon perceiving this to be the instrument she had formerly heard at midnight she rose and stepped softly to the casement to which the sounds appeared to come from a lower room In a few moments their soft melody was accompanied by a voice so full of pathos that it evidently sang not of imaginary sorrows Its sweet and peculiar tones she thought she had somewhere heard before yet if this was not fancy it was at most a very faint recollection It stole over her mind amidst the anguish of her present suffering like a celestial strain soothing and re assuring her Pleasant as the gale of spring that sighs on the hunter s ear when he awakens from dreams of joy and has heard the music of the spirits of the hill Ossian A R But her emotion can scarcely be imagined when she heard sung with the taste and simplicity of true feeling one of the popular airs of her native province to which she had so often listened with delight when a child and which she had so often heard her father repeat To this well known song never till now heard but in her native country her heart melted while the memory of past times returned The pleasant peaceful scenes of Gascony the tenderness and goodness of her parents the taste and simplicity of her former life all rose to her fancy and formed a picture so sweet and glowing so strikingly contrasted with the scenes the characters and the dangers which now surrounded her that her mind could not bear to pause upon the retrospect and shrunk at the acuteness of its own sufferings Her sighs were deep and convulsed she could no longer listen to the strain that had so often charmed her to tranquillity and she withdrew from the casement to a remote part of the chamber But she was not yet beyond the reach of the music she heard the measure change and the succeeding air called her again to the window for she immediately recollected it to be the same she had formerly heard in the fishing house in Gascony Assisted perhaps by the mystery which had then accompanied this strain it had made so deep an impression on her memory that she had never since entirely forgotten it and the manner in which it was now sung convinced her however unaccountable the circumstances appeared that this was the same voice she had then heard Surprise soon yielded to other emotions a thought darted like lightning upon her mind which discovered a train of hopes that revived all her spirits Yet these hopes were so new so unexpected so astonishing that she did not dare to trust though she could not resolve to discourage them She sat down by the casement breathless and overcome with the alternate emotions of hope and fear then rose again leaned from the window that she might catch a nearer sound listened now doubting and then believing softly exclaimed the name of Valancourt and then sunk again into the chair Yes it was possible that Valancourt was near her and she recollected circumstances which induced her to believe it was his voice she had just heard She remembered he had more than once said that the fishing house where she had formerly listened to this voice and air and where she had seen pencilled sonnets addressed to herself had been his favourite haunt before he had been made known to her there too she had herself unexpectedly met him It appeared from these circumstances more than probable that he was the musician who had formerly charmed her attention and the author of the lines which had expressed such tender admiration who else indeed could it be She was unable at that time to form a conjecture as to the writer but since her acquaintance with Valancourt whenever he had mentioned the fishing house to have been known to him she had not scrupled to believe that he was the author of the sonnets As these considerations passed over her mind joy fear and tenderness contended at her heart she leaned again from the casement to catch the sounds which might confirm or destroy her hope though she did not recollect to have ever heard him sing but the voice and the instrument now ceased She considered for a moment whether she should venture to speak then not choosing lest it should be he to mention his name and yet too much interested to neglect the opportunity of enquiring she called from the casement Is that song from Gascony Her anxious attention was not cheered by any reply every thing remained silent Her impatience increasing with her fears she repeated the question but still no sound was heard except the sighings of the wind among the battlements above and she endeavoured to console herself with a belief that the stranger whoever he was had retired before she had spoken beyond the reach of her voice which it appeared certain had Valancourt heard and recognized he would instantly have replied to Presently however she considered that a motive of prudence and not an accidental removal might occasion his silence but the surmise that led to this reflection suddenly changed her hope and joy to terror and grief for if Valancourt were in the castle it was too probable that he was here a prisoner taken with some of his countrymen many of whom were at that time engaged in the wars of Italy or intercepted in some attempt to reach her Had he even recollected Emily s voice he would have feared in these circumstances to reply to it in the presence of the men who guarded his prison What so lately she had eagerly hoped she now believed she dreaded dreaded to know that Valancourt was near her and while she was anxious to be relieved from her apprehension for his safety she still was unconscious that a hope of soon seeing him struggled with the fear She remained listening at the casement till the air began to freshen and one high mountain in the east to glimmer with the morning when wearied with anxiety she retired to her couch where she found it utterly impossible to sleep for joy tenderness doubt and apprehension distracted her during the whole night Now she rose from the couch and opened the casement to listen then she would pace the room with impatient steps and at length return with despondence to her pillow Never did hours appear to move so heavily as those of this anxious night after which she hoped that Annette might appear and conclude her present state of torturing suspense CHAPTER VI might we but hear The folded flocks penn d in their watled cotes Or sound of pastoral reed with oaten stops Or whistle from the lodge or village cock Count the night watches to his feathery dames Twould be some solace yet some little cheering In this close dungeon of innumerous boughs MILTON In the morning Emily was relieved from her fears for Annette who came at an early hour Here were fine doings in the castle last night ma amselle said she as soon as she entered the room fine doings indeed Was you not frightened ma amselle at not seeing me I was alarmed both on your account and on my own replied Emily What detained you Aye I said so I told him so but it would not do It was not my fault indeed ma amselle for I could not get out That rogue Ludovico locked me up again
2007_132570_000008_000000	train-clean-100	 Locked you up said Emily with displeasure Why do you permit Ludovico to lock you up 
2007_132570_000009_000000	train-clean-100	 Holy Saints exclaimed Annette how can I help it 
none	none	If he will lock the door ma amselle and take away the key how am I to get out unless I jump through the window But that I should not mind so much if the casements here were not all so high one can hardly scramble up to them on the inside and one should break one s neck I suppose going down on the outside But you know I dare say ma am what a hurly burly the castle was in last night you must have heard some of the uproar
2007_132570_000010_000000	train-clean-100	 What were they disputing then said Emily 
none	none	No ma amselle nor fighting but almost as good for I believe there was not one of the Signors sober and what is more not one of those fine ladies sober either 
2007_132570_000011_000001	train-clean-100	I thought when I saw them first that all those fine silks and fine veils why ma amselle their veils were worked with silver and fine trimmings boded no good I guessed what they were 
2007_132570_000012_000000	train-clean-100	 Good God exclaimed Emily what will become of me 
none	none	Aye ma am Ludovico said much the same thing of me Good God said he Annette what is to become of you if you are to go running about the castle among all these drunken Signors O says I for that matter I only want to go to my young lady s chamber and I have only to go you know along the vaulted passage and across the great hall and up the marble stair case and along the north gallery and through the west wing of the castle and I am in the corridor in a minute Are you so says he and what is to become of you if you meet any of those noble cavaliers in the way Well says I if you think there is danger then go with me and guard me I am never afraid when you are by What says he when I am scarcely recovered of one wound shall I put myself in the way of getting another for if any of the cavaliers meet you they will fall a fighting with me directly No no says he I will cut the way shorter than through the vaulted passage and up the marble stair case and along the north gallery and through the west wing of the castle for you shall stay here Annette you shall not go out of this room to night So with that I says Well well said Emily impatiently and anxious to enquire on another subject so he locked you up Yes he did indeed ma amselle notwithstanding all I could say to the contrary and Caterina and I and he staid there all night And in a few minutes after I was not so vexed for there came Signor Verezzi roaring along the passage like a mad bull and he mistook Ludovico s hall for old Carlo s so he tried to burst open the door and called out for more wine for that he had drunk all the flasks dry and was dying of thirst So we were all as still as night that he might suppose there was nobody in the room but the Signor was as cunning as the best of us and kept calling out at the door Come forth my antient hero said he here is no enemy at the gate that you need hide yourself come forth my valorous Signor Steward Just then old Carlo opened his door and he came with a flask in his hand for as soon as the Signor saw him he was as tame as could be and followed him away as naturally as a dog does a butcher with a piece of meat in his basket 
2007_132570_000016_000002	train-clean-100	All this I saw through the key hole 
none	none	Well Annette said Ludovico jeeringly shall I let you out now O no says I I would not I have some questions to ask you on another subject interrupted Emily quite wearied by this story Do you know whether there are any prisoners in the castle and whether they are confined at this end of the edifice I was not in the way ma amselle replied Annette when the first party came in from the mountains and the last party is not come back yet so I don t know whether there are any prisoners but it is expected back to night or to morrow and I shall know then perhaps Emily enquired if she had ever heard the servants talk of prisoners Ah ma amselle said Annette archly now I dare say you are thinking of Monsieur Valancourt and that he may have come among the armies which they say are come from our country to fight against this state and that he has met with some of OUR people and is taken captive O Lord how glad I should be if it was so
2007_132570_000021_000000	train-clean-100	 Would you indeed be glad said Emily in a tone of mournful reproach 
none	none	To be sure I should ma am replied Annette and would not you be glad too to see Signor Valancourt I don t know any chevalier I like better I have a very great regard for the Signor truly Your regard for him cannot be doubted said Emily since you wish to see him a prisoner Why no ma amselle not a prisoner either but one must be glad to see him you know And it was only the other night I dreamt I dreamt I saw him drive into the castle yard all in a coach and six and dressed out with a laced coat and a sword like a lord as he is Emily could not forbear smiling at Annette s ideas of Valancourt and repeated her enquiry whether she had heard the servants talk of prisoners No ma amselle replied she never and lately they have done nothing but talk of the apparition that has been walking about of a night on the ramparts and that frightened the sentinels into fits It came among them like a flash of fire they say and they all fell down in a row till they came to themselves again and then it was gone and nothing to be seen but the old castle walls so they helped one another up again as fast as they could You would not believe ma amselle though I shewed you the very cannon where it used to appear And are you indeed so simple Annette said Emily smiling at this curious exaggeration of the circumstances she had witnessed as to credit these stories
2007_132570_000028_000000	train-clean-100	 Credit them ma amselle why all the world could not persuade me out of them 
none	none	Roberto and Sebastian and half a dozen more of them went into fits To be sure there was no occasion for that I said myself there was no need of that for says I when the enemy comes what a pretty figure they will cut if they are to fall down in fits all of a row The enemy won t be so civil perhaps as to walk off like the ghost and leave them to help one another up but will fall to cutting and slashing till he makes them all rise up dead men No no says I there is reason in all things though I might have fallen down in a fit that was no rule for them being because it is no business of mine to look gruff and fight battles Emily endeavoured to correct the superstitious weakness of Annette though she could not entirely subdue her own to which the latter only replied Nay ma amselle you will believe nothing you are almost as bad as the Signor himself who was in a great passion when they told of what had happened and swore that the first man who repeated such nonsense should be thrown into the dungeon under the east turret This was a hard punishment too for only talking nonsense as he called it but I dare say he had other reasons for calling it so than you have ma am Emily looked displeased and made no reply As she mused upon the recollected appearance which had lately so much alarmed her and considered the circumstances of the figure having stationed itself opposite to her casement she was for a moment inclined to believe it was Valancourt whom she had seen Yet if it was he why did he not speak to her when he had the opportunity of doing so and if he was a prisoner in the castle and he could be here in no other character how could he obtain the means of walking abroad on the rampart Thus she was utterly unable to decide whether the musician and the form she had observed were the same or if they were whether this was Valancourt She however desired that Annette would endeavour to learn whether any prisoners were in the castle and also their names O dear ma amselle said Annette I forget to tell you what you bade me ask about the ladies as they call themselves who are lately come to Udolpho Why that Signora Livona that the Signor brought to see my late lady at Venice is his mistress now and was little better then I dare say And Ludovico says but pray be secret ma am that his excellenza introduced her only to impose upon the world that had begun to make free with her character So when people saw my lady notice her they thought what they had heard must be scandal The other two are the mistresses of Signor Verezzi and Signor Bertolini and Signor Montoni invited them all to the castle and so yesterday he gave a great entertainment and there they were all drinking Tuscany wine and all sorts and laughing and singing till they made the castle ring again But I thought they were dismal sounds so soon after my poor lady s death too and they brought to my mind what she would have thought if she had heard them but she cannot hear them now poor soul said I Emily turned away to conceal her emotion and then desired Annette to go and make enquiry concerning the prisoners that might be in the castle but conjured her to do it with caution and on no account to mention her name or that of Monsieur Valancourt Now I think of it ma amselle said Annette I do believe there are prisoners for I overheard one of the Signor s men yesterday in the servants hall talking something about ransoms and saying what a fine thing it was for his excellenza to catch up men and they were as good booty as any other because of the ransoms And the other man was grumbling and saying it was fine enough for the Signor but none so fine for his soldiers because said he we don t go shares there This information heightened Emily s impatience to know more and Annette immediately departed on her enquiry The late resolution of Emily to resign her estates to Montoni now gave way to new considerations the possibility that Valancourt was near her revived her fortitude and she determined to brave the threatened vengeance at least till she could be assured whether he was really in the castle She was in this temper of mind when she received a message from Montoni requiring her attendance in the cedar parlour which she obeyed with trembling and on her way thither endeavoured to animate her fortitude with the idea of Valancourt Montoni was alone I sent for you said he to give you another opportunity of retracting your late mistaken assertions concerning the Languedoc estates I will condescend to advise where I may command If you are really deluded by an opinion that you have any right to these estates at least do not persist in the error an error which you may perceive too late has been fatal to you Dare my resentment no further but sign the papers If I have no right in these estates sir said Emily of what service can it be to you that I should sign any papers concerning them If the lands are yours by law you certainly may possess them without my interference or my consent I will have no more argument said Montoni with a look that made her tremble
2007_132570_000038_000001	train-clean-100	 What had I but trouble to expect when I condescended to reason with a baby 
2007_132570_000038_000002	train-clean-100	But I will be trifled with no longer let the recollection of your aunt s sufferings in consequence of her folly and obstinacy teach you a lesson Sign the papers 
none	none	Emily s resolution was for a moment awed she shrunk at the recollections he revived and from the vengeance he threatened but then the image of Valancourt who so long had loved her and who was now perhaps so near her came to her heart and together with the strong feelings of indignation with which she had always from her infancy regarded an act of injustice inspired her with a noble though imprudent courage
2007_132570_000040_000000	train-clean-100	 Sign the papers said Montoni more impatiently than before 
none	none	Never sir replied Emily that request would have proved to me the injustice of your claim had I even been ignorant of my right Montoni turned pale with anger while his quivering lip and lurking eye made her almost repent the boldness of her speech Then all my vengeance falls upon you he exclaimed with an horrible oath And think not it shall be delayed 
2007_132570_000043_000002	train-clean-100	Neither the estates in Languedoc or Gascony shall be yours you have dared to question my right now dare to question my power 
2007_132570_000043_000003	train-clean-100	I have a punishment which you think not of it is terrible 
2007_132570_000043_000004	train-clean-100	This night this very night 
none	none	This night repeated another voice Montoni paused and turned half round but seeming to recollect himself he proceeded in a lower tone You have lately seen one terrible example of obstinacy and folly yet this it appears has not been sufficient to deter you I could tell you of others I could make you tremble at the bare recital He was interrupted by a groan which seemed to rise from underneath the chamber they were in and as he threw a glance round it impatience and rage flashed from his eyes yet something like a shade of fear passed over his countenance Emily sat down in a chair near the door for the various emotions she had suffered now almost overcame her but Montoni paused scarcely an instant and commanding his features resumed his discourse in a lower yet sterner voice I say I could give you other instances of my power and of my character which it seems you do not understand or you would not defy me I could tell you that when once my resolution is taken but I am talking to a baby Let me however repeat that terrible as are the examples I could recite the recital could not now benefit you for though your repentance would put an immediate end to opposition it would not now appease my indignation I will have vengeance as well as justice Another groan filled the pause which Montoni made Leave the room instantly said he seeming not to notice this strange occurrence Without power to implore his pity she rose to go but found that she could not support herself awe and terror overcame her and she sunk again into the chair
2007_132570_000051_000000	train-clean-100	 Quit my presence cried Montoni 
none	none	This affectation of fear ill becomes the heroine who has just dared to brave my indignation Did you hear nothing Signor said Emily trembling and still unable to leave the room I heard my own voice rejoined Montoni sternly And nothing else said Emily speaking with difficulty There again Do you hear nothing now
2007_132570_000055_000000	train-clean-100	 Obey my order repeated Montoni 
2007_132570_000055_000001	train-clean-100	 And for these fool s tricks I will soon discover by whom they are practised 
none	none	Emily again rose and exerted herself to the utmost to leave the room while Montoni followed her but instead of calling aloud to his servants to search the chamber as he had formerly done on a similar occurrence passed to the ramparts As in her way to the corridor she rested for a moment at an open casement Emily saw a party of Montoni s troops winding down a distant mountain whom she noticed no further than as they brought to her mind the wretched prisoners they were perhaps bringing to the castle At length having reached her apartment she threw herself upon the couch overcome with the new horrors of her situation Her thoughts lost in tumult and perplexity she could neither repent of or approve her late conduct she could only remember that she was in the power of a man who had no principle of action but his will and the astonishment and terrors of superstition which had for a moment so strongly assailed her now yielded to those of reason She was at length roused from the reverie which engaged her by a confusion of distant voices and a clattering of hoofs that seemed to come on the wind from the courts A sudden hope that some good was approaching seized her mind till she remembered the troops she had observed from the casement and concluded this to be the party which Annette had said were expected at Udolpho Soon after she heard voices faintly from the halls and the noise of horses feet sunk away in the wind silence ensued Emily listened anxiously for Annette s step in the corridor but a pause of total stillness continued till again the castle seemed to be all tumult and confusion She heard the echoes of many footsteps passing to and fro in the halls and avenues below and then busy tongues were loud on the rampart Having hurried to her casement she perceived Montoni with some of his officers leaning on the walls and pointing from them while several soldiers were employed at the further end of the rampart about some cannon and she continued to observe them careless of the passing time Annette at length appeared but brought no intelligence of Valancourt For ma amselle said she all the people pretend to know nothing about any prisoners But here is a fine piece of business The rest of the party are just arrived ma am they came scampering in as if they would have broken their necks one scarcely knew whether the man or his horse would get within the gates first And they have brought word and such news they have brought word that a party of the enemy as they call them are coming towards the castle so we shall have all the officers of justice I suppose besieging it all those terrible looking fellows one used to see at Venice Thank God exclaimed Emily fervently there is yet a hope left for me then What mean you ma amselle Do you wish to fall into the hands of those sad looking men Why I used to shudder as I passed them and should have guessed what they were if Ludovico had not told me We cannot be in worse hands than at present replied Emily unguardedly but what reason have you to suppose these are officers of justice Why OUR people ma am are all in such a fright and a fuss and I don t know any thing but the fear of justice that could make them so I used to think nothing on earth could fluster them unless indeed it was a ghost or so but now some of them are for hiding down in the vaults under the castle but you must not tell the Signor this ma amselle and I overheard two of them talking Holy Mother what makes you look so sad ma amselle You don t hear what I say Yes I do Annette pray proceed Well ma amselle all the castle is in such hurly burly Some of the men are loading the cannon and some are examining the great gates and the walls all round and are hammering and patching up just as if all those repairs had never been made that were so long about But what is to become of me and you ma amselle and Ludovico O when I hear the sound of the cannon I shall die with fright If I could but catch the great gate open for one minute I would be even with it for shutting me within these walls so long it should never see me again Emily caught the latter words of Annette O if you could find it open but for one moment she exclaimed my peace might yet be saved The heavy groan she uttered and the wildness of her look terrified Annette still more than her words who entreated Emily to explain the meaning of them to whom it suddenly occurred that Ludovico might be of some service if there should be a possibility of escape and who repeated the substance of what had passed between Montoni and herself but conjured her to mention this to no person except to Ludovico It may perhaps be in his power she added to effect our escape Go to him Annette tell him what I have to apprehend and what I have already suffered but entreat him to be secret and to lose no time in attempting to release us If he is willing to undertake this he shall be amply rewarded I cannot speak with him myself for we might be observed and then effectual care would be taken to prevent our flight But be quick Annette and above all be discreet I will await your return in this apartment The girl whose honest heart had been much affected by the recital was now as eager to obey as Emily was to employ her and she immediately quitted the room Emily s surprise increased as she reflected upon Annette s intelligence Alas said she what can the officers of justice do against an armed castle these cannot be such Upon further consideration however she concluded that Montoni s bands having plundered the country round the inhabitants had taken arms and were coming with the officers of police and a party of soldiers to force their way into the castle But they know not thought she its strength or the armed numbers within it Alas except from flight I have nothing to hope Montoni though not precisely what Emily apprehended him to be a captain of banditti had employed his troops in enterprises not less daring or less atrocious than such a character would have undertaken They had not only pillaged whenever opportunity offered the helpless traveller but had attacked and plundered the villas of several persons which being situated among the solitary recesses of the mountains were totally unprepared for resistance In these expeditions the commanders of the party did not appear and the men partly disguised had sometimes been mistaken for common robbers and at others for bands of the foreign enemy who at that period invaded the country But though they had already pillaged several mansions and brought home considerable treasures they had ventured to approach only one castle in the attack of which they were assisted by other troops of their own order from this however they were vigorously repulsed and pursued by some of the foreign enemy who were in league with the besieged Montoni s troops fled precipitately towards Udolpho but were so closely tracked over the mountains that when they reached one of the heights in the neighbourhood of the castle and looked back upon the road they perceived the enemy winding among the cliffs below and at not more than a league distant Upon this discovery they hastened forward with increased speed to prepare Montoni for the enemy and it was their arrival which had thrown the castle into such confusion and tumult As Emily awaited anxiously some information from below she now saw from her casements a body of troops pour over the neighbouring heights and though Annette had been gone a very short time and had a difficult and dangerous business to accomplish her impatience for intelligence became painful she listened opened her door and often went out upon the corridor to meet her At length she heard a footstep approach her chamber and on opening the door saw not Annette but old Carlo New fears rushed upon her mind He said he came from the Signor who had ordered him to inform her that she must be ready to depart from Udolpho immediately for that the castle was about to be besieged and that mules were preparing to convey her with her guides to a place of safety Of safety exclaimed Emily thoughtlessly has then the Signor so much consideration for me Carlo looked upon the ground and made no reply A thousand opposite emotions agitated Emily successively as she listened to old Carlo those of joy grief distrust and apprehension appeared and vanished from her mind with the quickness of lightning One moment it seemed impossible that Montoni could take this measure merely for her preservation and so very strange was his sending her from the castle at all that she could attribute it only to the design of carrying into execution the new scheme of vengeance with which he had menaced her In the next instant it appeared so desirable to quit the castle under any circumstances that she could not but rejoice in the prospect believing that change must be for the better till she remembered the probability of Valancourt being detained in it when sorrow and regret usurped her mind and she wished much more fervently than she had yet done that it might not be his voice which she had heard Carlo having reminded her that she had no time to lose for that the enemy were within sight of the castle Emily entreated him to inform her whither she was to go and after some hesitation he said he had received no orders to tell but on her repeating the question replied that he believed she was to be carried into Tuscany To Tuscany exclaimed Emily and why thither Carlo answered that he knew nothing further than that she was to be lodged in a cottage on the borders of Tuscany at the feet of the Apennines Not a day s journey distant said he Emily now dismissed him and with trembling hands prepared the small package that she meant to take with her while she was employed about which Annette returned O ma amselle said she nothing can be done Ludovico says the new porter is more watchful even than Barnardine was and we might as well throw ourselves in the way of a dragon as in his Ludovico is almost as broken hearted as you are ma am on my account he says and I am sure I shall never live to hear the cannon fire twice She now began to weep but revived upon hearing of what had just occurred and entreated Emily to take her with her That I will do most willingly replied Emily if Signor Montoni permits it to which Annette made no reply but ran out of the room and immediately sought Montoni who was on the terrace surrounded by his officers where she began her petition He sharply bade her go into the castle and absolutely refused her request Annette however not only pleaded for herself but for Ludovico and Montoni had ordered some of his men to take her from his presence before she would retire In an agony of disappointment she returned to Emily who foreboded little good towards herself from this refusal to Annette and who soon after received a summons to repair to the great court where the mules with her guides were in waiting Emily here tried in vain to sooth the weeping Annette who persisted in saying that she should never see her dear young lady again a fear which her mistress secretly thought too well justified but which she endeavoured to restrain while with apparent composure she bade this affectionate servant farewell Annette however followed to the courts which were now thronged with people busy in preparation for the enemy and having seen her mount her mule and depart with her attendants through the portal turned into the castle and wept again Emily meanwhile as she looked back upon the gloomy courts of the castle no longer silent as when she had first entered them but resounding with the noise of preparation for their defence as well as crowded with soldiers and workmen hurrying to and fro and when she passed once more under the huge portcullis which had formerly struck her with terror and dismay and looking round saw no walls to confine her steps felt in spite of anticipation the sudden joy of a prisoner who unexpectedly finds himself at liberty This emotion would not suffer her now to look impartially on the dangers that awaited her without on mountains infested by hostile parties who seized every opportunity for plunder and on a journey commended under the guidance of men whose countenances certainly did not speak favourably of their dispositions In the present moments she could only rejoice that she was liberated from those walls which she had entered with such dismal forebodings and remembering the superstitious presentiment which had then seized her she could now smile at the impression it had made upon her mind As she gazed with these emotions upon the turrets of the castle rising high over the woods among which she wound the stranger whom she believed to be confined there returned to her remembrance and anxiety and apprehension lest he should be Valancourt again passed like a cloud upon her joy She recollected every circumstance concerning this unknown person since the night when she had first heard him play the song of her native province circumstances which she had so often recollected and compared before without extracting from them any thing like conviction and which still only prompted her to believe that Valancourt was a prisoner at Udolpho It was possible however that the men who were her conductors might afford her information on this subject but fearing to question them immediately lest they should be unwilling to discover any circumstance to her in the presence of each other she watched for an opportunity of speaking with them separately Soon after a trumpet echoed faintly from a distance the guides stopped and looked toward the quarter whence it came but the thick woods which surrounded them excluding all view of the country beyond one of the men rode on to the point of an eminence that afforded a more extensive prospect to observe how near the enemy whose trumpet he guessed this to be were advanced the other meanwhile remained with Emily and to him she put some questions concerning the stranger at Udolpho Ugo for this was his name said that there were several prisoners in the castle but he neither recollected their persons or the precise time of their arrival and could therefore give her no information There was a surliness in his manner as he spoke that made it probable he would not have satisfied her enquiries even if he could have done so Having asked him what prisoners had been taken about the time as nearly as she could remember when she had first heard the music All that week said Ugo I was out with a party upon the mountains and knew nothing of what was doing at the castle We had enough upon our hands we had warm work of it Bertrand the other man being now returned Emily enquired no further and when he had related to his companion what he had seen they travelled on in deep silence while Emily often caught between the opening woods partial glimpses of the castle above the west towers whose battlements were now crowded with archers and the ramparts below where soldiers were seen hurrying along or busy upon the walls preparing the cannon Having emerged from the woods they wound along the valley in an opposite direction to that from whence the enemy were approaching Emily now had a full view of Udolpho with its gray walls towers and terraces high over topping the precipices and the dark woods and glittering partially with the arms of the condottieri as the sun s rays streaming through an autumnal cloud glanced upon a part of the edifice whose remaining features stood in darkened majesty She continued to gaze through her tears upon walls that perhaps confined Valancourt and which now as the cloud floated away were lighted up with sudden splendour and then as suddenly were shrouded in gloom while the passing gleam fell on the wood tops below and heightened the first tints of autumn that had begun to steal upon the foliage The winding mountains at length shut Udolpho from her view and she turned with mournful reluctance to other objects The melancholy sighing of the wind among the pines that waved high over the steeps and the distant thunder of a torrent assisted her musings and conspired with the wild scenery around to diffuse over her mind emotions solemn yet not unpleasing but which were soon interrupted by the distant roar of cannon echoing among the mountains The sounds rolled along the wind and were repeated in faint and fainter reverberation till they sunk in sullen murmurs This was a signal that the enemy had reached the castle and fear for Valancourt again tormented Emily She turned her anxious eyes towards that part of the country where the edifice stood but the intervening heights concealed it from her view still however she saw the tall head of a mountain which immediately fronted her late chamber and on this she fixed her gaze as if it could have told her of all that was passing in the scene it overlooked The guides twice reminded her that she was losing time and that they had far to go before she could turn from this interesting object and even when she again moved onward she often sent a look back till only its blue point brightening in a gleam of sunshine appeared peeping over other mountains The sound of the cannon affected Ugo as the blast of the trumpet does the war horse it called forth all the fire of his nature he was impatient to be in the midst of the fight and uttered frequent execrations against Montoni for having sent him to a distance The feelings of his comrade seemed to be very opposite and adapted rather to the cruelties than to the dangers of war Emily asked frequent questions concerning the place of her destination but could only learn that she was going to a cottage in Tuscany and whenever she mentioned the subject she fancied she perceived in the countenances of these men an expression of malice and cunning that alarmed her It was afternoon when they had left the castle During several hours they travelled through regions of profound solitude where no bleat of sheep or bark of watch dog broke on silence and they were now too far off to hear even the faint thunder of the cannon Towards evening they wound down precipices black with forests of cypress pine and cedar into a glen so savage and secluded that if Solitude ever had local habitation this might have been her place of dearest residence To Emily it appeared a spot exactly suited for the retreat of banditti and in her imagination she already saw them lurking under the brow of some projecting rock whence their shadows lengthened by the setting sun stretched across the road and warned the traveller of his danger She shuddered at the idea and looking at her conductors to observe whether they were armed thought she saw in them the banditti she dreaded It was in this glen that they proposed to alight For said Ugo night will come on presently and then the wolves will make it dangerous to stop This was a new subject of alarm to Emily but inferior to what she suffered from the thought of being left in these wilds at midnight with two such men as her present conductors Dark and dreadful hints of what might be Montoni s purpose in sending her hither came to her mind She endeavoured to dissuade the men from stopping and enquired with anxiety how far they had yet to go Many leagues yet replied Bertrand As for you Signora you may do as you please about eating but for us we will make a hearty supper while we can We shall have need of it I warrant before we finish our journey The sun s going down apace let us alight under that rock yonder His comrade assented and turning the mules out of the road they advanced towards a cliff overhung with cedars Emily following in trembling silence They lifted her from her mule and having seated themselves on the grass at the foot of the rocks drew some homely fare from a wallet of which Emily tried to eat a little the better to disguise her apprehensions The sun was now sunk behind the high mountains in the west upon which a purple haze began to spread and the gloom of twilight to draw over the surrounding objects To the low and sullen murmur of the breeze passing among the woods she no longer listened with any degree of pleasure for it conspired with the wildness of the scene and the evening hour to depress her spirits Suspense had so much increased her anxiety as to the prisoner at Udolpho that finding it impracticable to speak alone with Bertrand on that subject she renewed her questions in the presence of Ugo but he either was or pretended to be entirely ignorant concerning the stranger When he had dismissed the question he talked with Ugo on some subject which led to the mention of Signor Orsino and of the affair that had banished him from Venice respecting which Emily had ventured to ask a few questions Ugo appeared to be well acquainted with the circumstances of that tragical event and related some minute particulars that both shocked and surprised her for it appeared very extraordinary how such particulars could be known to any but to persons present when the assassination was committed He was of rank said Bertrand or the State would not have troubled itself to enquire after his assassins The Signor has been lucky hitherto this is not the first affair of the kind he has had upon his hands and to be sure when a gentleman has no other way of getting redress why he must take this Aye said Ugo and why is not this as good as another This is the way to have justice done at once without more ado If you go to law you must stay till the judges please and may lose your cause at last Why the best way then is to make sure of your right while you can and execute justice yourself Yes yes rejoined Bertrand if you wait till justice is done you you may stay long enough Why if I want a friend of mine properly served how am I to get my revenge Ten to one they will tell me he is in the right and I am in the wrong Or if a fellow has got possession of property which I think ought to be mine why I may wait till I starve perhaps before the law will give it me and then after all the judge may say the estate is his What is to be done then Why the case is plain enough I must take it at last Emily s horror at this conversation was heightened by a suspicion that the latter part of it was pointed against herself and that these men had been commissioned by Montoni to execute a similar kind of JUSTICE in his cause But I was speaking of Signor Orsino resumed Bertrand he is one of those who love to do justice at once I remember about ten years ago the Signor had a quarrel with a cavaliero of Milan The story was told me then and it is still fresh in my head They quarrelled about a lady that the Signor liked and she was perverse enough to prefer the gentleman of Milan and even carried her whim so far as to marry him This provoked the Signor as well it might for he had tried to talk reason to her a long while and used to send people to serenade her under her windows of a night and used to make verses about her and would swear she was the handsomest lady in Milan But all would not do nothing would bring her to reason and as I said she went so far at last as to marry this other cavaliero This made the Signor wrath with a vengeance he resolved to be even with her though and he watched his opportunity and did not wait long for soon after the marriage they set out for Padua nothing doubting I warrant of what was preparing for them The cavaliero thought to be sure he was to be called to no account but was to go off triumphant but he was soon made to know another sort of story What then the lady had promised to have Signor Orsino said Ugo Promised No replied Bertrand she had not wit enough even to tell him she liked him as I heard but the contrary for she used to say from the first she never meant to have him And this was what provoked the Signor so and with good reason for who likes to be told that he is disagreeable and this was saying as good It was enough to tell him this she need not have gone and married another What she married then on purpose to plague the Signor said Ugo I don t know as for that replied Bertrand they said indeed that she had had a regard for the other gentleman a great while but that is nothing to the purpose she should not have married him and then the Signor would not have been so much provoked She might have expected what was to follow it was not to be supposed he would bear her ill usage tamely and she might thank herself for what happened But as I said they set out for Padua she and her husband and the road lay over some barren mountains like these This suited the Signor s purpose well He watched the time of their departure and sent his men after them with directions what to do They kept their distance till they saw their opportunity and this did not happen till the second day s journey when the gentleman having sent his servants forward to the next town may be to have horses in readiness the Signor s men quickened their pace and overtook the carriage in a hollow between two mountains where the woods prevented the servants from seeing what passed though they were then not far off When we came up we fired our tromboni but missed Emily turned pale at these words and then hoped she had mistaken them while Bertrand proceeded The gentleman fired again but he was soon made to alight and it was as he turned to call his people that he was struck It was the most dexterous feat you ever saw he was struck in the back with three stillettos at once He fell and was dispatched in a minute but the lady escaped for the servants had heard the firing and came up before she could be taken care of Bertrand said the Signor when his men returned Bertrand exclaimed Emily pale with horror on whom not a syllable of this narrative had been lost Bertrand did I say rejoined the man with some confusion No Giovanni But I have forgot where I was Bertrand said the Signor Bertrand again said Emily in a faltering voice Why do you repeat that name Bertrand swore What signifies it he proceeded what the man was called Bertrand or Giovanni or Roberto it s all one for that You have put me out twice with that question Bertrand or Giovanni or what you will Bertrand said the Signor if your comrades had done their duty as well as you I should not have lost the lady Go my honest fellow and be happy with this He game him a purse of gold and little enough too considering the service he had done him Aye aye said Ugo little enough little enough Emily now breathed with difficulty and could scarcely support herself When first she saw these men their appearance and their connection with Montoni had been sufficient to impress her with distrust but now when one of them had betrayed himself to be a murderer and she saw herself at the approach of night under his guidance among wild and solitary mountains and going she scarcely knew whither the most agonizing terror seized her which was the less supportable from the necessity she found herself under of concealing all symptoms of it from her companions Reflecting on the character and the menaces of Montoni it appeared not improbable that he had delivered her to them for the purpose of having her murdered and of thus securing to himself without further opposition or delay the estates for which he had so long and so desperately contended Yet if this was his design there appeared no necessity for sending her to such a distance from the castle for if any dread of discovery had made him unwilling to perpetrate the deed there a much nearer place might have sufficed for the purpose of concealment These considerations however did not immediately occur to Emily with whom so many circumstances conspired to rouse terror that she had no power to oppose it or to enquire coolly into its grounds and if she had done so still there were many appearances which would too well have justified her most terrible apprehensions She did not now dare to speak to her conductors at the sound of whose voices she trembled and when now and then she stole a glance at them their countenances seen imperfectly through the gloom of evening served to confirm her fears The sun had now been set some time heavy clouds whose lower skirts were tinged with sulphureous crimson lingered in the west and threw a reddish tint upon the pine forests which sent forth a solemn sound as the breeze rolled over them The hollow moan struck upon Emily s heart and served to render more gloomy and terrific every object around her the mountains shaded in twilight the gleaming torrent hoarsely roaring the black forests and the deep glen broken into rocky recesses high overshadowed by cypress and sycamore and winding into long obscurity To this glen Emily as she sent forth her anxious eye thought there was no end no hamlet or even cottage was seen and still no distant bark of watch dog or even faint far off halloo came on the wind In a tremulous voice she now ventured to remind the guides that it was growing late and to ask again how far they had to go but they were too much occupied by their own discourse to attend to her question which she forbore to repeat lest it should provoke a surly answer Having however soon after finished their supper the men collected the fragments into their wallet and proceeded along this winding glen in gloomy silence while Emily again mused upon her own situation and concerning the motives of Montoni for involving her in it That it was for some evil purpose towards herself she could not doubt and it seemed that if he did not intend to destroy her with a view of immediately seizing her estates he meant to reserve her a while in concealment for some more terrible design for one that might equally gratify his avarice and still more his deep revenge At this moment remembering Signor Brochio and his behaviour in the corridor a few preceding nights the latter supposition horrible as it was strengthened in her belief Yet why remove her from the castle where deeds of darkness had she feared been often executed with secrecy from chambers perhaps With many a foul and midnight murder stain d The dread of what she might be going to encounter was now so excessive that it sometimes threatened her senses and often as she went she thought of her late father and of all he would have suffered could he have foreseen the strange and dreadful events of her future life and how anxiously he would have avoided that fatal confidence which committed his daughter to the care of a woman so weak as was Madame Montoni So romantic and improbable indeed did her present situation appear to Emily herself particularly when she compared it with the repose and beauty of her early days that there were moments when she could almost have believed herself the victim of frightful visions glaring upon a disordered fancy Restrained by the presence of her guides from expressing her terrors their acuteness was at length lost in gloomy despair The dreadful view of what might await her hereafter rendered her almost indifferent to the surrounding dangers She now looked with little emotion on the wild dingles and the gloomy road and mountains whose outlines were only distinguishable through the dusk objects which but lately had affected her spirits so much as to awaken horrid views of the future and to tinge these with their own gloom It was now so nearly dark that the travellers who proceeded only by the slowest pace could scarcely discern their way The clouds which seemed charged with thunder passed slowly along the heavens shewing at intervals the trembling stars while the groves of cypress and sycamore that overhung the rocks waved high in the breeze as it swept over the glen and then rushed among the distant woods Emily shivered as it passed Where is the torch said Ugo It grows dark Not so dark yet replied Bertrand but we may find our way and tis best not light the torch before we can help for it may betray us if any straggling party of the enemy is abroad Ugo muttered something which Emily did not understand and they proceeded in darkness while she almost wished that the enemy might discover them for from change there was something to hope since she could scarcely imagine any situation more dreadful than her present one As they moved slowly along her attention was surprised by a thin tapering flame that appeared by fits at the point of the pike which Bertrand carried resembling what she had observed on the lance of the sentinel the night Madame Montoni died and which he had said was an omen The event immediately following it appeared to justify the assertion and a superstitious impression had remained on Emily s mind which the present appearance confirmed She thought it was an omen of her own fate and watched it successively vanish and return in gloomy silence which was at length interrupted by Bertrand Let us light the torch said he and get under shelter of the woods a storm is coming on look at my lance He held it forth with the flame tapering at its point See the Abbe Berthelon on Electricity A R Aye said Ugo you are not one of those that believe in omens we have left cowards at the castle who would turn pale at such a sight I have often seen it before a thunder storm it is an omen of that and one is coming now sure enough The clouds flash fast already Emily was relieved by this conversation from some of the terrors of superstition but those of reason increased as waiting while Ugo searched for a flint to strike fire she watched the pale lightning gleam over the woods they were about to enter and illumine the harsh countenances of her companions Ugo could not find a flint and Bertrand became impatient for the thunder sounded hollowly at a distance and the lightning was more frequent Sometimes it revealed the nearer recesses of the woods or displaying some opening in their summits illumined the ground beneath with partial splendour the thick foliage of the trees preserving the surrounding scene in deep shadow At length Ugo found a flint and the torch was lighted The men then dismounted and having assisted Emily led the mules towards the woods that skirted the glen on the left over broken ground frequently interrupted with brush wood and wild plants which she was often obliged to make a circuit to avoid She could not approach these woods without experiencing keener sense of her danger Their deep silence except when the wind swept among their branches and impenetrable glooms shewn partially by the sudden flash and then by the red glare of the torch which served only to make darkness visible were circumstances that contributed to renew all her most terrible apprehensions she thought too that at this moment the countenances of her conductors displayed more than their usual fierceness mingled with a kind of lurking exultation which they seemed endeavouring to disguise To her affrighted fancy it occurred that they were leading her into these woods to complete the will of Montoni by her murder The horrid suggestion called a groan from her heart which surprised her companions who turned round quickly towards her and she demanded why they led her thither beseeching them to continue their way along the open glen which she represented to be less dangerous than the woods in a thunder storm No no said Bertrand we know best where the danger lies See how the clouds open over our heads Besides we can glide under cover of the woods with less hazard of being seen should any of the enemy be wandering this way By holy saint Peter and all the rest of them I ve as stout a heart as the best as many a poor devil could tell if he were alive again but what can we do against numbers What are you whining about said Ugo contemptuously who fears numbers Let them come though they were as many as the Signor s castle could hold I would shew the knaves what fighting is For you I would lay you quietly in a dry ditch where you might peep out and see me put the rogues to flight Who talks of fear Bertrand replied with an horrible oath that he did not like such jesting and a violent altercation ensued which was at length silenced by the thunder whose deep volley was heard afar rolling onward till it burst over their heads in sounds that seemed to shake the earth to its centre The ruffians paused and looked upon each other Between the boles of the trees the blue lightning flashed and quivered along the ground while as Emily looked under the boughs the mountains beyond frequently appeared to be clothed in livid flame At this moment perhaps she felt less fear of the storm than did either of her companions for other terrors occupied her mind The men now rested under an enormous chesnut tree and fixed their pikes in the ground at some distance on the iron points of which Emily repeatedly observed the lightning play and then glide down them into the earth I would we were well in the Signor s castle said Bertrand I know not why he should send us on this business Hark how it rattles above there I could almost find in my heart to turn priest and pray Ugo hast got a rosary No replied Ugo I leave it to cowards like thee to carry rosaries I carry a sword And much good may it do thee in fighting against the storm said Bertrand Another peal which was reverberated in tremendous echoes among the mountains silenced them for a moment As it rolled away Ugo proposed going on We are only losing time here said he for the thick boughs of the woods will shelter us as well as this chesnut tree They again led the mules forward between the boles of the trees and over pathless grass that concealed their high knotted roots The rising wind was now heard contending with the thunder as it rushed furiously among the branches above and brightened the red flame of the torch which threw a stronger light forward among the woods and shewed their gloomy recesses to be suitable resorts for the wolves of which Ugo had formerly spoken At length the strength of the wind seemed to drive the storm before it for the thunder rolled away into distance and was only faintly heard After travelling through the woods for nearly an hour during which the elements seemed to have returned to repose the travellers gradually ascending from the glen found themselves upon the open brow of a mountain with a wide valley extending in misty moon light at their feet and above the blue sky trembling through the few thin clouds that lingered after the storm and were sinking slowly to the verge of the horizon Emily s spirits now that she had quitted the woods began to revive for she considered that if these men had received an order to destroy her they would probably have executed their barbarous purpose in the solitary wild from whence they had just emerged where the deed would have been shrouded from every human eye Reassured by this reflection and by the quiet demeanour of her guides Emily as they proceeded silently in a kind of sheep track that wound along the skirts of the woods which ascended on the right could not survey the sleeping beauty of the vale to which they were declining without a momentary sensation of pleasure It seemed varied with woods pastures and sloping grounds and was screened to the north and the east by an amphitheatre of the Apennines whose outline on the horizon was here broken into varied and elegant forms to the west and the south the landscape extended indistinctly into the lowlands of Tuscany There is the sea yonder said Bertrand as if he had known that Emily was examining the twilight view yonder in the west though we cannot see it Emily already perceived a change in the climate from that of the wild and mountainous tract she had left and as she continued descending the air became perfumed by the breath of a thousand nameless flowers among the grass called forth by the late rain So soothingly beautiful was the scene around her and so strikingly contrasted to the gloomy grandeur of those to which she had long been confined and to the manners of the people who moved among them that she could almost have fancied herself again at La Vallee and wondering why Montoni had sent her hither could scarcely believe that he had selected so enchanting a spot for any cruel design It was however probably not the spot but the persons who happened to inhabit it and to whose care he could safely commit the execution of his plans whatever they might be that had determined his choice She now ventured again to enquire whether they were near the place of their destination and was answered by Ugo that they had not far to go Only to the wood of chesnuts in the valley yonder said he there by the brook that sparkles with the moon I wish I was once at rest there with a flask of good wine and a slice of Tuscany bacon Emily s spirits revived when she heard that the journey was so nearly concluded and saw the wood of chesnuts in an open part of the vale on the margin of the stream In a short time they reached the entrance of the wood and perceived between the twinkling leaves a light streaming from a distant cottage window They proceeded along the edge of the brook to where the trees crowding over it excluded the moon beams but a long line of light from the cottage above was seen on its dark tremulous surface Bertrand now stepped on first and Emily heard him knock and call loudly at the door As she reached it the small upper casement where the light appeared was unclosed by a man who having enquired what they wanted immediately descended let them into a neat rustic cot and called up his wife to set refreshments before the travellers As this man conversed rather apart with Bertrand Emily anxiously surveyed him He was a tall but not robust peasant of a sallow complexion and had a shrewd and cunning eye his countenance was not of a character to win the ready confidence of youth and there was nothing in his manner that might conciliate a stranger Ugo called impatiently for supper and in a tone as if he knew his authority here to be unquestionable I expected you an hour ago said the peasant for I have had Signor Montoni s letter these three hours and I and my wife had given you up and gone to bed How did you fare in the storm Ill enough replied Ugo ill enough and we are like to fare ill enough here too unless you will make more haste Get us more wine and let us see what you have to eat The peasant placed before them all that his cottage afforded ham wine figs and grapes of such size and flavour as Emily had seldom tasted After taking refreshment she was shewn by the peasant s wife to her little bed chamber where she asked some questions concerning Montoni to which the woman whose name was Dorina gave reserved answers pretending ignorance of his excellenza s intention in sending Emily hither but acknowledging that her husband had been apprized of the circumstance Perceiving that she could obtain no intelligence concerning her destination Emily dismissed Dorina and retired to repose but all the busy scenes of her past and the anticipated ones of the future came to her anxious mind and conspired with the sense of her new situation to banish sleep CHAPTER VII Was nought around but images of rest Sleep soothing groves and quiet lawns between And flowery beds that slumbrous influence kept From poppies breath d and banks of pleasant green Where never yet was creeping creature seen Meantime unnumbered glittering streamlets play d And hurled every where their water s sheen That as they bicker d through the sunny glade Though restless still themselves a lulling murmur made THOMSON When Emily in the morning opened her casement she was surprised to observe the beauties that surrounded it The cottage was nearly embowered in the woods which were chiefly of chesnut intermixed with some cypress larch and sycamore Beneath the dark and spreading branches appeared to the north and to the east the woody Apennines rising in majestic amphitheatre not black with pines as she had been accustomed to see them but their loftiest summits crowned with antient forests of chesnut oak and oriental plane now animated with the rich tints of autumn and which swept downward to the valley uninterruptedly except where some bold rocky promontory looked out from among the foliage and caught the passing gleam Vineyards stretched along the feet of the mountains where the elegant villas of the Tuscan nobility frequently adorned the scene and overlooked slopes clothed with groves of olive mulberry orange and lemon The plain to which these declined was coloured with the riches of cultivation whose mingled hues were mellowed into harmony by an Italian sun Vines their purple clusters blushing between the russet foliage hung in luxuriant festoons from the branches of standard fig and cherry trees while pastures of verdure such as Emily had seldom seen in Italy enriched the banks of a stream that after descending from the mountains wound along the landscape which it reflected to a bay of the sea There far in the west the waters fading into the sky assumed a tint of the faintest purple and the line of separation between them was now and then discernible only by the progress of a sail brightened with the sunbeam along the horizon The cottage which was shaded by the woods from the intenser rays of the sun and was open only to his evening light was covered entirely with vines fig trees and jessamine whose flowers surpassed in size and fragrance any that Emily had seen These and ripening clusters of grapes hung round her little casement The turf that grew under the woods was inlaid with a variety of wild flowers and perfumed herbs and on the opposite margin of the stream whose current diffused freshness beneath the shades rose a grove of lemon and orange trees This though nearly opposite to Emily s window did not interrupt her prospect but rather heightened by its dark verdure the effect of the perspective and to her this spot was a bower of sweets whose charms communicated imperceptibly to her mind somewhat of their own serenity She was soon summoned to breakfast by the peasant s daughter a girl about seventeen of a pleasant countenance which Emily was glad to observe seemed animated with the pure affections of nature though the others that surrounded her expressed more or less the worst qualities cruelty ferocity cunning and duplicity of the latter style of countenance especially were those of the peasant and his wife Maddelina spoke little but what she said was in a soft voice and with an air of modesty and complacency that interested Emily who breakfasted at a separate table with Dorina while Ugo and Bertrand were taking a repast of Tuscany bacon and wine with their host near the cottage door when they had finished which Ugo rising hastily enquired for his mule and Emily learned that he was to return to Udolpho while Bertrand remained at the cottage a circumstance which though it did not surprise distressed her When Ugo was departed Emily proposed to walk in the neighbouring woods but on being told that she must not quit the cottage without having Bertrand for her attendant she withdrew to her own room There as her eyes settled on the towering Apennines she recollected the terrific scenery they had exhibited and the horrors she had suffered on the preceding night particularly at the moment when Bertrand had betrayed himself to be an assassin and these remembrances awakened a train of images which since they abstracted her from a consideration of her own situation she pursued for some time and then arranged in the following lines pleased to have discovered any innocent means by which she could beguile an hour of misfortune THE PILGRIM Slow o er the Apennine with bleeding feet A patient Pilgrim wound his lonely way To deck the Lady of Loretto s seat With all the little wealth his zeal could pay From mountain tops cold died the evening ray And stretch d in twilight slept the vale below And now the last last purple streaks of day Along the melancholy West fade slow High o er his head the restless pines complain As on their summit rolls the breeze of night Beneath the hoarse stream chides the rocks in vain The Pilgrim pauses on the dizzy height Then to the vale his cautious step he prest For there a hermit s cross was dimly seen Cresting the rock and there his limbs might rest Cheer d in the good man s cave by faggot s sheen On leafy beds nor guile his sleep molest Unhappy Luke he trusts a treacherous clue Behind the cliff the lurking robber stood No friendly moon his giant shadow threw Athwart the road to save the Pilgrim s blood On as he went a vesper hymn he sang The hymn that nightly sooth d him to repose Fierce on his harmless prey the ruffian sprang The Pilgrim bleeds to death his eye lids close Yet his meek spirit knew no vengeful care But dying for his murd rer breath d a sainted pray r This poem and that entitled THE TRAVELLER in vol ii have already appeared in a periodical publication A R Preferring the solitude of her room to the company of the persons below stairs Emily dined above and Maddelina was suffered to attend her from whose simple conversation she learned that the peasant and his wife were old inhabitants of this cottage which had been purchased for them by Montoni in reward of some service rendered him many years before by Marco to whom Carlo the steward at the castle was nearly related So many years ago Signora added Maddelina that I know nothing about it but my father did the Signor a great good for my mother has often said to him this cottage was the least he ought to have had To the mention of this circumstance Emily listened with a painful interest since it appeared to give a frightful colour to the character of Marco whose service thus rewarded by Montoni she could scarcely doubt have been criminal and if so had too much reason to believe that she had been committed into his hands for some desperate purpose Did you ever hear how many years it is said Emily who was considering of Signora Laurentini s disappearance from Udolpho since your father performed the services you spoke of It was a little before he came to live at the cottage Signora replied Maddelina and that is about eighteen years ago This was near the period when Signora Laurentini had been said to disappear and it occurred to Emily that Marco had assisted in that mysterious affair and perhaps had been employed in a murder This horrible suggestion fixed her in such profound reverie that Maddelina quitted the room unperceived by her and she remained unconscious of all around her for a considerable time Tears at length came to her relief after indulging which her spirits becoming calmer she ceased to tremble at a view of evils that might never arrive and had sufficient resolution to endeavour to withdraw her thoughts from the contemplation of her own interests Remembering the few books which even in the hurry of her departure from Udolpho she had put into her little package she sat down with one of them at her pleasant casement whence her eyes often wandered from the page to the landscape whose beauty gradually soothed her mind into gentle melancholy Here she remained alone till evening and saw the sun descend the western sky throw all his pomp of light and shadow upon the mountains and gleam upon the distant ocean and the stealing sails as he sunk amidst the waves Then at the musing hour of twilight her softened thoughts returned to Valancourt she again recollected every circumstance connected with the midnight music and all that might assist her conjecture concerning his imprisonment at the castle and becoming confirmed in the supposition that it was his voice she had heard there she looked back to that gloomy abode with emotions of grief and momentary regret Refreshed by the cool and fragrant air and her spirits soothed to a state of gentle melancholy by the stilly murmur of the brook below and of the woods around she lingered at her casement long after the sun had set watching the valley sinking into obscurity till only the grand outline of the surrounding mountains shadowed upon the horizon remained visible But a clear moon light that succeeded gave to the landscape what time gives to the scenes of past life when it softens all their harsher features and throws over the whole the mellowing shade of distant contemplation The scenes of La Vallee in the early morn of her life when she was protected and beloved by parents equally loved appeared in Emily s memory tenderly beautiful like the prospect before her and awakened mournful comparisons Unwilling to encounter the coarse behaviour of the peasant s wife she remained supperless in her room while she wept again over her forlorn and perilous situation a review of which entirely overcame the small remains of her fortitude and reducing her to temporary despondence she wished to be released from the heavy load of life that had so long oppressed her and prayed to Heaven to take her in its mercy to her parents Wearied with weeping she at length lay down on her mattress and sunk to sleep but was soon awakened by a knocking at her chamber door and starting up in terror she heard a voice calling her The image of Bertrand with a stilletto in his hand appeared to her alarmed fancy and she neither opened the door or answered but listened in profound silence till the voice repeating her name in the same low tone she demanded who called It is I Signora replied the voice which she now distinguished to be Maddelina s pray open the door Don t be frightened it is I And what brings you here so late Maddelina said Emily as she let her in Hush signora for heaven s sake hush if we are overheard I shall never be forgiven My father and mother and Bertrand are all gone to bed continued Maddelina as she gently shut the door and crept forward and I have brought you some supper for you had none you know Signora below stairs Here are some grapes and figs and half a cup of wine Emily thanked her but expressed apprehension lest this kindness should draw upon her the resentment of Dorina when she perceived the fruit was gone Take it back therefore Maddelina added Emily I shall suffer much less from the want of it than I should do if this act of good nature was to subject you to your mother s displeasure O Signora there is no danger of that replied Maddelina my mother cannot miss the fruit for I saved it from my own supper You will make me very unhappy if you refuse to take it Signora Emily was so much affected by this instance of the good girl s generosity that she remained for some time unable to reply and Maddelina watched her in silence till mistaking the cause of her emotion she said Do not weep so Signora My mother to be sure is a little cross sometimes but then it is soon over so don t take it so much to heart She often scolds me too but then I have learned to bear it and when she has done if I can but steal out into the woods and play upon my sticcado I forget it all directly Emily smiling through her tears told Maddelina that she was a good girl and then accepted her offering She wished anxiously to know whether Bertrand and Dorina had spoken of Montoni or of his designs concerning herself in the presence of Maddelina but disdained to tempt the innocent girl to a conduct so mean as that of betraying the private conversations of her parents When she was departing Emily requested that she would come to her room as often as she dared without offending her mother and Maddelina after promising that she would do so stole softly back again to her own chamber Thus several days passed during which Emily remained in her own room Maddelina attending her only at her repast whose gentle countenance and manners soothed her more than any circumstance she had known for many months Of her pleasant embowered chamber she now became fond and began to experience in it those feelings of security which we naturally attach to home In this interval also her mind having been undisturbed by any new circumstance of disgust or alarm recovered its tone sufficiently to permit her the enjoyment of her books among which she found some unfinished sketches of landscapes several blank sheets of paper with her drawing instruments and she was thus enabled to amuse herself with selecting some of the lovely features of the prospect that her window commanded and combining them in scenes to which her tasteful fancy gave a last grace In these little sketches she generally placed interesting groups characteristic of the scenery they animated and often contrived to tell with perspicuity some simple and affecting story when as a tear fell over the pictured griefs which her imagination drew she would forget for a moment her real sufferings Thus innocently she beguiled the heavy hours of misfortune and with meek patience awaited the events of futurity A beautiful evening that had succeeded to a sultry day at length induced Emily to walk though she knew that Bertrand must attend her and with Maddelina for her companion she left the cottage followed by Bertrand who allowed her to choose her own way The hour was cool and silent and she could not look upon the country around her without delight How lovely too appeared the brilliant blue that coloured all the upper region of the air and thence fading downward was lost in the saffron glow of the horizon Nor less so were the varied shades and warm colouring of the Apennines as the evening sun threw his slanting rays athwart their broken surface Emily followed the course of the stream under the shades that overhung its grassy margin On the opposite banks the pastures were animated with herds of cattle of a beautiful cream colour and beyond were groves of lemon and orange with fruit glowing on the branches frequent almost as the leaves which partly concealed it She pursued her way towards the sea which reflected the warm glow of sun set while the cliffs that rose over its edge were tinted with the last rays The valley was terminated on the right by a lofty promontory whose summit impending over the waves was crowned with a ruined tower now serving for the purpose of a beacon whose shattered battlements and the extended wings of some sea fowl that circled near it were still illumined by the upward beams of the sun though his disk was now sunk beneath the horizon while the lower part of the ruin the cliff on which it stood and the waves at its foot were shaded with the first tints of twilight Having reached this headland Emily gazed with solemn pleasure on the cliffs that extended on either hand along the sequestered shores some crowned with groves of pine and others exhibiting only barren precipices of grayish marble except where the crags were tufted with myrtle and other aromatic shrubs The sea slept in a perfect calm its waves dying in murmurs on the shores flowed with the gentlest undulation while its clear surface reflected in softened beauty the vermeil tints of the west Emily as she looked upon the ocean thought of France and of past times and she wished Oh how ardently and vainly wished that its waves would bear her to her distant native home Ah that vessel said she that vessel which glides along so stately with its tall sails reflected in the water is perhaps bound for France Happy happy bark She continued to gaze upon it with warm emotion till the gray of twilight obscured the distance and veiled it from her view The melancholy sound of the waves at her feet assisted the tenderness that occasioned her tears and this was the only sound that broke upon the hour till having followed the windings of the beach for some time a chorus of voices passed her on the air She paused a moment wishing to hear more yet fearing to be seen and for the first time looked back to Bertrand as her protector who was following at a short distance in company with some other person Reassured by this circumstance she advanced towards the sounds which seemed to arise from behind a high promontory that projected athwart the beach There was now a sudden pause in the music and then one female voice was heard to sing in a kind of chant Emily quickened her steps and winding round the rock saw within the sweeping bay beyond which was hung with woods from the borders of the beach to the very summit of the cliffs two groups of peasants one seated beneath the shades and the other standing on the edge of the sea round the girl who was singing and who held in her hand a chaplet of flowers which she seemed about to drop into the waves Emily listening with surprise and attention distinguished the following invocation delivered in the pure and elegant tongue of Tuscany and accompanied by a few pastoral instruments TO A SEA NYMPH O nymph who loves to float on the green wave When Neptune sleeps beneath the moon light hour Lull d by the music s melancholy pow r O nymph arise from out thy pearly cave For Hesper beams amid the twilight shade And soon shall Cynthia tremble o er the tide Gleam on these cliffs that bound the ocean s pride And lonely silence all the air pervade Then let thy tender voice at distance swell And steal along this solitary shore Sink on the breeze till dying heard no more Thou wak saint the sudden magic of thy shell While the long coast in echo sweet replies Thy soothing strains the pensive heart beguile And bid the visions of the future smile O nymph from out thy pearly cave arise Chorus ARISE Semi chorus ARISE The last words being repeated by the surrounding group the garland of flowers was thrown into the waves and the chorus sinking gradually into a chant died away in silence What can this mean Maddelina said Emily awakening from the pleasing trance into which the music had lulled her This is the eve of a festival Signora replied Maddelina and the peasants then amuse themselves with all kinds of sports But they talked of a sea nymph said Emily how came these good people to think of a sea nymph O Signora rejoined Maddelina mistaking the reason of Emily s surprise nobody BELIEVES in such things but our old songs tell of them and when we are at our sports we sometimes sing to them and throw garlands into the sea Emily had been early taught to venerate Florence as the seat of literature and of the fine arts but that its taste for classic story should descend to the peasants of the country occasioned her both surprise and admiration The Arcadian air of the girls next attracted her attention Their dress was a very short full petticoat of light green with a boddice of white silk the sleeves loose and tied up at the shoulders with ribbons and bunches of flowers Their hair falling in ringlets on their necks was also ornamented with flowers and with a small straw hat which set rather backward and on one side of the head gave an expression of gaiety and smartness to the whole figure When the song had concluded several of these girls approached Emily and inviting her to sit down among them offered her and Maddelina whom they knew grapes and figs Emily accepted their courtesy much pleased with the gentleness and grace of their manners which appeared to be perfectly natural to them and when Bertrand soon after approached and was hastily drawing her away a peasant holding up a flask invited him to drink a temptation which Bertrand was seldom very valiant in resisting Let the young lady join in the dance my friend said the peasant while we empty this flask They are going to begin directly Strike up my lads strike up your tambourines and merry flutes They sounded gaily and the younger peasants formed themselves into a circle which Emily would readily have joined had her spirits been in unison with their mirth Maddelina however tripped it lightly and Emily as she looked on the happy group lost the sense of her misfortunes in that of a benevolent pleasure But the pensive melancholy of her mind returned as she sat rather apart from the company listening to the mellow music which the breeze softened as it bore it away and watching the moon stealing its tremulous light over the waves and on the woody summits of the cliffs that wound along these Tuscan shores Meanwhile Bertrand was so well pleased with his first flask that he very willingly commenced the attack on a second and it was late before Emily not without some apprehension returned to the cottage After this evening she frequently walked with Maddelina but was never unattended by Bertrand and her mind became by degrees as tranquil as the circumstances of her situation would permit The quiet in which she was suffered to live encouraged her to hope that she was not sent hither with an evil design and had it not appeared probable that Valancourt was at this time an inhabitant of Udolpho she would have wished to remain at the cottage till an opportunity should offer of returning to her native country But concerning Montoni s motive for sending her into Tuscany she was more than ever perplexed nor could she believe that any consideration for her safety had influenced him on this occasion She had been some time at the cottage before she recollected that in the hurry of leaving Udolpho she had forgotten the papers committed to her by her late aunt relative to the Languedoc estates but though this remembrance occasioned her much uneasiness she had some hope that in the obscure place where they were deposited they would escape the detection of Montoni CHAPTER VIII My tongue hath but a heavier tale to say I play the torturer by small and small To lengthen out the worst that must be spoken RICHARD II 
1924-132574-0000	train-other-500	We now return for a moment to Venice where Count Morano was suffering under an accumulation of misfortunes Soon after his arrival in that city
1924-132574-0001	train-other-500	he had been arrested by order of the Senate and without knowing of what he was suspected was conveyed to a place of confinement whither the most strenuous enquiries of his friends had been unable to trace him
1924-132574-0002	train-other-500	Who the enemy was that had occasioned him this calamity he had not been able to guess unless indeed it was Montoni on whom his suspicions rested and not only with much apparent probability
1924-132574-0003	train-other-500	but with justice In the affair of the poisoned cup Montoni had suspected Morano but being unable to obtain the degree of proof which was necessary to convict him of a guilty intention
1924-132574-0004	train-other-500	he had recourse to means of other revenge than he could hope to obtain by prosecution He employed a person in whom he believed he might confide to drop a letter of accusation into

1924-132574-0006	train-other-500	As on these occasions the accuser is not confronted with the accused a man may falsely impeach his enemy and accomplish an unjust revenge without fear of punishment or detection
1924-132574-0007	train-other-500	That Montoni should have recourse to these diabolical means of ruining a person whom he suspected of having attempted his life is not in the least surprising In the letter
1924-132574-0008	train-other-500	which he had employed as the instrument of his revenge he accused Morano of designs against the state which he attempted to prove with all the plausible simplicity of which he was master and the Senate

1924-132574-0012	train-other-500	His castle was besieged by troops who seemed willing to dare every thing and to suffer patiently any hardships in pursuit of victory The strength of the fortress however withstood their attack
none	none	 and this with the vigorous defence of the garrison and the scarcity of provision on these wild mountains soon compelled the assailants to raise the siege 
1924-132574-0013	train-other-500	When Udolpho was once more left to the quiet possession of Montoni he dispatched Ugo into Tuscany for Emily whom he had sent from considerations of her personal safety
1924-132574-0014	train-other-500	to a place of greater security than a castle which was at that time liable to be overrun by his enemies Tranquillity being once more restored to Udolpho
1924-132574-0015	train-other-500	he was impatient to secure her again under his roof and had commissioned Ugo to assist Bertrand in guarding her back to the castle Thus compelled to return Emily bade the kind Maddelina farewell with regret
1924-132574-0016	train-other-500	and after about a fortnight s stay in Tuscany where she had experienced an interval of quiet which was absolutely necessary to sustain her long harassed spirits began once more to ascend the Apennines

1924-132574-0017	train-other-500	that extended at their feet and to the distant Mediterranean whose waves she had so often wished would bear her back to France The distress she felt on her return towards the place of her former sufferings was
1924-132574-0018	train-other-500	however softened by a conjecture that Valancourt was there and she found some degree of comfort in the thought of being near him notwithstanding the consideration that he was probably a prisoner
1924-132574-0019	train-other-500	It was noon when she had left the cottage and the evening was closed long before she came within the neighbourhood of Udolpho There was a moon
1924-132574-0020	train-other-500	but it shone only at intervals for the night was cloudy and lighted by the torch which Ugo carried the travellers paced silently along Emily musing on her situation and Bertrand and Ugo anticipating
1924-132574-0021	train-other-500	the comforts of a flask of wine and a good fire for they had perceived for some time the difference between the warm climate of the lowlands of Tuscany and the nipping air of these upper regions Emily was at length
none	none	 roused from her reverie by the far off sound of the castle clock to which she listened not without 
1924-132574-0022	train-other-500	some degree of awe as it rolled away on the breeze Another and another note succeeded and died in sullen murmur among the mountains to her mournful imagination
1924-132574-0023	train-other-500	it seemed a knell measuring out some fateful period for her Aye there is the old clock said Bertrand there he is still the cannon have not silenced him
none	none	 No answered Ugo

none	none	 I said that some of them would have a hit at the old fellow but he escaped 
1924-132574-0025	train-other-500	and the tower too The road winding round the base of a mountain they now came within view of the castle which was shewn in the perspective of the valley by a gleam of moon shine and then vanished in shade
1924-132574-0026	train-other-500	while even a transient view of it had awakened the poignancy of Emily s feelings Its massy and gloomy walls gave her terrible ideas of imprisonment and suffering yet as she advanced
1924-132574-0027	train-other-500	some degree of hope mingled with her terror for though this was certainly the residence of Montoni it was possibly also that of Valancourt and she could not approach a place where he might be
1924-132574-0028	train-other-500	without experiencing somewhat of the joy of hope They continued to wind along the valley and soon after she saw again the old walls and moon lit towers rising over the woods
1924-132574-0029	train-other-500	the strong rays enabled her also to perceive the ravages which the siege had made with the broken walls and shattered battlements for they were now at the foot of the steep on which Udolpho stood
1924-132574-0030	train-other-500	Massy fragments had rolled down among the woods through which the travellers now began to ascend and there mingled with the loose earth and pieces of rock they had brought with them
1924-132574-0031	train-other-500	The woods too had suffered much from the batteries above for here the enemy had endeavoured to screen themselves from the fire of the ramparts Many noble trees were levelled with the ground
1924-132574-0032	train-other-500	and others to a wide extent were entirely stripped of their upper branches We had better dismount said Ugo and lead the mules up the hill
none	none	 or we shall get into some of the holes which the balls have left 
1924-132574-0033	train-other-500	Here are plenty of them Give me the torch continued Ugo after they had dismounted and take care you don t stumble over any thing
none	none	 that lies in your way 
1924-132574-0034	train-other-500	for the ground is not yet cleared of the enemy How exclaimed Emily are any of the enemy here then Nay I don t know for that now he replied
1924-132574-0035	train-other-500	but when I came away I saw one or two of them lying under the trees As they proceeded the torch threw a gloomy light upon the ground and far among the recesses of the woods
1924-132574-0036	train-other-500	and Emily feared to look forward lest some object of horror should meet her eye The path was often strewn with broken heads of arrows and with shattered remains of armour
none	none	 such as at that period was mingled with the lighter dress of the soldiers 
1924-132574-0037	train-other-500	Bring the light hither said Bertrand I have stumbled over something that rattles loud enough
none	none	 Ugo holding up the torch 
1924-132574-0038	train-other-500	they perceived a steel breastplate on the ground which Bertrand raised and they saw that it was pierced through and that the lining was entirely covered with blood
1924-132574-0039	train-other-500	but upon Emily s earnest entreaties that they would proceed Bertrand uttering some joke upon the unfortunate person to whom it had belonged threw it hard upon the ground and they passed on
1924-132574-0040	train-other-500	At every step she took Emily feared to see some vestige of death Coming soon after to an opening in the woods Bertrand stopped to survey the ground which was encumbered with massy trunks
1924-132574-0041	train-other-500	and branches of the trees that had so lately adorned it and seemed to have been a spot particularly fatal to the besiegers for it was evident from the destruction of the trees
none	none	 that here the hottest fire of the garrison had been directed As Ugo held again forth the torch steel glittered between the fallen trees the ground beneath was covered with broken arms and with the torn vestments of soldiers 
1924-132574-0042	train-other-500	whose mangled forms Emily almost expected to see and she again entreated her companions to proceed who were however
none	none	 too intent in their examination to regard her 
1924-132574-0043	train-other-500	and she turned her eyes from this desolated scene to the castle above where she observed lights gliding along the ramparts Presently the castle clock struck twelve
1924-132574-0044	train-other-500	and then a trumpet sounded of which Emily enquired the occasion O they are only changing watch replied Ugo I do not remember this trumpet
none	none	 said Emily it is a new custom It is only an old one revived lady we always use it in time of war We have sounded it at midnight ever since the place was besieged Hark said Emily as the trumpet sounded again and in the next moment she heard a faint clash of arms and then the watchword passed along the terrace above and was answered from a distant part of the castle 
1924-132574-0045	train-other-500	after which all was again still She complained of cold and begged to go on Presently lady said Bertrand turning over some broken arms with the pike he usually carried
1924-132574-0046	train-other-500	What have we here Hark cried Emily what noise was that What noise was it said Ugo starting up and listening Hush repeated Emily
1924-132574-0047	train-other-500	It surely came from the ramparts above and on looking up they perceived a light moving along the walls while in the next instant the breeze swelling the voice sounded louder than before
none	none	 Who goes yonder cried a sentinel of the castle Speak or it will be worse for you Bertrand uttered a shout of joy Hah my brave comrade is it you said he 
1924-132574-0048	train-other-500	and he blew a shrill whistle which signal was answered by another from the soldier on watch and the party then passing forward soon after emerged from the woods upon the broken road
1924-132574-0049	train-other-500	that led immediately to the castle gates and Emily saw with renewed terror the whole of that stupendous structure Alas said she to herself I am going again into my prison
1924-132574-0050	train-other-500	Here has been warm work by saint Marco cried Bertrand waving a torch over the ground the balls have torn up the earth here with a vengeance
none	none	 Aye replied Ugo they were fired from that redoubt yonder and rare execution they did The enemy made a furious attack upon the great gates but they might have guessed they could never carry it there 
1924-132574-0051	train-other-500	for besides the cannon from the walls our archers on the two round towers showered down upon them at such a rate that by holy Peter there was no standing it I never saw a better sight in my life
none	none	 I laughed till my sides aked to see how the knaves scampered 
1924-132574-0052	train-other-500	Bertrand my good fellow thou shouldst have been among them I warrant thou wouldst have won the race Hah you are at your old tricks again
none	none	 said Bertrand in a surly tone It is well for thee thou art so near the castle 
1924-132574-0053	train-other-500	thou knowest I have killed my man before now
none	none	 Ugo replied only by a laugh 
1924-132574-0054	train-other-500	and then gave some further account of the siege to which as Emily listened she was struck by the strong contrast of the present scene with that which had so lately been acted here
none	none	 The mingled uproar of cannon drums and trumpets 
1924-132574-0055	train-other-500	the groans of the conquered and the shouts of the conquerors were now sunk into a silence so profound that it seemed as if death had triumphed alike over the vanquished and the victor
1924-132574-0056	train-other-500	The shattered condition of one of the towers of the great gates by no means confirmed the VALIANT account just given by Ugo of the scampering party who it was evident had not only made a stand
1924-132574-0057	train-other-500	but had done much mischief before they took to flight for this tower appeared as far as Emily could judge by the dim moon light that fell upon
none	none	 it to be laid open 
1924-132574-0058	train-other-500	and the battlements were nearly demolished While she gazed a light glimmered through one of the lower loop holes and disappeared
none	none	 but in the next moment 
1924-132574-0059	train-other-500	she perceived through the broken wall a soldier with a lamp ascending the narrow staircase that wound within the tower and remembering that it was the same she had passed up on the night when Barnardine
none	none	 had deluded her with a promise of seeing Madame Montoni fancy gave her somewhat of the terror she had then suffered She was now very near the gates over which the soldier having opened the door of the portal chamber 
1924-132574-0060	train-other-500	the lamp he carried gave her a dusky view of that terrible apartment and she almost sunk under the recollected horrors of the moment when she had drawn aside the curtain and discovered the object it was meant to conceal
none	none	 Perhaps said she to herself it is now used for a similar purpose 
1924-132574-0061	train-other-500	perhaps that soldier goes at this dead hour to watch over the corpse of his friend The little remains of her fortitude now gave way to the united force of remembered and anticipated horrors
1924-132574-0062	train-other-500	for the melancholy fate of Madame Montoni appeared to foretell her own She considered that
none	none	 though the Languedoc estates if she relinquished them would satisfy Montoni s avarice 
1924-132574-0063	train-other-500	they might not appease his vengeance which was seldom pacified but by a terrible sacrifice
none	none	 and she even thought 
1924-132574-0064	train-other-500	that were she to resign them the fear of justice might urge him either to detain her a prisoner or to take away her life They were now arrived at the gates where Bertrand
none	none	 observing the light glimmer through a small casement of the portal chamber 
1924-132574-0065	train-other-500	called aloud and the soldier looking out demanded who was there Here I have brought you a prisoner said Ugo open the gate and let us in Tell me first who it is that demands entrance
1924-132574-0066	train-other-500	replied the soldier What my old comrade cried Ugo don t you know me not know Ugo I have brought home a prisoner here bound hand and foot a fellow who has been drinking Tuscany wine
1924-132574-0067	train-other-500	while we here have been fighting You will not rest till you meet with your match said Bertrand sullenly Hah my comrade is it you said the soldier
none	none	 I ll be with you directly Emily presently heard his steps descending the stairs within 
1924-132574-0068	train-other-500	and then the heavy chain fall and the bolts undraw of a small postern door which he opened to admit the party He held the lamp low to shew the step of the gate
1924-132574-0069	train-other-500	and she found herself once more beneath the gloomy arch and heard the door close that seemed to shut her from the world for ever In the next moment she was in the first court of the castle
none	none	 where she surveyed the spacious and solitary area with a kind of calm despair while the dead hour of the night the gothic gloom of the surrounding buildings and the hollow and imperfect echoes which they returned 
1924-132574-0070	train-other-500	as Ugo and the soldier conversed together assisted to increase the melancholy forebodings of her heart Passing on to the second court a distant sound broke feebly on the silence
1924-132574-0071	train-other-500	and gradually swelling louder as they advanced Emily distinguished voices of revelry and laughter but they were to her far other than sounds of joy
none	none	 Why you have got some Tuscany wine among you HERE said Bertrand 
1924-132574-0072	train-other-500	if one may judge by the uproar that is going forward
none	none	 Ugo has taken a larger share of that than of fighting I ll be sworn 
1924-132574-0073	train-other-500	Who is carousing at this late hour His excellenza and the Signors replied the soldier it is a sign you are a stranger at the castle or you would not need to ask the question They are brave spirits that do without sleep
1924-132574-0074	train-other-500	they generally pass the night in good cheer would that we who keep the watch had a little of it It is cold work pacing the ramparts so many hours of the night if one has no good liquor to warm one s heart
1924-132574-0075	train-other-500	Courage my lad courage ought to warm your heart said Ugo Courage replied the soldier sharply with a menacing air which Ugo perceiving prevented his saying more by returning to the subject of the carousal
1924-132574-0076	train-other-500	This is a new custom said he when I left the castle the Signors used to sit up counselling Aye and for that matter carousing too replied the soldier but since the siege they have done nothing but make merry
1924-132574-0077	train-other-500	and if I was they I would settle accounts with myself
none	none	 for all my hard fighting the same way They had now crossed the second court and reached the hall door when the soldier bidding them good night hastened back to his post and while they waited for admittance Emily considered how she might avoid seeing Montoni and retire unnoticed to her former apartment for she shrunk from the thought of encountering either him or any of his party at this hour The uproar within the castle was now so loud that though Ugo knocked repeatedly at the hall door he was not heard by any of the servants a circumstance which increased Emily s alarm while it allowed her time to deliberate on the means of retiring unobserved for though she might perhaps pass up the great stair case unseen it was impossible she could find the way to her chamber without a light the difficulty of procuring which and the danger of wandering about the castle without one immediately struck her Bertrand had only a torch and she knew that the servants never brought a taper to the door for the hall was sufficiently lighted by the large tripod lamp which hung in the vaulted roof and while she should wait till Annette could bring a taper Montoni or some of his companions might discover her The door was now opened by Carlo and Emily having requested him to send Annette immediately with a light to the great gallery where she determined to await her passed on with hasty steps towards the stair case while Bertrand and Ugo with the torch followed old Carlo to the servants hall impatient for supper and the warm blaze of a wood fire Emily lighted only by the feeble rays which the lamp above threw between the arches of this extensive hall endeavoured to find her way to the stair case now hid in obscurity while the shouts of merriment that burst from a remote apartment served by heightening her terror to increase her perplexity and she expected every instant to see the door of that room open and Montoni and his companions issue forth Having at length reached the stair case and found her way to the top she seated herself on the last stair to await the arrival of Annette for the profound darkness of the gallery deterred her from proceeding farther and while she listened for her footstep she heard only distant sounds of revelry which rose in sullen echoes from among the arcades below Once she thought she heard a low sound from the dark gallery behind her and turning her eyes fancied she saw something luminous move in it and since she could not at this moment subdue the weakness that caused her fears she quitted her seat and crept softly down a few stairs lower Annette not yet appearing Emily now concluded that she was gone to bed and that nobody chose to call her up and the prospect that presented itself of passing the night in darkness in this place or in some other equally forlorn for she knew it would be impracticable to find her way through the intricacies of the galleries to her chamber drew tears of mingled terror and despondency from her eyes While thus she sat she fancied she heard again an odd sound from the gallery and she listened scarcely daring to breathe but the increasing voices below overcame every other sound Soon after she heard Montoni and his companions burst into the hall who spoke as if they were much intoxicated and seemed to be advancing towards the stair case She now remembered that they must come this way to their chambers and forgetting all the terrors of the gallery hurried towards it with an intention of secreting herself in some of the passages that opened beyond and of endeavouring when the Signors were retired to find her way to her own room or to that of Annette which was in a remote part of the castle With extended arms she crept along the gallery still hearing the voices of persons below who seemed to stop in conversation at the foot of the stair case and then pausing for a moment to listen half fearful of going further into the darkness of the gallery where she still imagined from the noise she had heard that some person was lurking They are already informed of my arrival said she and Montoni is coming himself to seek me In the present state of his mind his purpose must be desperate Then recollecting the scene that had passed in the corridor on the night preceding her departure from the castle O Valancourt said she I must then resign you for ever To brave any longer the injustice of Montoni would not be fortitude but rashness Still the voices below did not draw nearer but they became louder and she distinguished those of Verezzi and Bertolini above the rest while the few words she caught made her listen more anxiously for others The conversation seemed to concern herself and having ventured to step a few paces nearer to the stair case she discovered that they were disputing about her each seeming to claim some former promise of Montoni who appeared at first inclined to appease and to persuade them to return to their wine but afterwards to be weary of the dispute and saying that he left them to settle it as they could was returning with the rest of the party to the apartment he had just quitted Verezzi then stopped him Where is she Signor said he in a voice of impatience tell us where she is I have already told you that I do not know replied Montoni who seemed to be somewhat overcome with wine but she is most probably gone to her apartment Verezzi and Bertolini now desisted from their enquiries and sprang to the stair case together while Emily who during this discourse had trembled so excessively that she had with difficulty supported herself seemed inspired with new strength the moment she heard the sound of their steps and ran along the gallery dark as it was with the fleetness of a fawn But long before she reached its extremity the light which Verezzi carried flashed upon the walls both appeared and instantly perceiving Emily pursued her At this moment Bertolini whose steps though swift were not steady and whose impatience overcame what little caution he had hitherto used stumbled and fell at his length The lamp fell with him and was presently expiring on the floor but Verezzi regardless of saving it seized the advantage this accident gave him over his rival and followed Emily to whom however the light had shown one of the passages that branched from the gallery and she instantly turned into it Verezzi could just discern the way she had taken and this he pursued but the sound of her steps soon sunk in distance while he less acquainted with the passage was obliged to proceed through the dark with caution lest he should fall down a flight of steps such as in this extensive old castle frequently terminated an avenue This passage at length brought Emily to the corridor into which her own chamber opened and not hearing any footstep she paused to take breath and consider what was the safest design to be adopted She had followed this passage merely because it was the first that appeared and now that she had reached the end of it was as perplexed as before Whither to go or how further to find her way in the dark she knew not she was aware only that she must not seek her apartment for there she would certainly be sought and her danger increased every instant while she remained near it Her spirits and her breath however were so much exhausted that she was compelled to rest for a few minutes at the end of the passage and still she heard no steps approaching As thus she stood light glimmered under an opposite door of the gallery and from its situation she knew that it was the door of that mysterious chamber where she had made a discovery so shocking that she never remembered it but with the utmost horror That there should be light in this chamber and at this hour excited her strong surprise and she felt a momentary terror concerning it which did not permit her to look again for her spirits were now in such a state of weakness that she almost expected to see the door slowly open and some horrible object appear at it Still she listened for a step along the passage and looked up it where not a ray of light appearing she concluded that Verezzi had gone back for the lamp and believing that he would shortly be there she again considered which way she should go or rather which way she could find in the dark A faint ray still glimmered under the opposite door but so great and perhaps so just was her horror of that chamber that she would not again have tempted its secrets though she had been certain of obtaining the light so important to her safety She was still breathing with difficulty and resting at the end of the passage when she heard a rustling sound and then a low voice so very near her that it seemed close to her ear but she had presence of mind to check her emotions and to remain quite still in the next moment she perceived it to be the voice of Verezzi who did not appear to know that she was there but to have spoken to himself The air is fresher here said he this should be the corridor Perhaps he was one of those heroes whose courage can defy an enemy better than darkness and he tried to rally his spirits with the sound of his own voice However this might be he turned to the right and proceeded with the same stealing steps towards Emily s apartment apparently forgetting that in darkness she could easily elude his search even in her chamber and like an intoxicated person he followed pertinaciously the one idea that had possessed his imagination The moment she heard his steps steal away she left her station and moved softly to the other end of the corridor determined to trust again to chance and to quit it by the first avenue she could find but before she could effect this light broke upon the walls of the gallery and looking back she saw Verezzi crossing it towards her chamber She now glided into a passage that opened on the left without as she thought being perceived but in the next instant another light glimmering at the further end of this passage threw her into new terror While she stopped and hesitated which way to go the pause allowed her to perceive that it was Annette who advanced and she hurried to meet her but her imprudence again alarmed Emily on perceiving whom she burst into a scream of joy and it was some minutes before she could be prevailed with to be silent or to release her mistress from the ardent clasp in which she held her When at length Emily made Annette comprehend her danger they hurried towards Annette s room which was in a distant part of the castle No apprehensions however could yet silence the latter Oh dear ma amselle said she as they passed along what a terrified time have I had of it Oh I thought I should have died an hundred times I never thought I should live to see you again and I never was so glad to see any body in my whole life as I am to see you now Hark cried Emily we are pursued that was the echo of steps No ma amselle said Annette it was only the echo of a door shutting sound runs along these vaulted passages so that one is continually deceived by it if one does but speak or cough it makes a noise as loud as a cannon Then there is the greater necessity for us to be silent said Emily pr ythee say no more till we reach your chamber Here at length they arrived without interruption and Annette having fastened the door Emily sat down on her little bed to recover breath and composure To her enquiry whether Valancourt was among the prisoners in the castle Annette replied that she had not been able to hear but that she knew there were several persons confined She then proceeded in her tedious way to give an account of the siege or rather a detail of her terrors and various sufferings during the attack But added she when I heard the shouts of victory from the ramparts I thought we were all taken and gave myself up for lost instead of which WE had driven the enemy away I went then to the north gallery and saw a great many of them scampering away among the mountains but the rampart walls were all in ruins as one may say and there was a dismal sight to see down among the woods below where the poor fellows were lying in heaps but were carried off presently by their comrades While the siege was going on the Signor was here and there and every where at the same time as Ludovico told me for he would not let me see any thing hardly and locked me up as he has often done before in a room in the middle of the castle and used to bring me food and come and talk with me as often as he could and I must say if it had not been for Ludovico I should have died outright Well Annette said Emily and how have affairs gone on since the siege O sad hurly burly doings ma amselle replied Annette the Signors have done nothing but sit and drink and game ever since They sit up all night and play among themselves for all those riches and fine things they brought in some time since when they used to go out a robbing or as good for days together and then they have dreadful quarrels about who loses and who wins That fierce Signor Verezzi is always losing as they tell me and Signor Orsino wins from him and this makes him very wroth and they have had several hard set to s about it Then all those fine ladies are at the castle still and I declare I am frighted whenever I meet any of them in the passages Surely Annette said Emily starting I heard a noise listen After a long pause No ma amselle said Annette it was only the wind in the gallery I often hear it when it shakes the old doors at the other end But won t you go to bed ma amselle you surely will not sit up starving all night Emily now laid herself down on the mattress and desired Annette to leave the lamp burning on the hearth having done which the latter placed herself beside Emily who however was not suffered to sleep for she again thought she heard a noise from the passage and Annette was again trying to convince her that it was only the wind when footsteps were distinctly heard near the door Annette was now starting from the bed but Emily prevailed with her to remain there and listened with her in a state of terrible expectation The steps still loitered at the door when presently an attempt was made on the lock and in the next instant a voice called For heaven s sake Annette do not answer said Emily softly remain quite still but I fear we must extinguish the lamp or its glare will betray us Holy Virgin exclaimed Annette forgetting her discretion I would not be in darkness now for the whole world While she spoke the voice became louder than before and repeated Annette s name Blessed Virgin cried she suddenly it is only Ludovico She rose to open the door but Emily prevented her till they should be more certain that it was he alone with whom Annette at length talked for some time and learned that he was come to enquire after herself whom he had let out of her room to go to Emily and that he was now returned to lock her in again Emily fearful of being overheard if they conversed any longer through the door consented that it should be opened and a young man appeared whose open countenance confirmed the favourable opinion of him which his care of Annette had already prompted her to form She entreated his protection should Verezzi make this requisite and Ludovico offered to pass the night in an old chamber adjoining that opened from the gallery and on the first alarm to come to their defence Emily was much soothed by this proposal and Ludovico having lighted his lamp went to his station while she once more endeavoured to repose on her mattress But a variety of interests pressed upon her attention and prevented sleep She thought much on what Annette had told her of the dissolute manners of Montoni and his associates and more of his present conduct towards herself and of the danger from which she had just escaped From the view of her present situation she shrunk as from a new picture of terror She saw herself in a castle inhabited by vice and violence seated beyond the reach of law or justice and in the power of a man whose perseverance was equal to every occasion and in whom passions of which revenge was not the weakest entirely supplied the place of principles She was compelled once more to acknowledge that it would be folly and not fortitude any longer to dare his power and resigning all hopes of future happiness with Valancourt she determined that on the following morning she would compromise with Montoni and give up her estates on condition that he would permit her immediate return to France Such considerations kept her waking for many hours but the night passed without further alarm from Verezzi On the next morning Emily had a long conversation with Ludovico in which she heard circumstances concerning the castle and received hints of the designs of Montoni that considerably increased her alarms On expressing her surprise that Ludovico who seemed to be so sensible of the evils of his situation should continue in it he informed her that it was not his intention to do so and she then ventured to ask him if he would assist her to escape from the castle Ludovico assured her of his readiness to attempt this but strongly represented the difficulty of the enterprise and the certain destruction which must ensure should Montoni overtake them before they had passed the mountains he however promised to be watchful of every circumstance that might contribute to the success of the attempt and to think upon some plan of departure Emily now confided to him the name of Valancourt and begged he would enquire for such a person among the prisoners in the castle for the faint hope which this conversation awakened made her now recede from her resolution of an immediate compromise with Montoni She determined if possible to delay this till she heard further from Ludovico and if his designs were found to be impracticable to resign the estates at once Her thoughts were on this subject when Montoni who was now recovered from the intoxication of the preceding night sent for her and she immediately obeyed the summons He was alone I find said he that you were not in your chamber last night where were you Emily related to him some circumstances of her alarm and entreated his protection from a repetition of them You know the terms of my protection said he if you really value this you will secure it His open declaration that he would only conditionally protect her while she remained a prisoner in the castle shewed Emily the necessity of an immediate compliance with his terms but she first demanded whether he would permit her immediately to depart if she gave up her claim to the contested estates In a very solemn manner he then assured her that he would and immediately laid before her a paper which was to transfer the right of those estates to himself She was for a considerable time unable to sign it and her heart was torn with contending interests for she was about to resign the happiness of all her future years the hope which had sustained her in so many hours of adversity After hearing from Montoni a recapitulation of the conditions of her compliance and a remonstrance that his time was valuable she put her hand to the paper when she had done which she fell back in her chair but soon recovered and desired that he would give orders for her departure and that he would allow Annette to accompany her Montoni smiled It was necessary to deceive you said he there was no other way of making you act reasonably you shall go but it must not be at present I must first secure these estates by possession when that is done you may return to France if you will The deliberate villany with which he violated the solemn engagement he had just entered into shocked Emily as much as the certainty that she had made a fruitless sacrifice and must still remain his prisoner She had no words to express what she felt and knew that it would have been useless if she had As she looked piteously at Montoni he turned away and at the same time desired she would withdraw to her apartment but unable to leave the room she sat down in a chair near the door and sighed heavily She had neither words nor tears Why will you indulge this childish grief said he Endeavour to strengthen your mind to bear patiently what cannot now be avoided you have no real evil to lament be patient and you will be sent back to France At present retire to your apartment I dare not go sir said she where I shall be liable to the intrusion of Signor Verezzi Have I not promised to protect you said Montoni You have promised sir replied Emily after some hesitation And is not my promise sufficient added he sternly You will recollect your former promise Signor said Emily trembling and may determine for me whether I ought to rely upon this Will you provoke me to declare to you that I will not protect you then said Montoni in a tone of haughty displeasure If that will satisfy you I will do it immediately Withdraw to your chamber before I retract my promise you have nothing to fear there Emily left the room and moved slowly into the hall where the fear of meeting Verezzi or Bertolini made her quicken her steps though she could scarcely support herself and soon after she reached once more her own apartment Having looked fearfully round her to examine if any person was there and having searched every part of it she fastened the door and sat down by one of the casements Here while she looked out for some hope to support her fainting spirits which had been so long harassed and oppressed that if she had not now struggled much against misfortune they would have left her perhaps for ever she endeavoured to believe that Montoni did really intend to permit her return to France as soon as he had secured her property and that he would in the mean time protect her from insult but her chief hope rested with Ludovico who she doubted not would be zealous in her cause though he seemed almost to despair of success in it One circumstance however she had to rejoice in Her prudence or rather her fears had saved her from mentioning the name of Valancourt to Montoni which she was several times on the point of doing before she signed the paper and of stipulating for his release if he should be really a prisoner in the castle Had she done this Montoni s jealous fears would now probably have loaded Valancourt with new severities and have suggested the advantage of holding him a captive for life Thus passed the melancholy day as she had before passed many in this same chamber When night drew on she would have withdrawn herself to Annette s bed had not a particular interest inclined her to remain in this chamber in spite of her fears for when the castle should be still and the customary hour arrived she determined to watch for the music which she had formerly heard Though its sounds might not enable her positively to determine whether Valancourt was there they would perhaps strengthen her opinion that he was and impart the comfort so necessary to her present support But on the other hand if all should be silent She hardly dared to suffer her thoughts to glance that way but waited with impatient expectation the approaching hour The night was stormy the battlements of the castle appeared to rock in the wind and at intervals long groans seemed to pass on the air such as those which often deceive the melancholy mind in tempests and amidst scenes of desolation Emily heard as formerly the sentinels pass along the terrace to their posts and looking out from her casement observed that the watch was doubled a precaution which appeared necessary enough when she threw her eyes on the walls and saw their shattered condition The well known sounds of the soldiers march and of their distant voices which passed her in the wind and were lost again recalled to her memory the melancholy sensation she had suffered when she formerly heard the same sounds and occasioned almost involuntary comparisons between her present and her late situation But this was no subject for congratulations and she wisely checked the course of her thoughts while as the hour was not yet come in which she had been accustomed to hear the music she closed the casement and endeavoured to await it in patience The door of the stair case she tried to secure as usual with some of the furniture of the room but this expedient her fears now represented to her to be very inadequate to the power and perseverance of Verezzi and she often looked at a large and heavy chest that stood in the chamber with wishes that she and Annette had strength enough to move it While she blamed the long stay of this girl who was still with Ludovico and some other of the servants she trimmed her wood fire to make the room appear less desolate and sat down beside it with a book which her eyes perused while her thoughts wandered to Valancourt and her own misfortunes As she sat thus she thought in a pause of the wind she distinguished music and went to the casement to listen but the loud swell of the gust overcame every other sound When the wind sunk again she heard distinctly in the deep pause that succeeded the sweet strings of a lute but again the rising tempest bore away the notes and again was succeeded by a solemn pause Emily trembling with hope and fear opened her casement to listen and to try whether her own voice could be heard by the musician for to endure any longer this state of torturing suspense concerning Valancourt seemed to be utterly impossible There was a kind of breathless stillness in the chambers that permitted her to distinguish from below the tender notes of the very lute she had formerly heard and with it a plaintive voice made sweeter by the low rustling sound that now began to creep along the wood tops till it was lost in the rising wind Their tall heads then began to wave while through a forest of pine on the left the wind groaning heavily rolled onward over the woods below bending them almost to their roots and as the long resounding gale swept away other woods on the right seemed to answer the loud lament then others further still softened it into a murmur that died into silence Emily listened with mingled awe and expectation hope and fear and again the melting sweetness of the lute was heard and the same solemn breathing voice Convinced that these came from an apartment underneath she leaned far out of her window that she might discover whether any light was there but the casements below as well as those above were sunk so deep in the thick walls of the castle that she could not see them or even the faint ray that probably glimmered through their bars She then ventured to call but the wind bore her voice to the other end of the terrace and then the music was heard as before in the pause of the gust Suddenly she thought she heard a noise in her chamber and she drew herself within the casement but in a moment after distinguishing Annette s voice at the door she concluded it was her she had heard before and she let her in Move softly Annette to the casement said she and listen with me the music is returned They were silent till the measure changing Annette exclaimed Holy Virgin I know that song well it is a French song one of the favourite songs of my dear country This was the ballad Emily had heard on a former night though not the one she had first listened to from the fishing house in Gascony O it is a Frenchman that sings said Annette it must be Monsieur Valancourt Hark Annette do not speak so loud said Emily we may be overheard What by the Chevalier said Annette No replied Emily mournfully but by somebody who may report us to the Signor What reason have you to think it is Monsieur Valancourt who sings But hark now the voice swells louder Do you recollect those tones I fear to trust my own judgment I never happened to hear the Chevalier sing Mademoiselle replied Annette who as Emily was disappointed to perceive had no stronger reason for concluding this to be Valancourt than that the musician must be a Frenchman Soon after she heard the song of the fishing house and distinguished her own name which was repeated so distinctly that Annette had heard it also She trembled sunk into a chair by the window and Annette called aloud Monsieur Valancourt Monsieur Valancourt while Emily endeavoured to check her but she repeated the call more loudly than before and the lute and the voice suddenly stopped Emily listened for some time in a state of intolerable suspense but no answer being returned It does not signify Mademoiselle said Annette it is the Chevalier and I will speak to him No Annette said Emily I think I will speak myself if it is he he will know my voice and speak again Who is it said she that sings at this late hour A long silence ensued and having repeated the question she perceived some faint accents mingling in the blast that swept by but the sounds were so distant and passed so suddenly that she could scarcely hear them much less distinguish the words they uttered or recognise the voice After another pause Emily called again and again they heard a voice but as faintly as before and they perceived that there were other circumstances besides the strength and direction of the wind to content with for the great depth at which the casements were fixed in the castle walls contributed still more than the distance to prevent articulated sounds from being understood though general ones were easily heard Emily however ventured to believe from the circumstance of her voice alone having been answered that the stranger was Valancourt as well as that he knew her and she gave herself up to speechless joy Annette however was not speechless She renewed her calls but received no answer and Emily fearing that a further attempt which certainly was as present highly dangerous might expose them to the guards of the castle while it could not perhaps terminate her suspense insisted on Annette s dropping the enquiry for this night though she determined herself to question Ludovico on the subject in the morning more urgently than she had yet done She was now enabled to say that the stranger whom she had formerly heard was still in the castle and to direct Ludovico to that part of it in which he was confined Emily attended by Annette continued at the casement for some time but all remained still they heard neither lute or voice again and Emily was now as much oppressed by anxious joy as she lately was by a sense of her misfortunes With hasty steps she paced the room now half calling on Valancourt s name then suddenly stopping and now going to the casement and listening where however she heard nothing but the solemn waving of the woods Sometimes her impatience to speak to Ludovico prompted her to send Annette to call him but a sense of the impropriety of this at midnight restrained her Annette meanwhile as impatient as her mistress went as often to the casement to listen and returned almost as much disappointed She at length mentioned Signor Verezzi and her fear lest he should enter the chamber by the staircase door But the night is now almost past Mademoiselle said she recollecting herself there is the morning light beginning to peep over those mountains yonder in the east Emily had forgotten till this moment that such a person existed as Verezzi and all the danger that had appeared to threaten her but the mention of his name renewed her alarm and she remembered the old chest that she had wished to place against the door which she now with Annette attempted to move but it was so heavy that they could not lift it from the floor What is in this great old chest Mademoiselle said Annette that makes it so weighty Emily having replied that she found it in the chamber when she first came to the castle and had never examined it Then I will ma amselle said Annette and she tried to lift the lid but this was held by a lock for which she had no key and which indeed appeared from its peculiar construction to open with a spring The morning now glimmered through the casements and the wind had sunk into a calm Emily looked out upon the dusky woods and on the twilight mountains just stealing in the eye and saw the whole scene after the storm lying in profound stillness the woods motionless and the clouds above through which the dawn trembled scarcely appearing to move along the heavens One soldier was pacing the terrace beneath with measured steps and two more distant were sunk asleep on the walls wearied with the night s watch Having inhaled for a while the pure spirit of the air and of vegetation which the late rains had called forth and having listened once more for a note of music she now closed the casement and retired to rest CHAPTER IV Thus on the chill Lapponian s dreary land 
1924-132576-0000	train-other-500	For many a long month lost in snow profound When Sol from Cancer sends the seasons bland And in their northern cave the storms hath bound From silent mountains straight with startling sound
1924-132576-0001	train-other-500	Torrents are hurl d green hills emerge and lo The trees with foliage cliffs with flow rs are crown d Pure rills through vales of verdure warbling go And wonder love and joy
1924-132576-0002	train-other-500	the peasant s heart o erflow BEATTIE Several of her succeeding days passed in suspense for Ludovico could only learn from the soldiers
1924-132576-0003	train-other-500	that there was a prisoner in the apartment described to him by Emily and that he was a Frenchman whom they had taken in one of their skirmishes with a party of his countrymen During this interval
none	none	 Emily escaped the persecutions of Bertolini and Verezzi by confining herself to her apartment except that sometimes in an evening she ventured to walk in the adjoining corridor Montoni appeared to respect his last promise though he had prophaned his first 
1924-132576-0004	train-other-500	for to his protection only could she attribute her present repose and in this she was now so secure that she did not wish to leave the castle till she could obtain some certainty concerning Valancourt for which she waited
1924-132576-0005	train-other-500	indeed without any sacrifice of her own comfort since no circumstance had occurred to make her escape probable On the fourth day Ludovico informed her
1924-132576-0006	train-other-500	that he had hopes of being admitted to the presence of the prisoner it being the turn of a soldier with whom he had been for some time familiar to attend him on the following night He was not deceived in his hope
1924-132576-0007	train-other-500	for under pretence of carrying in a pitcher of water he entered the prison
none	none	 though his prudence having prevented him from telling the sentinel the real motive of his visit 
1924-132576-0008	train-other-500	he was obliged to make his conference with the prisoner a very short one Emily awaited the result in her own apartment
1924-132576-0009	train-other-500	Ludovico having promised to accompany Annette to the corridor in the evening where after several hours impatiently counted he arrived Emily having then uttered the name of Valancourt could articulate no more
1924-132576-0010	train-other-500	but hesitated in trembling expectation The Chevalier would not entrust me with his name Signora replied Ludovico but when I just mentioned yours he seemed overwhelmed with joy
none	none	 though he was not so much surprised as I expected Does he then remember me she exclaimed O it is Mons Valancourt 
1924-132576-0011	train-other-500	said Annette and looked impatiently at Ludovico who understood her look and replied to Emily Yes lady the Chevalier does indeed remember you and I am sure has a very great regard for you
1924-132576-0012	train-other-500	and I made bold to say you had for him He then enquired how you came to know he was in the castle and whether you ordered me to speak to him The first question I could not answer
1924-132576-0013	train-other-500	but the second I did and then he went off into his ecstasies again I was afraid his joy would have betrayed him to the sentinel at the door But how does he look Ludovico interrupted Emily
none	none	 is he not melancholy and ill with this long confinement Why as to melancholy 
1924-132576-0014	train-other-500	I saw no symptom of that lady while I was with him for he seemed in the finest spirits I ever saw any body in in all my life His countenance was all joy and
1924-132576-0015	train-other-500	if one may judge from that he was very well but I did not ask him Did he send me no message said Emily O yes Signora and something besides replied Ludovico who searched his pockets
1924-132576-0016	train-other-500	Surely I have not lost it added he The Chevalier said he would have written madam if he had had pen and ink and was going to have sent a very long message when the sentinel entered the room
1924-132576-0017	train-other-500	but not before he had give me this Ludovico then drew forth a miniature from his bosom which Emily received with a trembling hand and perceived to be a portrait of herself
none	none	 the very picture which her mother had lost so strangely in the fishing house at La Vallee Tears of mingled joy and tenderness flowed to her eyes while Ludovico proceeded Tell your lady said the Chevalier 
1924-132576-0018	train-other-500	as he gave me the picture that this has been my companion and only solace in all my misfortunes Tell her that I have worn it next my heart and that I sent it her as the pledge of an affection which can never die
none	none	 that I would not part with it 
1924-132576-0019	train-other-500	but to her for the wealth of worlds and that I now part with it only in the hope of soon receiving it from her hands Tell her Just then Signora the sentinel came in and the Chevalier said no more
none	none	 but he had before asked me to contrive an interview for him with you and when I told him how little hope I had of prevailing with the guard to assist me he said that was not perhaps of so much consequence as I imagined and bade me contrive 
1924-132576-0020	train-other-500	to bring back your answer and he would inform me
none	none	 of more than he chose to do then 
1924-132576-0021	train-other-500	So this I think lady is the whole of what passed How Ludovico shall I reward you for your zeal said Emily but indeed I do not now possess the means
1924-132576-0022	train-other-500	When can you see the Chevalier again That is uncertain Signora replied he
none	none	 It depends upon who stands guard next 
1924-132576-0023	train-other-500	there are not more than one or two among them
none	none	 from whom I would dare to ask admittance to the prison chamber 
1924-132576-0024	train-other-500	I need not bid you remember Ludovico resumed Emily how very much interested I am in your seeing the Chevalier soon and when you do so tell him that I have received the picture and with the sentiments he wished
none	none	 Tell him I have suffered much and still suffer She paused But shall I tell him you will see him lady 
1924-132576-0025	train-other-500	said Ludovico Most certainly I will replied Emily But when Signora and where That must depend upon circumstances returned Emily The place and the hour must be regulated by his opportunities
1924-132576-0026	train-other-500	As to the place mademoiselle said Annette there is no other place in the castle besides this corridor where WE can see him in safety you know and as for the hour it must be when all the Signors are asleep if that ever happens
1924-132576-0027	train-other-500	You may mention these circumstances to the Chevalier Ludovico said she checking the flippancy of Annette and leave them to his judgment and opportunity Tell him my heart is unchanged
1924-132576-0028	train-other-500	But above all let him see you again as soon as possible and Ludovico I think it is needless to tell you I shall very anxiously look for you Having then wished her good night Ludovico descended the staircase
1924-132576-0029	train-other-500	and Emily retired to rest but not to sleep for joy now rendered her as wakeful as she had ever been from grief Montoni and his castle had all vanished from her mind like the frightful vision of a necromancer
1924-132576-0030	train-other-500	and she wandered once more in fairy scenes of unfading happiness As when beneath the beam Of summer moons the distant woods among Or by some flood all silver d with the gleam
1924-132576-0031	train-other-500	The soft embodied Fays thro airy portals stream A week elapsed before Ludovico again visited the prison for the sentinels during that period were men in whom he could not confide
1924-132576-0032	train-other-500	and he feared to awaken curiosity by asking to see their prisoner In this interval he communicated to Emily terrific reports of what was passing in the castle of riots quarrels and of carousals more alarming than either
1924-132576-0033	train-other-500	while from some circumstances which he mentioned she not only doubted whether Montoni meant ever to release her but greatly feared that he had designs concerning her such as she had formerly dreaded
1924-132576-0034	train-other-500	Her name was frequently mentioned in the conversations which Bertolini and Verezzi held together and at those times they were frequently in contention
none	none	 Montoni had lost large sums to Verezzi so that there was a dreadful possibility of his designing her to be a substitute for the debt but as she was ignorant that he had formerly encouraged the hopes of Bertolini also concerning herself after the latter had done him some signal service she knew not how to account for these contentions between Bertolini and Verezzi 
1924-132576-0035	train-other-500	The cause of them however appeared to be of little consequence for she thought she saw destruction approaching in many forms and her entreaties to Ludovico to contrive an escape and to see the prisoner again
1924-132576-0036	train-other-500	were more urgent than ever At length he informed her that he had again visited the Chevalier who had directed him to confide in the guard of the prison
1924-132576-0037	train-other-500	from whom he had already received some instances of kindness and who had promised to permit his going into the castle for half an hour on the ensuing night when Montoni and his companions should be engaged
1924-132576-0038	train-other-500	at their carousals This was kind to be sure added Ludovico but Sebastian knows he runs no risque in letting the Chevalier out for
1924-132576-0039	train-other-500	if he can get beyond the bars and iron doors of the castle he must be cunning indeed But the Chevalier desired me Signora
none	none	 to go to you immediately 
1924-132576-0040	train-other-500	and to beg you would allow him to visit you this night if it was only for a moment for that he could no longer live under the same roof without seeing you the hour he said he could not mention for it must depend on circumstances
1924-132576-0041	train-other-500	just as you said Signora and the place he desired you would appoint as knowing which was best for your own safety Emily was now so much agitated by the near prospect of meeting Valancourt
none	none	 that it was some time before she could give any answer to Ludovico or consider of the place of meeting when she did she saw none that promised so much security as the corridor near her own apartment which she was checked from leaving 
1924-132576-0042	train-other-500	by the apprehension of meeting any of Montoni s guests on their way to their rooms and she dismissed the scruples which delicacy opposed now that a serious danger was to be avoided by encountering them
1924-132576-0043	train-other-500	It was settled therefore that the Chevalier should meet her in the corridor at that hour of the night which Ludovico who was to be upon the watch should judge safest and Emily
1924-132576-0044	train-other-500	as may be imagined passed this interval in a tumult of hope and joy anxiety and impatience Never since her residence in the castle had she watched with so much pleasure the sun set behind the mountains
1924-132576-0045	train-other-500	and twilight shade and darkness veil the scene as on this evening She counted the notes of the great clock and listened to the steps of the sentinels
none	none	 as they changed the watch only to rejoice 
1924-132576-0046	train-other-500	that another hour was gone O Valancourt said she after all I have suffered
none	none	 after our long long separation 
1924-132576-0047	train-other-500	when I thought I should never never see you more we are still to meet again O I have endured grief and anxiety and terror and let me then not sink beneath this joy
1924-132576-0048	train-other-500	These were moments when it was impossible for her to feel emotions of regret or melancholy for any ordinary interests even the reflection that she had resigned the estates
1924-132576-0049	train-other-500	which would have been a provision for herself and Valancourt for life threw only a light and transient shade upon her spirits The idea of Valancourt and that she should see him so soon alone occupied her heart
1924-132576-0050	train-other-500	At length the clock struck twelve she opened the door to listen if any noise was in the castle and heard only distant shouts of riot and laughter echoed feebly along the gallery
1924-132576-0051	train-other-500	She guessed that the Signor and his guests were at the banquet They are now engaged for the night said she and Valancourt will soon be here Having softly closed the door
1924-132576-0052	train-other-500	she paced the room with impatient steps and often went to the casement to listen for the lute but all was silent and her agitation every moment increasing she was at length unable to support herself
1924-132576-0053	train-other-500	and sat down by the window Annette whom she detained was in the meantime as loquacious as usual but Emily heard scarcely any thing she said and having at length risen to the casement
1924-132576-0054	train-other-500	she distinguished the chords of the lute struck with an expressive hand and then the voice she had formerly listened to accompanied it Now rising love they fann d now pleasing dole
none	none	 They breath d in tender musings through the heart And now a graver sacred strain they stole As when seraphic hands an hymn impart Emily wept 
1924-132576-0055	train-other-500	in doubtful joy and tenderness and when the strain ceased she considered it as a signal that Valancourt was about to leave the prison Soon after she heard steps in the corridor they were the light
1924-132576-0056	train-other-500	quick steps of hope she could scarcely support herself as they approached but opening the door of the apartment she advanced to meet Valancourt and in the next moment sunk in the arms of a stranger
none	none	 His voice his countenance instantly convinced her and she fainted away On reviving she found herself supported by the stranger who was watching over her recovery with a countenance of ineffable tenderness and anxiety She had no spirits for reply or enquiry she asked no questions but burst into tears and disengaged herself from his arms when the expression of his countenance changed to surprise and disappointment and he turned to Ludovico for an explanation Annette soon gave the information which Ludovico could not O sir said she in a voice interrupted with sobs O sir you are not the other Chevalier We expected Monsieur Valancourt but you are not he O Ludovico how could you deceive us so my poor lady will never recover it never The stranger who now appeared much agitated attempted to speak but his words faltered and then striking his hand against his forehead as if in sudden despair he walked abruptly to the other end of the corridor Suddenly Annette dried her tears and spoke to Ludovico But perhaps said she after all the other Chevalier is not this perhaps the Chevalier Valancourt is still below Emily raised her head No replied Ludovico Monsieur Valancourt never was below if this gentleman is not he If you sir said Ludovico addressing the stranger would but have had the goodness to trust me with your name this mistake had been avoided Most true replied the stranger speaking in broken Italian but it was of the utmost consequence to me that my name should be concealed from Montoni Madam added he then addressing Emily in French will you permit me to apologize for the pain I have occasioned you and to explain to you alone my name and the circumstance which has led me into this error I am of France I am your countryman we are met in a foreign land Emily tried to compose her spirits yet she hesitated to grant his request At length desiring that Ludovico would wait on the stair case and detaining Annette she told the stranger that her woman understood very little Italian and begged he would communicate what he wished to say in that language Having withdrawn to a distant part of the corridor he said with a long drawn sigh You madam are no stranger to me though I am so unhappy as to be unknown to you My name is Du Pont I am of France of Gascony your native province and have long admired and why should I affect to disguise it have long loved you He paused but in the next moment proceeded My family madam is probably not unknown to you for we lived within a few miles of La Vallee and I have sometimes had the happiness of meeting you on visits in the neighbourhood I will not offend you by repeating how much you interested me how much I loved to wander in the scenes you frequented how often I visited your favourite fishing house and lamented the circumstance which at that time forbade me to reveal my passion I will not explain how I surrendered to temptation and became possessed of a treasure which was to me inestimable a treasure which I committed to your messenger a few days ago with expectations very different from my present ones I will say nothing of these circumstances for I know they will avail me little let me only supplicate from you forgiveness and the picture which I so unwarily returned Your generosity will pardon the theft and restore the prize My crime has been my punishment for the portrait I stole has contributed to nourish a passion which must still be my torment Emily now interrupted him I think sir I may leave it to your integrity to determine whether after what has just appeared concerning Mons Valancourt I ought to return the picture I think you will acknowledge that this would not be generosity and you will allow me to add that it would be doing myself an injustice I must consider myself honoured by your good opinion but and she hesitated the mistake of this evening makes it unnecessary for me to say more It does madam alas it does said the stranger who after a long pause proceeded But you will allow me to shew my disinterestedness though not my love and will accept the services I offer Yet alas what services can I offer I am myself a prisoner a sufferer like you But dear as liberty is to me I would not seek it through half the hazards I would encounter to deliver you from this recess of vice Accept the offered services of a friend do not refuse me the reward of having at least attempted to deserve your thanks You deserve them already sir said Emily the wish deserves my warmest thanks But you will excuse me for reminding you of the danger you incur by prolonging this interview It will be a great consolation to me to remember whether your friendly attempts to release me succeed or not that I have a countryman who would so generously protect me Monsieur Du Pont took her hand which she but feebly attempted to withdraw and pressed it respectfully to his lips Allow me to breathe another fervent sigh for your happiness said he and to applaud myself for an affection which I cannot conquer As he said this Emily heard a noise from her apartment and turning round saw the door from the stair case open and a man rush into her chamber I will teach you to conquer it cried he as he advanced into the corridor and drew a stiletto which he aimed at Du Pont who was unarmed but who stepping back avoided the blow and then sprung upon Verezzi from whom he wrenched the stiletto While they struggled in each other s grasp Emily followed by Annette ran further into the corridor calling on Ludovico who was however gone from the stair case and as she advanced terrified and uncertain what to do a distant noise that seemed to arise from the hall reminded her of the danger she was incurring and sending Annette forward in search of Ludovico she returned to the spot where Du Pont and Verezzi were still struggling for victory It was her own cause which was to be decided with that of the former whose conduct independently of this circumstance would however have interested her in his success even had she not disliked and dreaded Verezzi She threw herself in a chair and supplicated them to desist from further violence till at length Du Pont forced Verezzi to the floor where he lay stunned by the violence of his fall and she then entreated Du Pont to escape from the room before Montoni or his party should appear but he still refused to leave her unprotected and while Emily now more terrified for him than for herself enforced the entreaty they heard steps ascending the private stair case O you are lost cried she these are Montoni s people Du Pont made no reply but supported Emily while with a steady though eager countenance he awaited their appearance and in the next moment Ludovico alone mounted the landing place Throwing an hasty glance round the chamber Follow me said he as you value your lives we have not an instant to lose Emily enquired what had occurred and whither they were to go I cannot stay to tell you now Signora replied Ludovico fly fly She immediately followed him accompanied by Mons Du Pont down the stair case and along a vaulted passage when suddenly she recollected Annette and enquired for her She awaits us further on Signora said Ludovico almost breathless with haste the gates were open a moment since to a party just come in from the mountains they will be shut I fear before we can reach them Through this door Signora added Ludovico holding down the lamp take care here are two steps Emily followed trembling still more than before she had understood that her escape from the castle depended upon the present moment while Du Pont supported her and endeavoured as they passed along to cheer her spirits Speak low Signor said Ludovico these passages send echoes all round the castle Take care of the light cried Emily you go so fast that the air will extinguish it Ludovico now opened another door where they found Annette and the party then descended a short flight of steps into a passage which Ludovico said led round the inner court of the castle and opened into the outer one As they advanced confused and tumultuous sounds that seemed to come from the inner court alarmed Emily Nay Signora said Ludovico our only hope is in that tumult while the Signor s people are busied about the men who are just arrived we may perhaps pass unnoticed through the gates But hush he added as they approached the small door that opened into the outer court if you will remain here a moment I will go to see whether the gates are open and any body is in the way Pray extinguish the light Signor if you hear me talking continued Ludovico delivering the lamp to Du Pont and remain quite still Saying this he stepped out upon the court and they closed the door listening anxiously to his departing steps No voice however was heard in the court which he was crossing though a confusion of many voices yet issued from the inner one We shall soon be beyond the walls said Du Pont softly to Emily support yourself a little longer Madam and all will be well But soon they heard Ludovico speaking loud and the voice also of some other person and Du Pont immediately extinguished the lamp Ah it is too late exclaimed Emily what is to become of us They listened again and then perceived that Ludovico was talking with a sentinel whose voices were heard also by Emily s favourite dog that had followed her from the chamber and now barked loudly This dog will betray us said Du Pont I will hold him I fear he has already betrayed us replied Emily Du Pont however caught him up and again listening to what was going on without they heard Ludovico say I ll watch the gates the while Stay a minute replied the sentinel and you need not have the trouble for the horses will be sent round to the outer stables then the gates will be shut and I can leave my post I don t mind the trouble comrade said Ludovico you will do such another good turn for me some time Go go and fetch the wine the rogues that are just come in will drink it all else The soldier hesitated and then called aloud to the people in the second court to know why they did not send out the horses that the gates might be shut but they were too much engaged to attend to him even if they had heard his voice Aye aye said Ludovico they know better than that they are sharing it all among them if you wait till the horses come out you must wait till the wine is drunk I have had my share already but since you do not care about yours I see no reason why I should not have that too Hold hold not so fast cried the sentinel do watch then for a moment I ll be with you presently Don t hurry yourself said Ludovico coolly I have kept guard before now But you may leave me your trombone that if the castle should be attacked you know I may be able to defend the pass like a hero A kind of blunderbuss A R There my good fellow returned the soldier there take it it has seen service though it could do little in defending the castle I ll tell you a good story though about this same trombone You ll tell it better when you have had the wine said Ludovico There they are coming out from the court already I ll have the wine though said the sentinel running off I won t keep you a minute Take your time I am in no haste replied Ludovico who was already hurrying across the court when the soldier came back Whither so fast friend whither so fast said the latter What is this the way you keep watch I must stand to my post myself I see Aye well replied Ludovico you have saved me the trouble of following you further for I wanted to tell you if you have a mind to drink the Tuscany wine you must go to Sebastian he is dealing it out the other that Federico has is not worth having But you are not likely to have any I see for they are all coming out By saint Peter so they are said the soldier and again ran off while Ludovico once more at liberty hastened to the door of the passage where Emily was sinking under the anxiety this long discourse had occasioned but on his telling them the court was clear they followed him to the gates without waiting another instant yet not before he had seized two horses that had strayed from the second court and were picking a scanty meal among the grass which grew between the pavement of the first They passed without interruption the dreadful gates and took the road that led down among the woods Emily Monsieur Du Pont and Annette on foot and Ludovico who was mounted on one horse leading the other Having reached them they stopped while Emily and Annette were placed on horseback with their two protectors when Ludovico leading the way they set off as fast as the broken road and the feeble light which a rising moon threw among the foliage would permit Emily was so much astonished by this sudden departure that she scarcely dared to believe herself awake and she yet much doubted whether this adventure would terminate in escape a doubt which had too much probability to justify it for before they quitted the woods they heard shouts in the wind and on emerging from them saw lights moving quickly near the castle above Du Pont whipped his horse and with some difficulty compelled him to go faster Ah poor beast said Ludovico he is weary enough he has been out all day but Signor we must fly for it now for yonder are lights coming this way Having given his own horse a lash they now both set off on a full gallop and when they again looked back the lights were so distant as scarcely to be discerned and the voices were sunk into silence The travellers then abated their pace and consulting whither they should direct their course it was determined they should descend into Tuscany and endeavour to reach the Mediterranean where they could readily embark for France Thither Du Pont meant to attend Emily if he should learn that the regiment he had accompanied into Italy was returned to his native country They were now in the road which Emily had travelled with Ugo and Bertrand but Ludovico who was the only one of the party acquainted with the passes of these mountains said that a little further on a bye road branching from this would lead them down into Tuscany with very little difficulty and that at a few leagues distance was a small town where necessaries could be procured for their journey But I hope added he we shall meet with no straggling parties of banditti some of them are abroad I know However I have got a good trombone which will be of some service if we should encounter any of those brave spirits You have no arms Signor Yes replied Du Pont I have the villain s stilletto who would have stabbed me but let us rejoice in our escape from Udolpho nor torment ourselves with looking out for dangers that may never arrive The moon was now risen high over the woods that hung upon the sides of the narrow glen through which they wandered and afforded them light sufficient to distinguish their way and to avoid the loose and broken stones that frequently crossed it They now travelled leisurely and in profound silence for they had scarcely yet recovered from the astonishment into which this sudden escape had thrown them Emily s mind especially was sunk after the various emotions it had suffered into a kind of musing stillness which the reposing beauty of the surrounding scene and the creeping murmur of the night breeze among the foliage above contributed to prolong She thought of Valancourt and of France with hope and she would have thought of them with joy had not the first events of this evening harassed her spirits too much to permit her now to feel so lively a sensation Meanwhile Emily was alone the object of Du Pont s melancholy consideration yet with the despondency he suffered as he mused on his recent disappointment was mingled a sweet pleasure occasioned by her presence though they did not now exchange a single word Annette thought of this wonderful escape of the bustle in which Montoni and his people must be now that their flight was discovered of her native country whither she hoped she was returning and of her marriage with Ludovico to which there no longer appeared any impediment for poverty she did not consider such Ludovico on his part congratulated himself on having rescued his Annette and Signora Emily from the danger that had surrounded them on his own liberation from people whose manners he had long detested on the freedom he had given to Monsieur Du Pont on his prospect of happiness with the object of his affections and not a little on the address with which he had deceived the sentinel and conducted the whole of this affair Thus variously engaged in thought the travellers passed on silently for above an hour a question only being now and then asked by Du Pont concerning the road or a remark uttered by Annette respecting objects seen imperfectly in the twilight At length lights were perceived twinkling on the side of a mountain and Ludovico had no doubt that they proceeded from the town he had mentioned while his companions satisfied by this assurance sunk again into silence Annette was the first who interrupted this Holy Peter said she What shall we do for money on our journey for I know neither I or my lady have a single sequin the Signor took care of that This remark produced a serious enquiry which ended in as serious an embarrassment for Du Pont had been rifled of nearly all his money when he was taken prisoner the remainder he had given to the sentinel who had enabled him occasionally to leave his prison chamber and Ludovico who had for some time found a difficulty in procuring any part of the wages due to him had now scarcely cash sufficient to procure necessary refreshment at the first town in which they should arrive Their poverty was the more distressing since it would detain them among the mountains where even in a town they could scarcely consider themselves safe from Montoni The travellers however had only to proceed and dare the future and they continued their way through lonely wilds and dusky vallies where the overhanging foliage now admitted and then excluded the moon light wilds so desolate that they appeared on the first glance as if no human being had ever trode them before Even the road in which the party were did but slightly contradict this error for the high grass and other luxuriant vegetation with which it was overgrown told how very seldom the foot of a traveller had passed it At length from a distance was heard the faint tinkling of a sheep bell and soon after the bleat of flocks and the party then knew that they were near some human habitation for the light which Ludovico had fancied to proceed from a town had long been concealed by intervening mountains Cheered by this hope they quickened their pace along the narrow pass they were winding and it opened upon one of those pastoral vallies of the Apennines which might be painted for a scene of Arcadia and whose beauty and simplicity are finely contrasted by the grandeur of the snow topt mountains above The morning light now glimmering in the horizon shewed faintly at a little distance upon the brow of a hill which seemed to peep from under the opening eye lids of the morn the town they were in search of and which they soon after reached It was not without some difficulty that they there found a house which could afford shelter for themselves and their horses and Emily desired they might not rest longer than was necessary for refreshment Her appearance excited some surprise for she was without a hat having had time only to throw on her veil before she left the castle a circumstance that compelled her to regret again the want of money without which it was impossible to procure this necessary article of dress Ludovico on examining his purse found it even insufficient to supply present refreshment and Du Pont at length ventured to inform the landlord whose countenance was simple and honest of their exact situation and requested that he would assist them to pursue their journey a purpose which he promised to comply with as far as he was able when he learned that they were prisoners escaping from Montoni whom he had too much reason to hate But though he consented to lend them fresh horses to carry them to the next town he was too poor himself to trust them with money and they were again lamenting their poverty when Ludovico who had been with his tired horses to the hovel which served for a stable entered the room half frantic with joy in which his auditors soon participated On removing the saddle from one of the horses he had found beneath it a small bag containing no doubt the booty of one of the condottieri who had returned from a plundering excursion just before Ludovico left the castle and whose horse having strayed from the inner court while his master was engaged in drinking had brought away the treasure which the ruffian had considered the reward of his exploit On counting over this Du Pont found that it would be more than sufficient to carry them all to France where he now determined to accompany Emily whether he should obtain intelligence of his regiment or not for though he had as much confidence in the integrity of Ludovico as his small knowledge of him allowed he could not endure the thought of committing her to his care for the voyage nor perhaps had he resolution enough to deny himself the dangerous pleasure which he might derive from her presence He now consulted them concerning the sea port to which they should direct their way and Ludovico better informed of the geography of the country said that Leghorn was the nearest port of consequence which Du Pont knew also to be the most likely of any in Italy to assist their plan since from thence vessels of all nations were continually departing Thither therefore it was determined that they should proceed Emily having purchased a little straw hat such as was worn by the peasant girls of Tuscany and some other little necessary equipments for the journey and the travellers having exchanged their tired horses for others better able to carry them re commenced their joyous way as the sun was rising over the mountains and after travelling through this romantic country for several hours began to descend into the vale of Arno And here Emily beheld all the charms of sylvan and pastoral landscape united adorned with the elegant villas of the Florentine nobles and diversified with the various riches of cultivation How vivid the shrubs that embowered the slopes with the woods that stretched amphitheatrically along the mountains and above all how elegant the outline of these waving Apennines now softening from the wildness which their interior regions exhibited At a distance in the east Emily discovered Florence with its towers rising on the brilliant horizon and its luxuriant plain spreading to the feet of the Apennines speckled with gardens and magnificent villas or coloured with groves of orange and lemon with vines corn and plantations of olives and mulberry while to the west the vale opened to the waters of the Mediterranean so distant that they were known only by a blueish line that appeared upon the horizon and by the light marine vapour which just stained the aether above With a full heart Emily hailed the waves that were to bear her back to her native country the remembrance of which however brought with it a pang for she had there no home to receive no parents to welcome her but was going like a forlorn pilgrim to weep over the sad spot where he who WAS her father lay interred Nor were her spirits cheered when she considered how long it would probably be before she should see Valancourt who might be stationed with his regiment in a distant part of France and that when they did meet it would be only to lament the successful villany of Montoni yet still she would have felt inexpressible delight at the thought of being once more in the same country with Valancourt had it even been certain that she could not see him The intense heat for it was now noon obliged the travellers to look out for a shady recess where they might rest for a few hours and the neighbouring thickets abounding with wild grapes raspberries and figs promised them grateful refreshment Soon after they turned from the road into a grove whose thick foliage entirely excluded the sun beams and where a spring gushing from the rock gave coolness to the air and having alighted and turned the horses to graze Annette and Ludovico ran to gather fruit from the surrounding thickets of which they soon returned with an abundance The travellers seated under the shade of a pine and cypress grove and on turf enriched with such a profusion of fragrant flowers as Emily had scarcely ever seen even among the Pyrenees took their simple repast and viewed with new delight beneath the dark umbrage of gigantic pines the glowing landscape stretching to the sea Emily and Du Pont gradually became thoughtful and silent but Annette was all joy and loquacity and Ludovico was gay without forgetting the respectful distance which was due to his companions The repast being over Du Pont recommended Emily to endeavour to sleep during these sultry hours and desiring the servants would do the same said he would watch the while but Ludovico wished to spare him this trouble and Emily and Annette wearied with travelling tried to repose while he stood guard with his trombone When Emily refreshed by slumber awoke she found the sentinel asleep on his post and Du Pont awake but lost in melancholy thought As the sun was yet too high to allow them to continue their journey and as it was necessary that Ludovico after the toils and trouble he had suffered should finish his sleep Emily took this opportunity of enquiring by what accident Du Pont became Montoni s prisoner and he pleased with the interest this enquiry expressed and with the excuse it gave him for talking to her of himself immediately answered her curiosity I came into Italy madam said Du Pont in the service of my country In an adventure among the mountains our party engaging with the bands of Montoni was routed and I with a few of my comrades was taken prisoner When they told me whose captive I was the name of Montoni struck me for I remembered that Madame Cheron your aunt had married an Italian of that name and that you had accompanied them into Italy It was not however till some time after that I became convinced this was the same Montoni or learned that you madam was under the same roof with myself I will not pain you by describing what were my emotions upon this discovery which I owed to a sentinel whom I had so far won to my interest that he granted me many indulgences one of which was very important to me and somewhat dangerous to himself but he persisted in refusing to convey any letter or notice of my situation to you for he justly dreaded a discovery and the consequent vengeance of Montoni He however enabled me to see you more than once You are surprised madam and I will explain myself My health and spirits suffered extremely from want of air and exercise and at length I gained so far upon the pity or the avarice of the man that he gave me the means of walking on the terrace Emily now listened with very anxious attention to the narrative of Du Pont who proceeded In granting this indulgence he knew that he had nothing to apprehend from a chance of my escaping from a castle which was vigilantly guarded and the nearest terrace of which rose over a perpendicular rock he shewed me also continued Du Pont a door concealed in the cedar wainscot of the apartment where I was confined which he instructed me how to open and which leading into a passage formed within the thickness of the wall that extended far along the castle finally opened in an obscure corner of the eastern rampart I have since been informed that there are many passages of the same kind concealed within the prodigious walls of that edifice and which were undoubtedly contrived for the purpose of facilitating escapes in time of war Through this avenue at the dead of night I often stole to the terrace where I walked with the utmost caution lest my steps should betray me to the sentinels on duty in distant parts for this end of it being guarded by high buildings was not watched by soldiers In one of these midnight wanderings I saw light in a casement that overlooked the rampart and which I observed was immediately over my prison chamber It occurred to me that you might be in that apartment and with the hope of seeing you I placed myself opposite to the window Emily remembering the figure that had formerly appeared on the terrace and which had occasioned her so much anxiety exclaimed It was you then Monsieur Du Pont who occasioned me much foolish terror my spirits were at that time so much weakened by long suffering that they took alarm at every hint Du Pont after lamenting that he had occasioned her any apprehension added As I rested on the wall opposite to your casement the consideration of your melancholy situation and of my own called from me involuntary sounds of lamentation which drew you I fancy to the casement I saw there a person whom I believed to be you O I will say nothing of my emotion at that moment I wished to speak but prudence restrained me till the distant foot step of a sentinel compelled me suddenly to quit my station It was some time before I had another opportunity of walking for I could only leave my prison when it happened to be the turn of one man to guard me meanwhile I became convinced from some circumstances related by him that your apartment was over mine and when again I ventured forth I returned to your casement where again I saw you but without daring to speak I waved my hand and you suddenly disappeared then it was that I forgot my prudence and yielded to lamentation again you appeared you spoke I heard the well known accent of your voice and at that moment my discretion would have forsaken me again had I not heard also the approaching steps of a soldier when I instantly quitted the place though not before the man had seen me He followed down the terrace and gained so fast upon me that I was compelled to make use of a stratagem ridiculous enough to save myself I had heard of the superstition of many of these men and I uttered a strange noise with a hope that my pursuer would mistake it for something supernatural and desist from pursuit Luckily for myself I succeeded the man it seems was subject to fits and the terror he suffered threw him into one by which accident I secured my retreat A sense of the danger I had escaped and the increased watchfulness which my appearance had occasioned among the sentinels deterred me ever after from walking on the terrace but in the stillness of night I frequently beguiled myself with an old lute procured for me by a soldier which I sometimes accompanied with my voice and sometimes I will acknowledge with a hope of making myself heard by you but it was only a few evenings ago that this hope was answered I then thought I heard a voice in the wind calling me yet even then I feared to reply lest the sentinel at the prison door should hear me Was I right madam in this conjecture was it you who spoke Yes said Emily with an involuntary sigh you was right indeed Du Pont observing the painful emotions which this question revived now changed the subject In one of my excursions through the passage which I have mentioned I overheard a singular conversation said he In the passage said Emily with surprise I heard it in the passage said Du Pont but it proceeded from an apartment adjoining the wall within which the passage wound and the shell of the wall was there so thin and was also somewhat decayed that I could distinctly hear every word spoken on the other side It happened that Montoni and his companions were assembled in the room and Montoni began to relate the extraordinary history of the lady his predecessor in the castle He did indeed mention some very surprising circumstances and whether they were strictly true his conscience must decide I fear it will determine against him But you madam have doubtless heard the report which he designs should circulate on the subject of that lady s mysterious fate I have sir replied Emily and I perceive that you doubt it I doubted it before the period I am speaking of rejoined Du Pont but some circumstances mentioned by Montoni greatly contributed to my suspicions The account I then heard almost convinced me that he was a murderer I trembled for you the more so that I had heard the guests mention your name in a manner that threatened your repose and knowing that the most impious men are often the most superstitious I determined to try whether I could not awaken their consciences and awe them from the commission of the crime I dreaded I listened closely to Montoni and in the most striking passages of his story I joined my voice and repeated his last words in a disguised and hollow tone But was you not afraid of being discovered said Emily I was not replied Du Pont for I knew that if Montoni had been acquainted with the secret of this passage he would not have confined me in the apartment to which it led I knew also from better authority that he was ignorant of it The party for some time appeared inattentive to my voice but at length were so much alarmed that they quitted the apartment and having heard Montoni order his servants to search it I returned to my prison which was very distant from this part of the passage I remember perfectly to have heard of the conversation you mention said Emily it spread a general alarm among Montoni s people and I will own I was weak enough to partake of it Monsieur Du Pont and Emily thus continued to converse of Montoni and then of France and of the plan of their voyage when Emily told him that it was her intention to retire to a convent in Languedoc where she had been formerly treated with much kindness and from thence to write to her relation Monsieur Quesnel and inform him of her conduct There she designed to wait till La Vallee should again be her own whither she hoped her income would some time permit her to return for Du Pont now taught her to expect that the estate of which Montoni had attempted to defraud her was not irrecoverably lost and he again congratulated her on her escape from Montoni who he had not a doubt meant to have detained her for life The possibility of recovering her aunt s estates for Valancourt and herself lighted up a joy in Emily s heart such as she had not known for many months but she endeavoured to conceal this from Monsieur Du Pont lest it should lead him to a painful remembrance of his rival They continued to converse till the sun was declining in the west when Du Pont awoke Ludovico and they set forward on their journey Gradually descending the lower slopes of the valley they reached the Arno and wound along its pastoral margin for many miles delighted with the scenery around them and with the remembrances which its classic waves revived At a distance they heard the gay song of the peasants among the vineyards and observed the setting sun tint the waves with yellow lustre and twilight draw a dusky purple over the mountains which at length deepened into night Then the LUCCIOLA the fire fly of Tuscany was seen to flash its sudden sparks among the foliage while the cicala with its shrill note became more clamorous than even during the noon day heat loving best the hour when the English beetle with less offensive sound winds His small but sullen horn As oft he rises midst the twilight path Against the pilgrim borne in heedless hum Collins A R The travellers crossed the Arno by moon light at a ferry and learning that Pisa was distant only a few miles down the river they wished to have proceeded thither in a boat but as none could be procured they set out on their wearied horses for that city As they approached it the vale expanded into a plain variegated with vineyards corn olives and mulberry groves but it was late before they reached its gates where Emily was surprised to hear the busy sound of footsteps and the tones of musical instruments as well as to see the lively groups that filled the streets and she almost fancied herself again at Venice but here was no moon light sea no gay gondolas dashing the waves no PALLADIAN palaces to throw enchantment over the fancy and lead it into the wilds of fairy story The Arno rolled through the town but no music trembled from balconies over its waters it gave only the busy voices of sailors on board vessels just arrived from the Mediterranean the melancholy heaving of the anchor and the shrill boatswain s whistle sounds which since that period have there sunk almost into silence They then served to remind Du Pont that it was probable he might hear of a vessel sailing soon to France from this port and thus be spared the trouble of going to Leghorn As soon as Emily had reached the inn he went therefore to the quay to make his enquiries but after all the endeavours of himself and Ludovico they could hear of no bark destined immediately for France and the travellers returned to their resting place Here also Du Pont endeavoured to learn where his regiment then lay but could acquire no information concerning it The travellers retired early to rest after the fatigues of this day and on the following rose early and without pausing to view the celebrated antiquities of the place or the wonders of its hanging tower pursued their journey in the cooler hours through a charming country rich with wine and corn and oil The Apennines no longer awful or even grand here softened into the beauty of sylvan and pastoral landscape and Emily as she descended them looked down delighted on Leghorn and its spacious bay filled with vessels and crowned with these beautiful hills She was no less surprised and amused on entering this town to find it crowded with persons in the dresses of all nations a scene which reminded her of a Venetian masquerade such as she had witnessed at the time of the Carnival but here was bustle without gaiety and noise instead of music while elegance was to be looked for only in the waving outlines of the surrounding hills Monsieur Du Pont immediately on their arrival went down to the quay where he heard of several French vessels and of one that was to sail in a few days for Marseilles from whence another vessel could be procured without difficulty to take them across the gulf of Lyons towards Narbonne on the coast not many leagues from which city he understood the convent was seated to which Emily wished to retire He therefore immediately engaged with the captain to take them to Marseilles and Emily was delighted to hear that her passage to France was secured Her mind was now relieved from the terror of pursuit and the pleasing hope of soon seeing her native country that country which held Valancourt restored to her spirits a degree of cheerfulness such as she had scarcely known since the death of her father At Leghorn also Du Pont heard of his regiment and that it had embarked for France a circumstance which gave him great satisfaction for he could now accompany Emily thither without reproach to his conscience or apprehension of displeasure from his commander During these days he scrupulously forbore to distress her by a mention of his passion and she was compelled to esteem and pity though she could not love him He endeavoured to amuse her by shewing the environs of the town and they often walked together on the sea shore and on the busy quays where Emily was frequently interested by the arrival and departure of vessels participating in the joy of meeting friends and sometimes shedding a sympathetic tear to the sorrow of those that were separating It was after having witnessed a scene of the latter kind that she arranged the following stanzas THE MARINER Soft came the breath of spring smooth flow d the tide And blue the heaven in its mirror smil d The white sail trembled swell d expanded wide The busy sailors at the anchor toil d With anxious friends that shed the parting tear The deck was throng d how swift the moments fly The vessel heaves the farewel signs appear Mute is each tongue and eloquent each eye The last dread moment comes The sailor youth Hides the big drop then smiles amid his pain Sooths his sad bride and vows eternal truth Farewel my love we shall shall meet again Long on the stern with waving hand he stood The crowded shore sinks lessening from his view As gradual glides the bark along the flood His bride is seen no more Adieu adieu The breeze of Eve moans low her smile is o er Dim steals her twilight down the crimson d west He climbs the top most mast to seek once more The far seen coast where all his wishes rest He views its dark line on the distant sky And Fancy leads him to his little home He sees his weeping love he hears her sigh He sooths her griefs and tells of joys to come Eve yields to night the breeze to wintry gales In one vast shade the seas and shores repose He turns his aching eyes his spirit fails The chill tear falls sad to the deck he goes The storm of midnight swells the sails are furl d Deep sounds the lead but finds no friendly shore Fast o er the waves the wretched bark is hurl d O Ellen Ellen we must meet no more Lightnings that shew the vast and foamy deep The rending thunders as they onward roll The loud loud winds that o er the billows sweep Shake the firm nerve appall the bravest soul Ah what avails the seamen s toiling care The straining cordage bursts the mast is riv n The sounds of terror groan along the air Then sink afar the bark on rocks is driv n Fierce o er the wreck the whelming waters pass d The helpless crew sunk in the roaring main Henry s faint accents trembled in the blast Farewel my love we ne er shall meet again Oft at the calm and silent evening hour When summer breezes linger on the wave A melancholy voice is heard to pour Its lonely sweetness o er poor Henry s grave And oft at midnight airy strains are heard Around the grove where Ellen s form is laid Nor is the dirge by village maidens fear d For lovers spirits guard the holy shade CHAPTER X Oh the joy Of young ideas painted on the mind In the warm glowing colours fancy spreads On objects not yet known when all is new And all is lovely SACRED DRAMAS We now return to Languedoc and to the mention of Count De Villefort the nobleman who succeeded to an estate of the Marquis De Villeroi situated near the monastery of saint Claire It may be recollected that this chateau was uninhabited when saint Aubert and his daughter were in the neighbourhood and that the former was much affected on discovering himself to be so near Chateau le Blanc a place concerning which the good old La Voisin afterwards dropped some hints that had alarmed Emily s curiosity It was in the year fifteen eighty four the beginning of that in which saint Aubert died that Francis Beauveau Count De Villefort came into possession of the mansion and extensive domain called Chateau le Blanc situated in the province of Languedoc on the shore of the Mediterranean This estate which during some centuries had belonged to his family now descended to him on the decease of his relative the Marquis De Villeroi who had been latterly a man of reserved manners and austere character circumstances which together with the duties of his profession that often called him into the field had prevented any degree of intimacy with his cousin the Count De Villefort For many years they had known little of each other and the Count received the first intelligence of his death which happened in a distant part of France together with the instruments that gave him possession of the domain Chateau le Blanc but it was not till the following year that he determined to visit that estate when he designed to pass the autumn there The scenes of Chateau le Blanc often came to his remembrance heightened by the touches which a warm imagination gives to the recollection of early pleasures for many years before in the life time of the Marchioness and at that age when the mind is particularly sensible to impressions of gaiety and delight he had once visited this spot and though he had passed a long intervening period amidst the vexations and tumults of public affairs which too frequently corrode the heart and vitiate the taste the shades of Languedoc and the grandeur of its distant scenery had never been remembered by him with indifference During many years the chateau had been abandoned by the late Marquis and being inhabited only by an old steward and his wife had been suffered to fall much into decay To superintend the repairs that would be requisite to make it a comfortable residence had been a principal motive with the Count for passing the autumnal months in Languedoc and neither the remonstrances or the tears of the Countess for on urgent occasions she could weep were powerful enough to overcome his determination She prepared therefore to obey the command which she could not conquer and to resign the gay assemblies of Paris where her beauty was generally unrivalled and won the applause to which her wit had but feeble claim for the twilight canopy of woods the lonely grandeur of mountains and the solemnity of gothic halls and of long long galleries which echoed only the solitary step of a domestic or the measured clink that ascended from the great clock the ancient monitor of the hall below From these melancholy expectations she endeavoured to relieve her spirits by recollecting all that she had ever heard concerning the joyous vintage of the plains of Languedoc but there alas no airy forms would bound to the gay melody of Parisian dances and a view of the rustic festivities of peasants could afford little pleasure to a heart in which even the feelings of ordinary benevolence had long since decayed under the corruptions of luxury The Count had a son and a daughter the children of a former marriage who he designed should accompany him to the south of France Henri who was in his twentieth year was in the French service and Blanche who was not yet eighteen had been hitherto confined to the convent where she had been placed immediately on her father s second marriage The present Countess who had neither sufficient ability or inclination to superintend the education of her daughter in law had advised this step and the dread of superior beauty had since urged her to employ every art that might prevail on the Count to prolong the period of Blanche s seclusion it was therefore with extreme mortification that she now understood he would no longer submit on this subject yet it afforded her some consolation to consider that though the Lady Blanche would emerge from her convent the shades of the country would for some time veil her beauty from the public eye On the morning which commenced the journey the postillions stopped at the convent by the Count s order to take up Blanche whose heart beat with delight at the prospect of novelty and freedom now before her As the time of her departure drew nigh her impatience had increased and the last night during which she counted every note of every hour had appeared the most tedious of any she had ever known The morning light at length dawned the matin bell rang she heard the nuns descending from their chambers and she started from a sleepless pillow to welcome the day which was to emancipate her from the severities of a cloister and introduce her to a world where pleasure was ever smiling and goodness ever blessed where in short nothing but pleasure and goodness reigned When the bell of the great gate rang and the sound was followed by that of carriage wheels she ran with a palpitating heart to her lattice and perceiving her father s carriage in the court below danced with airy steps along the gallery where she was met by a nun with a summons from the abbess In the next moment she was in the parlour and in the presence of the Countess who now appeared to her as an angel that was to lead her into happiness But the emotions of the Countess on beholding her were not in unison with those of Blanche who had never appeared so lovely as at this moment when her countenance animated by the lightning smile of joy glowed with the beauty of happy innocence After conversing for a few minutes with the abbess the Countess rose to go This was the moment which Blanche had anticipated with such eager expectation the summit from which she looked down upon the fairy land of happiness and surveyed all its enchantment was it a moment then for tears of regret Yet it was so She turned with an altered and dejected countenance to her young companions who were come to bid her farewell and wept Even my lady abbess so stately and so solemn she saluted with a degree of sorrow which an hour before she would have believed it impossible to feel and which may be accounted for by considering how reluctantly we all part even with unpleasing objects when the separation is consciously for ever Again she kissed the poor nuns and then followed the Countess from that spot with tears which she expected to leave only with smiles But the presence of her father and the variety of objects on the road soon engaged her attention and dissipated the shade which tender regret had thrown upon her spirits Inattentive to a conversation which was passing between the Countess and a Mademoiselle Bearn her friend Blanche sat lost in pleasing reverie as she watched the clouds floating silently along the blue expanse now veiling the sun and stretching their shadows along the distant scene and then disclosing all his brightness The journey continued to give Blanche inexpressible delight for new scenes of nature were every instant opening to her view and her fancy became stored with gay and beautiful imagery It was on the evening of the seventh day that the travellers came within view of Chateau le Blanc the romantic beauty of whose situation strongly impressed the imagination of Blanche who observed with sublime astonishment the Pyrenean mountains which had been seen only at a distance during the day now rising within a few leagues with their wild cliffs and immense precipices which the evening clouds floating round them now disclosed and again veiled The setting rays that tinged their snowy summits with a roseate hue touched their lower points with various colouring while the blueish tint that pervaded their shadowy recesses gave the strength of contrast to the splendour of light The plains of Languedoc blushing with the purple vine and diversified with groves of mulberry almond and olives spread far to the north and the east to the south appeared the Mediterranean clear as crystal and blue as the heavens it reflected bearing on its bosom vessels whose white sails caught the sun beams and gave animation to the scene On a high promontory washed by the waters of the Mediterranean stood her father s mansion almost secluded from the eye by woods of intermingled pine oak and chesnut which crowned the eminence and sloped towards the plains on one side while on the other they extended to a considerable distance along the sea shores As Blanche drew nearer the gothic features of this antient mansion successively appeared first an embattled turret rising above the trees then the broken arch of an immense gate way retiring beyond them and she almost fancied herself approaching a castle such as is often celebrated in early story where the knights look out from the battlements on some champion below who clothed in black armour comes with his companions to rescue the fair lady of his love from the oppression of his rival a sort of legends to which she had once or twice obtained access in the library of her convent that like many others belonging to the monks was stored with these reliques of romantic fiction The carriages stopped at a gate which led into the domain of the chateau but which was now fastened and the great bell that had formerly served to announce the arrival of strangers having long since fallen from its station a servant climbed over a ruined part of the adjoining wall to give notice to those within of the arrival of their lord As Blanche leaned from the coach window she resigned herself to the sweet and gentle emotions which the hour and the scenery awakened The sun had now left the earth and twilight began to darken the mountains while the distant waters reflecting the blush that still glowed in the west appeared like a line of light skirting the horizon The low murmur of waves breaking on the shore came in the breeze and now and then the melancholy dashing of oars was feebly heard from a distance She was suffered to indulge her pensive mood for the thoughts of the rest of the party were silently engaged upon the subjects of their several interests Meanwhile the Countess reflecting with regret upon the gay parties she had left at Paris surveyed with disgust what she thought the gloomy woods and solitary wildness of the scene and shrinking from the prospect of being shut up in an old castle was prepared to meet every object with displeasure The feelings of Henri were somewhat similar to those of the Countess he gave a mournful sigh to the delights of the capital and to the remembrance of a lady who he believed had engaged his affections and who had certainly fascinated his imagination but the surrounding country and the mode of life on which he was entering had for him at least the charm of novelty and his regret was softened by the gay expectations of youth The gates being at length unbarred the carriage moved slowly on under spreading chesnuts that almost excluded the remains of day following what had been formerly a road but which now overgrown with luxuriant vegetation could be traced only by the boundary formed by trees on either side and which wound for near half a mile among the woods before it reached the chateau This was the very avenue that saint Aubert and Emily had formerly entered on their first arrival in the neighbourhood with the hope of finding a house that would receive them for the night and had so abruptly quitted on perceiving the wildness of the place and a figure which the postillion had fancied was a robber What a dismal place is this exclaimed the Countess as the carriage penetrated the deeper recesses of the woods Surely my lord you do not mean to pass all the autumn in this barbarous spot One ought to bring hither a cup of the waters of Lethe that the remembrance of pleasanter scenes may not heighten at least the natural dreariness of these I shall be governed by circumstances madam said the Count this barbarous spot was inhabited by my ancestors The carriage now stopped at the chateau where at the door of the great hall appeared the old steward and the Parisian servants who had been sent to prepare the chateau waiting to receive their lord Lady Blanche now perceived that the edifice was not built entirely in the gothic style but that it had additions of a more modern date the large and gloomy hall however into which she now entered was entirely gothic and sumptuous tapestry which it was now too dark to distinguish hung upon the walls and depictured scenes from some of the antient Provencal romances A vast gothic window embroidered with CLEMATIS and eglantine that ascended to the south led the eye now that the casements were thrown open through this verdant shade over a sloping lawn to the tops of dark woods that hung upon the brow of the promontory Beyond appeared the waters of the Mediterranean stretching far to the south and to the east where they were lost in the horizon while to the north east they were bounded by the luxuriant shores of Languedoc and Provence enriched with wood and gay with vines and sloping pastures and to the south west by the majestic Pyrenees now fading from the eye beneath the gradual gloom Blanche as she crossed the hall stopped a moment to observe this lovely prospect which the evening twilight obscured yet did not conceal But she was quickly awakened from the complacent delight which this scene had diffused upon her mind by the Countess who discontented with every object around and impatient for refreshment and repose hastened forward to a large parlour whose cedar wainscot narrow pointed casements and dark ceiling of carved cypress wood gave it an aspect of peculiar gloom which the dingy green velvet of the chairs and couches fringed with tarnished gold had once been designed to enliven While the Countess enquired for refreshment the Count attended by his son went to look over some part of the chateau and Lady Blanche reluctantly remained to witness the discontent and ill humour of her step mother How long have you lived in this desolate place said her ladyship to the old house keeper who came to pay her duty Above twenty years your ladyship on the next feast of saint Jerome How happened it that you have lived here so long and almost alone too I understood that the chateau had been shut up for some years Yes madam it was for many years after my late lord the Count went to the wars but it is above twenty years since I and my husband came into his service The place is so large and has of late been so lonely that we were lost in it and after some time we went to live in a cottage at the end of the woods near some of the tenants and came to look after the chateau every now and then When my lord returned to France from the wars he took a dislike to the place and never came to live here again and so he was satisfied with our remaining at the cottage Alas alas how the chateau is changed from what it once was What delight my late lady used to take in it I well remember when she came here a bride and how fine it was Now it has been neglected so long and is gone into such decay I shall never see those days again The Countess appearing to be somewhat offended by the thoughtless simplicity with which the old woman regretted former times Dorothee added But the chateau will now be inhabited and cheerful again not all the world could tempt me to live in it alone Well the experiment will not be made I believe said the Countess displeased that her own silence had been unable to awe the loquacity of this rustic old housekeeper now spared from further attendance by the entrance of the Count who said he had been viewing part of the chateau and found that it would require considerable repairs and some alterations before it would be perfectly comfortable as a place of residence I am sorry to hear it my lord replied the Countess And why sorry madam Because the place will ill repay your trouble and were it even a paradise it would be insufferable at such a distance from Paris The Count made no reply but walked abruptly to a window There are windows my lord but they neither admit entertainment or light they shew only a scene of savage nature I am at a loss madam said the Count to conjecture what you mean by savage nature Do those plains or those woods or that fine expanse of water deserve the name Those mountains certainly do my lord rejoined the Countess pointing to the Pyrenees and this chateau though not a work of rude nature is to my taste at least one of savage art The Count coloured highly This place madam was the work of my ancestors said he and you must allow me to say that your present conversation discovers neither good taste or good manners Blanche now shocked at an altercation which appeared to be increasing to a serious disagreement rose to leave the room when her mother s woman entered it and the Countess immediately desiring to be shewn to her own apartment withdrew attended by Mademoiselle Bearn Lady Blanche it being not yet dark took this opportunity of exploring new scenes and leaving the parlour she passed from the hall into a wide gallery whose walls were decorated by marble pilasters which supported an arched roof composed of a rich mosaic work Through a distant window that seemed to terminate the gallery were seen the purple clouds of evening and a landscape whose features thinly veiled in twilight no longer appeared distinctly but blended into one grand mass stretched to the horizon coloured only with a tint of solemn grey The gallery terminated in a saloon to which the window she had seen through an open door belonged but the increasing dusk permitted her only an imperfect view of this apartment which seemed to be magnificent and of modern architecture though it had been either suffered to fall into decay or had never been properly finished The windows which were numerous and large descended low and afforded a very extensive and what Blanche s fancy represented to be a very lovely prospect and she stood for some time surveying the grey obscurity and depicturing imaginary woods and mountains vallies and rivers on this scene of night her solemn sensations rather assisted than interrupted by the distant bark of a watch dog and by the breeze as it trembled upon the light foliage of the shrubs Now and then appeared for a moment among the woods a cottage light and at length was heard afar off the evening bell of a convent dying on the air When she withdrew her thoughts from these subjects of fanciful delight the gloom and silence of the saloon somewhat awed her and having sought the door of the gallery and pursued for a considerable time a dark passage she came to a hall but one totally different from that she had formerly seen By the twilight admitted through an open portico she could just distinguish this apartment to be of very light and airy architecture and that it was paved with white marble pillars of which supported the roof that rose into arches built in the Moorish style While Blanche stood on the steps of this portico the moon rose over the sea and gradually disclosed in partial light the beauties of the eminence on which she stood whence a lawn now rude and overgrown with high grass sloped to the woods that almost surrounding the chateau extended in a grand sweep down the southern sides of the promontory to the very margin of the ocean Beyond the woods on the north side appeared a long tract of the plains of Languedoc and to the east the landscape she had before dimly seen with the towers of a monastery illumined by the moon rising over dark groves The soft and shadowy tint that overspread the scene the waves undulating in the moon light and their low and measured murmurs on the beach were circumstances that united to elevate the unaccustomed mind of Blanche to enthusiasm And have I lived in this glorious world so long said she and never till now beheld such a prospect never experienced these delights Every peasant girl on my father s domain has viewed from her infancy the face of nature has ranged at liberty her romantic wilds while I have been shut in a cloister from the view of these beautiful appearances which were designed to enchant all eyes and awaken all hearts How can the poor nuns and friars feel the full fervour of devotion if they never see the sun rise or set Never till this evening did I know what true devotion is for never before did I see the sun sink below the vast earth To morrow for the first time in my life I will see it rise O who would live in Paris to look upon black walls and dirty streets when in the country they might gaze on the blue heavens and all the green earth This enthusiastic soliloquy was interrupted by a rustling noise in the hall and while the loneliness of the place made her sensible to fear she thought she perceived something moving between the pillars For a moment she continued silently observing it till ashamed of her ridiculous apprehensions she recollected courage enough to demand who was there O my young lady is it you said the old housekeeper who was come to shut the windows I am glad it is you The manner in which she spoke this with a faint breath rather surprised Blanche who said You seemed frightened Dorothee what is the matter No not frightened ma amselle replied Dorothee hesitating and trying to appear composed but I am old and a little matter startles me The Lady Blanche smiled at the distinction I am glad that my lord the Count is come to live at the chateau ma amselle continued Dorothee for it has been many a year deserted and dreary enough now the place will look a little as it used to do when my poor lady was alive Blanche enquired how long it was since the Marchioness died Alas my lady replied Dorothee so long that I have ceased to count the years The place to my mind has mourned ever since and I am sure my lord s vassals have But you have lost yourself ma amselle shall I shew you to the other side of the chateau Blanche enquired how long this part of the edifice had been built Soon after my lord s marriage ma am replied Dorothee The place was large enough without this addition for many rooms of the old building were even then never made use of and my lord had a princely household too but he thought the antient mansion gloomy and gloomy enough it is Lady Blanche now desired to be shewn to the inhabited part of the chateau and as the passages were entirely dark Dorothee conducted her along the edge of the lawn to the opposite side of the edifice where a door opening into the great hall she was met by Mademoiselle Bearn Where have you been so long said she I had begun to think some wonderful adventure had befallen you and that the giant of this enchanted castle or the ghost which no doubt haunts it had conveyed you through a trap door into some subterranean vault whence you was never to return No replied Blanche laughingly you seem to love adventures so well that I leave them for you to achieve Well I am willing to achieve them provided I am allowed to describe them My dear Mademoiselle Bearn said Henri as he met her at the door of the parlour no ghost of these days would be so savage as to impose silence on you Our ghosts are more civilized than to condemn a lady to a purgatory severer even than their own be it what it may Mademoiselle Bearn replied only by a laugh and the Count now entering the room supper was served during which he spoke little frequently appeared to be abstracted from the company and more than once remarked that the place was greatly altered since he had last seen it Many years have intervened since that period said he and though the grand features of the scenery admit of no change they impress me with sensations very different from those I formerly experienced Did these scenes sir said Blanche ever appear more lovely than they do now To me this seems hardly possible The Count regarding her with a melancholy smile said They once were as delightful to me as they are now to you the landscape is not changed but time has changed me from my mind the illusion which gave spirit to the colouring of nature is fading fast If you live my dear Blanche to re visit this spot at the distance of many years you will perhaps remember and understand the feelings of your father Lady Blanche affected by these words remained silent she looked forward to the period which the Count anticipated and considering that he who now spoke would then probably be no more her eyes bent to the ground were filed with tears She gave her hand to her father who smiling affectionately rose from his chair and went to a window to conceal his emotion The fatigues of the day made the party separate at an early hour when Blanche retired through a long oak gallery to her chamber whose spacious and lofty walls high antiquated casements and what was the effect of these its gloomy air did not reconcile her to its remote situation in this antient building The furniture also was of antient date the bed was of blue damask trimmed with tarnished gold lace and its lofty tester rose in the form of a canopy whence the curtains descended like those of such tents as are sometimes represented in old pictures and indeed much resembling those exhibited on the faded tapestry with which the chamber was hung To Blanche every object here was matter of curiosity and taking the light from her woman to examine the tapestry she perceived that it represented scenes from the wars of Troy though the almost colourless worsted now mocked the glowing actions they once had painted She laughed at the ludicrous absurdity she observed till recollecting that the hands which had wove it were like the poet whose thoughts of fire they had attempted to express long since mouldered into dust a train of melancholy ideas passed over her mind and she almost wept Having given her woman a strict injunction to awaken her before sun rise she dismissed her and then to dissipate the gloom which reflection had cast upon her spirits opened one of the high casements and was again cheered by the face of living nature The shadowy earth the air and ocean all was still Along the deep serene of the heavens a few light clouds floated slowly through whose skirts the stars now seemed to tremble and now to emerge with purer splendour Blanche s thoughts arose involuntarily to the Great Author of the sublime objects she contemplated and she breathed a prayer of finer devotion than any she had ever uttered beneath the vaulted roof of a cloister At this casement she remained till the glooms of midnight were stretched over the prospect She then retired to her pillow and with gay visions of to morrow to those sweet slumbers which health and happy innocence only know To morrow to fresh woods and pastures new CHAPTER XI What transport to retrace our early plays Our easy bliss when each thing joy supplied The woods the mountains and the warbling maze Of the wild brooks THOMSON Blanche s slumbers continued till long after the hour which she had so impatiently anticipated for her woman fatigued with travelling did not call her till breakfast was nearly ready Her disappointment however was instantly forgotten when on opening the casement she saw on one hand the wide sea sparkling in the morning rays with its stealing sails and glancing oars and on the other the fresh woods the plains far stretching and the blue mountains all glowing with the splendour of day As she inspired the pure breeze health spread a deeper blush upon her countenance and pleasure danced in her eyes Who could first invent convents said she and who could first persuade people to go into them and to make religion a pretence too where all that should inspire it is so carefully shut out God is best pleased with the homage of a grateful heart and when we view his glories we feel most grateful I never felt so much devotion during the many dull years I was in the convent as I have done in the few hours that I have been here where I need only look on all around me to adore God in my inmost heart Saying this she left the window bounded along the gallery and in the next moment was in the breakfast room where the Count was already seated The cheerfulness of a bright sunshine had dispersed the melancholy glooms of his reflections a pleasant smile was on his countenance and he spoke in an enlivening voice to Blanche whose heart echoed back the tones Henri and soon after the Countess with Mademoiselle Bearn appeared and the whole party seemed to acknowledge the influence of the scene even the Countess was so much re animated as to receive the civilities of her husband with complacency and but once forgot her good humour which was when she asked whether they had any neighbours who were likely to make THIS BARBAROUS SPOT more tolerable and whether the Count believed it possible for her to exist here without some amusement Soon after breakfast the party dispersed the Count ordering his steward to attend him in the library went to survey the condition of his premises and to visit some of his tenants Henri hastened with alacrity to the shore to examine a boat that was to bear them on a little voyage in the evening and to superintend the adjustment of a silk awning while the Countess attended by Mademoiselle Bearn retired to an apartment on the modern side of the chateau which was fitted up with airy elegance and as the windows opened upon balconies that fronted the sea she was there saved from a view of the HORRID Pyrenees Here while she reclined on a sofa and casting her languid eyes over the ocean which appeared beyond the wood tops indulged in the luxuries of ENNUI her companion read aloud a sentimental novel on some fashionable system of philosophy for the Countess was herself somewhat of a PHILOSOPHER especially as to INFIDELITY and among a certain circle her opinions were waited for with impatience and received as doctrines The Lady Blanche meanwhile hastened to indulge amidst the wild wood walks around the chateau her new enthusiasm where as she wandered under the shades her gay spirits gradually yielded to pensive complacency Now she moved with solemn steps beneath the gloom of thickly interwoven branches where the fresh dew still hung upon every flower that peeped from among the grass and now tripped sportively along the path on which the sunbeams darted and the checquered foliage trembled where the tender greens of the beech the acacia and the mountain ash mingling with the solemn tints of the cedar the pine and cypress exhibited as fine a contrast of colouring as the majestic oak and oriental plane did of form to the feathery lightness of the cork tree and the waving grace of the poplar Having reached a rustic seat within a deep recess of the woods she rested awhile and as her eyes caught through a distant opening a glimpse of the blue waters of the Mediterranean with the white sail gliding on its bosom or of the broad mountain glowing beneath the mid day sun her mind experienced somewhat of that exquisite delight which awakens the fancy and leads to poetry The hum of bees alone broke the stillness around her as with other insects of various hues they sported gaily in the shade or sipped sweets from the fresh flowers and while Blanche watched a butter fly flitting from bud to bud she indulged herself in imagining the pleasures of its short day till she had composed the following stanzas THE BUTTER FLY TO HIS LOVE What bowery dell with fragrant breath Courts thee to stay thy airy flight Nor seek again the purple heath So oft the scene of gay delight Long I ve watch d i the lily s bell Whose whiteness stole the morning s beam No fluttering sounds thy coming tell No waving wings at distance gleam But fountain fresh nor breathing grove Nor sunny mead nor blossom d tree So sweet as lily s cell shall prove The bower of constant love and me When April buds begin to blow The prim rose and the hare bell blue That on the verdant moss bank grow With violet cups that weep in dew When wanton gales breathe through the shade And shake the blooms and steal their sweets And swell the song of ev ry glade I range the forest s green retreats There through the tangled wood walks play Where no rude urchin paces near Where sparely peeps the sultry day And light dews freshen all the air High on a sun beam oft I sport O er bower and fountain vale and hill Oft ev ry blushing flow ret court That hangs its head o er winding rill But these I ll leave to be thy guide And shew thee where the jasmine spreads Her snowy leaf where may flow rs hide And rose buds rear their peeping heads With me the mountain s summit scale And taste the wild thyme s honied bloom Whose fragrance floating on the gale Oft leads me to the cedar s gloom Yet yet no sound comes in the breeze What shade thus dares to tempt thy stay Once me alone thou wish d to please And with me only thou wouldst stray But while thy long delay I mourn And chide the sweet shades for their guile Thou may saint be true and they forlorn And fairy favours court thy smile The tiny queen of fairy land Who knows thy speed hath sent thee far To bring or ere the night watch stand Rich essence for her shadowy car Perchance her acorn cups to fill With nectar from the Indian rose Or gather near some haunted rill May dews that lull to sleep Love s woes Or o er the mountains bade thee fly To tell her fairy love to speed When ev ning steals upon the sky To dance along the twilight mead But now I see thee sailing low Gay as the brightest flow rs of spring Thy coat of blue and jet I know And well thy gold and purple wing Borne on the gale thou com saint to me O welcome welcome to my home In lily s cell we ll live in glee Together o er the mountains roam When Lady Blanche returned to the chateau instead of going to the apartment of the Countess she amused herself with wandering over that part of the edifice which she had not yet examined of which the most antient first attracted her curiosity for though what she had seen of the modern was gay and elegant there was something in the former more interesting to her imagination Having passed up the great stair case and through the oak gallery she entered upon a long suite of chambers whose walls were either hung with tapestry or wainscoted with cedar the furniture of which looked almost as antient as the rooms themselves the spacious fire places where no mark of social cheer remained presented an image of cold desolation and the whole suite had so much the air of neglect and desertion that it seemed as if the venerable persons whose portraits hung upon the walls had been the last to inhabit them On leaving these rooms she found herself in another gallery one end of which was terminated by a back stair case and the other by a door that seemed to communicate with the north side of the chateau but which being fastened she descended the stair case and opening a door in the wall a few steps down found herself in a small square room that formed part of the west turret of the castle Three windows presented each a separate and beautiful prospect that to the north overlooking Languedoc another to the west the hills ascending towards the Pyrenees whose awful summits crowned the landscape and a third fronting the south gave the Mediterranean and a part of the wild shores of Rousillon to the eye Having left the turret and descended the narrow stair case she found herself in a dusky passage where she wandered unable to find her way till impatience yielded to apprehension and she called for assistance Presently steps approached and light glimmered through a door at the other extremity of the passage which was opened with caution by some person who did not venture beyond it and whom Blanche observed in silence till the door was closing when she called aloud and hastening towards it perceived the old housekeeper Dear ma amselle is it you said Dorothee How could you find your way hither Had Blanche been less occupied by her own fears she would probably have observed the strong expressions of terror and surprise on Dorothee s countenance who now led her through a long succession of passages and rooms that looked as if they had been uninhabited for a century till they reached that appropriated to the housekeeper where Dorothee entreated she would sit down and take refreshment Blanche accepted the sweet meats offered to her mentioned her discovery of the pleasant turret and her wish to appropriate it to her own use Whether Dorothee s taste was not so sensible to the beauties of landscape as her young lady s or that the constant view of lovely scenery had deadened it she forbore to praise the subject of Blanche s enthusiasm which however her silence did not repress To Lady Blanche s enquiry of whither the door she had found fastened at the end of the gallery led she replied that it opened to a suite of rooms which had not been entered during many years For added she my late lady died in one of them and I could never find in my heart to go into them since Blanche though she wished to see these chambers forbore on observing that Dorothee s eyes were filled with tears to ask her to unlock them and soon after went to dress for dinner at which the whole party met in good spirits and good humour except the Countess whose vacant mind overcome by the languor of idleness would neither suffer her to be happy herself or to contribute to the happiness of others Mademoiselle Bearn attempting to be witty directed her badinage against Henri who answered because he could not well avoid it rather than from any inclination to notice her whose liveliness sometimes amused but whose conceit and insensibility often disgusted him The cheerfulness with which Blanche rejoined the party vanished on her reaching the margin of the sea she gazed with apprehension upon the immense expanse of waters which at a distance she had beheld only with delight and astonishment and it was by a strong effort that she so far overcame her fears as to follow her father into the boat As she silently surveyed the vast horizon bending round the distant verge of the ocean an emotion of sublimest rapture struggled to overcome a sense of personal danger A light breeze played on the water and on the silk awning of the boat and waved the foliage of the receding woods that crowned the cliffs for many miles and which the Count surveyed with the pride of conscious property as well as with the eye of taste At some distance among these woods stood a pavilion which had once been the scene of social gaiety and which its situation still made one of romantic beauty Thither the Count had ordered coffee and other refreshment to be carried and thither the sailors now steered their course following the windings of the shore round many a woody promontory and circling bay while the pensive tones of horns and other wind instruments played by the attendants in a distant boat echoed among the rocks and died along the waves Blanche had now subdued her fears a delightful tranquillity stole over her mind and held her in silence and she was too happy even to remember the convent or her former sorrows as subjects of comparison with her present felicity The Countess felt less unhappy than she had done since the moment of her leaving Paris for her mind was now under some degree of restraint she feared to indulge its wayward humours and even wished to recover the Count s good opinion On his family and on the surrounding scene he looked with tempered pleasure and benevolent satisfaction while his son exhibited the gay spirits of youth anticipating new delights and regretless of those that were passed After near an hour s rowing the party landed and ascended a little path overgrown with vegetation At a little distance from the point of the eminence within the shadowy recess of the woods appeared the pavilion which Blanche perceived as she caught a glimpse of its portico between the trees to be built of variegated marble As she followed the Countess she often turned her eyes with rapture towards the ocean seen beneath the dark foliage far below and from thence upon the deep woods whose silence and impenetrable gloom awakened emotions more solemn but scarcely less delightful The pavilion had been prepared as far as was possible on a very short notice for the reception of its visitors but the faded colours of its painted walls and ceiling and the decayed drapery of its once magnificent furniture declared how long it had been neglected and abandoned to the empire of the changing seasons While the party partook of a collation of fruit and coffee the horns placed in a distant part of the woods where an echo sweetened and prolonged their melancholy tones broke softly on the stillness of the scene This spot seemed to attract even the admiration of the Countess or perhaps it was merely the pleasure of planning furniture and decorations that made her dwell so long on the necessity of repairing and adorning it while the Count never happier than when he saw her mind engaged by natural and simple objects acquiesced in all her designs concerning the pavilion The paintings on the walls and coved ceiling were to be renewed the canopies and sofas were to be of light green damask marble statues of wood nymphs bearing on their heads baskets of living flowers were to adorn the recesses between the windows which descending to the ground were to admit to every part of the room and it was of octagonal form the various landscape One window opened upon a romantic glade where the eye roved among the woody recesses and the scene was bounded only by a lengthened pomp of groves from another the woods receding disclosed the distant summits of the Pyrenees a third fronted an avenue beyond which the grey towers of Chateau le Blanc and a picturesque part of its ruin were seen partially among the foliage while a fourth gave between the trees a glimpse of the green pastures and villages that diversify the banks of the Aude The Mediterranean with the bold cliffs that overlooked its shores were the grand objects of a fifth window and the others gave in different points of view the wild scenery of the woods After wandering for some time in these the party returned to the shore and embarked and the beauty of the evening tempting them to extend their excursion they proceeded further up the bay A dead calm had succeeded the light breeze that wafted them hither and the men took to their oars Around the waters were spread into one vast expanse of polished mirror reflecting the grey cliffs and feathery woods that over hung its surface the glow of the western horizon and the dark clouds that came slowly from the east Blanche loved to see the dipping oars imprint the water and to watch the spreading circles they left which gave a tremulous motion to the reflected landscape without destroying the harmony of its features Above the darkness of the woods her eye now caught a cluster of high towers touched with the splendour of the setting rays and soon after the horns being then silent she heard the faint swell of choral voices from a distance What voices are those upon the air said the Count looking round and listening but the strain had ceased It seemed to be a vesper hymn which I have often heard in my convent said Blanche We are near the monastery then observed the Count and the boat soon after doubling a lofty head land the monastery of saint Claire appeared seated near the margin of the sea where the cliffs suddenly sinking formed a low shore within a small bay almost encircled with woods among which partial features of the edifice were seen the great gate and gothic window of the hall the cloisters and the side of a chapel more remote while a venerable arch which had once led to a part of the fabric now demolished stood a majestic ruin detached from the main building beyond which appeared a grand perspective of the woods On the grey walls the moss had fastened and round the pointed windows of the chapel the ivy and the briony hung in many a fantastic wreath All without was silent and forsaken but while Blanche gazed with admiration on this venerable pile whose effect was heightened by the strong lights and shadows thrown athwart it by a cloudy sun set a sound of many voices slowly chanting arose from within The Count bade his men rest on their oars The monks were singing the hymn of vespers and some female voices mingled with the strain which rose by soft degrees till the high organ and the choral sounds swelled into full and solemn harmony The strain soon after dropped into sudden silence and was renewed in a low and still more solemn key till at length the holy chorus died away and was heard no more Blanche sighed tears trembled in her eyes and her thoughts seemed wafted with the sounds to heaven While a rapt stillness prevailed in the boat a train of friars and then of nuns veiled in white issued from the cloisters and passed under the shade of the woods to the main body of the edifice The Countess was the first of her party to awaken from this pause of silence These dismal hymns and friars make one quite melancholy said she twilight is coming on pray let us return or it will be dark before we get home The count looking up now perceived that the twilight of evening was anticipated by an approaching storm In the east a tempest was collecting a heavy gloom came on opposing and contrasting the glowing splendour of the setting sun The clamorous sea fowl skimmed in fleet circles upon the surface of the sea dipping their light pinions in the wave as they fled away in search of shelter The boatmen pulled hard at their oars but the thunder that now muttered at a distance and the heavy drops that began to dimple the water made the Count determine to put back to the monastery for shelter and the course of the boat was immediately changed As the clouds approached the west their lurid darkness changed to a deep ruddy glow which by reflection seemed to fire the tops of the woods and the shattered towers of the monastery The appearance of the heavens alarmed the Countess and Mademoiselle Bearn whose expressions of apprehension distressed the Count and perplexed his men while Blanche continued silent now agitated with fear and now with admiration as she viewed the grandeur of the clouds and their effect on the scenery and listened to the long long peals of thunder that rolled through the air The boat having reached the lawn before the monastery the Count sent a servant to announce his arrival and to entreat shelter of the Superior who soon after appeared at the great gate attended by several monks while the servant returned with a message expressive at once of hospitality and pride but of pride disguised in submission The party immediately disembarked and having hastily crossed the lawn for the shower was now heavy were received at the gate by the Superior who as they entered stretched forth his hands and gave his blessing and they passed into the great hall where the lady abbess waited attended by several nuns clothed like herself in black and veiled in white The veil of the abbess was however thrown half back and discovered a countenance whose chaste dignity was sweetened by the smile of welcome with which she addressed the Countess whom she led with Blanche and Mademoiselle Bearn into the convent parlour while the Count and Henri were conducted by the Superior to the refectory The Countess fatigued and discontented received the politeness of the abbess with careless haughtiness and had followed her with indolent steps to the parlour over which the painted casements and wainscot of larch wood threw at all times a melancholy shade and where the gloom of evening now loured almost to darkness While the lady abbess ordered refreshment and conversed with the Countess Blanche withdrew to a window the lower panes of which being without painting allowed her to observe the progress of the storm over the Mediterranean whose dark waves that had so lately slept now came boldly swelling in long succession to the shore where they burst in white foam and threw up a high spray over the rocks A red sulphureous tint overspread the long line of clouds that hung above the western horizon beneath whose dark skirts the sun looking out illumined the distant shores of Languedoc as well as the tufted summits of the nearer woods and shed a partial gleam on the western waves The rest of the scene was in deep gloom except where a sun beam darting between the clouds glanced on the white wings of the sea fowl that circled high among them or touched the swelling sail of a vessel which was seen labouring in the storm Blanche for some time anxiously watched the progress of the bark as it threw the waves in foam around it and as the lightnings flashed looked to the opening heavens with many a sigh for the fate of the poor mariners The sun at length set and the heavy clouds which had long impended dropped over the splendour of his course the vessel however was yet dimly seen and Blanche continued to observe it till the quick succession of flashes lighting up the gloom of the whole horizon warned her to retire from the window and she joined the Abbess who having exhausted all her topics of conversation with the Countess had now leisure to notice her But their discourse was interrupted by tremendous peals of thunder and the bell of the monastery soon after ringing out summoned the inhabitants to prayer As Blanche passed the window she gave another look to the ocean where by the momentary flash that illumined the vast body of the waters she distinguished the vessel she had observed before amidst a sea of foam breaking the billows the mast now bowing to the waves and then rising high in air She sighed fervently as she gazed and then followed the Lady Abbess and the Countess to the chapel Meanwhile some of the Count s servants having gone by land to the chateau for carriages returned soon after vespers had concluded when the storm being somewhat abated the Count and his family returned home Blanche was surprised to discover how much the windings of the shore had deceived her concerning the distance of the chateau from the monastery whose vesper bell she had heard on the preceding evening from the windows of the west saloon and whose towers she would also have seen from thence had not twilight veiled them On their arrival at the chateau the Countess affecting more fatigue than she really felt withdrew to her apartment and the Count with his daughter and Henri went to the supper room where they had not been long when they heard in a pause of the gust a firing of guns which the Count understanding to be signals of distress from some vessel in the storm went to a window that opened towards the Mediterranean to observe further but the sea was now involved in utter darkness and the loud howlings of the tempest had again overcome every other sound Blanche remembering the bark which she had before seen now joined her father with trembling anxiety In a few moments the report of guns was again borne along the wind and as suddenly wafted away a tremendous burst of thunder followed and in the flash that had preceded it and which seemed to quiver over the whole surface of the waters a vessel was discovered tossing amidst the white foam of the waves at some distance from the shore Impenetrable darkness again involved the scene but soon a second flash shewed the bark with one sail unfurled driving towards the coast Blanche hung upon her father s arm with looks full of the agony of united terror and pity which were unnecessary to awaken the heart of the Count who gazed upon the sea with a piteous expression and perceiving that no boat could live in the storm forbore to send one but he gave orders to his people to carry torches out upon the cliffs hoping they might prove a kind of beacon to the vessel or at least warn the crew of the rocks they were approaching While Henri went out to direct on what part of the cliffs the lights should appear Blanche remained with her father at the window catching every now and then as the lightnings flashed a glimpse of the vessel and she soon saw with reviving hope the torches flaming on the blackness of night and as they waved over the cliffs casting a red gleam on the gasping billows When the firing of guns was repeated the torches were tossed high in the air as if answering the signal and the firing was then redoubled but though the wind bore the sound away she fancied as the lightnings glanced that the vessel was much nearer the shore The Count s servants were now seen running to and fro on the rocks some venturing almost to the point of the crags and bending over held out their torches fastened to long poles while others whose steps could be traced only by the course of the lights descended the steep and dangerous path that wound to the margin of the sea and with loud halloos hailed the mariners whose shrill whistle and then feeble voices were heard at intervals mingling with the storm Sudden shouts from the people on the rocks increased the anxiety of Blanche to an almost intolerable degree but her suspense concerning the fate of the mariners was soon over when Henri running breathless into the room told that the vessel was anchored in the bay below but in so shattered a condition that it was feared she would part before the crew could disembark The Count immediately gave orders for his own boats to assist in bringing them to shore and that such of these unfortunate strangers as could not be accommodated in the adjacent hamlet should be entertained at the chateau Among the latter were Emily saint Aubert Monsieur Du Pont Ludovico and Annette who having embarked at Leghorn and reached Marseilles were from thence crossing the Gulf of Lyons when this storm overtook them They were received by the Count with his usual benignity who though Emily wished to have proceeded immediately to the monastery of saint Claire would not allow her to leave the chateau that night and indeed the terror and fatigue she had suffered would scarcely have permitted her to go farther In Monsieur Du Pont the Count discovered an old acquaintance and much joy and congratulation passed between them after which Emily was introduced by name to the Count s family whose hospitable benevolence dissipated the little embarrassment which her situation had occasioned her and the party were soon seated at the supper table The unaffected kindness of Blanche and the lively joy she expressed on the escape of the strangers for whom her pity had been so much interested gradually revived Emily s languid spirits and Du Pont relieved from his terrors for her and for himself felt the full contrast between his late situation on a dark and tremendous ocean and his present one in a cheerful mansion where he was surrounded with plenty elegance and smiles of welcome Annette meanwhile in the servants hall was telling of all the dangers she had encountered and congratulating herself so heartily upon her own and Ludovico s escape and on her present comforts that she often made all that part of the chateau ring with merriment and laughter Ludovico s spirits were as gay as her own but he had discretion enough to restrain them and tried to check hers though in vain till her laughter at length ascended to MY LADY S chamber who sent to enquire what occasioned so much uproar in the chateau and to command silence Emily withdrew early to seek the repose she so much required but her pillow was long a sleepless one On this her return to her native country many interesting remembrances were awakened all the events and sufferings she had experienced since she quitted it came in long succession to her fancy and were chased only by the image of Valancourt with whom to believe herself once more in the same land after they had been so long and so distantly separated gave her emotions of indescribable joy but which afterwards yielded to anxiety and apprehension when she considered the long period that had elapsed since any letter had passed between them and how much might have happened in this interval to affect her future peace But the thought that Valancourt might be now no more or if living might have forgotten her was so very terrible to her heart that she would scarcely suffer herself to pause upon the possibility She determined to inform him on the following day of her arrival in France which it was scarcely possible he could know but by a letter from herself and after soothing her spirits with the hope of soon hearing that he was well and unchanged in his affections she at length sunk to repose CHAPTER XII Oft woo d the gleam of Cynthia silver bright In cloisters dim far from the haunts of folly With freedom by my side and soft ey d melancholy GRAY The Lady Blanche was so much interested for Emily that upon hearing she was going to reside in the neighbouring convent she requested the Count would invite her to lengthen her stay at the chateau And you know my dear sir added Blanche how delighted I shall be with such a companion for at present I have no friend to walk or to read with since Mademoiselle Bearn is my mamma s friend only The Count smiled at the youthful simplicity with which his daughter yielded to first impressions and though he chose to warn her of their danger he silently applauded the benevolence that could thus readily expand in confidence to a stranger He had observed Emily with attention on the preceding evening and was as much pleased with her as it was possible he could be with any person on so short an acquaintance The mention made of her by Mons Du Pont had also given him a favourable impression of Emily but extremely cautious as to those whom he introduced to the intimacy of his daughter he determined on hearing that the former was no stranger at the convent of saint Claire to visit the abbess and if her account corresponded with his wish to invite Emily to pass some time at the chateau On this subject he was influenced by a consideration of the Lady Blanche s welfare still more than by either a wish to oblige her or to befriend the orphan Emily for whom however he felt considerably interested On the following morning Emily was too much fatigued to appear but Mons Du Pont was at the breakfast table when the Count entered the room who pressed him as his former acquaintance and the son of a very old friend to prolong his stay at the chateau an invitation which Du Pont willingly accepted since it would allow him to be near Emily and though he was not conscious of encouraging a hope that she would ever return his affection he had not fortitude enough to attempt at present to overcome it Emily when she was somewhat recovered wandered with her new friend over the grounds belonging to the chateau as much delighted with the surrounding views as Blanche in the benevolence of her heart had wished from thence she perceived beyond the woods the towers of the monastery and remarked that it was to this convent she designed to go Ah said Blanche with surprise I am but just released from a convent and would you go into one If you could know what pleasure I feel in wandering here at liberty and in seeing the sky and the fields and the woods all round me I think you would not Emily smiling at the warmth with which the Lady Blanche spoke observed that she did not mean to confine herself to a convent for life No you may not intend it now said Blanche but you do not know to what the nuns may persuade you to consent I know how kind they will appear and how happy for I have seen too much of their art When they returned to the chateau Lady Blanche conducted Emily to her favourite turret and from thence they rambled through the ancient chambers which Blanche had visited before Emily was amused by observing the structure of these apartments and the fashion of their old but still magnificent furniture and by comparing them with those of the castle of Udolpho which were yet more antique and grotesque She was also interested by Dorothee the house keeper who attended them whose appearance was almost as antique as the objects around her and who seemed no less interested by Emily on whom she frequently gazed with so much deep attention as scarcely to hear what was said to her While Emily looked from one of the casements she perceived with surprise some objects that were familiar to her memory the fields and woods with the gleaming brook which she had passed with La Voisin one evening soon after the death of Monsieur saint Aubert in her way from the monastery to her cottage and she now knew this to be the chateau which he had then avoided and concerning which he had dropped some remarkable hints Shocked by this discovery yet scarcely knowing why she mused for some time in silence and remembered the emotion which her father had betrayed on finding himself so near this mansion and some other circumstances of his conduct that now greatly interested her The music too which she had formerly heard and respecting which La Voisin had given such an odd account occurred to her and desirous of knowing more concerning it she asked Dorothee whether it returned at midnight as usual and whether the musician had yet been discovered Yes ma amselle replied Dorothee that music is still heard but the musician has never been found out nor ever will I believe though there are some people who can guess Indeed said Emily then why do they not pursue the enquiry Ah young lady enquiry enough has been made but who can pursue a spirit Emily smiled and remembering how lately she had suffered herself to be led away by superstition determined now to resist its contagion yet in spite of her efforts she felt awe mingle with her curiosity on this subject and Blanche who had hitherto listened in silence now enquired what this music was and how long it had been heard Ever since the death of my lady madam replied Dorothee Why the place is not haunted surely said Blanche between jesting and seriousness I have heard that music almost ever since my dear lady died continued Dorothee and never before then But that is nothing to some things I could tell of Do pray tell them then said Lady Blanche now more in earnest than in jest I am much interested for I have heard sister Henriette and sister Sophie in the convent tell of such strange appearances which they themselves had witnessed You never heard my lady I suppose what made us leave the chateau and go and live in a cottage said Dorothee Never replied Blanche with impatience Nor the reason that my lord the Marquis Dorothee checked herself hesitated and then endeavoured to change the topic but the curiosity of Blanche was too much awakened to suffer the subject thus easily to escape her and she pressed the old house keeper to proceed with her account upon whom however no entreaties could prevail and it was evident that she was alarmed for the imprudence into which she had already betrayed herself I perceive said Emily smiling that all old mansions are haunted I am lately come from a place of wonders but unluckily since I left it I have heard almost all of them explained Blanche was silent Dorothee looked grave and sighed and Emily felt herself still inclined to believe more of the wonderful than she chose to acknowledge Just then she remembered the spectacle she had witnessed in a chamber of Udolpho and by an odd kind of coincidence the alarming words that had accidentally met her eye in the MS papers which she had destroyed in obedience to the command of her father and she shuddered at the meaning they seemed to impart almost as much as at the horrible appearance disclosed by the black veil The Lady Blanche meanwhile unable to prevail with Dorothee to explain the subject of her late hints had desired on reaching the door that terminated the gallery and which she found fastened on the preceding day to see the suite of rooms beyond Dear young lady said the housekeeper I have told you my reason for not opening them I have never seen them since my dear lady died and it would go hard with me to see them now Pray madam do not ask me again Certainly I will not replied Blanche if that is really your objection Alas it is said the old woman we all loved her well and I shall always grieve for her Time runs round it is now many years since she died but I remember every thing that happened then as if it was but yesterday Many things that have passed of late years are gone quite from my memory while those so long ago I can see as if in a glass She paused but afterwards as they walked up the gallery added to Emily this young lady sometimes brings the late Marchioness to my mind I can remember when she looked just as blooming and very like her when she smiles Poor lady how gay she was when she first came to the chateau And was she not gay afterwards said Blanche Dorothee shook her head and Emily observed her with eyes strongly expressive of the interest she now felt Let us sit down in this window said the Lady Blanche on reaching the opposite end of the gallery and pray Dorothee if it is not painful to you tell us something more about the Marchioness I should like to look into the glass you spoke of just now and see a few of the circumstances which you say often pass over it No my lady replied Dorothee if you knew as much as I do you would not for you would find there a dismal train of them I often wish I could shut them out but they will rise to my mind I see my dear lady on her death bed her very look and remember all she said it was a terrible scene Why was it so terrible said Emily with emotion Ah dear young lady is not death always terrible replied Dorothee To some further enquiries of Blanche Dorothee was silent and Emily observing the tears in her eyes forbore to urge the subject and endeavoured to withdraw the attention of her young friend to some object in the gardens where the Count with the Countess and Monsieur Du Pont appearing they went down to join them When he perceived Emily he advanced to meet her and presented her to the Countess in a manner so benign that it recalled most powerfully to her mind the idea of her late father and she felt more gratitude to him than embarrassment towards the Countess who however received her with one of those fascinating smiles which her caprice sometimes allowed her to assume and which was now the result of a conversation the Count had held with her concerning Emily Whatever this might be or whatever had passed in his conversation with the lady abbess whom he had just visited esteem and kindness were strongly apparent in his manner when he addressed Emily who experienced that sweet emotion which arises from the consciousness of possessing the approbation of the good for to the Count s worth she had been inclined to yield her confidence almost from the first moment in which she had seen him Before she could finish her acknowledgments for the hospitality she had received and mention of her design of going immediately to the convent she was interrupted by an invitation to lengthen her stay at the chateau which was pressed by the Count and the Countess with an appearance of such friendly sincerity that though she much wished to see her old friends at the monastery and to sigh once more over her father s grave she consented to remain a few days at the chateau To the abbess however she immediately wrote mentioning her arrival in Languedoc and her wish to be received into the convent as a boarder she also sent letters to Monsieur Quesnel and to Valancourt whom she merely informed of her arrival in France and as she knew not where the latter might be stationed she directed her letter to his brother s seat in Gascony In the evening Lady Blanche and Mons Du Pont walked with Emily to the cottage of La Voisin which she had now a melancholy pleasure in approaching for time had softened her grief for the loss of saint Aubert though it could not annihilate it and she felt a soothing sadness in indulging the recollections which this scene recalled La Voisin was still living and seemed to enjoy as much as formerly the tranquil evening of a blameless life He was sitting at the door of his cottage watching some of his grandchildren playing on the grass before him and now and then with a laugh or a commendation encouraging their sports He immediately recollected Emily whom he was much pleased to see and she was as rejoiced to hear that he had not lost one of his family since her departure Yes ma amselle said the old man we all live merrily together still thank God and I believe there is not a happier family to be found in Languedoc than ours Emily did not trust herself in the chamber where saint Aubert died and after half an hour s conversation with La Voisin and his family she left the cottage During these the first days of her stay at Chateau le Blanc she was often affected by observing the deep but silent melancholy which at times stole over Du Pont and Emily pitying the self delusion which disarmed him of the will to depart determined to withdraw herself as soon as the respect she owed the Count and Countess De Villefort would permit The dejection of his friend soon alarmed the anxiety of the Count to whom Du Pont at length confided the secret of his hopeless affection which however the former could only commiserate though he secretly determined to befriend his suit if an opportunity of doing so should ever occur Considering the dangerous situation of Du Pont he but feebly opposed his intention of leaving Chateau le Blanc on the following day but drew from him a promise of a longer visit when he could return with safety to his peace Emily herself though she could not encourage his affection esteemed him both for the many virtues he possessed and for the services she had received from him and it was not without tender emotions of gratitude and pity that she now saw him depart for his family seat in Gascony while he took leave of her with a countenance so expressive of love and grief as to interest the Count more warmly in his cause than before In a few days Emily also left the chateau but not before the Count and Countess had received her promise to repeat her visit very soon and she was welcomed by the abbess with the same maternal kindness she had formerly experienced and by the nuns with much expression of regard The well known scenes of the convent occasioned her many melancholy recollections but with these were mingled others that inspired gratitude for having escaped the various dangers that had pursued her since she quitted it and for the good which she yet possessed and though she once more wept over her father s grave with tears of tender affection her grief was softened from its former acuteness Some time after her return to the monastery she received a letter from her uncle Mons Quesnel in answer to information that she had arrived in France and to her enquiries concerning such of her affairs as he had undertaken to conduct during her absence especially as to the period for which La Vallee had been let whither it was her wish to return if it should appear that her income would permit her to do so The reply of Mons Quesnel was cold and formal as she expected expressing neither concern for the evils she suffered nor pleasure that she was now removed from them nor did he allow the opportunity to pass of reproving her for her rejection of Count Morano whom he affected still to believe a man of honour and fortune nor of vehemently declaiming against Montoni to whom he had always till now felt himself to be inferior On Emily s pecuniary concerns he was not very explicit he informed her however that the term for which La Vallee had been engaged was nearly expired but without inviting her to his own house added that her circumstances would by no means allow her to reside there and earnestly advised her to remain for the present in the convent of saint Claire To her enquiries respecting poor old Theresa her late father s servant he gave no answer In the postscript to his letter Monsieur Quesnel mentioned M Motteville in whose hands the late saint Aubert had placed the chief of his personal property as being likely to arrange his affairs nearly to the satisfaction of his creditors and that Emily would recover much more of her fortune than she had formerly reason to expect The letter also inclosed to Emily an order upon a merchant at Narbonne for a small sum of money The tranquillity of the monastery and the liberty she was suffered to enjoy in wandering among the woods and shores of this delightful province gradually restored her spirits to their natural tone except that anxiety would sometimes intrude concerning Valancourt as the time approached when it was possible that she might receive an answer to her letter CHAPTER XIII As when a wave that from a cloud impends And swell d with tempests on the ship descends White are the decks with foam the winds aloud Howl o er the masts and sing through ev ry shroud Pale trembling tir d the sailors freeze with fears And instant death on ev ry wave appears POPE S HOMER The Lady Blanche meanwhile who was left much alone became impatient for the company of her new friend whom she wished to observe sharing in the delight she received from the beautiful scenery around She had now no person to whom she could express her admiration and communicate her pleasures no eye that sparkled to her smile or countenance that reflected her happiness and she became spiritless and pensive The Count observing her dissatisfaction readily yielded to her entreaties and reminded Emily of her promised visit but the silence of Valancourt which was now prolonged far beyond the period when a letter might have arrived from Estuviere oppressed Emily with severe anxiety and rendering her averse to society she would willingly have deferred her acceptance of this invitation till her spirits should be relieved The Count and his family however pressed to see her and as the circumstances that prompted her wish for solitude could not be explained there was an appearance of caprice in her refusal which she could not persevere in without offending the friends whose esteem she valued At length therefore she returned upon a second visit to Chateau le Blanc Here the friendly manner of Count De Villefort encouraged Emily to mention to him her situation respecting the estates of her late aunt and to consult him on the means of recovering them He had little doubt that the law would decide in her favour and advising her to apply to it offered first to write to an advocate at Avignon on whose opinion he thought he could rely His kindness was gratefully accepted by Emily who soothed by the courtesy she daily experienced would have been once more happy could she have been assured of Valancourt s welfare and unaltered affection She had now been above a week at the chateau without receiving intelligence of him and though she knew that if he was absent from his brother s residence it was scarcely probable her letter had yet reached him she could not forbear to admit doubts and fears that destroyed her peace Again she would consider of all that might have happened in the long period since her first seclusion at Udolpho and her mind was sometimes so overwhelmed with an apprehension that Valancourt was no more or that he lived no longer for her that the company even of Blanche became intolerably oppressive and she would sit alone in her apartment for hours together when the engagements of the family allowed her to do so without incivility In one of these solitary hours she unlocked a little box which contained some letters of Valancourt with some drawings she had sketched during her stay in Tuscany the latter of which were no longer interesting to her but in the letters she now with melancholy indulgence meant to retrace the tenderness that had so often soothed her and rendered her for a moment insensible of the distance which separated her from the writer But their effect was now changed the affection they expressed appealed so forcibly to her heart when she considered that it had perhaps yielded to the powers of time and absence and even the view of the hand writing recalled so many painful recollections that she found herself unable to go through the first she had opened and sat musing with her cheek resting on her arm and tears stealing from her eyes when old Dorothee entered the room to inform her that dinner would be ready an hour before the usual time Emily started on perceiving her and hastily put up the papers but not before Dorothee had observed both her agitation and her tears Ah ma amselle said she you who are so young have you reason for sorrow Emily tried to smile but was unable to speak Alas dear young lady when you come to my age you will not weep at trifles and surely you have nothing serious to grieve you No Dorothee nothing of any consequence replied Emily Dorothee now stooping to pick up something that had dropped from among the papers suddenly exclaimed Holy Mary what is it I see and then trembling sat down in a chair that stood by the table What is it you do see said Emily alarmed by her manner and looking round the room It is herself said Dorothee her very self just as she looked a little before she died Emily still more alarmed began now to fear that Dorothee was seized with sudden phrensy but entreated her to explain herself That picture said she where did you find it lady it is my blessed mistress herself She laid on the table the miniature which Emily had long ago found among the papers her father had enjoined her to destroy and over which she had once seen him shed such tender and affecting tears and recollecting all the various circumstances of his conduct that had long perplexed her her emotions increased to an excess which deprived her of all power to ask the questions she trembled to have answered and she could only enquire whether Dorothee was certain the picture resembled the late marchioness O ma amselle said she how came it to strike me so the instant I saw it if it was not my lady s likeness Ah added she taking up the miniature these are her own blue eyes looking so sweet and so mild and there is her very look such as I have often seen it when she had sat thinking for a long while and then the tears would often steal down her cheeks but she never would complain It was that look so meek as it were and resigned that used to break my heart and make me love her so Dorothee said Emily solemnly I am interested in the cause of that grief more so perhaps than you may imagine and I entreat that you will no longer refuse to indulge my curiosity it is not a common one As Emily said this she remembered the papers with which the picture had been found and had scarcely a doubt that they had concerned the Marchioness de Villeroi but with this supposition came a scruple whether she ought to enquire further on a subject which might prove to be the same that her father had so carefully endeavoured to conceal Her curiosity concerning the Marchioness powerful as it was it is probable she would now have resisted as she had formerly done on unwarily observing the few terrible words in the papers which had never since been erased from her memory had she been certain that the history of that lady was the subject of those papers or that such simple particulars only as it was probable Dorothee could relate were included in her father s command What was known to her could be no secret to many other persons and since it appeared very unlikely that saint Aubert should attempt to conceal what Emily might learn by ordinary means she at length concluded that if the papers had related to the story of the Marchioness it was not those circumstances of it which Dorothee could disclose that he had thought sufficiently important to wish to have concealed She therefore no longer hesitated to make the enquiries that might lead to the gratification of her curiosity Ah ma amselle said Dorothee it is a sad story and cannot be told now but what am I saying I never will tell it Many years have passed since it happened and I never loved to talk of the Marchioness to any body but my husband He lived in the family at that time as well as myself and he knew many particulars from me which nobody else did for I was about the person of my lady in her last illness and saw and heard as much or more than my lord himself Sweet saint how patient she was When she died I thought I could have died with her Dorothee said Emily interrupting her what you shall tell you may depend upon it shall never be disclosed by me I have I repeat it particular reasons for wishing to be informed on this subject and am willing to bind myself in the most solemn manner never to mention what you shall wish me to conceal Dorothee seemed surprised at the earnestness of Emily s manner and after regarding her for some moments in silence said Young lady that look of yours pleads for you it is so like my dear mistress s that I can almost fancy I see her before me if you were her daughter you could not remind me of her more But dinner will be ready had you not better go down You will first promise to grant my request said Emily And ought not you first to tell me ma amselle how this picture fell into your hands and the reasons you say you have for curiosity about my lady Why no Dorothee replied Emily recollecting herself I have also particular reasons for observing silence on these subjects at least till I know further and remember I do not promise ever to speak upon them therefore do not let me induce you to satisfy my curiosity from an expectation that I shall gratify yours What I may judge proper to conceal does not concern myself alone or I should have less scruple in revealing it let a confidence in my honour alone persuade you to disclose what I request Well lady replied Dorothee after a long pause during which her eyes were fixed upon Emily you seem so much interested and this picture and that face of yours make me think you have some reason to be so that I will trust you and tell some things that I never told before to any body but my husband though there are people who have suspected as much I will tell you the particulars of my lady s death too and some of my own suspicions but you must first promise me by all the saints Emily interrupting her solemnly promised never to reveal what should be confided to her without Dorothee s consent But there is the horn ma amselle sounding for dinner said Dorothee I must be gone When shall I see you again enquired Emily Dorothee mused and then replied Why madam it may make people curious if it is known I am so much in your apartment and that I should be sorry for so I will come when I am least likely to be observed I have little leisure in the day and I shall have a good deal to say so if you please ma am I will come when the family are all in bed That will suit me very well replied Emily Remember then to night Aye that is well remembered said Dorothee I fear I cannot come to night madam for there will be the dance of the vintage and it will be late before the servants go to rest for when they once set in to dance they will keep it up in the cool of the air till morning at least it used to be so in my time Ah is it the dance of the vintage said Emily with a deep sigh remembering that it was on the evening of this festival in the preceding year that saint Aubert and herself had arrived in the neighbourhood of Chateau le Blanc She paused a moment overcome by the sudden recollection and then recovering herself added But this dance is in the open woods you therefore will not be wanted and can easily come to me Dorothee replied that she had been accustomed to be present at the dance of the vintage and she did not wish to be absent now but if I can get away madam I will said she Emily then hastened to the dining room where the Count conducted himself with the courtesy which is inseparable from true dignity and of which the Countess frequently practised little though her manner to Emily was an exception to her usual habit But if she retained few of the ornamental virtues she cherished other qualities which she seemed to consider invaluable She had dismissed the grace of modesty but then she knew perfectly well how to manage the stare of assurance her manners had little of the tempered sweetness which is necessary to render the female character interesting but she could occasionally throw into them an affectation of spirits which seemed to triumph over every person who approached her In the country however she generally affected an elegant languor that persuaded her almost to faint when her favourite read to her a story of fictitious sorrow but her countenance suffered no change when living objects of distress solicited her charity and her heart beat with no transport to the thought of giving them instant relief she was a stranger to the highest luxury of which perhaps the human mind can be sensible for her benevolence had never yet called smiles upon the face of misery In the evening the Count with all his family except the Countess and Mademoiselle Bearn went to the woods to witness the festivity of the peasants The scene was in a glade where the trees opening formed a circle round the turf they highly overshadowed between their branches vines loaded with ripe clusters were hung in gay festoons and beneath were tables with fruit wine cheese and other rural fare and seats for the Count and his family At a little distance were benches for the elder peasants few of whom however could forbear to join the jocund dance which began soon after sun set when several of sixty tripped it with almost as much glee and airy lightness as those of sixteen The musicians who sat carelessly on the grass at the foot of a tree seemed inspired by the sound of their own instruments which were chiefly flutes and a kind of long guitar Behind stood a boy flourishing a tamborine and dancing a solo except that as he sometimes gaily tossed the instrument he tripped among the other dancers when his antic gestures called forth a broader laugh and heightened the rustic spirit of the scene The Count was highly delighted with the happiness he witnessed to which his bounty had largely contributed and the Lady Blanche joined the dance with a young gentleman of her father s party Du Pont requested Emily s hand but her spirits were too much depressed to permit her to engage in the present festivity which called to her remembrance that of the preceding year when saint Aubert was living and of the melancholy scenes which had immediately followed it Overcome by these recollections she at length left the spot and walked slowly into the woods where the softened music floating at a distance soothed her melancholy mind The moon threw a mellow light among the foliage the air was balmy and cool and Emily lost in thought strolled on without observing whither till she perceived the sounds sinking afar off and an awful stillness round her except that sometimes the nightingale beguiled the silence with Liquid notes that close the eye of day At length she found herself near the avenue which on the night of her father s arrival Michael had attempted to pass in search of a house which was still nearly as wild and desolate as it had then appeared for the Count had been so much engaged in directing other improvements that he had neglected to give orders concerning this extensive approach and the road was yet broken and the trees overloaded with their own luxuriance As she stood surveying it and remembering the emotions which she had formerly suffered there she suddenly recollected the figure that had been seen stealing among the trees and which had returned no answer to Michael s repeated calls and she experienced somewhat of the fear that had then assailed her for it did not appear improbable that these deep woods were occasionally the haunt of banditti She therefore turned back and was hastily pursuing her way to the dancers when she heard steps approaching from the avenue and being still beyond the call of the peasants on the green for she could neither hear their voices or their music she quickened her pace but the persons following gained fast upon her and at length distinguishing the voice of Henri she walked leisurely till he came up He expressed some surprise at meeting her so far from the company and on her saying that the pleasant moon light had beguiled her to walk farther than she intended an exclamation burst from the lips of his companion and she thought she heard Valancourt speak It was indeed he and the meeting was such as may be imagined between persons so affectionate and so long separated as they had been In the joy of these moments Emily forgot all her past sufferings and Valancourt seemed to have forgotten that any person but Emily existed while Henri was a silent and astonished spectator of the scene Valancourt asked a thousand questions concerning herself and Montoni which there was now no time to answer but she learned that her letter had been forwarded to him at Paris which he had previously quitted and was returning to Gascony whither the letter also returned which at length informed him of Emily s arrival and on the receipt of which he had immediately set out for Languedoc On reaching the monastery whence she had dated her letter he found to his extreme disappointment that the gates were already closed for the night and believing that he should not see Emily till the morrow he was returning to his little inn with the intention of writing to her when he was overtaken by Henri with whom he had been intimate at Paris and was led to her whom he was secretly lamenting that he should not see till the following day Emily with Valancourt and Henri now returned to the green where the latter presented Valancourt to the Count who she fancied received him with less than his usual benignity though it appeared that they were not strangers to each other He was invited however to partake of the diversions of the evening and when he had paid his respects to the Count and while the dancers continued their festivity he seated himself by Emily and conversed without restraint The lights which were hung among the trees under which they sat allowed her a more perfect view of the countenance she had so frequently in absence endeavoured to recollect and she perceived with some regret that it was not the same as when last she saw it There was all its wonted intelligence and fire but it had lost much of the simplicity and somewhat of the open benevolence that used to characterise it Still however it was an interesting countenance but Emily thought she perceived at intervals anxiety contract and melancholy fix the features of Valancourt sometimes too he fell into a momentary musing and then appeared anxious to dissipate thought while at others as he fixed his eyes on Emily a kind of sudden distraction seemed to cross his mind In her he perceived the same goodness and beautiful simplicity that had charmed him on their first acquaintance The bloom of her countenance was somewhat faded but all its sweetness remained and it was rendered more interesting than ever by the faint expression of melancholy that sometimes mingled with her smile At his request she related the most important circumstances that had occurred to her since she left France and emotions of pity and indignation alternately prevailed in his mind when he heard how much she had suffered from the villany of Montoni More than once when she was speaking of his conduct of which the guilt was rather softened than exaggerated by her representation he started from his seat and walked away apparently overcome as much by self accusation as by resentment Her sufferings alone were mentioned in the few words which he could address to her and he listened not to the account which she was careful to give as distinctly as possible of the present loss of Madame Montoni s estates and of the little reason there was to expect their restoration At length Valancourt remained lost in thought and then some secret cause seemed to overcome him with anguish Again he abruptly left her When he returned she perceived that he had been weeping and tenderly begged that he would compose himself My sufferings are all passed now said she for I have escaped from the tyranny of Montoni and I see you well let me also see you happy Valancourt was more agitated than before I am unworthy of you Emily said he I am unworthy of you words by his manner of uttering which Emily was then more shocked than by their import She fixed on him a mournful and enquiring eye Do not look thus on me said he turning away and pressing her hand I cannot bear those looks I would ask said Emily in a gentle but agitated voice the meaning of your words but I perceive that the question would distress you now Let us talk on other subjects To morrow perhaps you may be more composed Observe those moon light woods and the towers which appear obscurely in the perspective You used to be a great admirer of landscape and I have heard you say that the faculty of deriving consolation under misfortune from the sublime prospects which neither oppression or poverty with hold from us was the peculiar blessing of the innocent Valancourt was deeply affected Yes replied he I had once a taste for innocent and elegant delights I had once an uncorrupted heart Then checking himself he added Do you remember our journey together in the Pyrenees Can I forget it said Emily Would that I could he replied that was the happiest period of my life I then loved with enthusiasm whatever was truly great or good It was some time before Emily could repress her tears and try to command her emotions If you wish to forget that journey said she it must certainly be my wish to forget it also She paused and then added You make me very uneasy but this is not the time for further enquiry yet how can I bear to believe even for a moment that you are less worthy of my esteem than formerly I have still sufficient confidence in your candour to believe that when I shall ask for an explanation you will give it me Yes said Valancourt yes Emily I have not yet lost my candour if I had I could better have disguised my emotions on learning what were your sufferings your virtues while I I but I will say no more I did not mean to have said even so much I have been surprised into the self accusation Tell me Emily that you will not forget that journey will not wish to forget it and I will be calm I would not lose the remembrance of it for the whole earth How contradictory is this said Emily but we may be overheard My recollection of it shall depend upon yours I will endeavour to forget or to recollect it as you may do Let us join the Count Tell me first said Valancourt that you forgive the uneasiness I have occasioned you this evening and that you will still love me I sincerely forgive you replied Emily You best know whether I shall continue to love you for you know whether you deserve my esteem At present I will believe that you do It is unnecessary to say added she observing his dejection how much pain it would give me to believe otherwise The young lady who approaches is the Count s daughter Valancourt and Emily now joined the Lady Blanche and the party soon after sat down with the Count his son and the Chevalier Du Pont at a banquet spread under a gay awning beneath the trees At the table also were seated several of the most venerable of the Count s tenants and it was a festive repast to all but Valancourt and Emily When the Count retired to the chateau he did not invite Valancourt to accompany him who therefore took leave of Emily and retired to his solitary inn for the night meanwhile she soon withdrew to her own apartment where she mused with deep anxiety and concern on his behaviour and on the Count s reception of him Her attention was thus so wholly engaged that she forgot Dorothee and her appointment till morning was far advanced when knowing that the good old woman would not come she retired for a few hours to repose On the following day when the Count had accidentally joined Emily in one of the walks they talked of the festival of the preceding evening and this led him to a mention of Valancourt That is a young man of talents said he you were formerly acquainted with him I perceive Emily said that she was He was introduced to me at Paris said the Count and I was much pleased with him on our first acquaintance He paused and Emily trembled between the desire of hearing more and the fear of shewing the Count that she felt an interest on the subject May I ask said he at length how long you have known Monsieur Valancourt Will you allow me to ask your reason for the question sir said she and I will answer it immediately Certainly said the Count that is but just I will tell you my reason I cannot but perceive that Monsieur Valancourt admires you in that however there is nothing extraordinary every person who sees you must do the same I am above using common place compliments I speak with sincerity What I fear is that he is a favoured admirer Why do you fear it sir said Emily endeavouring to conceal her emotion Because replied the Count I think him not worthy of your favour Emily greatly agitated entreated further explanation I will give it said he if you will believe that nothing but a strong interest in your welfare could induce me to hazard that assertion I must believe so sir replied Emily But let us rest under these trees said the Count observing the paleness of her countenance here is a seat you are fatigued They sat down and the Count proceeded Many young ladies circumstanced as you are would think my conduct on this occasion and on so short an acquaintance impertinent instead of friendly from what I have observed of your temper and understanding I do not fear such a return from you Our acquaintance has been short but long enough to make me esteem you and feel a lively interest in your happiness You deserve to be very happy and I trust that you will be so Emily sighed softly and bowed her thanks The Count paused again I am unpleasantly circumstanced said he but an opportunity of rendering you important service shall overcome inferior considerations Will you inform me of the manner of your first acquaintance with the Chevalier Valancourt if the subject is not too painful Emily briefly related the accident of their meeting in the presence of her father and then so earnestly entreated the Count not to hesitate in declaring what he knew that he perceived the violent emotion against which she was contending and regarding her with a look of tender compassion considered how he might communicate his information with least pain to his anxious auditor The Chevalier and my son said he were introduced to each other at the table of a brother officer at whose house I also met him and invited him to my own whenever he should be disengaged I did not then know that he had formed an acquaintance with a set of men a disgrace to their species who live by plunder and pass their lives in continual debauchery I knew several of the Chevalier s family resident at Paris and considered them as sufficient pledges for his introduction to my own But you are ill I will leave the subject No sir said Emily I beg you will proceed I am only distressed ONLY said the Count with emphasis however I will proceed I soon learned that these his associates had drawn him into a course of dissipation from which he appeared to have neither the power nor the inclination to extricate himself He lost large sums at the gaming table he became infatuated with play and was ruined I spoke tenderly of this to his friends who assured me that they had remonstrated with him till they were weary I afterwards learned that in consideration of his talents for play which were generally successful when unopposed by the tricks of villany that in consideration of these the party had initiated him into the secrets of their trade and allotted him a share of their profits Impossible said Emily suddenly but pardon me sir I scarcely know what I say allow for the distress of my mind I must indeed I must believe that you have not been truly informed The Chevalier had doubtless enemies who misrepresented him I should be most happy to believe so replied the Count but I cannot Nothing short of conviction and a regard for your happiness could have urged me to repeat these unpleasant reports Emily was silent She recollected Valancourt s sayings on the preceding evening which discovered the pangs of self reproach and seemed to confirm all that the Count had related Yet she had not fortitude enough to dare conviction Her heart was overwhelmed with anguish at the mere suspicion of his guilt and she could not endure a belief of it After a silence the Count said I perceive and can allow for your want of conviction It is necessary I should give some proof of what I have asserted but this I cannot do without subjecting one who is very dear to me to danger What is the danger you apprehend sir said Emily if I can prevent it you may safely confide in my honour On your honour I am certain I can rely said the Count but can I trust your fortitude Do you think you can resist the solicitation of a favoured admirer when he pleads in affliction for the name of one who has robbed him of a blessing I shall not be exposed to such a temptation sir said Emily with modest pride for I cannot favour one whom I must no longer esteem I however readily give my word Tears in the mean time contradicted her first assertion and she felt that time and effort only could eradicate an affection which had been formed on virtuous esteem and cherished by habit and difficulty I will trust you then said the Count for conviction is necessary to your peace and cannot I perceive be obtained without this confidence My son has too often been an eye witness of the Chevalier s ill conduct he was very near being drawn in by it he was indeed drawn in to the commission of many follies but I rescued him from guilt and destruction Judge then Mademoiselle saint Aubert whether a father who had nearly lost his only son by the example of the Chevalier has not from conviction reason to warn those whom he esteems against trusting their happiness in such hands I have myself seen the Chevalier engaged in deep play with men whom I almost shuddered to look upon If you still doubt I will refer you to my son I must not doubt what you have yourself witnessed replied Emily sinking with grief or what you assert But the Chevalier has perhaps been drawn only into a transient folly which he may never repeat If you had known the justness of his former principles you would allow for my present incredulity Alas observed the Count it is difficult to believe that which will make us wretched But I will not sooth you by flattering and false hopes We all know how fascinating the vice of gaming is and how difficult it is also to conquer habits the Chevalier might perhaps reform for a while but he would soon relapse into dissipation for I fear not only the bonds of habit would be powerful but that his morals are corrupted And why should I conceal from you that play is not his only vice he appears to have a taste for every vicious pleasure The Count hesitated and paused while Emily endeavoured to support herself as with increasing perturbation she expected what he might further say A long pause of silence ensued during which he was visibly agitated at length he said It would be a cruel delicacy that could prevail with me to be silent and I will inform you that the Chevalier s extravagance has brought him twice into the prisons of Paris from whence he was last extricated as I was told upon authority which I cannot doubt by a well known Parisian Countess with whom he continued to reside when I left Paris He paused again and looking at Emily perceived her countenance change and that she was falling from the seat he caught her but she had fainted and he called loudly for assistance They were however beyond the hearing of his servants at the chateau and he feared to leave her while he went thither for assistance yet knew not how otherwise to obtain it till a fountain at no great distance caught his eye and he endeavoured to support Emily against the tree under which she had been sitting while he went thither for water But again he was perplexed for he had nothing near him in which water could be brought but while with increased anxiety he watched her he thought he perceived in her countenance symptoms of returning life It was long however before she revived and then she found herself supported not by the Count but by Valancourt who was observing her with looks of earnest apprehension and who now spoke to her in a tone tremulous with his anxiety At the sound of his well known voice she raised her eyes but presently closed them and a faintness again came over her The Count with a look somewhat stern waved him to withdraw but he only sighed heavily and called on the name of Emily as he again held the water that had been brought to her lips On the Count s repeating his action and accompanying it with words Valancourt answered him with a look of deep resentment and refused to leave the place till she should revive or to resign her for a moment to the care of any person In the next instant his conscience seemed to inform him of what had been the subject of the Count s conversation with Emily and indignation flashed in his eyes but it was quickly repressed and succeeded by an expression of serious anguish that induced the Count to regard him with more pity than resentment and the view of which so much affected Emily when she again revived that she yielded to the weakness of tears But she soon restrained them and exerting her resolution to appear recovered she rose thanked the Count and Henri with whom Valancourt had entered the garden for their care and moved towards the chateau without noticing Valancourt who heart struck by her manner exclaimed in a low voice Good God how have I deserved this what has been said to occasion this change Emily without replying but with increased emotion quickened her steps What has thus disordered you Emily said he as he still walked by her side give me a few moments conversation I entreat you I am very miserable Though this was spoken in a low voice it was overheard by the Count who immediately replied that Mademoiselle saint Aubert was then too much indisposed to attend to any conversation but that he would venture to promise she would see Monsieur Valancourt on the morrow if she was better Valancourt s cheek was crimsoned he looked haughtily at the Count and then at Emily with successive expressions of surprise grief and supplication which she could neither misunderstand or resist and she said languidly I shall be better tomorrow and if you wish to accept the Count s permission I will see you then See me exclaimed Valancourt as he threw a glance of mingled pride and resentment upon the Count and then seeming to recollect himself he added But I will come madam I will accept the Count s PERMISSION When they reached the door of the chateau he lingered a moment for his resentment was now fled and then with a look so expressive of tenderness and grief that Emily s heart was not proof against it he bade her good morning and bowing slightly to the Count disappeared Emily withdrew to her own apartment under such oppression of heart as she had seldom known when she endeavoured to recollect all that the Count had told to examine the probability of the circumstances he himself believed and to consider of her future conduct towards Valancourt But when she attempted to think her mind refused controul and she could only feel that she was miserable One moment she sunk under the conviction that Valancourt was no longer the same whom she had so tenderly loved the idea of whom had hitherto supported her under affliction and cheered her with the hope of happier days but a fallen a worthless character whom she must teach herself to despise if she could not forget Then unable to endure this terrible supposition she rejected it and disdained to believe him capable of conduct such as the Count had described to whom she believed he had been misrepresented by some artful enemy and there were moments when she even ventured to doubt the integrity of the Count himself and to suspect that he was influenced by some selfish motive to break her connection with Valancourt But this was the error of an instant only the Count s character which she had heard spoken of by Du Pont and many other persons and had herself observed enabled her to judge and forbade the supposition had her confidence indeed been less there appeared to be no temptation to betray him into conduct so treacherous and so cruel Nor did reflection suffer her to preserve the hope that Valancourt had been mis represented to the Count who had said that he spoke chiefly from his own observation and from his son s experience She must part from Valancourt therefore for ever for what of either happiness or tranquillity could she expect with a man whose tastes were degenerated into low inclinations and to whom vice was become habitual whom she must no longer esteem though the remembrance of what he once was and the long habit of loving him would render it very difficult for her to despise him O Valancourt she would exclaim having been separated so long do we meet only to be miserable only to part for ever Amidst all the tumult of her mind she remembered pertinaciously the seeming candour and simplicity of his conduct on the preceding night and had she dared to trust her own heart it would have led her to hope much from this Still she could not resolve to dismiss him for ever without obtaining further proof of his ill conduct yet she saw no probability of procuring it if indeed proof more positive was possible Something however it was necessary to decide upon and she almost determined to be guided in her opinion solely by the manner with which Valancourt should receive her hints concerning his late conduct Thus passed the hours till dinner time when Emily struggling against the pressure of her grief dried her tears and joined the family at table where the Count preserved towards her the most delicate attention but the Countess and Mademoiselle Bearn having looked for a moment with surprise on her dejected countenance began as usual to talk of trifles while the eyes of Lady Blanche asked much of her friend who could only reply by a mournful smile Emily withdrew as soon after dinner as possible and was followed by the Lady Blanche whose anxious enquiries however she found herself quite unequal to answer and whom she entreated to spare her on the subject of her distress To converse on any topic was now indeed so extremely painful to her that she soon gave up the attempt and Blanche left her with pity of the sorrow which she perceived she had no power to assuage Emily secretly determined to go to her convent in a day or two for company especially that of the Countess and Mademoiselle Bearn was intolerable to her in the present state of her spirits and in the retirement of the convent as well as the kindness of the abbess she hoped to recover the command of her mind and to teach it resignation to the event which she too plainly perceived was approaching To have lost Valancourt by death or to have seen him married to a rival would she thought have given her less anguish than a conviction of his unworthiness which must terminate in misery to himself and which robbed her even of the solitary image her heart so long had cherished These painful reflections were interrupted for a moment by a note from Valancourt written in evident distraction of mind entreating that she would permit him to see her on the approaching evening instead of the following morning a request which occasioned her so much agitation that she was unable to answer it She wished to see him and to terminate her present state of suspense yet shrunk from the interview and incapable of deciding for herself she at length sent to beg a few moments conversation with the Count in his library where she delivered to him the note and requested his advice After reading it he said that if she believed herself well enough to support the interview his opinion was that for the relief of both parties it ought to take place that evening His affection for you is undoubtedly a very sincere one added the Count and he appears so much distressed and you my amiable friend are so ill at ease that the sooner the affair is decided the better Emily replied therefore to Valancourt that she would see him and then exerted herself in endeavours to attain fortitude and composure to bear her through the approaching scene a scene so afflictingly the reverse of any to which she had looked forward VOLUME four CHAPTER I Is all the council that we two have shared the hours that we have spent When we have chid the hasty footed time For parting us Oh and is all forgot And will you rend our ancient love asunder MIDSUMMER NIGHT S DREAM In the evening when Emily was at length informed that Count De Villefort requested to see her she guessed that Valancourt was below and endeavouring to assume composure and to recollect all her spirits she rose and left the apartment but on reaching the door of the library where she imagined him to be her emotion returned with such energy that fearing to trust herself in the room she returned into the hall where she continued for a considerable time unable to command her agitated spirits When she could recall them she found in the library Valancourt seated with the Count who both rose on her entrance but she did not dare to look at Valancourt and the Count having led her to a chair immediately withdrew Emily remained with her eyes fixed on the floor under such oppression of heart that she could not speak and with difficulty breathed while Valancourt threw himself into a chair beside her and sighing heavily continued silent when had she raised her eyes she would have perceived the violent emotions with which he was agitated At length in a tremulous voice he said I have solicited to see you this evening that I might at least be spared the further torture of suspense which your altered manner had occasioned me and which the hints I have just received from the Count have in part explained I perceive I have enemies Emily who envied me my late happiness and who have been busy in searching out the means to destroy it I perceive too that time and absence have weakened the affection you once felt for me and that you can now easily be taught to forget me His last words faltered and Emily less able to speak than before continued silent O what a meeting is this exclaimed Valancourt starting from his seat and pacing the room with hurried steps what a meeting is this after our long long separation Again he sat down and after the struggle of a moment he added in a firm but despairing tone This is too much I cannot bear it Emily will you not speak to me He covered his face with his hand as if to conceal his emotion and took Emily s which she did not withdraw Her tears could no longer be restrained and when he raised his eyes and perceived that she was weeping all his tenderness returned and a gleam of hope appeared to cross his mind for he exclaimed O you do pity me then you do love me Yes you are still my own Emily let me believe those tears that tell me so Emily now made an effort to recover her firmness and hastily drying them Yes said she I do pity you I weep for you but ought I to think of you with affection You may remember that yester evening I said I had still sufficient confidence in your candour to believe that when I should request an explanation of your words you would give it This explanation is now unnecessary I understand them too well but prove at least that your candour is deserving of the confidence I give it when I ask you whether you are conscious of being the same estimable Valancourt whom I once loved Once loved cried he the same the same He paused in extreme emotion and then added in a voice at once solemn and dejected No I am not the same I am lost I am no longer worthy of you He again concealed his face Emily was too much affected by this honest confession to reply immediately and while she struggled to overcome the pleadings of her heart and to act with the decisive firmness which was necessary for her future peace she perceived all the danger of trusting long to her resolution in the presence of Valancourt and was anxious to conclude an interview that tortured them both yet when she considered that this was probably their last meeting her fortitude sunk at once and she experienced only emotions of tenderness and of despondency Valancourt meanwhile lost in emotions of remorse and grief which he had neither the power or the will to express sat insensible almost of the presence of Emily his features still concealed and his breast agitated by convulsive sighs Spare me the necessity said Emily recollecting her fortitude spare me the necessity of mentioning those circumstances of your conduct which oblige me to break our connection forever We must part I now see you for the last time Impossible cried Valancourt roused from his deep silence You cannot mean what you say you cannot mean to throw me from you forever We must part repeated Emily with emphasis and that forever Your own conduct has made this necessary This is the Count s determination said he haughtily not yours and I shall enquire by what authority he interferes between us He now rose and walked about the room in great emotion Let me save you from this error said Emily not less agitated it is my determination and if you reflect a moment on your late conduct you will perceive that my future peace requires it Your future peace requires that we should part part forever said Valancourt How little did I ever expect to hear you say so And how little did I expect that it would be necessary for me to say so rejoined Emily while her voice softened into tenderness and her tears flowed again That you you Valancourt would ever fall from my esteem He was silent a moment as if overwhelmed by the consciousness of no longer deserving this esteem as well as the certainty of having lost it and then with impassioned grief lamented the criminality of his late conduct and the misery to which it had reduced him till overcome by a recollection of the past and a conviction of the future he burst into tears and uttered only deep and broken sighs The remorse he had expressed and the distress he suffered could not be witnessed by Emily with indifference and had she not called to her recollection all the circumstances of which Count De Villefort had informed her and all he had said of the danger of confiding in repentance formed under the influence of passion she might perhaps have trusted to the assurances of her heart and have forgotten his misconduct in the tenderness which that repentance excited Valancourt returning to the chair beside her at length said in a calm voice Tis true I am fallen fallen from my own esteem but could you Emily so soon so suddenly resign if you had not before ceased to love me or if your conduct was not governed by the designs I will say the selfish designs of another person Would you not otherwise be willing to hope for my reformation and could you bear by estranging me from you to abandon me to misery to myself Emily wept aloud No Emily no you would not do this if you still loved me You would find your own happiness in saving mine There are too many probabilities against that hope said Emily to justify me in trusting the comfort of my whole life to it May I not also ask whether you could wish me to do this if you really loved me Really loved you exclaimed Valancourt is it possible you can doubt my love Yet it is reasonable that you should do so since you see that I am less ready to suffer the horror of parting with you than that of involving you in my ruin Yes Emily I am ruined irreparably ruined I am involved in debts which I can never discharge Valancourt s look which was wild as he spoke this soon settled into an expression of gloomy despair and Emily while she was compelled to admire his sincerity saw with unutterable anguish new reasons for fear in the suddenness of his feelings and the extent of the misery in which they might involve him After some minutes she seemed to contend against her grief and to struggle for fortitude to conclude the interview I will not prolong these moments said she by a conversation which can answer no good purpose Valancourt farewell You are not going said he wildly interrupting her You will not leave me thus you will not abandon me even before my mind has suggested any possibility of compromise between the last indulgence of my despair and the endurance of my loss Emily was terrified by the sternness of his look and said in a soothing voice You have yourself acknowledged that it is necessary we should part if you wish that I should believe you love me you will repeat the acknowledgment Never never cried he I was distracted when I made it O Emily this is too much though you are not deceived as to my faults you must be deluded into this exasperation against them The Count is the barrier between us but he shall not long remain so You are indeed distracted said Emily the Count is not your enemy on the contrary he is my friend and that might in some degree induce you to consider him as yours Your friend said Valancourt hastily how long has he been your friend that he can so easily make you forget your lover Was it he who recommended to your favour the Monsieur Du Pont who you say accompanied you from Italy and who I say has stolen your affections But I have no right to question you you are your own mistress Du Pont perhaps may not long triumph over my fallen fortunes Emily more frightened than before by the frantic looks of Valancourt said in a tone scarcely audible For heaven s sake be reasonable be composed Monsieur Du Pont is not your rival nor is the Count his advocate You have no rival nor except yourself an enemy My heart is wrung with anguish which must increase while your frantic behaviour shews me more than ever that you are no longer the Valancourt I have been accustomed to love He made no reply but sat with his arms rested on the table and his face concealed by his hands while Emily stood silent and trembling wretched for herself and dreading to leave him in this state of mind O excess of misery he suddenly exclaimed that I can never lament my sufferings without accusing myself nor remember you without recollecting the folly and the vice by which I have lost you Why was I forced to Paris and why did I yield to allurements which were to make me despicable for ever O why cannot I look back without interruption to those days of innocence and peace the days of our early love The recollection seemed to melt his heart and the frenzy of despair yielded to tears After a long pause turning towards her and taking her hand he said in a softened voice Emily can you bear that we should part can you resolve to give up an heart that loves you like mine an heart which though it has erred widely erred is not irretrievable from error as you well know it never can be retrievable from love Emily made no reply but with her tears Can you continued he can you forget all our former days of happiness and confidence when I had not a thought that I might wish to conceal from you when I had no taste no pleasures in which you did not participate O do not lead me to the remembrance of those days said Emily unless you can teach me to forget the present I do not mean to reproach you if I did I should be spared these tears but why will you render your present sufferings more conspicuous by contrasting them with your former virtues Those virtues said Valancourt might perhaps again be mine if your affection which nurtured them was unchanged but I fear indeed I see that you can no longer love me else the happy hours which we have passed together would plead for me and you could not look back upon them unmoved Yet why should I torture myself with the remembrance why do I linger here Am I not ruined would it not be madness to involve you in my misfortunes even if your heart was still my own I will not distress you further Yet before I go added he in a solemn voice let me repeat that whatever may be my destiny whatever I may be doomed to suffer I must always love you most fondly love you I am going Emily I am going to leave you to leave you forever As he spoke the last words his voice trembled and he threw himself again into the chair from which he had risen Emily was utterly unable to leave the room or to say farewell All impression of his criminal conduct and almost of his follies was obliterated from her mind and she was sensible only of pity and grief My fortitude is gone said Valancourt at length I can no longer even struggle to recall it I cannot now leave you I cannot bid you an eternal farewell say at least that you will see me once again Emily s heart was somewhat relieved by the request and she endeavoured to believe that she ought not to refuse it Yet she was embarrassed by recollecting that she was a visitor in the house of the Count who could not be pleased by the return of Valancourt Other considerations however soon overcame this and she granted his request on the condition that he would neither think of the Count as his enemy nor Du Pont as his rival He then left her with a heart so much lightened by this short respite that he almost lost every former sense of misfortune Emily withdrew to her own room that she might compose her spirits and remove the traces of her tears which would encourage the censorious remarks of the Countess and her favourite as well as excite the curiosity of the rest of the family She found it however impossible to tranquillize her mind from which she could not expel the remembrance of the late scene with Valancourt or the consciousness that she was to see him again on the morrow This meeting now appeared more terrible to her than the last for the ingenuous confession he had made of his ill conduct and his embarrassed circumstances with the strength and tenderness of affection which this confession discovered had deeply impressed her and in spite of all she had heard and believed to his disadvantage her esteem began to return It frequently appeared to her impossible that he could have been guilty of the depravities reported of him which if not inconsistent with his warmth and impetuosity were entirely so with his candour and sensibility Whatever was the criminality which had given rise to the reports she could not now believe them to be wholly true nor that his heart was finally closed against the charms of virtue The deep consciousness which he felt as well as expressed of his errors seemed to justify the opinion and as she understood not the instability of youthful dispositions when opposed by habit and that professions frequently deceive those who make as well as those who hear them she might have yielded to the flattering persuasions of her own heart and the pleadings of Valancourt had she not been guided by the superior prudence of the Count He represented to her in a clear light the danger of her present situation that of listening to promises of amendment made under the influence of strong passion and the slight hope which could attach to a connection whose chance of happiness rested upon the retrieval of ruined circumstances and the reform of corrupted habits On these accounts he lamented that Emily had consented to a second interview for he saw how much it would shake her resolution and increase the difficulty of her conquest Her mind was now so entirely occupied by nearer interests that she forgot the old housekeeper and the promised history which so lately had excited her curiosity but which Dorothee was probably not very anxious to disclose for night came the hours passed and she did not appear in Emily s chamber With the latter it was a sleepless and dismal night the more she suffered her memory to dwell on the late scenes with Valancourt the more her resolution declined and she was obliged to recollect all the arguments which the Count had made use of to strengthen it and all the precepts which she had received from her deceased father on the subject of self command to enable her to act with prudence and dignity on this the most severe occasion of her life There were moments when all her fortitude forsook her and when remembering the confidence of former times she thought it impossible that she could renounce Valancourt His reformation then appeared certain the arguments of Count De Villefort were forgotten she readily believed all she wished and was willing to encounter any evil rather than that of an immediate separation Thus passed the night in ineffectual struggles between affection and reason and she rose in the morning with a mind weakened and irresolute and a frame trembling with illness CHAPTER II Come weep with me past hope past cure past help ROMEO AND JULIET Valancourt meanwhile suffered the tortures of remorse and despair The sight of Emily had renewed all the ardour with which he first loved her and which had suffered a temporary abatement from absence and the passing scenes of busy life When on the receipt of her letter he set out for Languedoc he then knew that his own folly had involved him in ruin and it was no part of his design to conceal this from her But he lamented only the delay which his ill conduct must give to their marriage and did not foresee that the information could induce her to break their connection forever While the prospect of this separation overwhelmed his mind before stung with self reproach he awaited their second interview in a state little short of distraction yet was still inclined to hope that his pleadings might prevail upon her not to exact it In the morning he sent to know at what hour she would see him and his note arrived when she was with the Count who had sought an opportunity of again conversing with her of Valancourt for he perceived the extreme distress of her mind and feared more than ever that her fortitude would desert her Emily having dismissed the messenger the Count returned to the subject of their late conversation urging his fear of Valancourt s entreaties and again pointing out to her the lengthened misery that must ensue if she should refuse to encounter some present uneasiness His repeated arguments could indeed alone have protected her from the affection she still felt for Valancourt and she resolved to be governed by them The hour of interview at length arrived Emily went to it at least with composure of manner but Valancourt was so much agitated that he could not speak for several minutes and his first words were alternately those of lamentation entreaty and self reproach Afterward he said Emily I have loved you I do love you better than my life but I am ruined by my own conduct Yet I would seek to entangle you in a connection that must be miserable for you rather than subject myself to the punishment which is my due the loss of you I am a wretch but I will be a villain no longer I will not endeavour to shake your resolution by the pleadings of a selfish passion I resign you Emily and will endeavour to find consolation in considering that though I am miserable you at least may be happy The merit of the sacrifice is indeed not my own for I should never have attained strength of mind to surrender you if your prudence had not demanded it He paused a moment while Emily attempted to conceal the tears which came to her eyes She would have said You speak now as you were wont to do but she checked herself Forgive me Emily said he all the sufferings I have occasioned you and sometimes when you think of the wretched Valancourt remember that his only consolation would be to believe that you are no longer unhappy by his folly The tears now fell fast upon her cheek and he was relapsing into the phrensy of despair when Emily endeavoured to recall her fortitude and to terminate an interview which only seemed to increase the distress of both Perceiving her tears and that she was rising to go Valancourt struggled once more to overcome his own feelings and to sooth hers The remembrance of this sorrow said he shall in future be my protection O never again will example or temptation have power to seduce me to evil exalted as I shall be by the recollection of your grief for me Emily was somewhat comforted by this assurance We are now parting for ever said she but if my happiness is dear to you you will always remember that nothing can contribute to it more than to believe that you have recovered your own esteem Valancourt took her hand his eyes were covered with tears and the farewell he would have spoken was lost in sighs After a few moments Emily said with difficulty and emotion Farewell Valancourt may you be happy She repeated her farewell and attempted to withdraw her hand but he still held it and bathed it with his tears Why prolong these moments said Emily in a voice scarcely audible they are too painful to us both This is too too much exclaimed Valancourt resigning her hand and throwing himself into a chair where he covered his face with his hands and was overcome for some moments by convulsive sighs After a long pause during which Emily wept in silence and Valancourt seemed struggling with his grief she again rose to take leave of him Then endeavouring to recover his composure I am again afflicting you said he but let the anguish I suffer plead for me He then added in a solemn voice which frequently trembled with the agitation of his heart Farewell Emily you will always be the only object of my tenderness Sometimes you will think of the unhappy Valancourt and it will be with pity though it may not be with esteem O what is the whole world to me without you without your esteem He checked himself I am falling again into the error I have just lamented I must not intrude longer upon your patience or I shall relapse into despair He once more bade Emily adieu pressed her hand to his lips looked at her for the last time and hurried out of the room Emily remained in the chair where he had left her oppressed with a pain at her heart which scarcely permitted her to breathe and listening to his departing steps sinking fainter and fainter as he crossed the hall She was at length roused by the voice of the Countess in the garden and her attention being then awakened the first object which struck her sight was the vacant chair where Valancourt had sat The tears which had been for some time repressed by the kind of astonishment that followed his departure now came to her relief and she was at length sufficiently composed to return to her own room CHAPTER III

3125-132586-0001	train-other-500	were soon lost in nearer interests than any which the unhappy Emily had awakened His depredations having exceeded their usual limits and reached an extent at which neither the timidity of the then commercial senate of Venice

3125-132586-0003	train-other-500	solicited an interview with the Minister who directed the enterprise To him he represented that the situation of Udolpho rendered it too strong to be taken by open force except after some tedious operations
3125-132586-0004	train-other-500	that Montoni had lately shewn how capable he was of adding to its strength all the advantages which could be derived from the skill of a commander that so considerable a body of troops as that allotted to the expedition could not approach Udolpho without his knowledge

3125-132586-0006	train-other-500	The object of the expedition he thought might be accomplished much more safely and speedily by mingling contrivance with force It was possible to meet Montoni and his party without their walls and to attack them then

3125-132586-0012	train-other-500	and whose concealment had been made known to the senate by Count Morano after the unsuccessful attempt of the latter to carry off Emily It was indeed partly for the purpose of capturing this man by whom one of the senate had been murdered
3125-132586-0013	train-other-500	that the expedition was undertaken and its success was so acceptable to them that Morano was instantly released notwithstanding the political suspicions which Montoni by his secret accusation had excited against him The celerity and ease
3125-132586-0014	train-other-500	with which this whole transaction was completed prevented it from attracting curiosity or even from obtaining a place in any of the published records of that time so that Emily
none	none	 who remained in Languedoc 
3125-132586-0015	train-other-500	was ignorant of the defeat and signal humiliation of her late persecutor Her mind was now occupied with sufferings which no effort of reason had yet been able to controul
none	none	 Count De Villefort 
3125-132586-0016	train-other-500	who sincerely attempted whatever benevolence could suggest for softening them sometimes allowed her the solitude she wished for sometimes led her into friendly parties and constantly protected her as much as possible
3125-132586-0017	train-other-500	from the shrewd enquiries and critical conversation of the Countess He often invited her to make excursions with him and his daughter during which he conversed entirely on questions suitable to her taste without appearing to consult it
3125-132586-0018	train-other-500	and thus endeavoured gradually to withdraw her from the subject of her grief and to awake other interests in her mind Emily to whom he appeared as the enlightened friend and protector of her youth soon felt for him the tender affection of a daughter
3125-132586-0019	train-other-500	and her heart expanded to her young friend Blanche as to a sister
none	none	 whose kindness and simplicity compensated for the want of more brilliant qualities 
3125-132586-0020	train-other-500	It was long before she could sufficiently abstract her mind from Valancourt to listen to the story promised by old Dorothee
none	none	 concerning which her curiosity had once been so deeply interested 
3125-132586-0021	train-other-500	but Dorothee at length reminded her of it
none	none	 and Emily desired that she would come that night to her chamber 
3125-132586-0022	train-other-500	Still her thoughts were employed by considerations which weakened her curiosity and Dorothee s tap at the door soon after twelve surprised her almost as much as if it had not been appointed I am come at last lady
none	none	 said she I wonder what it is makes my old limbs shake so to night I thought once or twice I should have dropped as I was a coming Emily seated her in a chair and desired that she would compose her spirits before she entered upon the subject that had brought her thither Alas said Dorothee it is thinking of that I believe which has disturbed me so In my way hither too I passed the chamber where my dear lady died and every thing was so still and gloomy about me 
3125-132586-0023	train-other-500	that I almost fancied I saw her as she appeared upon her death bed Emily now drew her chair near to Dorothee who went on It is about twenty years since my lady Marchioness came a bride to the chateau
3125-132586-0024	train-other-500	O I well remember how she looked when she came into the great hall where we servants were all assembled to welcome her and how happy my lord the Marquis seemed Ah who would have thought then But
none	none	 as I was saying ma amselle I thought the Marchioness with all her sweet looks did not look happy at heart and so I told my husband and he said it was all fancy so I said no more but I made my remarks for all that 
3125-132586-0025	train-other-500	My lady Marchioness was then about your age and as I have often thought very like you
none	none	 Well my lord the Marquis kept open house for a long time and gave such entertainments and there were such gay doings as have never been in the chateau since 
3125-132586-0026	train-other-500	I was younger ma amselle then than I am now and was as gay at the best of them
none	none	 I remember I danced with Philip the butler in a pink gown with yellow ribbons and a coif not such as they wear now but plaited high with ribbons all about it 
3125-132586-0027	train-other-500	It was very becoming truly my lord the Marquis noticed me
none	none	 Ah he was a good natured gentleman then who would have thought that he But the Marchioness Dorothee said Emily 
3125-132586-0028	train-other-500	you was telling me of her O yes my lady Marchioness I thought she did not seem happy at heart and once soon after the marriage I caught her crying in her chamber but when she saw me she dried her eyes and pretended to smile
3125-132586-0029	train-other-500	I did not dare then to ask what was the matter
none	none	 but the next time I saw her crying I did 
3125-132586-0030	train-other-500	and she seemed displeased so I said no more I found out some time after how it was Her father it seems had commanded her to marry my lord the Marquis for his money and there was another nobleman or else a chevalier that she liked better
3125-132586-0031	train-other-500	and that was very fond of her and she fretted for the loss of him I fancy but she never told me so My lady always tried to conceal her tears from the Marquis for I have often seen her after she has been so sorrowful look so calm and sweet when he came into the room
3125-132586-0032	train-other-500	But my lord all of a sudden grew gloomy and fretful and very unkind sometimes to my lady This afflicted her very much as I saw for she never complained and she used to try so sweetly to oblige him and to bring him into a good humour
3125-132586-0033	train-other-500	that my heart has often ached to see it But he used to be stubborn and give her harsh answers
none	none	 and then when she found it all in vain she would go to her own room and cry so I used to hear her in the anti room 
3125-132586-0034	train-other-500	poor dear lady but I seldom ventured to go to her I used sometimes to think my lord was jealous To be sure my lady was greatly admired but she was too good to deserve suspicion
none	none	 Among the many chevaliers that visited at the chateau 
3125-132586-0035	train-other-500	there was one that I always thought seemed just suited for my lady
none	none	 he was so courteous yet so spirited 
3125-132586-0036	train-other-500	and there was such a grace as it were in all he did or said
none	none	 I always observed that whenever he had been there the Marquis was more gloomy 
3125-132586-0037	train-other-500	and my lady more thoughtful and it came into my head that this was the chevalier she ought to have married but I never could learn for certain What was the chevalier s name Dorothee said Emily
3125-132586-0038	train-other-500	Why that I will not tell even to you ma amselle for evil may come of it I once heard from a person who is since dead that the Marchioness was not in law the wife of the Marquis for that she had before been privately married to the gentleman
3125-132586-0039	train-other-500	she was so much attached to and was afterwards afraid to own it to her father who was a very stern man but this seems very unlikely and I never gave much faith to it
3125-132586-0040	train-other-500	As I was saying the Marquis was most out of humour as I thought when the chevalier I spoke of had been at the chateau and at last his ill treatment of my lady made her quite miserable He would see hardly any visitors at the castle and made her live almost by herself
3125-132586-0041	train-other-500	I was her constant attendant and saw all she suffered but still she never complained After matters had gone on thus for near a year my lady was taken ill and I thought her long fretting had made her so but alas I fear it was worse than that
3125-132586-0042	train-other-500	Worse Dorothee said Emily can that be possible I fear it was so madam there were strange appearances But I will only tell what happened My lord the Marquis Hush Dorothee what sounds were those said Emily
3125-132586-0043	train-other-500	Dorothee changed countenance and while they both listened they heard on the stillness of the night music of uncommon sweetness
none	none	 I have surely heard that voice before said Emily at length I have often heard it and at this same hour said Dorothee solemnly and if spirits ever bring music that is surely the music of one Emily as the sounds drew nearer knew them to be the same she had formerly heard at the time of her father s death and whether it was the remembrance they now revived of that melancholy event 
3125-132586-0044	train-other-500	or that she was struck with superstitious awe
none	none	 it is certain she was so much affected that she had nearly fainted 
3125-132586-0045	train-other-500	I think I once told you madam said Dorothee that I first heard this music soon after my lady s death
none	none	 I well remember the night Hark it comes again said Emily let us open the window and listen They did so but soon the sounds floated gradually away into distance and all was again still they seemed to have sunk among the woods whose tufted tops were visible upon the clear horizon while every other feature of the scene was involved in the night shade which however allowed the eye an indistinct view of some objects in the garden below As Emily leaned on the window gazing with a kind of thrilling awe upon the obscurity beneath and then upon the cloudless arch above enlightened only by the stars Dorothee in a low voice resumed her narrative 
3125-132586-0046	train-other-500	I was saying ma amselle that I well remember when first I heard that music It was one night soon after my lady s death that I had sat up later than usual and I don t know how it was
3125-132586-0047	train-other-500	but I had been thinking a great deal about my poor mistress and of the sad scene I had lately witnessed The chateau was quite still and I was in the chamber at a good distance from the rest of the servants
3125-132586-0048	train-other-500	and this with the mournful things I had been thinking of I suppose made me low spirited for I felt very lonely and forlorn as it were and listened often
none	none	 wishing to hear a sound in the chateau for you know ma amselle when one can hear people moving 
3125-132586-0049	train-other-500	one does not so much mind about one s fears But all the servants were gone to bed and I sat thinking and thinking till I was almost afraid to look round the room and my poor lady s countenance often came to my mind
3125-132586-0050	train-other-500	such as I had seen her when she was dying and once or twice I almost thought I saw her before me when suddenly I heard such sweet music It seemed just at my window and I shall never forget what I felt
none	none	 I had not power to move from my chair but then when I thought it was my dear lady s voice the tears came to my eyes I had often heard her sing in her life time and to be sure she had a very fine voice 
3125-132586-0051	train-other-500	it had made me cry to hear her many a time when she has sat in her oriel of an evening playing upon her lute such sad songs and singing so O it went to one s heart
3125-132586-0052	train-other-500	I have listened in the anti chamber for the hour together and she would sometimes sit playing with the window open when it was summer time till it was quite dark and when I have gone in to shut it she has hardly seemed to know what hour it was
3125-132586-0053	train-other-500	But as I said madam continued Dorothee when first I heard the music that came just now I thought it was my late lady s and I have often thought so again when I have heard it as I have done at intervals ever since
3125-132586-0054	train-other-500	Sometimes many months have gone by but still it has returned It is extraordinary observed Emily that no person has yet discovered the musician
3125-132586-0055	train-other-500	Aye ma amselle if it had been any thing earthly it would have been discovered long ago but who could have courage to follow a spirit and if they had what good could it do for spirits YOU KNOW ma am can take any shape or no shape and they will be here one minute
none	none	 and the next perhaps in a quite different place 
3125-132586-0056	train-other-500	Pray resume your story of the Marchioness said Emily and acquaint me with the manner of her death I will ma am said Dorothee but shall we leave the window This cool air refreshes me replied Emily and I love to hear it creep along the woods
3125-132586-0057	train-other-500	and to look upon this dusky landscape You was speaking of my lord the Marquis when the music interrupted us Yes madam my lord the Marquis became more and more gloomy and my lady grew worse and worse till one night she was taken very ill indeed
none	none	 I was called up and when I came to her bedside I was shocked to see her countenance it was so changed 
3125-132586-0058	train-other-500	She looked piteously up at me and desired I would call the Marquis again for he was not yet come and tell him she had something particular to say to him At last he came and he did to be sure seem very sorry to see her
3125-132586-0059	train-other-500	but he said very little My lady told him she felt herself to be dying and wished to speak with him alone and then I left the room but I shall never forget his look as I went When I returned I ventured to remind my lord about sending for a doctor
3125-132586-0060	train-other-500	for I supposed he had forgot to do so in his grief but my lady said it was then too late but my lord so far from thinking so seemed to think light of her disorder
3125-132586-0061	train-other-500	till she was seized with such terrible pains O I never shall forget her shriek My lord then sent off a man and horse for the doctor and walked about the room and all over the chateau in the greatest distress
3125-132586-0062	train-other-500	and I staid by my dear lady and did what I could to ease her sufferings She had intervals of ease and in one of these she sent for my lord again when he came I was going
none	none	 but she desired I would not leave her O I shall never forget what a scene passed 
3125-132586-0063	train-other-500	I can hardly bear to think of it now
none	none	 My lord was almost distracted for my lady behaved with so much goodness and took such pains to comfort him that if he ever had suffered a suspicion to enter his head he must now have been convinced he was wrong 
3125-132586-0064	train-other-500	And to be sure he did seem to be overwhelmed with the thought of his treatment of her and this affected her so much that she fainted away We then got my lord out of the room
3125-132586-0065	train-other-500	he went into his library and threw himself on the floor and there he staid and would hear no reason that was talked to him When my lady recovered she enquired for him but afterwards said she could not bear to see his grief and desired we would let her die quietly
3125-132586-0066	train-other-500	She died in my arms ma amselle and she went off as peacefully as a child for all the violence of her disorder was passed
none	none	 Dorothee paused and wept and Emily wept with her 
3125-132586-0067	train-other-500	for she was much affected by the goodness of the late Marchioness and by the meek patience with which she had suffered When the doctor came resumed Dorothee alas he came too late
none	none	 he appeared greatly shocked to see her for soon after her death a frightful blackness spread all over her face 
3125-132586-0068	train-other-500	When he had sent the attendants out of the room he asked me several odd questions about the Marchioness particularly concerning the manner in which she had been seized and he often shook his head at my answers and seemed to mean more than he chose to say
3125-132586-0069	train-other-500	But I understood him too well However I kept my remarks to myself and only told them to my husband who bade me hold my tongue Some of the other servants however suspected what I did and strange reports were whispered about the neighbourhood
3125-132586-0070	train-other-500	but nobody dared to make any stir about them When my lord heard that my lady was dead he shut himself up and would see nobody but the doctor who used to be with him alone sometimes for an hour together
none	none	 and after that the doctor never talked with me again about my lady When she was buried in the church of the convent at a little distance yonder if the moon was up you might see the towers here ma amselle 
3125-132586-0071	train-other-500	all my lord s vassals followed the funeral and there was not a dry eye among them for she had done a deal of good among the poor My lord the Marquis I never saw any body so melancholy as he was afterwards
3125-132586-0072	train-other-500	and sometimes he would be in such fits of violence that we almost thought he had lost his senses He did not stay long at the chateau but joined his regiment and soon after all the servants except my husband and I
3125-132586-0073	train-other-500	received notice to go for my lord went to the wars I never saw him after for he would not return to the chateau though it is such a fine place and never finished those fine rooms he was building on the west side of it
3125-132586-0074	train-other-500	and it has in a manner been shut up ever since till my lord the Count came here The death of the Marchioness appears extraordinary said Emily who was anxious to know more than she dared to ask Yes madam replied Dorothee it was extraordinary
3125-132586-0075	train-other-500	I have told you all I saw and you may easily guess what I think I cannot say more because I would not spread reports that might offend my lord the Count You are very right said Emily
none	none	 where did the Marquis die In the north of France I believe ma amselle replied Dorothee I was very glad when I heard my lord the Count was coming for this had been a sad desolate place these many years and we heard such strange noises sometimes after my lady s death that as I told you before my husband and I left it for a neighbouring cottage 
3125-132586-0076	train-other-500	And now lady I have told you all this sad history and all my thoughts and you have promised you know never to give the least hint about
none	none	 it I have said Emily and I will be faithful to my promise Dorothee 
3125-132586-0077	train-other-500	what you have told has interested me more than you can imagine
none	none	 I only wish I could prevail upon you to tell the name of the chevalier whom you thought so deserving of the Marchioness 
3125-132586-0078	train-other-500	Dorothee however steadily refused to do this and then returned to the notice of Emily s likeness to the late Marchioness There is another picture of her added she hanging in a room of the suite which was shut up
none	none	 It was drawn as I have heard before she was married and is much more like you than the miniature When Emily expressed a strong desire to see this Dorothee replied that she did not like to open those rooms 
3125-132586-0079	train-other-500	but Emily reminded her that the Count had talked the other day of ordering them to be opened of which Dorothee seemed to consider much and then she owned
none	none	 that she should feel less if she went into them with Emily first 
3125-132586-0080	train-other-500	than otherwise and at length promised to shew the picture The night was too far advanced and Emily was too much affected by the narrative of the scenes which had passed in those apartments to wish to visit them at this hour
3125-132586-0081	train-other-500	but she requested that Dorothee would return on the following night when they were not likely to be observed and conduct her thither Besides her wish to examine the portrait she felt a thrilling curiosity to see the chamber in which the Marchioness had died
3125-132586-0082	train-other-500	and which Dorothee had said remained with the bed and furniture just as when the corpse was removed for interment The solemn emotions which the expectation of viewing such a scene had awakened were in unison with the present tone of her mind
3125-132586-0083	train-other-500	depressed by severe disappointment Cheerful objects rather added to than removed this depression but perhaps she yielded too much to her melancholy inclination and imprudently lamented the misfortune
3125-132586-0084	train-other-500	which no virtue of her own could have taught her to avoid though no effort of reason could make her look unmoved upon the self degradation of him whom she had once esteemed and loved Dorothee promised to return on the following night
none	none	 with the keys of the chambers and then wished Emily good repose and departed Emily however continued at the window musing upon the melancholy fate of the Marchioness and listening in awful expectation for a return of the music 
3125-132586-0085	train-other-500	But the stillness of the night remained long unbroken except by the murmuring sounds of the woods as they waved in the breeze and then by the distant bell of the convent striking one She now withdrew from the window and as she sat at her bed side
3125-132586-0086	train-other-500	indulging melancholy reveries which the loneliness of the hour assisted the stillness was suddenly interrupted not by music but by very uncommon sounds that seemed to come either from the room adjoining her own or from one below
3125-132586-0087	train-other-500	The terrible catastrophe that had been related to her together with the mysterious circumstances said to have since occurred in the chateau had so much shocked her spirits that she now sunk for a moment under the weakness of superstition
none	none	 The sounds however did not return and she retired to forget in sleep the disastrous story she had heard CHAPTER IV Now it is the time of night That the graves all gaping wide Every one lets forth his spite In the church way path to glide SHAKESPEARE On the next night about the same hour as before Dorothee came to Emily s chamber with the keys of that suite of rooms which had been particularly appropriated to the late Marchioness These extended along the north side of the chateau forming part of the old building and as Emily s room was in the south they had to pass over a great extent of the castle and by the chambers of several of the family whose observations Dorothee was anxious to avoid since it might excite enquiry and raise reports such as would displease the Count She therefore requested that Emily would wait half an hour before they ventured forth that they might be certain all the servants were gone to bed It was nearly one before the chateau was perfectly still or Dorothee thought it prudent to leave the chamber In this interval her spirits seemed to be greatly affected by the remembrance of past events and by the prospect of entering again upon places where these had occurred and in which she had not been for so many years Emily too was affected but her feelings had more of solemnity and less of fear From the silence into which reflection and expectation had thrown them they at length roused themselves and left the chamber Dorothee at first carried the lamp but her hand trembled so much with infirmity and alarm that Emily took it from her and offered her arm to support her feeble steps They had to descend the great stair case and after passing over a wide extent of the chateau to ascend another which led to the suite of rooms they were in quest of They stepped cautiously along the open corridor that ran round the great hall and into which the chambers of the Count Countess and the Lady Blanche opened and from thence descending the chief stair case they crossed the hall itself Proceeding through the servants hall where the dying embers of a wood fire still glimmered on the hearth and the supper table was surrounded by chairs that obstructed their passage they came to the foot of the back stair case Old Dorothee here paused and looked around Let us listen said she if any thing is stirring Ma amselle do you hear any voice None said Emily there certainly is no person up in the chateau besides ourselves No ma amselle said Dorothee but I have never been here at this hour before and after what I know my fears are not wonderful What do you know said Emily O ma amselle we have no time for talking now let us go on That door on the left is the one we must open They proceeded and having reached the top of the stair case Dorothee applied the key to the lock Ah said she as she endeavoured to turn it so many years have passed since this was opened that I fear it will not move Emily was more successful and they presently entered a spacious and ancient chamber Alas exclaimed Dorothee as she entered the last time I passed through this door I followed my poor lady s corpse Emily struck with the circumstance and affected by the dusky and solemn air of the apartment remained silent and they passed on through a long suite of rooms till they came to one more spacious than the rest and rich in the remains of faded magnificence Let us rest here awhile madam said Dorothee faintly we are going into the chamber where my lady died that door opens into it Ah ma amselle why did you persuade me to come Emily drew one of the massy arm chairs with which the apartment was furnished and begged Dorothee would sit down and try to compose her spirits How the sight of this place brings all that passed formerly to my mind said Dorothee it seems as if it was but yesterday since all that sad affair happened Hark what noise is that said Emily Dorothee half starting from her chair looked round the apartment and they listened but every thing remaining still the old woman spoke again upon the subject of her sorrow This saloon ma amselle was in my lady s time the finest apartment in the chateau and it was fitted up according to her own taste All this grand furniture but you can now hardly see what it is for the dust and our light is none of the best ah how I have seen this room lighted up in my lady s time all this grand furniture came from Paris and was made after the fashion of some in the Louvre there except those large glasses and they came from some outlandish place and that rich tapestry How the colours are faded already since I saw it last I understood that was twenty years ago observed Emily Thereabout madam said Dorothee and well remembered but all the time between then and now seems as nothing That tapestry used to be greatly admired at it tells the stories out of some famous book or other but I have forgot the name Emily now rose to examine the figures it exhibited and discovered by verses in the Provencal tongue wrought underneath each scene that it exhibited stories from some of the most celebrated ancient romances Dorothee s spirits being now more composed she rose and unlocked the door that led into the late Marchioness s apartment and Emily passed into a lofty chamber hung round with dark arras and so spacious that the lamp she held up did not shew its extent while Dorothee when she entered had dropped into a chair where sighing deeply she scarcely trusted herself with the view of a scene so affecting to her It was some time before Emily perceived through the dusk the bed on which the Marchioness was said to have died when advancing to the upper end of the room she discovered the high canopied tester of dark green damask with the curtains descending to the floor in the fashion of a tent half drawn and remaining apparently as they had been left twenty years before and over the whole bedding was thrown a counterpane or pall of black velvet that hung down to the floor Emily shuddered as she held the lamp over it and looked within the dark curtains where she almost expected to have seen a human face and suddenly remembering the horror she had suffered upon discovering the dying Madame Montoni in the turret chamber of Udolpho her spirits fainted and she was turning from the bed when Dorothee who had now reached it exclaimed Holy Virgin methinks I see my lady stretched upon that pall as when last I saw her Emily shocked by this exclamation looked involuntarily again within the curtains but the blackness of the pall only appeared while Dorothee was compelled to support herself upon the side of the bed and presently tears brought her some relief Ah said she after she had wept awhile it was here I sat on that terrible night and held my lady s hand and heard her last words and saw all her sufferings HERE she died in my arms Do not indulge these painful recollections said Emily let us go Shew me the picture you mentioned if it will not too much affect you It hangs in the oriel said Dorothee rising and going towards a small door near the bed s head which she opened and Emily followed with the light into the closet of the late Marchioness Alas there she is ma amselle said Dorothee pointing to a portrait of a lady there is her very self just as she looked when she came first to the chateau You see madam she was all blooming like you then and so soon to be cut off While Dorothee spoke Emily was attentively examining the picture which bore a strong resemblance to the miniature though the expression of the countenance in each was somewhat different but still she thought she perceived something of that pensive melancholy in the portrait which so strongly characterised the miniature Pray ma amselle stand beside the picture that I may look at you together said Dorothee who when the request was complied with exclaimed again at the resemblance Emily also as she gazed upon it thought that she had somewhere seen a person very like it though she could not now recollect who this was In this closet were many memorials of the departed Marchioness a robe and several articles of her dress were scattered upon the chairs as if they had just been thrown off On the floor were a pair of black satin slippers and on the dressing table a pair of gloves and a long black veil which as Emily took it up to examine she perceived was dropping to pieces with age Ah said Dorothee observing the veil my lady s hand laid it there it has never been moved since Emily shuddering immediately laid it down again I well remember seeing her take it off continued Dorothee it was on the night before her death when she had returned from a little walk I had persuaded her to take in the gardens and she seemed refreshed by it I told her how much better she looked and I remember what a languid smile she gave me but alas she little thought or I either that she was to die that night Dorothee wept again and then taking up the veil threw it suddenly over Emily who shuddered to find it wrapped round her descending even to her feet and as she endeavoured to throw it off Dorothee intreated that she would keep it on for one moment I thought added she how like you would look to my dear mistress in that veil may your life ma amselle be a happier one than hers Emily having disengaged herself from the veil laid it again on the dressing table and surveyed the closet where every object on which her eye fixed seemed to speak of the Marchioness In a large oriel window of painted glass stood a table with a silver crucifix and a prayer book open and Emily remembered with emotion what Dorothee had mentioned concerning her custom of playing on her lute in this window before she observed the lute itself lying on a corner of the table as if it had been carelessly placed there by the hand that had so often awakened it This is a sad forlorn place said Dorothee for when my dear lady died I had no heart to put it to rights or the chamber either and my lord never came into the rooms after so they remain just as they did when my lady was removed for interment While Dorothee spoke Emily was still looking on the lute which was a Spanish one and remarkably large and then with a hesitating hand she took it up and passed her fingers over the chords They were out of tune but uttered a deep and full sound Dorothee started at their well known tones and seeing the lute in Emily s hand said This is the lute my lady Marchioness loved so I remember when last she played upon it it was on the night that she died I came as usual to undress her and as I entered the bed chamber I heard the sound of music from the oriel and perceiving it was my lady s who was sitting there I stepped softly to the door which stood a little open to listen for the music though it was mournful was so sweet There I saw her with the lute in her hand looking upwards and the tears fell upon her cheeks while she sung a vesper hymn so soft and so solemn and her voice trembled as it were and then she would stop for a moment and wipe away her tears and go on again lower than before O I had often listened to my lady but never heard any thing so sweet as this it made me cry almost to hear it She had been at prayers I fancy for there was the book open on the table beside her aye and there it lies open still Pray let us leave the oriel ma amselle added Dorothee this is a heart breaking place Having returned into the chamber she desired to look once more upon the bed when as they came opposite to the open door leading into the saloon Emily in the partial gleam which the lamp threw into it thought she saw something glide along into the obscurer part of the room Her spirits had been much affected by the surrounding scene or it is probable this circumstance whether real or imaginary would not have affected her in the degree it did but she endeavoured to conceal her emotion from Dorothee who however observing her countenance change enquired if she was ill Let us go said Emily faintly the air of these rooms is unwholesome but when she attempted to do so considering that she must pass through the apartment where the phantom of her terror had appeared this terror increased and too faint to support herself she sad down on the side of the bed Dorothee believing that she was only affected by a consideration of the melancholy catastrophe which had happened on this spot endeavoured to cheer her and then as they sat together on the bed she began to relate other particulars concerning it and this without reflecting that it might increase Emily s emotion but because they were particularly interesting to herself A little before my lady s death said she when the pains were gone off she called me to her and stretching out her hand to me I sat down just there where the curtain falls upon the bed How well I remember her look at the time death was in it I can almost fancy I see her now There she lay ma amselle her face was upon the pillow there This black counterpane was not upon the bed then it was laid on after her death and she was laid out upon it Emily turned to look within the dusky curtains as if she could have seen the countenance of which Dorothee spoke The edge of the white pillow only appeared above the blackness of the pall but as her eyes wandered over the pall itself she fancied she saw it move Without speaking she caught Dorothee s arm who surprised by the action and by the look of terror that accompanied it turned her eyes from Emily to the bed where in the next moment she too saw the pall slowly lifted and fall again Emily attempted to go but Dorothee stood fixed and gazing upon the bed and at length said It is only the wind that waves it ma amselle we have left all the doors open see how the air waves the lamp too It is only the wind She had scarcely uttered these words when the pall was more violently agitated than before but Emily somewhat ashamed of her terrors stepped back to the bed willing to be convinced that the wind only had occasioned her alarm when as she gazed within the curtains the pall moved again and in the next moment the apparition of a human countenance rose above it Screaming with terror they both fled and got out of the chamber as fast as their trembling limbs would bear them leaving open the doors of all the rooms through which they passed When they reached the stair case Dorothee threw open a chamber door where some of the female servants slept and sunk breathless on the bed while Emily deprived of all presence of mind made only a feeble attempt to conceal the occasion of her terror from the astonished servants and though Dorothee when she could speak endeavoured to laugh at her own fright and was joined by Emily no remonstrances could prevail with the servants who had quickly taken the alarm to pass even the remainder of the night in a room so near to these terrific chambers Dorothee having accompanied Emily to her own apartment they then began to talk over with some degree of coolness the strange circumstance that had just occurred and Emily would almost have doubted her own perceptions had not those of Dorothee attested their truth Having now mentioned what she had observed in the outer chamber she asked the housekeeper whether she was certain no door had been left unfastened by which a person might secretly have entered the apartments Dorothee replied that she had constantly kept the keys of the several doors in her own possession that when she had gone her rounds through the castle as she frequently did to examine if all was safe she had tried these doors among the rest and had always found them fastened It was therefore impossible she added that any person could have got admittance into the apartments and if they could it was very improbable they should have chose to sleep in a place so cold and forlorn Emily observed that their visit to these chambers had perhaps been watched and that some person for a frolic had followed them into the rooms with a design to frighten them and while they were in the oriel had taken the opportunity of concealing himself in the bed Dorothee allowed that this was possible till she recollected that on entering the apartments she had turned the key of the outer door and this which had been done to prevent their visit being noticed by any of the family who might happen to be up must effectually have excluded every person except themselves from the chambers and she now persisted in affirming that the ghastly countenance she had seen was nothing human but some dreadful apparition Emily was very solemnly affected Of whatever nature might be the appearance she had witnessed whether human or supernatural the fate of the deceased Marchioness was a truth not to be doubted and this unaccountable circumstance occurring in the very scene of her sufferings affected Emily s imagination with a superstitious awe to which after having detected the fallacies at Udolpho she might not have yielded had she been ignorant of the unhappy story related by the housekeeper Her she now solemnly conjured to conceal the occurrence of this night and to make light of the terror she had already betrayed that the Count might not be distressed by reports which would certainly spread alarm and confusion among his family Time she added may explain this mysterious affair meanwhile let us watch the event in silence Dorothee readily acquiesced but she now recollected that she had left all the doors of the north suite of rooms open and not having courage to return alone to lock even the outer one Emily after some effort so far conquered her own fears that she offered to accompany her to the foot of the back stair case and to wait there while Dorothee ascended whose resolution being re assured by this circumstance she consented to go and they left Emily s apartment together No sound disturbed the stillness as they passed along the halls and galleries but on reaching the foot of the back stair case Dorothee s resolution failed again having however paused a moment to listen and no sound being heard above she ascended leaving Emily below and scarcely suffering her eye to glance within the first chamber she fastened the door which shut up the whole suite of apartments and returned to Emily As they stepped along the passage leading into the great hall a sound of lamentation was heard which seemed to come from the hall itself and they stopped in new alarm to listen when Emily presently distinguished the voice of Annette whom she found crossing the hall with another female servant and so terrified by the report which the other maids had spread that believing she could be safe only where her lady was she was going for refuge to her apartment Emily s endeavours to laugh or to argue her out of these terrors were equally vain and in compassion to her distress she consented that she should remain in her room during the night CHAPTER V Hail mildly pleasing Solitude Companion of the wise and good This is the balmy breath of morn Just as the dew bent rose is born But chief when evening scenes decay And the faint landscape swims away Thine is the doubtful soft decline And that best hour of musing thine THOMSON Emily s injunctions to Annette to be silent on the subject of her terror were ineffectual and the occurrence of the preceding night spread such alarm among the servants who now all affirmed that they had frequently heard unaccountable noises in the chateau that a report soon reached the Count of the north side of the castle being haunted He treated this at first with ridicule but perceiving that it was productive of serious evil in the confusion it occasioned among his household he forbade any person to repeat it on pain of punishment The arrival of a party of his friends soon withdrew his thoughts entirely from this subject and his servants had now little leisure to brood over it except indeed in the evenings after supper when they all assembled in their hall and related stories of ghosts till they feared to look round the room started if the echo of a closing door murmured along the passage and refused to go singly to any part of the castle On these occasions Annette made a distinguished figure When she told not only of all the wonders she had witnessed but of all that she had imagined in the castle of Udolpho with the story of the strange disappearance of Signora Laurentini she made no trifling impression on the mind of her attentive auditors Her suspicions concerning Montoni she would also have freely disclosed had not Ludovico who was now in the service of the Count prudently checked her loquacity whenever it pointed to that subject Among the visitors at the chateau was the Baron de Saint Foix an old friend of the Count and his son the Chevalier saint Foix a sensible and amiable young man who having in the preceding year seen the Lady Blanche at Paris had become her declared admirer The friendship which the Count had long entertained for his father and the equality of their circumstances made him secretly approve of the connection but thinking his daughter at this time too young to fix her choice for life and wishing to prove the sincerity and strength of the Chevalier s attachment he then rejected his suit though without forbidding his future hope This young man now came with the Baron his father to claim the reward of a steady affection a claim which the Count admitted and which Blanche did not reject While these visitors were at the chateau it became a scene of gaiety and splendour The pavilion in the woods was fitted up and frequented in the fine evenings as a supper room when the hour usually concluded with a concert at which the Count and Countess who were scientific performers and the Chevaliers Henri and saint Foix with the Lady Blanche and Emily whose voices and fine taste compensated for the want of more skilful execution usually assisted Several of the Count s servants performed on horns and other instruments some of which placed at a little distance among the woods spoke in sweet response to the harmony that proceeded from the pavilion At any other period these parties would have been delightful to Emily but her spirits were now oppressed with a melancholy which she perceived that no kind of what is called amusement had power to dissipate and which the tender and frequently pathetic melody of these concerts sometimes increased to a very painful degree She was particularly fond of walking in the woods that hung on a promontory overlooking the sea Their luxuriant shade was soothing to her pensive mind and in the partial views which they afforded of the Mediterranean with its winding shores and passing sails tranquil beauty was united with grandeur The paths were rude and frequently overgrown with vegetation but their tasteful owner would suffer little to be done to them and scarcely a single branch to be lopped from the venerable trees On an eminence in one of the most sequestered parts of these woods was a rustic seat formed of the trunk of a decayed oak which had once been a noble tree and of which many lofty branches still flourishing united with beech and pines to over canopy the spot Beneath their deep umbrage the eye passed over the tops of other woods to the Mediterranean and to the left through an opening was seen a ruined watch tower standing on a point of rock near the sea and rising from among the tufted foliage Hither Emily often came alone in the silence of evening and soothed by the scenery and by the faint murmur that rose from the waves would sit till darkness obliged her to return to the chateau Frequently also she visited the watch tower which commanded the entire prospect and when she leaned against its broken walls and thought of Valancourt she not once imagined what was so true that this tower had been almost as frequently his resort as her own since his estrangement from the neighbouring chateau One evening she lingered here to a late hour She had sat on the steps of the building watching in tranquil melancholy the gradual effect of evening over the extensive prospect till the gray waters of the Mediterranean and the massy woods were almost the only features of the scene that remained visible when as she gazed alternately on these and on the mild blue of the heavens where the first pale star of evening appeared she personified the hour in the following lines SONG OF THE EVENING HOUR Last of the Hours that track the fading Day I move along the realms of twilight air And hear remote the choral song decay Of sister nymphs who dance around his car Then as I follow through the azure void His partial splendour from my straining eye Sinks in the depth of space my only guide His faint ray dawning on the farthest sky Save that sweet lingering strain of gayer Hours Whose close my voice prolongs in dying notes While mortals on the green earth own its pow rs As downward on the evening gale it floats When fades along the West the Sun s last beam As weary to the nether world he goes And mountain summits catch the purple gleam And slumbering ocean faint and fainter glows Silent upon the globe s broad shade I steal And o er its dry turf shed the cooling dews And ev ry fever d herb and flow ret heal And all their fragrance on the air diffuse Where er I move a tranquil pleasure reigns O er all the scene the dusky tints I send That forests wild and mountains stretching plains And peopled towns in soft confusion blend Wide o er the world I waft the fresh ning wind Low breathing through the woods and twilight vale In whispers soft that woo the pensive mind Of him who loves my lonely steps to hail His tender oaten reed I watch to hear Stealing its sweetness o er some plaining rill Or soothing ocean s wave when storms are near Or swelling in the breeze from distant hill I wake the fairy elves who shun the light When from their blossom d beds they slily peep And spy my pale star leading on the night Forth to their games and revelry they leap Send all the prison d sweets abroad in air That with them slumber d in the flow ret s cell Then to the shores and moon light brooks repair Till the high larks their matin carol swell The wood nymphs hail my airs and temper d shade With ditties soft and lightly sportive dance On river margin of some bow ry glade And strew their fresh buds as my steps advance But swift I pass and distant regions trace For moon beams silver all the eastern cloud And Day s last crimson vestige fades apace Down the steep west I fly from Midnight s shroud The moon was now rising out of the sea She watched its gradual progress the extending line of radiance it threw upon the waters the sparkling oars the sail faintly silvered and the wood tops and the battlements of the watch tower at whose foot she was sitting just tinted with the rays Emily s spirits were in harmony with this scene As she sat meditating sounds stole by her on the air which she immediately knew to be the music and the voice she had formerly heard at midnight and the emotion of awe which she felt was not unmixed with terror when she considered her remote and lonely situation The sounds drew nearer She would have risen to leave the place but they seemed to come from the way she must have taken towards the chateau and she awaited the event in trembling expectation The sounds continued to approach for some time and then ceased Emily sat listening gazing and unable to move when she saw a figure emerge from the shade of the woods and pass along the bank at some little distance before her It went swiftly and her spirits were so overcome with awe that though she saw she did not much observe it Having left the spot with a resolution never again to visit it alone at so late an hour she began to approach the chateau when she heard voices calling her from the part of the wood which was nearest to it They were the shouts of the Count s servants who were sent to search for her and when she entered the supper room where he sat with Henri and Blanche he gently reproached her with a look which she blushed to have deserved This little occurrence deeply impressed her mind and when she withdrew to her own room it recalled so forcibly the circumstances she had witnessed a few nights before that she had scarcely courage to remain alone She watched to a late hour when no sound having renewed her fears she at length sunk to repose But this was of short continuance for she was disturbed by a loud and unusual noise that seemed to come from the gallery into which her chamber opened Groans were distinctly heard and immediately after a dead weight fell against the door with a violence that threatened to burst it open She called loudly to know who was there but received no answer though at intervals she still thought she heard something like a low moaning Fear deprived her of the power to move Soon after she heard footsteps in a remote part of the gallery and as they approached she called more loudly than before till the steps paused at her door She then distinguished the voices of several of the servants who seemed too much engaged by some circumstance without to attend to her calls but Annette soon after entering the room for water Emily understood that one of the maids had fainted whom she immediately desired them to bring into her room where she assisted to restore her When this girl had recovered her speech she affirmed that as she was passing up the back stair case in the way to her chamber she had seen an apparition on the second landing place she held the lamp low she said that she might pick her way several of the stairs being infirm and even decayed and it was upon raising her eyes that she saw this appearance It stood for a moment in the corner of the landing place which she was approaching and then gliding up the stairs vanished at the door of the apartment that had been lately opened She heard afterwards a hollow sound Then the devil has got a key to that apartment said Dorothee for it could be nobody but he I locked the door myself The girl springing down the stairs and passing up the great stair case had run with a faint scream till she reached the gallery where she fell groaning at Emily s door Gently chiding her for the alarm she had occasioned Emily tried to make her ashamed of her fears but the girl persisted in saying that she had seen an apparition till she went to her own room whither she was accompanied by all the servants present except Dorothee who at Emily s request remained with her during the night Emily was perplexed and Dorothee was terrified and mentioned many occurrences of former times which had long since confirmed her superstitions among these according to her belief she had once witnessed an appearance like that just described and on the very same spot and it was the remembrance of it that had made her pause when she was going to ascend the stairs with Emily and which had increased her reluctance to open the north apartments Whatever might be Emily s opinions she did not disclose them but listened attentively to all that Dorothee communicated which occasioned her much thought and perplexity From this night the terror of the servants increased to such an excess that several of them determined to leave the chateau and requested their discharge of the Count who if he had any faith in the subject of their alarm thought proper to dissemble it and anxious to avoid the inconvenience that threatened him employed ridicule and then argument to convince them they had nothing to apprehend from supernatural agency But fear had rendered their minds inaccessible to reason and it was now that Ludovico proved at once his courage and his gratitude for the kindness he had received from the Count by offering to watch during a night in the suite of rooms reputed to be haunted He feared he said no spirits and if any thing of human form appeared he would prove that he dreaded that as little The Count paused upon the offer while the servants who heard it looked upon one another in doubt and amazement and Annette terrified for the safety of Ludovico employed tears and entreaties to dissuade him from his purpose You are a bold fellow said the Count smiling Think well of what you are going to encounter before you finally determine upon it However if you persevere in your resolution I will accept your offer and your intrepidity shall not go unrewarded I desire no reward your excellenza replied Ludovico but your approbation Your excellenza has been sufficiently good to me already but I wish to have arms that I may be equal to my enemy if he should appear Your sword cannot defend you against a ghost replied the Count throwing a glance of irony upon the other servants neither can bars or bolts for a spirit you know can glide through a keyhole as easily as through a door Give me a sword my lord Count said Ludovico and I will lay all the spirits that shall attack me in the red sea Well said the Count you shall have a sword and good cheer too and your brave comrades here will perhaps have courage enough to remain another night in the chateau since your boldness will certainly for this night at least confine all the malice of the spectre to yourself Curiosity now struggled with fear in the minds of several of his fellow servants and at length they resolved to await the event of Ludovico s rashness Emily was surprised and concerned when she heard of his intention and was frequently inclined to mention what she had witnessed in the north apartments to the Count for she could not entirely divest herself of fears for Ludovico s safety though her reason represented these to be absurd The necessity however of concealing the secret with which Dorothee had entrusted her and which must have been mentioned with the late occurrence in excuse for her having so privately visited the north apartments kept her entirely silent on the subject of her apprehension and she tried only to sooth Annette who held that Ludovico was certainly to be destroyed and who was much less affected by Emily s consolatory efforts than by the manner of old Dorothee who often as she exclaimed Ludovico sighed and threw up her eyes to heaven CHAPTER VI Ye gods of quiet and of sleep profound Whose soft dominion o er this castle sways And all the widely silent places round Forgive me if my trembling pen displays What never yet was sung in mortal lays THOMSON The Count gave orders for the north apartments to be opened and prepared for the reception of Ludovico but Dorothee remembering what she had lately witnessed there feared to obey and not one of the other servants daring to venture thither the rooms remained shut up till the time when Ludovico was to retire thither for the night an hour for which the whole household waited with impatience After supper Ludovico by the order of the Count attended him in his closet where they remained alone for near half an hour and on leaving which his Lord delivered to him a sword It has seen service in mortal quarrels said the Count jocosely you will use it honourably no doubt in a spiritual one Tomorrow let me hear that there is not one ghost remaining in the chateau Ludovico received it with a respectful bow You shall be obeyed my Lord said he I will engage that no spectre shall disturb the peace of the chateau after this night They now returned to the supper room where the Count s guests awaited to accompany him and Ludovico to the door of the north apartments and Dorothee being summoned for the keys delivered them to Ludovico who then led the way followed by most of the inhabitants of the chateau Having reached the back stair case several of the servants shrunk back and refused to go further but the rest followed him to the top of the stair case where a broad landing place allowed them to flock round him while he applied the key to the door during which they watched him with as much eager curiosity as if he had been performing some magical rite Ludovico unaccustomed to the lock could not turn it and Dorothee who had lingered far behind was called forward under whose hand the door opened slowly and her eye glancing within the dusky chamber she uttered a sudden shriek and retreated At this signal of alarm the greater part of the crowd hurried down the stairs and the Count Henri and Ludovico were left alone to pursue the enquiry who instantly rushed into the apartment Ludovico with a drawn sword which he had just time to draw from the scabbard the Count with the lamp in his hand and Henri carrying a basket containing provisions for the courageous adventurer Having looked hastily round the first room where nothing appeared to justify alarm they passed on to the second and here too all being quiet they proceeded to a third with a more tempered step The Count had now leisure to smile at the discomposure into which he had been surprised and to ask Ludovico in which room he designed to pass the night There are several chambers beyond these your excellenza said Ludovico pointing to a door and in one of them is a bed they say I will pass the night there and when I am weary of watching I can lie down Good said the Count let us go on You see these rooms shew nothing but damp walls and decaying furniture I have been so much engaged since I came to the chateau that I have not looked into them till now Remember Ludovico to tell the housekeeper to morrow to throw open these windows The damask hangings are dropping to pieces I will have them taken down and this antique furniture removed Dear sir said Henri here is an arm chair so massy with gilding that it resembles one of the state chairs at the Louvre more then any thing else Yes said the Count stopping a moment to survey it there is a history belonging to that chair but I have not time to tell it Let us pass on This suite runs to a greater extent than I had imagined it is many years since I was in them But where is the bed room you speak of Ludovico these are only anti chambers to the great drawing room I remember them in their splendour The bed my Lord replied Ludovico they told me was in a room that opens beyond the saloon and terminates the suite O here is the saloon said the Count as they entered the spacious apartment in which Emily and Dorothee had rested He here stood for a moment surveying the reliques of faded grandeur which it exhibited the sumptuous tapestry the long and low sophas of velvet with frames heavily carved and gilded the floor inlaid with small squares of fine marble and covered in the centre with a piece of very rich tapestry work the casements of painted glass and the large Venetian mirrors of a size and quality such as at that period France could not make which reflected on every side the spacious apartment These had formerly also reflected a gay and brilliant scene for this had been the state room of the chateau and here the Marchioness had held the assemblies that made part of the festivities of her nuptials If the wand of a magician could have recalled the vanished groups many of them vanished even from the earth that once had passed over these polished mirrors what a varied and contrasted picture would they have exhibited with the present Now instead of a blaze of lights and a splendid and busy crowd they reflected only the rays of the one glimmering lamp which the Count held up and which scarcely served to shew the three forlorn figures that stood surveying the room and the spacious and dusky walls around them Ah said the Count to Henri awaking from his deep reverie how the scene is changed since last I saw it I was a young man then and the Marchioness was alive and in her bloom many other persons were here too who are now no more There stood the orchestra here we tripped in many a sprightly maze the walls echoing to the dance Now they resound only one feeble voice and even that will ere long be heard no more My son remember that I was once as young as yourself and that you must pass away like those who have preceded you like those who as they sung and danced in this once gay apartment forgot that years are made up of moments and that every step they took carried them nearer to their graves But such reflections are useless I had almost said criminal unless they teach us to prepare for eternity since otherwise they cloud our present happiness without guiding us to a future one But enough of this let us go on Ludovico now opened the door of the bed room and the Count as he entered was struck with the funereal appearance which the dark arras gave to it He approached the bed with an emotion of solemnity and perceiving it to be covered with the pall of black velvet paused What can this mean said he as he gazed upon it I have heard my Lord said Ludovico as he stood at the feet looking within the canopied curtains that the Lady Marchioness de Villeroi died in this chamber and remained here till she was removed to be buried and this perhaps Signor may account for the pall The Count made no reply but stood for a few moments engaged in thought and evidently much affected Then turning to Ludovico he asked him with a serious air whether he thought his courage would support him through the night If you doubt this added the Count do not be ashamed to own it I will release you from your engagement without exposing you to the triumphs of your fellow servants Ludovico paused pride and something very like fear seemed struggling in his breast pride however was victorious he blushed and his hesitation ceased No my Lord said he I will go through with what I have begun and I am grateful for your consideration On that hearth I will make a fire and with the good cheer in this basket I doubt not I shall do well Be it so said the Count but how will you beguile the tediousness of the night if you do not sleep When I am weary my Lord replied Ludovico I shall not fear to sleep in the meanwhile I have a book that will entertain me Well said the Count I hope nothing will disturb you but if you should be seriously alarmed in the night come to my apartment I have too much confidence in your good sense and courage to believe you will be alarmed on slight grounds or suffer the gloom of this chamber or its remote situation to overcome you with ideal terrors To morrow I shall have to thank you for an important service these rooms shall then be thrown open and my people will be convinced of their error Good night Ludovico let me see you early in the morning and remember what I lately said to you I will my Lord good night to your excellenza let me attend you with the light He lighted the Count and Henri through the chambers to the outer door on the landing place stood a lamp which one of the affrighted servants had left and Henri as he took it up again bade Ludovico good night who having respectfully returned the wish closed the door upon them and fastened it Then as he retired to the bed chamber he examined the rooms through which he passed with more minuteness than he had done before for he apprehended that some person might have concealed himself in them for the purpose of frightening him No one however but himself was in these chambers and leaving open the doors through which he passed he came again to the great drawing room whose spaciousness and silent gloom somewhat awed him For a moment he stood looking back through the long suite of rooms he had quitted and as he turned perceiving a light and his own figure reflected in one of the large mirrors he started Other objects too were seen obscurely on its dark surface but he paused not to examine them and returned hastily into the bed room as he surveyed which he observed the door of the oriel and opened it All within was still On looking round his eye was arrested by the portrait of the deceased Marchioness upon which he gazed for a considerable time with great attention and some surprise and then having examined the closet he returned into the bed room where he kindled a wood fire the bright blaze of which revived his spirits which had begun to yield to the gloom and silence of the place for gusts of wind alone broke at intervals this silence He now drew a small table and a chair near the fire took a bottle of wine and some cold provision out of his basket and regaled himself When he had finished his repast he laid his sword upon the table and not feeling disposed to sleep drew from his pocket the book he had spoken of It was a volume of old Provencal tales Having stirred the fire upon the hearth he began to read and his attention was soon wholly occupied by the scenes which the page disclosed The Count meanwhile had returned to the supper room whither those of the party who had attended him to the north apartment had retreated upon hearing Dorothee s scream and who were now earnest in their enquiries concerning those chambers The Count rallied his guests on their precipitate retreat and on the superstitious inclination which had occasioned it and this led to the question Whether the spirit after it has quitted the body is ever permitted to revisit the earth and if it is whether it was possible for spirits to become visible to the sense The Baron was of opinion that the first was probable and the last was possible and he endeavoured to justify this opinion by respectable authorities both ancient and modern which he quoted The Count however was decidedly against him and a long conversation ensued in which the usual arguments on these subjects were on both sides brought forward with skill and discussed with candour but without converting either party to the opinion of his opponent The effect of their conversation on their auditors was various Though the Count had much the superiority of the Baron in point of argument he had considerably fewer adherents for that love so natural to the human mind of whatever is able to distend its faculties with wonder and astonishment attached the majority of the company to the side of the Baron and though many of the Count s propositions were unanswerable his opponents were inclined to believe this the consequence of their own want of knowledge on so abstracted a subject rather than that arguments did not exist which were forcible enough to conquer his Blanche was pale with attention till the ridicule in her father s glance called a blush upon her countenance and she then endeavoured to forget the superstitious tales she had been told in her convent Meanwhile Emily had been listening with deep attention to the discussion of what was to her a very interesting question and remembering the appearance she had witnessed in the apartment of the late Marchioness she was frequently chilled with awe Several times she was on the point of mentioning what she had seen but the fear of giving pain to the Count and the dread of his ridicule restrained her and awaiting in anxious expectation the event of Ludovico s intrepidity she determined that her future silence should depend upon it When the party had separated for the night and the Count retired to his dressing room the remembrance of the desolate scenes he had lately witnessed in his own mansion deeply affected him but at length he was aroused from his reverie and his silence What music is that I hear said he suddenly to his valet Who plays at this late hour The man made no reply and the Count continued to listen and then added That is no common musician he touches the instrument with a delicate hand who is it Pierre My lord said the man hesitatingly Who plays that instrument repeated the Count Does not your lordship know then said the valet What mean you said the Count somewhat sternly Nothing my Lord I meant nothing rejoined the man submissively Only that music goes about the house at midnight often and I thought your lordship might have heard it before Music goes about the house at midnight Poor fellow does nobody dance to the music too It is not in the chateau I believe my Lord the sounds come from the woods they say though they seem so near but then a spirit can do any thing Ah poor fellow said the Count I perceive you are as silly as the rest of them to morrow you will be convinced of your ridiculous error But hark what voice is that O my Lord that is the voice we often hear with the music Often said the Count How often pray It is a very fine one Why my Lord I myself have not heard it more than two or three times but there are those who have lived here longer that have heard it often enough What a swell was that exclaimed the Count as he still listened And now what a dying cadence This is surely something more than mortal That is what they say my Lord said the valet they say it is nothing mortal that utters it and if I might say my thoughts Peace said the Count and he listened till the strain died away This is strange said he as he turned from the window Close the casements Pierre Pierre obeyed and the Count soon after dismissed him but did not so soon lose the remembrance of the music which long vibrated in his fancy in tones of melting sweetness while surprise and perplexity engaged his thoughts Ludovico meanwhile in his remote chamber heard now and then the faint echo of a closing door as the family retired to rest and then the hall clock at a great distance strike twelve It is midnight said he and he looked suspiciously round the spacious chamber The fire on the hearth was now nearly expiring for his attention having been engaged by the book before him he had forgotten every thing besides but he soon added fresh wood not because he was cold though the night was stormy but because he was cheerless and having again trimmed his lamp he poured out a glass of wine drew his chair nearer to the crackling blaze tried to be deaf to the wind that howled mournfully at the casements endeavoured to abstract his mind from the melancholy that was stealing upon him and again took up his book It had been lent to him by Dorothee who had formerly picked it up in an obscure corner of the Marquis s library and who having opened it and perceived some of the marvels it related had carefully preserved it for her own entertainment its condition giving her some excuse for detaining it from its proper station The damp corner into which it had fallen had caused the cover to be disfigured and mouldy and the leaves to be so discoloured with spots that it was not without difficulty the letters could be traced The fictions of the Provencal writers whether drawn from the Arabian legends brought by the Saracens into Spain or recounting the chivalric exploits performed by the crusaders whom the Troubadors accompanied to the east were generally splendid and always marvellous both in scenery and incident and it is not wonderful that Dorothee and Ludovico should be fascinated by inventions which had captivated the careless imagination in every rank of society in a former age Some of the tales however in the book now before Ludovico were of simple structure and exhibited nothing of the magnificent machinery and heroic manners which usually characterized the fables of the twelfth century and of this description was the one he now happened to open which in its original style was of great length but which may be thus shortly related The reader will perceive that it is strongly tinctured with the superstition of the times THE PROVENCAL TALE There lived in the province of Bretagne a noble Baron famous for his magnificence and courtly hospitalities His castle was graced with ladies of exquisite beauty and thronged with illustrious knights for the honour he paid to feats of chivalry invited the brave of distant countries to enter his lists and his court was more splendid than those of many princes Eight minstrels were retained in his service who used to sing to their harps romantic fictions taken from the Arabians or adventures of chivalry that befel knights during the crusades or the martial deeds of the Baron their lord while he surrounded by his knights and ladies banqueted in the great hall of his castle where the costly tapestry that adorned the walls with pictured exploits of his ancestors the casements of painted glass enriched with armorial bearings the gorgeous banners that waved along the roof the sumptuous canopies the profusion of gold and silver that glittered on the sideboards the numerous dishes that covered the tables the number and gay liveries of the attendants with the chivalric and splendid attire of the guests united to form a scene of magnificence such as we may not hope to see in these DEGENERATE DAYS Of the Baron the following adventure is related One night having retired late from the banquet to his chamber and dismissed his attendants he was surprised by the appearance of a stranger of a noble air but of a sorrowful and dejected countenance Believing that this person had been secreted in the apartment since it appeared impossible he could have lately passed the anti room unobserved by the pages in waiting who would have prevented this intrusion on their lord the Baron calling loudly for his people drew his sword which he had not yet taken from his side and stood upon his defence The stranger slowly advancing told him that there was nothing to fear that he came with no hostile design but to communicate to him a terrible secret which it was necessary for him to know The Baron appeased by the courteous manners of the stranger after surveying him for some time in silence returned his sword into the scabbard and desired him to explain the means by which he had obtained access to the chamber and the purpose of this extraordinary visit Without answering either of these enquiries the stranger said that he could not then explain himself but that if the Baron would follow him to the edge of the forest at a short distance from the castle walls he would there convince him that he had something of importance to disclose This proposal again alarmed the Baron who could scarcely believe that the stranger meant to draw him to so solitary a spot at this hour of the night without harbouring a design against his life and he refused to go observing at the same time that if the stranger s purpose was an honourable one he would not persist in refusing to reveal the occasion of his visit in the apartment where they were While he spoke this he viewed the stranger still more attentively than before but observed no change in his countenance or any symptom that might intimate a consciousness of evil design He was habited like a knight was of a tall and majestic stature and of dignified and courteous manners Still however he refused to communicate the subject of his errand in any place but that he had mentioned and at the same time gave hints concerning the secret he would disclose that awakened a degree of solemn curiosity in the Baron which at length induced him to consent to follow the stranger on certain conditions Sir knight said he I will attend you to the forest and will take with me only four of my people who shall witness our conference To this however the Knight objected What I would disclose said he with solemnity is to you alone There are only three living persons to whom the circumstance is known it is of more consequence to you and your house than I shall now explain In future years you will look back to this night with satisfaction or repentance accordingly as you now determine As you would hereafter prosper follow me I pledge you the honour of a knight that no evil shall befall you if you are contented to dare futurity remain in your chamber and I will depart as I came Sir knight replied the Baron how is it possible that my future peace can depend upon my present determination That is not now to be told said the stranger I have explained myself to the utmost It is late if you follow me it must be quickly you will do well to consider the alternative The Baron mused and as he looked upon the knight he perceived his countenance assume a singular solemnity Here Ludovico thought he heard a noise and he threw a glance round the chamber and then held up the lamp to assist his observation but not perceiving any thing to confirm his alarm he took up the book again and pursued the story The Baron paced his apartment for some time in silence impressed by the last words of the stranger whose extraordinary request he feared to grant and feared also to refuse At length he said Sir knight you are utterly unknown to me tell me yourself is it reasonable that I should trust myself alone with a stranger at this hour in a solitary forest Tell me at least who you are and who assisted to secrete you in this chamber The knight frowned at these latter words and was a moment silent then with a countenance somewhat stern he said I am an English knight I am called Sir Bevys of Lancaster and my deeds are not unknown at the Holy City whence I was returning to my native land when I was benighted in the neighbouring forest Your name is not unknown to fame said the Baron I have heard of it The Knight looked haughtily But why since my castle is known to entertain all true knights did not your herald announce you Why did you not appear at the banquet where your presence would have been welcomed instead of hiding yourself in my castle and stealing to my chamber at midnight The stranger frowned and turned away in silence but the Baron repeated the questions I come not said the Knight to answer enquiries but to reveal facts If you would know more follow me and again I pledge the honour of a Knight that you shall return in safety Be quick in your determination I must be gone After some further hesitation the Baron determined to follow the stranger and to see the result of his extraordinary request he therefore again drew forth his sword and taking up a lamp bade the Knight lead on The latter obeyed and opening the door of the chamber they passed into the anti room where the Baron surprised to find all his pages asleep stopped and with hasty violence was going to reprimand them for their carelessness when the Knight waved his hand and looked so expressively upon the Baron that the latter restrained his resentment and passed on The Knight having descended a stair case opened a secret door which the Baron had believed was known only to himself and proceeding through several narrow and winding passages came at length to a small gate that opened beyond the walls of the castle Meanwhile the Baron followed in silence and amazement on perceiving that these secret passages were so well known to a stranger and felt inclined to return from an adventure that appeared to partake of treachery as well as danger Then considering that he was armed and observing the courteous and noble air of his conductor his courage returned he blushed that it had failed him for a moment and he resolved to trace the mystery to its source He now found himself on the heathy platform before the great gates of his castle where on looking up he perceived lights glimmering in the different casements of the guests who were retiring to sleep and while he shivered in the blast and looked on the dark and desolate scene around him he thought of the comforts of his warm chamber rendered cheerful by the blaze of wood and felt for a moment the full contrast of his present situation Here Ludovico paused a moment and looking at his own fire gave it a brightening stir The wind was strong and the Baron watched his lamp with anxiety expecting every moment to see it extinguished but though the flame wavered it did not expire and he still followed the stranger who often sighed as he went but did not speak When they reached the borders of the forest the Knight turned and raised his head as if he meant to address the Baron but then closing his lips in silence he walked on As they entered beneath the dark and spreading boughs the Baron affected by the solemnity of the scene hesitated whether to proceed and demanded how much further they were to go The Knight replied only by a gesture and the Baron with hesitating steps and a suspicious eye followed through an obscure and intricate path till having proceeded a considerable way he again demanded whither they were going and refused to proceed unless he was informed As he said this he looked at his own sword and at the Knight alternately who shook his head and whose dejected countenance disarmed the Baron for a moment of suspicion A little further is the place whither I would lead you said the stranger no evil shall befall you I have sworn it on the honour of a knight The Baron re assured again followed in silence and they soon arrived at a deep recess of the forest where the dark and lofty chesnuts entirely excluded the sky and which was so overgrown with underwood that they proceeded with difficulty The Knight sighed deeply as he passed and sometimes paused and having at length reached a spot where the trees crowded into a knot he turned and with a terrific look pointing to the ground the Baron saw there the body of a man stretched at its length and weltering in blood a ghastly wound was on the forehead and death appeared already to have contracted the features The Baron on perceiving the spectacle started in horror looked at the Knight for explanation and was then going to raise the body and examine if there were yet any remains of life but the stranger waving his hand fixed upon him a look so earnest and mournful as not only much surprised him but made him desist But what were the Baron s emotions when on holding the lamp near the features of the corpse he discovered the exact resemblance of the stranger his conductor to whom he now looked up in astonishment and enquiry As he gazed he perceived the countenance of the Knight change and begin to fade till his whole form gradually vanished from his astonished sense While the Baron stood fixed to the spot a voice was heard to utter these words Ludovico started and laid down the book for he thought he heard a voice in the chamber and he looked toward the bed where however he saw only the dark curtains and the pall He listened scarcely daring to draw his breath but heard only the distant roaring of the sea in the storm and the blast that rushed by the casements when concluding that he had been deceived by its sighings he took up his book to finish the story While the Baron stood fixed to the spot a voice was heard to utter these words This repetition seems to be intentional Ludovico is picking up the thread The body of Sir Bevys of Lancaster a noble knight of England lies before you He was this night waylaid and murdered as he journeyed from the Holy City towards his native land Respect the honour of knighthood and the law of humanity inter the body in christian ground and cause his murderers to be punished As ye observe or neglect this shall peace and happiness or war and misery light upon you and your house for ever The Baron when he recovered from the awe and astonishment into which this adventure had thrown him returned to his castle whither he caused the body of Sir Bevys to be removed and on the following day it was interred with the honours of knighthood in the chapel of the castle attended by all the noble knights and ladies who graced the court of Baron de Brunne Ludovico having finished this story laid aside the book for he felt drowsy and after putting more wood on the fire and taking another glass of wine he reposed himself in the arm chair on the hearth In his dream he still beheld the chamber where he really was and once or twice started from imperfect slumbers imagining he saw a man s face looking over the high back of his armchair This idea had so strongly impressed him that when he raised his eyes he almost expected to meet other eyes fixed upon his own and he quitted his seat and looked behind the chair before he felt perfectly convinced that no person was there Thus closed the hour CHAPTER VII Enjoy the honey heavy dew of slumber Thou hast no figures nor no fantasies Which busy care draws in the brains of men Therefore thou sleep saint so sound SHAKESPEARE The Count who had slept little during the night rose early and anxious to speak with Ludovico went to the north apartment but the outer door having been fastened on the preceding night he was obliged to knock loudly for admittance Neither the knocking or his voice was heard but considering the distance of this door from the bed room and that Ludovico wearied with watching had probably fallen into a deep sleep the Count was not surprised on receiving no answer and leaving the door he went down to walk in his grounds It was a gray autumnal morning The sun rising over Provence gave only a feeble light as his rays struggled through the vapours that ascended from the sea and floated heavily over the wood tops which were now varied with many a mellow tint of autumn The storm was passed but the waves were yet violently agitated and their course was traced by long lines of foam while not a breeze fluttered in the sails of the vessels near the shore that were weighing anchor to depart The still gloom of the hour was pleasing to the Count and he pursued his way through the woods sunk in deep thought Emily also rose at an early hour and took her customary walk along the brow of the promontory that overhung the Mediterranean Her mind was now not occupied with the occurrences of the chateau and Valancourt was the subject of her mournful thoughts whom she had not yet taught herself to consider with indifference though her judgment constantly reproached her for the affection that lingered in her heart after her esteem for him was departed Remembrance frequently gave her his parting look and the tones of his voice when he had bade her a last farewel and some accidental associations now recalling these circumstances to her fancy with peculiar energy she shed bitter tears to the recollection Having reached the watch tower she seated herself on the broken steps and in melancholy dejection watched the waves half hid in vapour as they came rolling towards the shore and threw up their light spray round the rocks below Their hollow murmur and the obscuring mists that came in wreaths up the cliffs gave a solemnity to the scene which was in harmony with the temper of her mind and she sat given up to the remembrance of past times till this became too painful and she abruptly quitted the place On passing the little gate of the watch tower she observed letters engraved on the stone postern which she paused to examine and though they appeared to have been rudely cut with a pen knife the characters were familiar to her at length recognizing the hand writing of Valancourt she read with trembling anxiety the following lines entitled SHIPWRECK Til solemn midnight On this lonely steep Beneath this watch tow r s desolated wall Where mystic shapes the wonderer appall I rest and view below the desert deep As through tempestuous clouds the moon s cold light Gleams on the wave Viewless the winds of night With loud mysterious force the billows sweep And sullen roar the surges far below In the still pauses of the gust I hear The voice of spirits rising sweet and slow And oft among the clouds their forms appear But hark what shriek of death comes in the gale And in the distant ray what glimmering sail Bends to the storm Now sinks the note of fear Ah wretched mariners no more shall day Unclose his cheering eye to light ye on your way From these lines it appeared that Valancourt had visited the tower that he had probably been here on the preceding night for it was such an one as they described and that he had left the building very lately since it had not long been light and without light it was impossible these letters could have been cut It was thus even probable that he might be yet in the gardens As these reflections passed rapidly over the mind of Emily they called up a variety of contending emotions that almost overcame her spirits but her first impulse was to avoid him and immediately leaving the tower she returned with hasty steps towards the chateau As she passed along she remembered the music she had lately heard near the tower with the figure which had appeared and in this moment of agitation she was inclined to believe that she had then heard and seen Valancourt but other recollections soon convinced her of her error On turning into a thicker part of the woods she perceived a person walking slowly in the gloom at some little distance and her mind engaged by the idea of him she started and paused imagining this to be Valancourt The person advanced with quicker steps and before she could recover recollection enough to avoid him he spoke and she then knew the voice of the Count who expressed some surprise on finding her walking at so early an hour and made a feeble effort to rally her on her love of solitude But he soon perceived this to be more a subject of concern than of light laughter and changing his manner affectionately expostulated with Emily on thus indulging unavailing regret who though she acknowledged the justness of all he said could not restrain her tears while she did so and he presently quitted the topic Expressing surprise at not having yet heard from his friend the Advocate at Avignon in answer to the questions proposed to him respecting the estates of the late Madame Montoni he with friendly zeal endeavoured to cheer Emily with hopes of establishing her claim to them while she felt that the estates could now contribute little to the happiness of a life in which Valancourt had no longer an interest When they returned to the chateau Emily retired to her apartment and Count De Villefort to the door of the north chambers This was still fastened but being now determined to arouse Ludovico he renewed his calls more loudly than before after which a total silence ensued and the Count finding all his efforts to be heard ineffectual at length began to fear that some accident had befallen Ludovico whom terror of an imaginary being might have deprived of his senses He therefore left the door with an intention of summoning his servants to force it open some of whom he now heard moving in the lower part of the chateau To the Count s enquiries whether they had seen or heard Ludovico they replied in affright that not one of them had ventured on the north side of the chateau since the preceding night He sleeps soundly then said the Count and is at such a distance from the outer door which is fastened that to gain admittance to the chambers it will be necessary to force it Bring an instrument and follow me The servants stood mute and dejected and it was not till nearly all the household were assembled that the Count s orders were obeyed In the mean time Dorothee was telling of a door that opened from a gallery leading from the great stair case into the last anti room of the saloon and this being much nearer to the bed chamber it appeared probable that Ludovico might be easily awakened by an attempt to open it Thither therefore the Count went but his voice was as ineffectual at this door as it had proved at the remoter one and now seriously interested for Ludovico he was himself going to strike upon the door with the instrument when he observed its singular beauty and with held the blow It appeared on the first glance to be of ebony so dark and close was its grain and so high its polish but it proved to be only of larch wood of the growth of Provence then famous for its forests of larch The beauty of its polished hue and of its delicate carvings determined the Count to spare this door and he returned to that leading from the back stair case which being at length forced he entered the first anti room followed by Henri and a few of the most courageous of his servants the rest awaiting the event of the enquiry on the stairs and landing place All was silent in the chambers through which the Count passed and having reached the saloon he called loudly upon Ludovico after which still receiving no answer he threw open the door of the bed room and entered The profound stillness within confirmed his apprehensions for Ludovico for not even the breathings of a person in sleep were heard and his uncertainty was not soon terminated since the shutters being all closed the chamber was too dark for any object to be distinguished in it The Count bade a servant open them who as he crossed the room to do so stumbled over something and fell to the floor when his cry occasioned such panic among the few of his fellows who had ventured thus far that they instantly fled and the Count and Henri were left to finish the adventure Henri then sprung across the room and opening a window shutter they perceived that the man had fallen over a chair near the hearth in which Ludovico had been sitting for he sat there no longer nor could any where be seen by the imperfect light that was admitted into the apartment The Count seriously alarmed now opened other shutters that he might be enabled to examine further and Ludovico not yet appearing he stood for a moment suspended in astonishment and scarcely trusting his senses till his eyes glancing on the bed he advanced to examine whether he was there asleep No person however was in it and he proceeded to the oriel where every thing remained as on the preceding night but Ludovico was no where to be found The Count now checked his amazement considering that Ludovico might have left the chambers during the night overcome by the terrors which their lonely desolation and the recollected reports concerning them had inspired Yet if this had been the fact the man would naturally have sought society and his fellow servants had all declared they had not seen him the door of the outer room also had been found fastened with the key on the inside it was impossible therefore for him to have passed through that and all the outer doors of this suite were found on examination to be bolted and locked with the keys also within them The Count being then compelled to believe that the lad had escaped through the casements next examined them but such as opened wide enough to admit the body of a man were found to be carefully secured either by iron bars or by shutters and no vestige appeared of any person having attempted to pass them neither was it probable that Ludovico would have incurred the risque of breaking his neck by leaping from a window when he might have walked safely through a door The Count s amazement did not admit of words but he returned once more to examine the bed room where was no appearance of disorder except that occasioned by the late overthrow of the chair near which had stood a small table and on this Ludovico s sword his lamp the book he had been reading and the remnant of his flask of wine still remained At the foot of the table too was the basket with some fragments of provision and wood Henri and the servant now uttered their astonishment without reserve and though the Count said little there was a seriousness in his manner that expressed much It appeared that Ludovico must have quitted these rooms by some concealed passage for the Count could not believe that any supernatural means had occasioned this event yet if there was any such passage it seemed inexplicable why he should retreat through it and it was equally surprising that not even the smallest vestige should appear by which his progress could be traced In the rooms every thing remained as much in order as if he had just walked out by the common way The Count himself assisted in lifting the arras with which the bed chamber saloon and one of the anti rooms were hung that he might discover if any door had been concealed behind it but after a laborious search none was found and he at length quitted the apartments having secured the door of the last anti chamber the key of which he took into his own possession He then gave orders that strict search should be made for Ludovico not only in the chateau but in the neighbourhood and retiring with Henri to his closet they remained there in conversation for a considerable time and whatever was the subject of it Henri from this hour lost much of his vivacity and his manners were particularly grave and reserved whenever the topic which now agitated the Count s family with wonder and alarm was introduced On the disappearing of Ludovico Baron saint Foix seemed strengthened in all his former opinions concerning the probability of apparitions though it was difficult to discover what connection there could possibly be between the two subjects or to account for this effect otherwise than by supposing that the mystery attending Ludovico by exciting awe and curiosity reduced the mind to a state of sensibility which rendered it more liable to the influence of superstition in general It is however certain that from this period the Baron and his adherents became more bigoted to their own systems than before while the terrors of the Count s servants increased to an excess that occasioned many of them to quit the mansion immediately and the rest remained only till others could be procured to supply their places The most strenuous search after Ludovico proved unsuccessful and after several days of indefatigable enquiry poor Annette gave herself up to despair and the other inhabitants of the chateau to amazement Emily whose mind had been deeply affected by the disastrous fate of the late Marchioness and with the mysterious connection which she fancied had existed between her and saint Aubert was particularly impressed by the late extraordinary event and much concerned for the loss of Ludovico whose integrity and faithful services claimed both her esteem and gratitude She was now very desirous to return to the quiet retirement of her convent but every hint of this was received with real sorrow by the Lady Blanche and affectionately set aside by the Count for whom she felt much of the respectful love and admiration of a daughter and to whom by Dorothee s consent she at length mentioned the appearance which they had witnessed in the chamber of the deceased Marchioness At any other period he would have smiled at such a relation and have believed that its object had existed only in the distempered fancy of the relater but he now attended to Emily with seriousness and when she concluded requested of her a promise that this occurrence should rest in silence Whatever may be the cause and the import of these extraordinary occurrences added the Count time only can explain them I shall keep a wary eye upon all that passes in the chateau and shall pursue every possible means of discovering the fate of Ludovico Meanwhile we must be prudent and be silent I will myself watch in the north chambers but of this we will say nothing till the night arrives when I purpose doing so The Count then sent for Dorothee and required of her also a promise of silence concerning what she had already or might in future witness of an extraordinary nature and this ancient servant now related to him the particulars of the Marchioness de Villeroi s death with some of which he appeared to be already acquainted while by others he was evidently surprised and agitated After listening to this narrative the Count retired to his closet where he remained alone for several hours and when he again appeared the solemnity of his manner surprised and alarmed Emily but she gave no utterance to her thoughts On the week following the disappearance of Ludovico all the Count s guests took leave of him except the Baron his son Mons saint Foix and Emily the latter of whom was soon after embarrassed and distressed by the arrival of another visitor Mons Du Pont which made her determine upon withdrawing to her convent immediately The delight that appeared in his countenance when he met her told that he brought back the same ardour of passion which had formerly banished him from Chateau le Blanc He was received with reserve by Emily and with pleasure by the Count who presented him to her with a smile that seemed intended to plead his cause and who did not hope the less for his friend from the embarrassment she betrayed But M Du Pont with truer sympathy seemed to understand her manner and his countenance quickly lost its vivacity and sunk into the languor of despondency On the following day however he sought an opportunity of declaring the purport of his visit and renewed his suit a declaration which was received with real concern by Emily who endeavoured to lessen the pain she might inflict by a second rejection with assurances of esteem and friendship yet she left him in a state of mind that claimed and excited her tenderest compassion and being more sensible than ever of the impropriety of remaining longer at the chateau she immediately sought the Count and communicated to him her intention of returning to the convent My dear Emily said he I observe with extreme concern the illusion you are encouraging an illusion common to young and sensible minds Your heart has received a severe shock you believe you can never entirely recover it and you will encourage this belief till the habit of indulging sorrow will subdue the strength of your mind and discolour your future views with melancholy and regret Let me dissipate this illusion and awaken you to a sense of your danger Emily smiled mournfully I know what you would say my dear sir said she and am prepared to answer you I feel that my heart can never know a second affection and that I must never hope even to recover its tranquillity if I suffer myself to enter into a second engagement I know that you feel all this replied the Count and I know also that time will overcome these feelings unless you cherish them in solitude and pardon me with romantic tenderness Then indeed time will only confirm habit I am particularly empowered to speak on this subject and to sympathize in your sufferings added the Count with an air of solemnity for I have known what it is to love and to lament the object of my love Yes continued he while his eyes filled with tears I have suffered but those times have passed away long passed and I can now look back upon them without emotion My dear sir said Emily timidly what mean those tears they speak I fear another language they plead for me They are weak tears for they are useless ones replied the Count drying them I would have you superior to such weakness These however are only faint traces of a grief which if it had not been opposed by long continued effort might have led me to the verge of madness Judge then whether I have not cause to warn you of an indulgence which may produce so terrible an effect and which must certainly if not opposed overcloud the years that otherwise might be happy M Du Pont is a sensible and amiable man who has long been tenderly attached to you his family and fortune are unexceptionable after what I have said it is unnecessary to add that I should rejoice in your felicity and that I think M Du Pont would promote it Do not weep Emily continued the Count taking her hand there IS happiness reserved for you He was silent a moment and then added in a firmer voice I do not wish that you should make a violent effort to overcome your feelings all I at present ask is that you will check the thoughts that would lead you to a remembrance of the past that you will suffer your mind to be engaged by present objects that you will allow yourself to believe it possible you may yet be happy and that you will sometimes think with complacency of poor Du Pont and not condemn him to the state of despondency from which my dear Emily I am endeavouring to withdraw you Ah my dear sir said Emily while her tears still fell do not suffer the benevolence of your wishes to mislead Mons Du Pont with an expectation that I can ever accept his hand If I understand my own heart this never can be your instruction I can obey in almost every other particular than that of adopting a contrary belief Leave me to understand your heart replied the Count with a faint smile If you pay me the compliment to be guided by my advice in other instances I will pardon your incredulity respecting your future conduct towards Mons Du Pont I will not even press you to remain longer at the chateau than your own satisfaction will permit but though I forbear to oppose your present retirement I shall urge the claims of friendship for your future visits Tears of gratitude mingled with those of tender regret while Emily thanked the Count for the many instances of friendship she had received from him promised to be directed by his advice upon every subject but one and assured him of the pleasure with which she should at some future period accept the invitation of the Countess and himself If Mons Du Pont was not at the chateau The Count smiled at this condition Be it so said he meanwhile the convent is so near the chateau that my daughter and I shall often visit you and if sometimes we should dare to bring you another visitor will you forgive us Emily looked distressed and remained silent Well rejoined the Count I will pursue this subject no further and must now entreat your forgiveness for having pressed it thus far You will however do me the justice to believe that I have been urged only by a sincere regard for your happiness and that of my amiable friend Mons Du Pont Emily when she left the Count went to mention her intended departure to the Countess who opposed it with polite expressions of regret after which she sent a note to acquaint the lady abbess that she should return to the convent and thither she withdrew on the evening of the following day M Du Pont in extreme regret saw her depart while the Count endeavoured to cheer him with a hope that Emily would sometimes regard him with a more favourable eye She was pleased to find herself once more in the tranquil retirement of the convent where she experienced a renewal of all the maternal kindness of the abbess and of the sisterly attentions of the nuns A report of the late extraordinary occurrence at the chateau had already reached them and after supper on the evening of her arrival it was the subject of conversation in the convent parlour where she was requested to mention some particulars of that unaccountable event Emily was guarded in her conversation on this subject and briefly related a few circumstances concerning Ludovico whose disappearance her auditors almost unanimously agreed had been effected by supernatural means A belief had so long prevailed said a nun who was called sister Frances that the chateau was haunted that I was surprised when I heard the Count had the temerity to inhabit it Its former possessor I fear had some deed of conscience to atone for let us hope that the virtues of its present owner will preserve him from the punishment due to the errors of the last if indeed he was a criminal Of what crime then was he suspected said a Mademoiselle Feydeau a boarder at the convent Let us pray for his soul said a nun who had till now sat in silent attention If he was criminal his punishment in this world was sufficient There was a mixture of wildness and solemnity in her manner of delivering this which struck Emily exceedingly but Mademoiselle repeated her question without noticing the solemn eagerness of the nun I dare not presume to say what was his crime replied sister Frances but I have heard many reports of an extraordinary nature respecting the late Marquis de Villeroi and among others that soon after the death of his lady he quitted Chateau le Blanc and never afterwards returned to it I was not here at the time so I can only mention it from report and so many years have passed since the Marchioness died that few of our sisterhood I believe can do more But I can said the nun who had before spoke and whom they called sister Agnes You then said Mademoiselle Feydeau are possibly acquainted with circumstances that enable you to judge whether he was criminal or not and what was the crime imputed to him I am replied the nun but who shall dare to scrutinize my thoughts who shall dare to pluck out my opinion God only is his judge and to that judge he is gone Emily looked with surprise at sister Frances who returned her a significant glance I only requested your opinion said Mademoiselle Feydeau mildly if the subject is displeasing to you I will drop it Displeasing said the nun with emphasis We are idle talkers we do not weigh the meaning of the words we use DISPLEASING is a poor word I will go pray As she said this she rose from her seat and with a profound sigh quitted the room What can be the meaning of this said Emily when she was gone It is nothing extraordinary replied sister Frances she is often thus but she had no meaning in what she says Her intellects are at times deranged Did you never see her thus before Never said Emily I have indeed sometimes thought that there was the melancholy of madness in her look but never before perceived it in her speech Poor soul I will pray for her Your prayers then my daughter will unite with ours observed the lady abbess she has need of them Dear lady said Mademoiselle Feydeau addressing the abbess what is your opinion of the late Marquis The strange circumstances that have occurred at the chateau have so much awakened my curiosity that I shall be pardoned the question What was his imputed crime and what the punishment to which sister Agnes alluded We must be cautious of advancing our opinion said the abbess with an air of reserve mingled with solemnity we must be cautious of advancing our opinion on so delicate a subject I will not take upon me to pronounce that the late Marquis was criminal or to say what was the crime of which he was suspected but concerning the punishment our daughter Agnes hinted I know of none he suffered She probably alluded to the severe one which an exasperated conscience can inflict Beware my children of incurring so terrible a punishment it is the purgatory of this life The late Marchioness I knew well she was a pattern to such as live in the world nay our sacred order need not have blushed to copy her virtues Our holy convent received her mortal part her heavenly spirit I doubt not ascended to its sanctuary As the abbess spoke this the last bell of vespers struck up and she rose Let us go my children said she and intercede for the wretched let us go and confess our sins and endeavour to purify our souls for the heaven to which SHE is gone Emily was affected by the solemnity of this exhortation and remembering her father The heaven to which HE too is gone said she faintly as she suppressed her sighs and followed the abbess and the nuns to the chapel CHAPTER VIII Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damn d Bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell Be thy intents wicked or charitable I will speak to thee HAMLET Count de Villefort at length received a letter from the advocate at Avignon encouraging Emily to assert her claim to the estates of the late Madame Montoni and about the same time a messenger arrived from Monsieur Quesnel with intelligence that made an appeal to the law on this subject unnecessary since it appeared that the only person who could have opposed her claim was now no more A friend of Monsieur Quesnel who resided at Venice had sent him an account of the death of Montoni who had been brought to trial with Orsino as his supposed accomplice in the murder of the Venetian nobleman Orsino was found guilty condemned and executed upon the wheel but nothing being discovered to criminate Montoni and his colleagues on this charge they were all released except Montoni who being considered by the senate as a very dangerous person was for other reasons ordered again into confinement where it was said he had died in a doubtful and mysterious manner and not without suspicion of having been poisoned The authority from which M Quesnel had received this information would not allow him to doubt its truth and he told Emily that she had now only to lay claim to the estates of her late aunt to secure them and added that he would himself assist in the necessary forms of this business The term for which La Vallee had been let being now also nearly expired he acquainted her with the circumstance and advised her to take the road thither through Tholouse where he promised to meet her and where it would be proper for her to take possession of the estates of the late Madame Montoni adding that he would spare her any difficulties that might occur on that occasion from the want of knowledge on the subject and that he believed it would be necessary for her to be at Tholouse in about three weeks from the present time An increase of fortune seemed to have awakened this sudden kindness in M Quesnel towards his niece and it appeared that he entertained more respect for the rich heiress than he had ever felt compassion for the poor and unfriended orphan The pleasure with which she received this intelligence was clouded when she considered that he for whose sake she had once regretted the want of fortune was no longer worthy of sharing it with her but remembering the friendly admonition of the Count she checked this melancholy reflection and endeavoured to feel only gratitude for the unexpected good that now attended her while it formed no inconsiderable part of her satisfaction to know that La Vallee her native home which was endeared to her by it s having been the residence of her parents would soon be restored to her possession There she meant to fix her future residence for though it could not be compared with the chateau at Tholouse either for extent or magnificence its pleasant scenes and the tender remembrances that haunted them had claims upon her heart which she was not inclined to sacrifice to ostentation She wrote immediately to thank M Quesnel for the active interest he took in her concerns and to say that she would meet him at Tholouse at the appointed time When Count de Villefort with Blanche came to the convent to give Emily the advice of the advocate he was informed of the contents of M Quesnel s letter and gave her his sincere congratulations on the occasion but she observed that when the first expression of satisfaction had faded from his countenance an unusual gravity succeeded and she scarcely hesitated to enquire its cause It has no new occasion replied the Count I am harassed and perplexed by the confusion into which my family is thrown by their foolish superstition Idle reports are floating round me which I can neither admit to be true or prove to be false and I am also very anxious about the poor fellow Ludovico concerning whom I have not been able to obtain information Every part of the chateau and every part of the neighbourhood too has I believe been searched and I know not what further can be done since I have already offered large rewards for the discovery of him The keys of the north apartment I have not suffered to be out of my possession since he disappeared and I mean to watch in those chambers myself this very night Emily seriously alarmed for the Count united her entreaties with those of the Lady Blanche to dissuade him from his purpose What should I fear said he I have no faith in supernatural combats and for human opposition I shall be prepared nay I will even promise not to watch alone But who dear sir will have courage enough to watch with you said Emily My son replied the Count If I am not carried off in the night added he smiling you shall hear the result of my adventure tomorrow The Count and Lady Blanche shortly afterwards took leave of Emily and returned to the chateau where he informed Henri of his intention who not without some secret reluctance consented to be the partner of his watch and when the design was mentioned after supper the Countess was terrified and the Baron and M Du Pont joined with her in entreating that he would not tempt his fate as Ludovico had done We know not added the Baron the nature or the power of an evil spirit and that such a spirit haunts those chambers can now I think scarcely be doubted Beware my lord how you provoke its vengeance since it has already given us one terrible example of its malice I allow it may be probable that the spirits of the dead are permitted to return to the earth only on occasions of high import but the present import may be your destruction The Count could not forbear smiling Do you think then Baron said he that my destruction is of sufficient importance to draw back to earth the soul of the departed Alas my good friend there is no occasion for such means to accomplish the destruction of any individual Wherever the mystery rests I trust I shall this night be able to detect it You know I am not superstitious I know that you are incredulous interrupted the Baron Well call it what you will I mean to say that though you know I am free from superstition if any thing supernatural has appeared I doubt not it will appear to me and if any strange event hangs over my house or if any extraordinary transaction has formerly been connected with it I shall probably be made acquainted with it At all events I will invite discovery and that I may be equal to a mortal attack which in good truth my friend is what I most expect I shall take care to be well armed The Count took leave of his family for the night with an assumed gaiety which but ill concealed the anxiety that depressed his spirits and retired to the north apartments accompanied by his son and followed by the Baron M Du Pont and some of the domestics who all bade him good night at the outer door In these chambers every thing appeared as when he had last been here even in the bed room no alteration was visible where he lighted his own fire for none of the domestics could be prevailed upon to venture thither After carefully examining the chamber and the oriel the Count and Henri drew their chairs upon the hearth set a bottle of wine and a lamp before them laid their swords upon the table and stirring the wood into a blaze began to converse on indifferent topics But Henri was often silent and abstracted and sometimes threw a glance of mingled awe and curiosity round the gloomy apartment while the Count gradually ceased to converse and sat either lost in thought or reading a volume of Tacitus which he had brought to beguile the tediousness of the night CHAPTER IV

none	none	 The Baron saint Foix whom anxiety for his friend had kept awake rose early to enquire the event of the night when as he passed the Count s closet hearing steps within he knocked at the door and it was opened by his friend himself Rejoicing to see him in safety and curious to learn the occurrences of the night he had not immediately leisure to observe the unusual gravity that overspread the features of the Count whose reserved answers first occasioned him to notice it The Count then smiling endeavoured to treat the subject of his curiosity with levity but the Baron was serious and pursued his enquiries so closely that the Count at length resuming his gravity said Well my friend press the subject no further I entreat you and let me request also that you will hereafter be silent upon any thing you may think extraordinary in my future conduct 
3379_132592_000002_000003	train-clean-360	I do not scruple to tell you that I am unhappy and that the watch of the last night has not assisted me to discover Ludovico upon every occurrence of the night you must excuse my reserve 
none	none	But where is Henri said the Baron with surprise and disappointment at this denial He is well in his own apartment replied the Count You will not question him on this topic my friend since you know my wish Certainly not said the Baron somewhat chagrined since it would be displeasing to you but methinks my friend you might rely on my discretion and drop this unusual reserve However you must allow me to suspect that you have seen reason to become a convert to my system and are no longer the incredulous knight you lately appeared to be Let us talk no more upon this subject said the Count you may be assured that no ordinary circumstance has imposed this silence upon me towards a friend whom I have called so for near thirty years and my present reserve cannot make you question either my esteem or the sincerity of my friendship I will not doubt either said the Baron though you must allow me to express my surprise at this silence To me I will allow it replied the Count but I earnestly entreat that you will forbear to notice it to my family as well as every thing remarkable you may observe in my conduct towards them The Baron readily promised this and after conversing for some time on general topics they descended to the breakfast room where the Count met his family with a cheerful countenance and evaded their enquiries by employing light ridicule and assuming an air of uncommon gaiety while he assured them that they need not apprehend any evil from the north chambers since Henri and himself had been permitted to return from them in safety Henri however was less successful in disguising his feelings From his countenance an expression of terror was not entirely faded he was often silent and thoughtful and when he attempted to laugh at the eager enquiries of Mademoiselle Bearn it was evidently only an attempt 
3379_132592_000011_000000	train-clean-360	In the evening the Count called as he had promised at the convent and Emily was surprised to perceive a mixture of playful ridicule and of reserve in his mention of the north apartment 
none	none	Of what had occurred there however he said nothing and when she ventured to remind him of his promise to tell her the result of his enquiries and to ask if he had received any proof that those chambers were haunted his look became solemn for a moment then seeming to recollect himself he smiled and said My dear Emily do not suffer my lady abbess to infect your good understanding with these fancies she will teach you to expect a ghost in every dark room But believe me added he with a profound sigh the apparition of the dead comes not on light or sportive errands to terrify or to surprise the timid He paused and fell into a momentary thoughtfulness and then added We will say no more on this subject 
3379_132592_000012_000000	train-clean-360	Soon after he took leave and when Emily joined some of the nuns she was surprised to find them acquainted with a circumstance which she had carefully avoided to mention and expressing their admiration of his intrepidity in having dared to pass a night in the apartment whence Ludovico had disappeared for she had not considered with what rapidity a tale of wonder circulates 
none	none	The nuns had acquired their information from peasants who brought fruit to the monastery and whose whole attention had been fixed since the disappearance of Ludovico on what was passing in the castle Emily listened in silence to the various opinions of the nuns concerning the conduct of the Count most of whom condemned it as rash and presumptuous affirming that it was provoking the vengeance of an evil spirit thus to intrude upon its haunts Sister Frances contended that the Count had acted with the bravery of a virtuous mind He knew himself guiltless of aught that should provoke a good spirit and did not fear the spells of an evil one since he could claim the protection of an higher Power of Him who can command the wicked and will protect the innocent
3379_132592_000015_000000	train-clean-360	 The guilty cannot claim that protection said sister Agnes let the Count look to his conduct that he do not forfeit his claim 
none	none	Yet who is he that shall dare to call himself innocent all earthly innocence is but comparative Yet still how wide asunder are the extremes of guilt and to what an horrible depth may we fall Oh The nun as she concluded uttered a shuddering sigh that startled Emily who looking up perceived the eyes of Agnes fixed on hers after which the sister rose took her hand gazed earnestly upon her countenance for some moments in silence and then said You are young you are innocent 
3379_132592_000017_000001	train-clean-360	I mean you are yet innocent of any great crime But you have passions in your heart scorpions they sleep now beware how you awaken them they will sting you even unto death 
none	none	Emily affected by these words and by the solemnity with which they were delivered could not suppress her tears Ah is it so exclaimed Agnes her countenance softening from its sternness so young and so unfortunate We are sisters then indeed Yet there is no bond of kindness among the guilty she added while her eyes resumed their wild expression no gentleness no peace no hope I knew them all once my eyes could weep but now they burn for now my soul is fixed and fearless I lament no more Rather let us repent and pray said another nun
3379_132592_000020_000001	train-clean-360	 We are taught to hope that prayer and penitence will work our salvation 
3379_132592_000020_000002	train-clean-360	There is hope for all who repent 
none	none	Who repent and turn to the true faith observed sister Frances For all but me replied Agnes solemnly who paused and then abruptly added My head burns I believe I am not well O could I strike from my memory all former scenes the figures that rise up like furies to torment me I see them when I sleep and when I am awake they are still before my eyes 
3379_132592_000022_000002	train-clean-360	I see them now now 
none	none	She stood in a fixed attitude of horror her straining eyes moving slowly round the room as if they followed something One of the nuns gently took her hand to lead her from the parlour Agnes became calm drew her other hand across her eyes looked again and sighing deeply said They are gone they are gone I am feverish I know not what I say I am thus sometimes but it will go off again I shall soon be better 
3379_132592_000023_000005	train-clean-360	Was not that the vesper bell 
3379_132592_000024_000000	train-clean-360	 No replied Frances the evening service is passed 
none	none	Let Margaret lead you to your cell
3379_132592_000025_000000	train-clean-360	 You are right replied sister Agnes I shall be better there 
none	none	Good night my sisters remember me in your orisons When they had withdrawn Frances observing Emily s emotion said Do not be alarmed our sister is often thus deranged though I have not lately seen her so frantic her usual mood is melancholy This fit has been coming on for several days seclusion and the customary treatment will restore her But how rationally she conversed at first observed Emily her ideas followed each other in perfect order Yes replied the nun this is nothing new nay I have sometimes known her argue not only with method but with acuteness and then in a moment start off into madness Her conscience seems afflicted said Emily did you ever hear what circumstance reduced her to this deplorable condition I have replied the nun who said no more till Emily repeated the question when she added in a low voice and looking significantly towards the other boarders I cannot tell you now but if you think it worth your while come to my cell to night when our sisterhood are at rest and you shall hear more but remember we rise to midnight prayers and come either before or after midnight Emily promised to remember and the abbess soon after appearing they spoke no more of the unhappy nun The Count meanwhile on his return home had found M Du Pont in one of those fits of despondency which his attachment to Emily frequently occasioned him an attachment that had subsisted too long to be easily subdued and which had already outlived the opposition of his friends M Du Pont had first seen Emily in Gascony during the lifetime of his parent who on discovering his son s partiality for Mademoiselle saint Aubert his inferior in point of fortune forbade him to declare it to her family or to think of her more During the life of his father he had observed the first command but had found it impracticable to obey the second and had sometimes soothed his passion by visiting her favourite haunts among which was the fishing house where once or twice he addressed her in verse concealing his name in obedience to the promise he had given his father There too he played the pathetic air to which she had listened with such surprise and admiration and there he found the miniature that had since cherished a passion fatal to his repose During his expedition into Italy his father died but he received his liberty at a moment when he was the least enabled to profit by it since the object that rendered it most valuable was no longer within the reach of his vows By what accident he discovered Emily and assisted to release her from a terrible imprisonment has already appeared and also the unavailing hope with which he then encouraged his love and the fruitless efforts that he had since made to overcome it The Count still endeavoured with friendly zeal to sooth him with a belief that patience perseverance and prudence would finally obtain for him happiness and Emily Time said he will wear away the melancholy impression which disappointment has left on her mind and she will be sensible of your merit 
3379_132592_000033_000001	train-clean-360	Your services have already awakened her gratitude and your sufferings her pity and trust me my friend in a heart so sensible as hers gratitude and pity lead to love 
none	none	When her imagination is rescued from its present delusion she will readily accept the homage of a mind like yours Du Pont sighed while he listened to these words and endeavouring to hope what his friend believed he willingly yielded to an invitation to prolong his visit at the chateau which we now leave for the monastery of saint Claire When the nuns had retired to rest Emily stole to her appointment with sister Frances whom she found in her cell engaged in prayer before a little table where appeared the image she was addressing and above the dim lamp that gave light to the place Turning her eyes as the door opened she beckoned to Emily to come in who having done so seated herself in silence beside the nun s little mattress of straw till her orisons should conclude The latter soon rose from her knees and taking down the lamp and placing it on the table Emily perceived there a human scull and bones lying beside an hour glass but the nun without observing her emotion sat down on the mattress by her saying Your curiosity sister has made you punctual but you have nothing remarkable to hear in the history of poor Agnes of whom I avoided to speak in the presence of my lay sisters only because I would not publish her crime to them I shall consider your confidence in me as a favour said Emily and will not misuse it Sister Agnes resumed the nun is of a noble family as the dignity of her air must already have informed you but I will not dishonour their name so much as to reveal it Love was the occasion of her crime and of her madness She was beloved by a gentleman of inferior fortune and her father as I have heard bestowing her on a nobleman whom she disliked an ill governed passion proved her destruction Every obligation of virtue and of duty was forgotten and she prophaned her marriage vows but her guilt was soon detected and she would have fallen a sacrifice to the vengeance of her husband had not her father contrived to convey her from his power 
3379_132592_000037_000003	train-clean-360	By what means he did this I never could learn but he secreted her in this convent where he afterwards prevailed with her to take the veil while a report was circulated in the world that she was dead and the father to save his daughter assisted the rumour and employed such means as induced her husband to believe she had become a victim to his jealousy 
none	none	You look surprised added the nun observing Emily s countenance I allow the story is uncommon but not I believe without a parallel Pray proceed said Emily I am interested The story is already told resumed the nun I have only to mention that the long struggle which Agnes suffered between love remorse and a sense of the duties she had taken upon herself in becoming of our order at length unsettled her reason 
3379_132592_000039_000001	train-clean-360	At first she was frantic and melancholy by quick alternatives then she sunk into a deep and settled melancholy which still however has at times been interrupted by fits of wildness and of late these have again been frequent 
none	none	Emily was affected by the history of the sister some parts of whose story brought to her remembrance that of the Marchioness de Villeroi who had also been compelled by her father to forsake the object of her affections for a nobleman of his choice but from what Dorothee had related there appeared no reason to suppose that she had escaped the vengeance of a jealous husband or to doubt for a moment the innocence of her conduct But Emily while she sighed over the misery of the nun could not forbear shedding a few tears to the misfortunes of the Marchioness and when she returned to the mention of sister Agnes she asked Frances if she remembered her in her youth and whether she was then beautiful I was not here at the time when she took the vows replied Frances which is so long ago that few of the present sisterhood I believe were witnesses of the ceremony nay ever our lady mother did not then preside over the convent but I can remember when sister Agnes was a very beautiful woman She retains that air of high rank which always distinguished her but her beauty you must perceive is fled I can scarcely discover even a vestige of the loveliness that once animated her features It is strange said Emily but there are moments when her countenance has appeared familiar to my memory You will think me fanciful and I think myself so for I certainly never saw sister Agnes before I came to this convent and I must therefore have seen some person whom she strongly resembles though of this I have no recollection You have been interested by the deep melancholy of her countenance said Frances and its impression has probably deluded your imagination for I might as reasonably think I perceive a likeness between you and Agnes as you that you have seen her any where but in this convent since this has been her place of refuge for nearly as many years as make your age Indeed said Emily Yes rejoined Frances and why does that circumstance excite your surprise 
3379_132592_000046_000000	train-clean-360	Emily did not appear to notice this question but remained thoughtful for a few moments and then said It was about that same period that the Marchioness de Villeroi expired 
3379_132592_000047_000000	train-clean-360	 That is an odd remark said Frances 
none	none	Emily recalled from her reverie smiled and gave the conversation another turn but it soon came back to the subject of the unhappy nun and Emily remained in the cell of sister Frances till the mid night bell aroused her when apologizing for having interrupted the sister s repose till this late hour they quitted the cell together Emily returned to her chamber and the nun bearing a glimmering taper went to her devotion in the chapel Several days followed during which Emily saw neither the Count or any of his family and when at length he appeared she remarked with concern that his air was unusually disturbed My spirits are harassed said he in answer to her anxious enquiries and I mean to change my residence for a little while an experiment which I hope will restore my mind to its usual tranquillity My daughter and myself will accompany the Baron saint Foix to his chateau It lies in a valley of the Pyrenees that opens towards Gascony and I have been thinking Emily that when you set out for La Vallee we may go part of the way together it would be a satisfaction to me to guard you towards your home She thanked the Count for his friendly consideration and lamented that the necessity for her going first to Tholouse would render this plan impracticable But when you are at the Baron s residence she added you will be only a short journey from La Vallee and I think sir you will not leave the country without visiting me it is unnecessary to say with what pleasure I should receive you and the Lady Blanche
3379_132592_000052_000000	train-clean-360	 I do not doubt it replied the Count and I will not deny myself and Blanche the pleasure of visiting you if your affairs should allow you to be at La Vallee about the time when we can meet you there 
none	none	When Emily said that she should hope to see the Countess also she was not sorry to learn that this lady was going accompanied by Mademoiselle Bearn to pay a visit for a few weeks to a family in lower Languedoc The Count after some further conversation on his intended journey and on the arrangement of Emily s took leave and many days did not succeed this visit before a second letter from M Quesnel informed her that he was then at Tholouse that La Vallee was at liberty and that he wished her to set off for the former place where he awaited her arrival with all possible dispatch since his own affairs pressed him to return to Gascony Emily did not hesitate to obey him and having taken an affecting leave of the Count s family in which M Du Pont was still included and of her friends at the convent she set out for Tholouse attended by the unhappy Annette and guarded by a steady servant of the Count CHAPTER X Lull d in the countless chambers of the brain Our thoughts are link d by many a hidden chain Awake but one and lo what myriads rise Each stamps its image as the other flies PLEASURES OF MEMORY Emily pursued her journey without any accident along the plains of Languedoc towards the north west and on this her return to Tholouse which she had last left with Madame Montoni she thought much on the melancholy fate of her aunt who but for her own imprudence might now have been living in happiness there Montoni too often rose to her fancy such as she had seen him in his days of triumph bold spirited and commanding such also as she had since beheld him in his days of vengeance and now only a few short months had passed and he had no longer the power or the will to afflict he had become a clod of earth and his life was vanished like a shadow Emily could have wept at his fate had she not remembered his crimes for that of her unfortunate aunt she did weep and all sense of her errors was overcome by the recollection of her misfortunes Other thoughts and other emotions succeeded as Emily drew near the well known scenes of her early love and considered that Valancourt was lost to her and to himself for ever At length she came to the brow of the hill whence on her departure for Italy she had given a farewell look to this beloved landscape amongst whose woods and fields she had so often walked with Valancourt and where he was then to inhabit when she would be far far away She saw once more that chain of the Pyrenees which overlooked La Vallee rising like faint clouds on the horizon There too is Gascony extended at their feet said she O my father my mother And there too is the Garonne she added drying the tears that obscured her sight and Tholouse and my aunt s mansion and the groves in her garden O my friends are ye all lost to me must I never never see ye more Tears rushed again to her eyes and she continued to weep till an abrupt turn in the road had nearly occasioned the carriage to overset when looking up she perceived another part of the well known scene around Tholouse and all the reflections and anticipations which she had suffered at the moment when she bade it last adieu came with recollected force to her heart She remembered how anxiously she had looked forward to the futurity which was to decide her happiness concerning Valancourt and what depressing fears had assailed her the very words she had uttered as she withdrew her last look from the prospect came to her memory Could I but be certain she had then said that I should ever return and that Valancourt would still live for me I should go in peace Now that futurity so anxiously anticipated was arrived she was returned but what a dreary blank appeared Valancourt no longer lived for her She had no longer even the melancholy satisfaction of contemplating his image in her heart for he was no longer the same Valancourt she had cherished there the solace of many a mournful hour the animating friend that had enabled her to bear up against the oppression of Montoni the distant hope that had beamed over her gloomy prospect On perceiving this beloved idea to be an illusion of her own creation Valancourt seemed to be annihilated and her soul sickened at the blank that remained His marriage with a rival even his death she thought she could have endured with more fortitude than this discovery for then amidst all her grief she could have looked in secret upon the image of goodness which her fancy had drawn of him and comfort would have mingled with her suffering Drying her tears she looked once more upon the landscape which had excited them and perceived that she was passing the very bank where she had taken leave of Valancourt on the morning of her departure from Tholouse and she now saw him through her returning tears such as he had appeared when she looked from the carriage to give him a last adieu saw him leaning mournfully against the high trees and remembered the fixed look of mingled tenderness and anguish with which he had then regarded her This recollection was too much for her heart and she sunk back in the carriage nor once looked up till it stopped at the gates of what was now her own mansion These being opened and by the servant to whose care the chateau had been entrusted the carriage drove into the court where alighting she hastily passed through the great hall now silent and solitary to a large oak parlour the common sitting room of the late Madame Montoni where instead of being received by M Quesnel she found a letter from him informing her that business of consequence had obliged him to leave Tholouse two days before Emily was upon the whole not sorry to be spared his presence since his abrupt departure appeared to indicate the same indifference with which he had formerly regarded her This letter informed her also of the progress he had made in the settlement of her affairs and concluded with directions concerning the forms of some business which remained for her to transact But M Quesnel s unkindness did not long occupy her thoughts which returned the remembrance of the persons she had been accustomed to see in this mansion and chiefly of the ill guided and unfortunate Madame Montoni In the room where she now sat she had breakfasted with her on the morning of their departure for Italy and the view of it brought most forcibly to her recollection all she had herself suffered at that time and the many gay expectations which her aunt had formed respecting the journey before her While Emily s mind was thus engaged her eyes wandered unconsciously to a large window that looked upon the garden and here new memorials of the past spoke to her heart for she saw extended before her the very avenue in which she had parted with Valancourt on the eve of her journey and all the anxiety the tender interest he had shewn concerning her future happiness his earnest remonstrances against her committing herself to the power of Montoni and the truth of his affection came afresh to her memory At this moment it appeared almost impossible that Valancourt could have become unworthy of her regard and she doubted all that she had lately heard to his disadvantage and even his own words which had confirmed Count De Villefort s report of him Overcome by the recollections which the view of this avenue occasioned she turned abruptly from the window and sunk into a chair beside it where she sat given up to grief till the entrance of Annette with coffee aroused her Dear madam how melancholy this place looks now said Annette to what it used to do It is dismal coming home when there is nobody to welcome one This was not the moment in which Emily could bear the remark her tears fell again and as soon as she had taken the coffee she retired to her apartment where she endeavoured to repose her fatigued spirits But busy memory would still supply her with the visions of former times she saw Valancourt interesting and benevolent as he had been wont to appear in the days of their early love and amidst the scenes where she had believed that they should sometimes pass their years together but at length sleep closed these afflicting scenes from her view On the following morning serious occupation recovered her from such melancholy reflections for being desirous of quitting Tholouse and of hastening on to La Vallee she made some enquiries into the condition of the estate and immediately dispatched a part of the necessary business concerning it according to the directions of Mons Quesnel It required a strong effort to abstract her thoughts from other interests sufficiently to attend to this but she was rewarded for her exertions by again experiencing that employment is the surest antidote to sorrow This day was devoted entirely to business and among other concerns she employed means to learn the situation of all her poor tenants that she might relieve their wants or confirm their comforts In the evening her spirits were so much strengthened that she thought she could bear to visit the gardens where she had so often walked with Valancourt and knowing that if she delayed to do so their scenes would only affect her the more whenever they should be viewed she took advantage of the present state of her mind and entered them Passing hastily the gate leading from the court into the gardens she hurried up the great avenue scarcely permitting her memory to dwell for a moment on the circumstance of her having here parted with Valancourt and soon quitted this for other walks less interesting to her heart These brought her at length to the flight of steps that led from the lower garden to the terrace on seeing which she became agitated and hesitated whether to ascend but her resolution returning she proceeded Ah said Emily as she ascended these are the same high trees that used to wave over the terrace and these the same flowery thickets the liburnum the wild rose and the cerinthe which were wont to grow beneath them Ah and there too on that bank are the very plants which Valancourt so carefully reared O when last I saw them she checked the thought but could not restrain her tears and after walking slowly on for a few moments her agitation upon the view of this well known scene increased so much that she was obliged to stop and lean upon the wall of the terrace It was a mild and beautiful evening The sun was setting over the extensive landscape to which his beams sloping from beneath a dark cloud that overhung the west gave rich and partial colouring and touched the tufted summits of the groves that rose from the garden below with a yellow gleam Emily and Valancourt had often admired together this scene at the same hour and it was exactly on this spot that on the night preceding her departure for Italy she had listened to his remonstrances against the journey and to the pleadings of passionate affection Some observations which she made on the landscape brought this to her remembrance and with it all the minute particulars of that conversation the alarming doubts he had expressed concerning Montoni doubts which had since been fatally confirmed the reasons and entreaties he had employed to prevail with her to consent to an immediate marriage the tenderness of his love the paroxysms of this grief and the conviction that he had repeatedly expressed that they should never meet again in happiness All these circumstances rose afresh to her mind and awakened the various emotions she had then suffered Her tenderness for Valancourt became as powerful as in the moments when she thought that she was parting with him and happiness together and when the strength of her mind had enabled her to triumph over present suffering rather than to deserve the reproach of her conscience by engaging in a clandestine marriage Alas said Emily as these recollections came to her mind and what have I gained by the fortitude I then practised am I happy now He said we should meet no more in happiness but O he little thought his own misconduct would separate us and lead to the very evil he then dreaded Her reflections increased her anguish while she was compelled to acknowledge that the fortitude she had formerly exerted if it had not conducted her to happiness had saved her from irretrievable misfortune from Valancourt himself But in these moments she could not congratulate herself on the prudence that had saved her she could only lament with bitterest anguish the circumstances which had conspired to betray Valancourt into a course of life so different from that which the virtues the tastes and the pursuits of his early years had promised but she still loved him too well to believe that his heart was even now depraved though his conduct had been criminal An observation which had fallen from M saint Aubert more than once now occurred to her This young man said he speaking of Valancourt has never been at Paris a remark that had surprised her at the time it was uttered but which she now understood and she exclaimed sorrowfully O Valancourt if such a friend as my father had been with you at Paris your noble ingenuous nature would not have fallen The sun was now set and recalling her thoughts from their melancholy subject she continued her walk for the pensive shade of twilight was pleasing to her and the nightingales from the surrounding groves began to answer each other in the long drawn plaintive note which always touched her heart while all the fragrance of the flowery thickets that bounded the terrace was awakened by the cool evening air which floated so lightly among their leaves that they scarcely trembled as it passed Emily came at length to the steps of the pavilion that terminated the terrace and where her last interview with Valancourt before her departure from Tholouse had so unexpectedly taken place The door was now shut and she trembled while she hesitated whether to open it but her wish to see again a place which had been the chief scene of her former happiness at length overcoming her reluctance to encounter the painful regret it would renew she entered The room was obscured by a melancholy shade but through the open lattices darkened by the hanging foliage of the vines appeared the dusky landscape the Garonne reflecting the evening light and the west still glowing A chair was placed near one of the balconies as if some person had been sitting there but the other furniture of the pavilion remained exactly as usual and Emily thought it looked as if it had not once been moved since she set out for Italy The silent and deserted air of the place added solemnity to her emotions for she heard only the low whisper of the breeze as it shook the leaves of the vines and the very faint murmur of the Garonne She seated herself in a chair near the lattice and yielded to the sadness of her heart while she recollected the circumstances of her parting interview with Valancourt on this spot It was here too that she had passed some of the happiest hours of her life with him when her aunt favoured the connection for here she had often sat and worked while he conversed or read and she now well remembered with what discriminating judgment with what tempered energy he used to repeat some of the sublimest passages of their favourite authors how often he would pause to admire with her their excellence and with what tender delight he would listen to her remarks and correct her taste And is it possible said Emily as these recollections returned is it possible that a mind so susceptible of whatever is grand and beautiful could stoop to low pursuits and be subdued by frivolous temptations She remembered how often she had seen the sudden tear start in his eye and had heard his voice tremble with emotion while he related any great or benevolent action or repeated a sentiment of the same character And such a mind said she such a heart were to be sacrificed to the habits of a great city These recollections becoming too painful to be endured she abruptly left the pavilion and anxious to escape from the memorials of her departed happiness returned towards the chateau As she passed along the terrace she perceived a person walking with a slow step and a dejected air under the trees at some distance The twilight which was now deep would not allow her to distinguish who it was and she imagined it to be one of the servants till the sound of her steps seeming to reach him he turned half round and she thought she saw Valancourt Whoever it was he instantly struck among the thickets on the left and disappeared while Emily her eyes fixed on the place whence he had vanished and her frame trembling so excessively that she could scarcely support herself remained for some moments unable to quit the spot and scarcely conscious of existence With her recollection her strength returned and she hurried toward the house where she did not venture to enquire who had been in the gardens lest she should betray her emotion and she sat down alone endeavouring to recollect the figure air and features of the person she had just seen Her view of him however had been so transient and the gloom had rendered it so imperfect that she could remember nothing with exactness yet the general appearance of his figure and his abrupt departure made her still believe that this person was Valancourt Sometimes indeed she thought that her fancy which had been occupied by the idea of him had suggested his image to her uncertain sight but this conjecture was fleeting If it was himself whom she had seen she wondered much that he should be at Tholouse and more how he had gained admittance into the garden but as often as her impatience prompted her to enquire whether any stranger had been admitted she was restrained by an unwillingness to betray her doubts and the evening was passed in anxious conjecture and in efforts to dismiss the subject from her thoughts But these endeavours were ineffectual and a thousand inconsistent emotions assailed her whenever she fancied that Valancourt might be near her now she dreaded it to be true and now she feared it to be false and while she constantly tried to persuade herself that she wished the person whom she had seen might not be Valancourt her heart as constantly contradicted her reason The following day was occupied by the visits of several neighbouring families formerly intimate with Madame Montoni who came to condole with Emily on her death to congratulate her upon the acquisition of these estates and to enquire about Montoni and concerning the strange reports they had heard of her own situation all which was done with the utmost decorum and the visitors departed with as much composure as they had arrived Emily was wearied by these formalities and disgusted by the subservient manners of many persons who had thought her scarcely worthy of common attention while she was believed to be a dependant on Madame Montoni Surely said she there is some magic in wealth which can thus make persons pay their court to it when it does not even benefit themselves How strange it is that a fool or a knave with riches should be treated with more respect by the world than a good man or a wise man in poverty It was evening before she was left alone and she then wished to have refreshed her spirits in the free air of her garden but she feared to go thither lest she should meet again the person whom she had seen on the preceding night and he should prove to be Valancourt The suspense and anxiety she suffered on this subject she found all her efforts unable to controul and her secret wish to see Valancourt once more though unseen by him powerfully prompted her to go but prudence and a delicate pride restrained her and she determined to avoid the possibility of throwing herself in his way by forbearing to visit the gardens for several days When after near a week she again ventured thither she made Annette her companion and confined her walk to the lower grounds but often started as the leaves rustled in the breeze imagining that some person was among the thickets and at the turn of every alley she looked forward with apprehensive expectation She pursued her walk thoughtfully and silently for her agitation would not suffer her to converse with Annette to whom however thought and silence were so intolerable that she did not scruple at length to talk to her mistress Dear madam said she why do you start so one would think you knew what has happened What has happened said Emily in a faltering voice and trying to command her emotion The night before last you know madam I know nothing Annette replied her lady in a more hurried voice The night before last madam there was a robber in the garden A robber said Emily in an eager yet doubting tone I suppose he was a robber madam What else could he be Where did you see him Annette rejoined Emily looking round her and turning back towards the chateau It was not I that saw him madam it was Jean the gardener It was twelve o clock at night and as he was coming across the court to go the back way into the house what should he see but somebody walking in the avenue that fronts the garden gate So with that Jean guessed how it was and he went into the house for his gun His gun exclaimed Emily Yes madam his gun and then he came out into the court to watch him Presently he sees him come slowly down the avenue and lean over the garden gate and look up at the house for a long time and I warrant he examined it well and settled what window he should break in at But the gun said Emily the gun Yes madam all in good time Presently Jean says the robber opened the gate and was coming into the court and then he thought proper to ask him his business so he called out again and bade him say who he was and what he wanted But the man would do neither but turned upon his heel and passed into the garden again Jean knew then well enough how it was and so he fired after him Fired exclaimed Emily Yes madam fired off his gun but Holy Virgin what makes you look so pale madam The man was not killed I dare say but if he was his comrades carried him off for when Jean went in the morning to look for the body it was gone and nothing to be seen but a track of blood on the ground Jean followed it that he might find out where the man got into the garden but it was lost in the grass and Annette was interrupted for Emily s spirits died away and she would have fallen to the ground if the girl had not caught her and supported her to a bench close to them When after a long absence her senses returned Emily desired to be led to her apartment and though she trembled with anxiety to enquire further on the subject of her alarm she found herself too ill at present to dare the intelligence which it was possible she might receive of Valancourt Having dismissed Annette that she might weep and think at liberty she endeavoured to recollect the exact air of the person whom she had seen on the terrace and still her fancy gave her the figure of Valancourt She had indeed scarcely a doubt that it was he whom she had seen and at whom the gardener had fired for the manner of the latter person as described by Annette was not that of a robber nor did it appear probable that a robber would have come alone to break into a house so spacious as this When Emily thought herself sufficiently recovered to listen to what Jean might have to relate she sent for him but he could inform her of no circumstance that might lead to a knowledge of the person who had been shot or of the consequence of the wound and after severely reprimanding him for having fired with bullets and ordering diligent enquiry to be made in the neighbourhood for the discovery of the wounded person she dismissed him and herself remained in the same state of terrible suspense All the tenderness she had ever felt for Valancourt was recalled by the sense of his danger and the more she considered the subject the more her conviction strengthened that it was he who had visited the gardens for the purpose of soothing the misery of disappointed affection amidst the scenes of his former happiness Dear madam said Annette when she returned I never saw you so affected before I dare say the man is not killed Emily shuddered and lamented bitterly the rashness of the gardener in having fired I knew you would be angry enough about that madam or I should have told you before and he knew so too for says he Annette say nothing about this to my lady She lies on the other side of the house so did not hear the gun perhaps but she would be angry with me if she knew seeing there is blood But then says he how is one to keep the garden clear if one is afraid to fire at a robber when one sees him No more of this said Emily pray leave me Annette obeyed and Emily returned to the agonizing considerations that had assailed her before but which she at length endeavoured to sooth by a new remark If the stranger was Valancourt it was certain he had come alone and it appeared therefore that he had been able to quit the gardens without assistance a circumstance which did not seem probable had his wound been dangerous With this consideration she endeavoured to support herself during the enquiries that were making by her servants in the neighbourhood but day after day came and still closed in uncertainty concerning this affair and Emily suffering in silence at length drooped and sunk under the pressure of her anxiety She was attacked by a slow fever and when she yielded to the persuasion of Annette to send for medical advice the physicians prescribed little beside air gentle exercise and amusement but how was this last to be obtained She however endeavoured to abstract her thoughts from the subject of her anxiety by employing them in promoting that happiness in others which she had lost herself and when the evening was fine she usually took an airing including in her ride the cottages of some of her tenants on whose condition she made such observations as often enabled her unasked to fulfil their wishes Her indisposition and the business she engaged in relative to this estate had already protracted her stay at Tholouse beyond the period she had formerly fixed for her departure to La Vallee and now she was unwilling to leave the only place where it seemed possible that certainty could be obtained on the subject of her distress But the time was come when her presence was necessary at La Vallee a letter from the Lady Blanche now informing her that the Count and herself being then at the chateau of the Baron saint Foix purposed to visit her at La Vallee on their way home as soon as they should be informed of her arrival there Blanche added that they made this visit with the hope of inducing her to return with them to Chateau le Blanc Emily having replied to the letter of her friend and said that she should be at La Vallee in a few days made hasty preparations for the journey and in thus leaving Tholouse endeavoured to support herself with a belief that if any fatal accident had happened to Valancourt she must in this interval have heard of it On the evening before her departure she went to take leave of the terrace and the pavilion The day had been sultry but a light shower that fell just before sun set had cooled the air and given that soft verdure to the woods and pastures which is so refreshing to the eye while the rain drops still trembling on the shrubs glittered in the last yellow gleam that lighted up the scene and the air was filled with fragrance exhaled by the late shower from herbs and flowers and from the earth itself But the lovely prospect which Emily beheld from the terrace was no longer viewed by her with delight she sighed deeply as her eye wandered over it and her spirits were in a state of such dejection that she could not think of her approaching return to La Vallee without tears and seemed to mourn again the death of her father as if it had been an event of yesterday Having reached the pavilion she seated herself at the open lattice and while her eyes settled on the distant mountains that overlooked Gascony still gleaming on the horizon though the sun had now left the plains below Alas said she I return to your long lost scenes but shall meet no more the parents that were wont to render them delightful no more shall see the smile of welcome or hear the well known voice of fondness all will now be cold and silent in what was once my happy home Tears stole down her cheek as the remembrance of what that home had been returned to her but after indulging her sorrow for some time she checked it accusing herself of ingratitude in forgetting the friends that she possessed while she lamented those that were departed and she at length left the pavilion and the terrace without having observed a shadow of Valancourt or of any other person CHAPTER XI Ah happy hills ah pleasing shade Ah fields belov d in vain Where once my careless childhood stray d A stranger yet to pain I feel the gales that from ye blow A momentary bliss bestow As waving fresh their gladsome wing My weary soul they seem to sooth GRAY On the following morning Emily left Tholouse at an early hour and reached La Vallee about sun set With the melancholy she experienced on the review of a place which had been the residence of her parents and the scene of her earliest delight was mingled after the first shock had subsided a tender and undescribable pleasure For time had so far blunted the acuteness of her grief that she now courted every scene that awakened the memory of her friends in every room where she had been accustomed to see them they almost seemed to live again and she felt that La Vallee was still her happiest home One of the first apartments she visited was that which had been her father s library and here she seated herself in his arm chair and while she contemplated with tempered resignation the picture of past times which her memory gave the tears she shed could scarcely be called those of grief Soon after her arrival she was surprised by a visit from the venerable M Barreaux who came impatiently to welcome the daughter of his late respected neighbour to her long deserted home Emily was comforted by the presence of an old friend and they passed an interesting hour in conversing of former times and in relating some of the circumstances that had occurred to each since they parted The evening was so far advanced when M Barreaux left Emily that she could not visit the garden that night but on the following morning she traced its long regretted scenes with fond impatience and as she walked beneath the groves which her father had planted and where she had so often sauntered in affectionate conversation with him his countenance his smile even the accents of his voice returned with exactness to her fancy and her heart melted to the tender recollections This too was his favourite season of the year at which they had often together admired the rich and variegated tints of these woods and the magical effect of autumnal lights upon the mountains and now the view of these circumstances made memory eloquent As she wandered pensively on she fancied the following address TO AUTUMN Sweet Autumn how thy melancholy grace Steals on my heart as through these shades I wind Sooth d by thy breathing sigh I fondly trace Each lonely image of the pensive mind Lov d scenes lov d friends long lost around me rise And wake the melting thought the tender tear That tear that thought which more than mirth I prize Sweet as the gradual tint that paints thy year Thy farewel smile with fond regret I view Thy beaming lights soft gliding o er the woods Thy distant landscape touch d with yellow hue While falls the lengthen d gleam thy winding floods Now veil d in shade save where the skiff s white sails Swell to the breeze and catch thy streaming ray But now e en now the partial vision fails And the wave smiles as sweeps the cloud away Emblem of life Thus checquer d is its plan Thus joy succeeds to grief thus smiles the varied man One of Emily s earliest enquiries after her arrival at La Vallee was concerning Theresa her father s old servant whom it may be remembered that M Quesnel had turned from the house when it was let without any provision Understanding that she lived in a cottage at no great distance Emily walked thither and on approaching was pleased to see that her habitation was pleasantly situated on a green slope sheltered by a tuft of oaks and had an appearance of comfort and extreme neatness She found the old woman within picking vine stalks who on perceiving her young mistress was nearly overcome with joy Ah my dear young lady said she I thought I should never see you again in this world when I heard you was gone to that outlandish country I have been hardly used since you went I little thought they would have turned me out of my old master s family in my old age Emily lamented the circumstance and then assured her that she would make her latter days comfortable and expressed satisfaction on seeing her in so pleasant an habitation Theresa thanked her with tears adding Yes mademoiselle it is a very comfortable home thanks to the kind friend who took me out of my distress when you was too far off to help me and placed me here I little thought but no more of that And who was this kind friend said Emily whoever it was I shall consider him as mine also Ah mademoiselle that friend forbad me to blazon the good deed I must not say who it was But how you are altered since I saw you last You look so pale now and so thin too but then there is my old master s smile Yes that will never leave you any more than the goodness that used to make him smile Alas a day the poor lost a friend indeed when he died Emily was affected by this mention of her father which Theresa observing changed the subject I heard mademoiselle said she that Madame Cheron married a foreign gentleman after all and took you abroad how does she do Emily now mentioned her death Alas said Theresa if she had not been my master s sister I should never have loved her she was always so cross But how does that dear young gentleman do M Valancourt he was an handsome youth and a good one is he well mademoiselle Emily was much agitated A blessing on him continued Theresa Ah my dear young lady you need not look so shy I know all about it Do you think I do not know that he loves you Why when you was away mademoiselle he used to come to the chateau and walk about it so disconsolate He would go into every room in the lower part of the house and sometimes he would sit himself down in a chair with his arms across and his eyes on the floor and there he would sit and think and think for the hour together He used to be very fond of the south parlour because I told him it used to be yours and there he would stay looking at the pictures which I said you drew and playing upon your lute that hung up by the window and reading in your books till sunset and then he must go back to his brother s chateau And then It is enough Theresa said Emily How long have you lived in this cottage and how can I serve you Will you remain here or return and live with me Nay mademoiselle said Theresa do not be so shy to your poor old servant I am sure it is no disgrace to like such a good young gentleman A deep sigh escaped from Emily Ah how he did love to talk of you I loved him for that Nay for that matter he liked to hear me talk for he did not say much himself But I soon found out what he came to the chateau about Then he would go into the garden and down to the terrace and sit under that great tree there for the day together with one of your books in his hand but he did not read much I fancy for one day I happened to go that way and I heard somebody talking Who can be here says I I am sure I let nobody into the garden but the Chevalier So I walked softly to see who it could be and behold it was the Chevalier himself talking to himself about you And he repeated your name and sighed so and said he had lost you for ever for that you would never return for him I thought he was out in his reckoning there but I said nothing and stole away No more of this trifling said Emily awakening from her reverie it displeases me But when M Quesnel let the chateau I thought it would have broke the Chevalier s heart Theresa said Emily seriously you must name the Chevalier no more Not name him mademoiselle cried Theresa what times are come up now Why I love the Chevalier next to my old master and you mademoiselle Perhaps your love was not well bestowed then replied Emily trying to conceal her tears but however that might be we shall meet no more Meet no more not well bestowed exclaimed Theresa What do I hear No mademoiselle my love was well bestowed for it was the Chevalier Valancourt who gave me this cottage and has supported me in my old age ever since M Quesnel turned me from my master s house The Chevalier Valancourt said Emily trembling extremely Yes mademoiselle he himself though he made me promise not to tell but how could one help when one heard him ill spoken of Ah dear young lady you may well weep if you have behaved unkindly to him for a more tender heart than his never young gentleman had He found me out in my distress when you was too far off to help me and M Quesnel refused to do so and bade me go to service again Alas I was too old for that The Chevalier found me and bought me this cottage and gave me money to furnish it and bade me seek out another poor woman to live with me and he ordered his brother s steward to pay me every quarter that which has supported me in comfort Think then mademoiselle whether I have not reason to speak well of the Chevalier And there are others who could have afforded it better than he and I am afraid he has hurt himself by his generosity for quarter day is gone by long since and no money for me But do not weep so mademoiselle you are not sorry surely to hear of the poor Chevalier s goodness Sorry said Emily and wept the more But how long is it since you have seen him Not this many a day mademoiselle When did you hear of him enquired Emily with increased emotion Alas never since he went away so suddenly into Languedoc and he was but just come from Paris then or I should have seen him I am sure Quarter day is gone by long since and as I said no money for me and I begin to fear some harm has happened to him and if I was not so far from Estuviere and so lame I should have gone to enquire before this time and I have nobody to send so far Emily s anxiety as to the fate of Valancourt was now scarcely endurable and since propriety would not suffer her to send to the chateau of his brother she requested that Theresa would immediately hire some person to go to his steward from herself and when he asked for the quarterage due to her to make enquiries concerning Valancourt But she first made Theresa promise never to mention her name in this affair or ever with that of the Chevalier Valancourt and her former faithfulness to M saint Aubert induced Emily to confide in her assurances Theresa now joyfully undertook to procure a person for this errand and then Emily after giving her a sum of money to supply her with present comforts returned with spirits heavily oppressed to her home lamenting more than ever that an heart possessed of so much benevolence as Valancourt s should have been contaminated by the vices of the world but affected by the delicate affection which his kindness to her old servant expressed for herself CHAPTER XII Light thickens and the crow Makes wing to the rooky wood Good things of day begin to droop and drowze While night s black agents to their preys do rouze MACBETH Meanwhile Count De Villefort and Lady Blanche had passed a pleasant fortnight at the chateau de saint Foix with the Baron and Baroness during which they made frequent excursions among the mountains and were delighted with the romantic wildness of Pyrenean scenery It was with regret that the Count bade adieu to his old friends although with the hope of being soon united with them in one family for it was settled that M saint Foix who now attended them into Gascony should receive the hand of the Lady Blanche upon their arrival at Chateau le Blanc As the road from the Baron s residence to La Vallee was over some of the wildest tract of the Pyrenees and where a carriage wheel had never passed the Count hired mules for himself and his family as well as a couple of stout guides who were well armed informed of all the passes of the mountains and who boasted too that they were acquainted with every brake and dingle in the way could tell the names of all the highest points of this chain of Alps knew every forest that spread along their narrow vallies the shallowest part of every torrent they must cross and the exact distance of every goat herd s and hunter s cabin they should have occasion to pass which last article of learning required no very capacious memory for even such simple inhabitants were but thinly scattered over these wilds The Count left the chateau de saint Foix early in the morning with an intention of passing the night at a little inn upon the mountains about half way to La Vallee of which his guides had informed him and though this was frequented chiefly by Spanish muleteers on their route into France and of course would afford only sorry accommodation the Count had no alternative for it was the only place like an inn on the road After a day of admiration and fatigue the travellers found themselves about sun set in a woody valley overlooked on every side by abrupt heights They had proceeded for many leagues without seeing a human habitation and had only heard now and then at a distance the melancholy tinkling of a sheep bell but now they caught the notes of merry music and presently saw within a little green recess among the rocks a group of mountaineers tripping through a dance The Count who could not look upon the happiness any more than on the misery of others with indifference halted to enjoy this scene of simple pleasure The group before him consisted of French and Spanish peasants the inhabitants of a neighbouring hamlet some of whom were performing a sprightly dance the women with castanets in their hands to the sounds of a lute and a tamborine till from the brisk melody of France the music softened into a slow movement to which two female peasants danced a Spanish Pavan The Count comparing this with the scenes of such gaiety as he had witnessed at Paris where false taste painted the features and while it vainly tried to supply the glow of nature concealed the charms of animation where affectation so often distorted the air and vice perverted the manners sighed to think that natural graces and innocent pleasures flourished in the wilds of solitude while they drooped amidst the concourse of polished society But the lengthening shadows reminded the travellers that they had no time to lose and leaving this joyous group they pursued their way towards the little inn which was to shelter them from the night The rays of the setting sun now threw a yellow gleam upon the forests of pine and chesnut that swept down the lower region of the mountains and gave resplendent tints to the snowy points above But soon even this light faded fast and the scenery assumed a more tremendous appearance invested with the obscurity of twilight Where the torrent had been seen it was now only heard where the wild cliffs had displayed every variety of form and attitude a dark mass of mountains now alone appeared and the vale which far far below had opened its dreadful chasm the eye could no longer fathom A melancholy gleam still lingered on the summits of the highest Alps overlooking the deep repose of evening and seeming to make the stillness of the hour more awful Blanche viewed the scene in silence and listened with enthusiasm to the murmur of the pines that extended in dark lines along the mountains and to the faint voice of the izard among the rocks that came at intervals on the air But her enthusiasm sunk into apprehension when as the shadows deepened she looked upon the doubtful precipice that bordered the road as well as on the various fantastic forms of danger that glimmered through the obscurity beyond it and she asked her father how far they were from the inn and whether he did not consider the road to be dangerous at this late hour The Count repeated the first question to the guides who returned a doubtful answer adding that when it was darker it would be safest to rest till the moon rose It is scarcely safe to proceed now said the Count but the guides assuring him that there was no danger went on Blanche revived by this assurance again indulged a pensive pleasure as she watched the progress of twilight gradually spreading its tints over the woods and mountains and stealing from the eye every minuter feature of the scene till the grand outlines of nature alone remained Then fell the silent dews and every wild flower and aromatic plant that bloomed among the cliffs breathed forth its sweetness then too when the mountain bee had crept into its blossomed bed and the hum of every little insect that had floated gaily in the sun beam was hushed the sound of many streams not heard till now murmured at a distance The bats alone of all the animals inhabiting this region seemed awake and while they flitted across the silent path which Blanche was pursuing she remembered the following lines which Emily had given her TO THE BAT From haunt of man from day s obtrusive glare Thou shroud saint thee in the ruin s ivy d tow r Or in some shadowy glen s romantic bow r Where wizard forms their mystic charms prepare Where Horror lurks and ever boding Care But at the sweet and silent ev ning hour When clos d in sleep is ev ry languid flow r Thou lov saint to sport upon the twilight air Mocking the eye that would thy course pursue In many a wanton round elastic gay Thou flit saint athwart the pensive wand rer s way As his lone footsteps print the mountain dew From Indian isles thou com saint with Summer s car Twilight thy love thy guide her beaming star To a warm imagination the dubious forms that float half veiled in darkness afford a higher delight than the most distinct scenery that the sun can shew While the fancy thus wanders over landscapes partly of its own creation a sweet complacency steals upon the mind and Refines it all to subtlest feeling Bids the tear of rapture roll The distant note of a torrent the weak trembling of the breeze among the woods or the far off sound of a human voice now lost and heard again are circumstances which wonderfully heighten the enthusiastic tone of the mind The young saint Foix who saw the presentations of a fervid fancy and felt whatever enthusiasm could suggest sometimes interrupted the silence which the rest of the party seemed by mutual consent to preserve remarking and pointing out to Blanche the most striking effect of the hour upon the scenery while Blanche whose apprehensions were beguiled by the conversation of her lover yielded to the taste so congenial to his and they conversed in a low restrained voice the effect of the pensive tranquillity which twilight and the scene inspired rather than of any fear that they should be heard But while the heart was thus soothed to tenderness saint Foix gradually mingled with his admiration of the country a mention of his affection and he continued to speak and Blanche to listen till the mountains the woods and the magical illusions of twilight were remembered no more The shadows of evening soon shifted to the gloom of night which was somewhat anticipated by the vapours that gathering fast round the mountains rolled in dark wreaths along their sides and the guides proposed to rest till the moon should rise adding that they thought a storm was coming on As they looked round for a spot that might afford some kind of shelter an object was perceived obscurely through the dusk on a point of rock a little way down the mountain which they imagined to be a hunter s or a shepherd s cabin and the party with cautious steps proceeded towards it Their labour however was not rewarded or their apprehensions soothed for on reaching the object of their search they discovered a monumental cross which marked the spot to have been polluted by murder The darkness would not permit them to read the inscription but the guides knew this to be a cross raised to the memory of a Count de Beliard who had been murdered here by a horde of banditti that had infested this part of the Pyrenees a few years before and the uncommon size of the monument seemed to justify the supposition that it was erected for a person of some distinction Blanche shuddered as she listened to some horrid particulars of the Count s fate which one of the guides related in a low restrained tone as if the sound of his own voice frightened him but while they lingered at the cross attending to his narrative a flash of lightning glanced upon the rocks thunder muttered at a distance and the travellers now alarmed quitted this scene of solitary horror in search of shelter Having regained their former track the guides as they passed on endeavoured to interest the Count by various stories of robbery and even of murder which had been perpetrated in the very places they must unavoidably pass with accounts of their own dauntless courage and wonderful escapes The chief guide or rather he who was the most completely armed drawing forth one of the four pistols that were tucked into his belt swore that it had shot three robbers within the year He then brandished a clasp knife of enormous length and was going to recount the wonderful execution it had done when saint Foix perceiving that Blanche was terrified interrupted him The Count meanwhile secretly laughing at the terrible histories and extravagant boastings of the man resolved to humour him and telling Blanche in a whisper his design began to recount some exploits of his own which infinitely exceeded any related by the guide To these surprising circumstances he so artfully gave the colouring of truth that the courage of the guides was visibly affected by them who continued silent long after the Count had ceased to speak The loquacity of the chief hero thus laid asleep the vigilance of his eyes and ears seemed more thoroughly awakened for he listened with much appearance of anxiety to the deep thunder which murmured at intervals and often paused as the breeze that was now rising rushed among the pines But when he made a sudden halt before a tuft of cork trees that projected over the road and drew forth a pistol before he would venture to brave the banditti which might lurk behind it the Count could no longer refrain from laughter Having now however arrived at a level spot somewhat sheltered from the air by overhanging cliffs and by a wood of larch that rose over the precipice on the left and the guides being yet ignorant how far they were from the inn the travellers determined to rest till the moon should rise or the storm disperse Blanche recalled to a sense of the present moment looked on the surrounding gloom with terror but giving her hand to saint Foix she alighted and the whole party entered a kind of cave if such it could be called which was only a shallow cavity formed by the curve of impending rocks A light being struck a fire was kindled whose blaze afforded some degree of cheerfulness and no small comfort for though the day had been hot the night air of this mountainous region was chilling a fire was partly necessary also to keep off the wolves with which those wilds were infested Provisions being spread upon a projection of the rock the Count and his family partook of a supper which in a scene less rude would certainly have been thought less excellent When the repast was finished saint Foix impatient for the moon sauntered along the precipice to a point that fronted the east but all was yet wrapt in gloom and the silence of night was broken only by the murmuring of woods that waved far below or by distant thunder and now and then by the faint voices of the party he had quitted He viewed with emotions of awful sublimity the long volumes of sulphureous clouds that floated along the upper and middle regions of the air and the lightnings that flashed from them sometimes silently and at others followed by sullen peals of thunder which the mountains feebly prolonged while the whole horizon and the abyss on which he stood were discovered in the momentary light Upon the succeeding darkness the fire which had been kindled in the cave threw a partial gleam illumining some points of the opposite rocks and the summits of pine woods that hung beetling on the cliffs below while their recesses seemed to frown in deeper shade saint Foix stopped to observe the picture which the party in the cave presented where the elegant form of Blanche was finely contrasted by the majestic figure of the Count who was seated by her on a rude stone and each was rendered more impressive by the grotesque habits and strong features of the guides and other attendants who were in the back ground of the piece The effect of the light too was interesting on the surrounding figures it threw a strong though pale gleam and glittered on their bright arms while upon the foliage of a gigantic larch that impended its shade over the cliff above appeared a red dusky tint deepening almost imperceptibly into the blackness of night While saint Foix contemplated the scene the moon broad and yellow rose over the eastern summits from among embattled clouds and shewed dimly the grandeur of the heavens the mass of vapours that rolled half way down the precipice beneath and the doubtful mountains What dreadful pleasure there to stand sublime Like shipwreck d mariner on desert coast And view th enormous waste of vapour tost In billows length ning to th horizon round THE MINSTREL From this romantic reverie he was awakened by the voices of the guides repeating his name which was reverbed from cliff to cliff till an hundred tongues seemed to call him when he soon quieted the fears of the Count and the Lady Blanche by returning to the cave As the storm however seemed approaching they did not quit their place of shelter and the Count seated between his daughter and saint Foix endeavoured to divert the fears of the former and conversed on subjects relating to the natural history of the scene among which they wandered He spoke of the mineral and fossile substances found in the depths of these mountains the veins of marble and granite with which they abounded the strata of shells discovered near their summits many thousand fathom above the level of the sea and at a vast distance from its present shore of the tremendous chasms and caverns of the rocks the grotesque form of the mountains and the various phaenomena that seem to stamp upon the world the history of the deluge From the natural history he descended to the mention of events and circumstances connected with the civil story of the Pyrenees named some of the most remarkable fortresses which France and Spain had erected in the passes of these mountains and gave a brief account of some celebrated sieges and encounters in early times when Ambition first frightened Solitude from these her deep recesses made her mountains which before had echoed only to the torrent s roar tremble with the clang of arms and when man s first footsteps in her sacred haunts had left the print of blood As Blanche sat attentive to the narrative that rendered the scenes doubly interesting and resigned to solemn emotion while she considered that she was on the very ground once polluted by these events her reverie was suddenly interrupted by a sound that came in the wind It was the distant bark of a watch dog The travellers listened with eager hope and as the wind blew stronger fancied that the sound came from no great distance and the guides having little doubt that it proceeded from the inn they were in search of the Count determined to pursue his way The moon now afforded a stronger though still an uncertain light as she moved among broken clouds and the travellers led by the sound recommenced their journey along the brow of the precipice preceded by a single torch that now contended with the moon light for the guides believing they should reach the inn soon after sun set had neglected to provide more In silent caution they followed the sound which was heard but at intervals and which after some time entirely ceased The guides endeavoured however to point their course to the quarter whence it had issued but the deep roaring of a torrent soon seized their attention and presently they came to a tremendous chasm of the mountain which seemed to forbid all further progress Blanche alighted from her mule as did the Count and saint Foix while the guides traversed the edge in search of a bridge which however rude might convey them to the opposite side and they at length confessed what the Count had begun to suspect that they had been for some time doubtful of their way and were now certain only that they had lost it At a little distance was discovered a rude and dangerous passage formed by an enormous pine which thrown across the chasm united the opposite precipices and which had been felled probably by the hunter to facilitate his chace of the izard or the wolf The whole party the guides excepted shuddered at the prospect of crossing this alpine bridge whose sides afforded no kind of defence and from which to fall was to die The guides however prepared to lead over the mules while Blanche stood trembling on the brink and listening to the roar of the waters which were seen descending from rocks above overhung with lofty pines and thence precipitating themselves into the deep abyss where their white surges gleamed faintly in the moon light The poor animals proceeded over this perilous bridge with instinctive caution neither frightened by the noise of the cataract or deceived by the gloom which the impending foliage threw athwart their way It was now that the solitary torch which had been hitherto of little service was found to be an inestimable treasure and Blanche terrified shrinking but endeavouring to re collect all her firmness and presence of mind preceded by her lover and supported by her father followed the red gleam of the torch in safety to the opposite cliff As they went on the heights contracted and formed a narrow pass at the bottom of which the torrent they had just crossed was heard to thunder But they were again cheered by the bark of a dog keeping watch perhaps over the flocks of the mountains to protect them from the nightly descent of the wolves The sound was much nearer than before and while they rejoiced in the hope of soon reaching a place of repose a light was seen to glimmer at a distance It appeared at a height considerably above the level of their path and was lost and seen again as if the waving branches of trees sometimes excluded and then admitted its rays The guides hallooed with all their strength but the sound of no human voice was heard in return and at length as a more effectual means of making themselves known they fired a pistol But while they listened in anxious expectation the noise of the explosion was alone heard echoing among the rocks and it gradually sunk into silence which no friendly hint of man disturbed The light however that had been seen before now became plainer and soon after voices were heard indistinctly on the wind but upon the guides repeating the call the voices suddenly ceased and the light disappeared The Lady Blanche was now almost sinking beneath the pressure of anxiety fatigue and apprehension and the united efforts of the Count and saint Foix could scarcely support her spirits As they continued to advance an object was perceived on a point of rock above which the strong rays of the moon then falling on it appeared to be a watch tower The Count from its situation and some other circumstances had little doubt that it was such and believing that the light had proceeded from thence he endeavoured to re animate his daughter s spirits by the near prospect of shelter and repose which however rude the accommodation a ruined watch tower might afford Numerous watch towers have been erected among the Pyrenees said the Count anxious only to call Blanche s attention from the subject of her fears and the method by which they give intelligence of the approach of the enemy is you know by fires kindled on the summits of these edifices Signals have thus sometimes been communicated from post to post along a frontier line of several hundred miles in length Then as occasion may require the lurking armies emerge from their fortresses and the forests and march forth to defend perhaps the entrance of some grand pass where planting themselves on the heights they assail their astonished enemies who wind along the glen below with fragments of the shattered cliff and pour death and defeat upon them The ancient forts and watch towers overlooking the grand passes of the Pyrenees are carefully preserved but some of those in inferior stations have been suffered to fall into decay and are now frequently converted into the more peaceful habitation of the hunter or the shepherd who after a day of toil retires hither and with his faithful dogs forgets near a cheerful blaze the labour of the chace or the anxiety of collecting his wandering flocks while he is sheltered from the nightly storm But are they always thus peacefully inhabited said the Lady Blanche No replied the Count they are sometimes the asylum of French and Spanish smugglers who cross the mountains with contraband goods from their respective countries and the latter are particularly numerous against whom strong parties of the king s troops are sometimes sent But the desperate resolution of these adventurers who knowing that if they are taken they must expiate the breach of the law by the most cruel death travel in large parties well armed often daunts the courage of the soldiers The smugglers who seek only safety never engage when they can possibly avoid it the military also who know that in these encounters danger is certain and glory almost unattainable are equally reluctant to fight an engagement therefore very seldom happens but when it does it never concludes till after the most desperate and bloody conflict You are inattentive Blanche added the Count I have wearied you with a dull subject but see yonder in the moon light is the edifice we have been in search of and we are fortunate to be so near it before the storm bursts Blanche looking up perceived that they were at the foot of the cliff on whose summit the building stood but no light now issued from it the barking of the dog too had for some time ceased and the guides began to doubt whether this was really the object of their search From the distance at which they surveyed it shewn imperfectly by a cloudy moon it appeared to be of more extent than a single watch tower but the difficulty was how to ascend the height whose abrupt declivities seemed to afford no kind of pathway While the guides carried forward the torch to examine the cliff the Count remaining with Blanche and saint Foix at its foot under the shadow of the woods endeavoured again to beguile the time by conversation but again anxiety abstracted the mind of Blanche and he then consulted apart with saint Foix whether it would be advisable should a path be found to venture to an edifice which might possibly harbour banditti They considered that their own party was not small and that several of them were well armed and after enumerating the dangers to be incurred by passing the night in the open wild exposed perhaps to the effects of a thunder storm there remained not a doubt that they ought to endeavour to obtain admittance to the edifice above at any hazard respecting the inhabitants it might harbour but the darkness and the dead silence that surrounded it appeared to contradict the probability of its being inhabited at all A shout from the guides aroused their attention after which in a few minutes one of the Count s servants returned with intelligence that a path was found and they immediately hastened to join the guides when they all ascended a little winding way cut in the rock among thickets of dwarf wood and after much toil and some danger reached the summit where several ruined towers surrounded by a massy wall rose to their view partially illumined by the moon light The space around the building was silent and apparently forsaken but the Count was cautious Step softly said he in a low voice while we reconnoitre the edifice Having proceeded silently along for some paces they stopped at a gate whose portals were terrible even in ruins and after a moment s hesitation passed on to the court of entrance but paused again at the head of a terrace which branching from it ran along the brow of a precipice Over this rose the main body of the edifice which was now seen to be not a watch tower but one of those ancient fortresses that from age and neglect had fallen to decay Many parts of it however appeared to be still entire it was built of grey stone in the heavy Saxon gothic style with enormous round towers buttresses of proportionable strength and the arch of the large gate which seemed to open into the hall of the fabric was round as was that of a window above The air of solemnity which must so strongly have characterized the pile even in the days of its early strength was now considerably heightened by its shattered battlements and half demolished walls and by the huge masses of ruin scattered in its wide area now silent and grass grown In this court of entrance stood the gigantic remains of an oak that seemed to have flourished and decayed with the building which it still appeared frowningly to protect by the few remaining branches leafless and moss grown that crowned its trunk and whose wide extent told how enormous the tree had been in a former age This fortress was evidently once of great strength and from its situation on a point of rock impending over a deep glen had been of great power to annoy as well as to resist the Count therefore as he stood surveying it was somewhat surprised that it had been suffered ancient as it was to sink into ruins and its present lonely and deserted air excited in his breast emotions of melancholy awe While he indulged for a moment these emotions he thought he heard a sound of remote voices steal upon the stillness from within the building the front of which he again surveyed with scrutinizing eyes but yet no light was visible He now determined to walk round the fort to that remote part of it whence he thought the voices had arisen that he might examine whether any light could be discerned there before he ventured to knock at the gate for this purpose he entered upon the terrace where the remains of cannon were yet apparent in the thick walls but he had not proceeded many paces when his steps were suddenly arrested by the loud barking of a dog within and which he fancied to be the same whose voice had been the means of bringing the travellers thither It now appeared certain that the place was inhabited and the Count returned to consult again with saint Foix whether he should try to obtain admittance for its wild aspect had somewhat shaken his former resolution but after a second consultation he submitted to the considerations which before determined him and which were strengthened by the discovery of the dog that guarded the fort as well as by the stillness that pervaded it He therefore ordered one of his servants to knock at the gate who was advancing to obey him when a light appeared through the loop hole of one of the towers and the Count called loudly but receiving no answer he went up to the gate himself and struck upon it with an iron pointed pole which had assisted him to climb the steep When the echoes had ceased that this blow had awakened the renewed barking and there were now more than one dog was the only sound that was heard The Count stepped back a few paces to observe whether the light was in the tower and perceiving that it was gone he returned to the portal and had lifted the pole to strike again when again he fancied he heard the murmur of voices within and paused to listen He was confirmed in the supposition but they were too remote to be heard otherwise than in a murmur and the Count now let the pole fall heavily upon the gate when almost immediately a profound silence followed It was apparent that the people within had heard the sound and their caution in admitting strangers gave him a favourable opinion of them They are either hunters or shepherds said he who like ourselves have probably sought shelter from the night within these walls and are fearful of admitting strangers lest they should prove robbers I will endeavour to remove their fears So saying he called aloud We are friends who ask shelter from the night In a few moments steps were heard within which approached and a voice then enquired Who calls Friends repeated the Count open the gates and you shall know more Strong bolts were now heard to be undrawn and a man armed with a hunting spear appeared What is it you want at this hour said he The Count beckoned his attendants and then answered that he wished to enquire the way to the nearest cabin Are you so little acquainted with these mountains said the man as not to know that there is none within several leagues I cannot shew you the way you must seek it there s a moon Saying this he was closing the gate and the Count was turning away half disappointed and half afraid when another voice was heard from above and on looking up he saw a light and a man s face at the grate of the portal Stay friend you have lost your way said the voice You are hunters I suppose like ourselves I will be with you presently The voice ceased and the light disappeared Blanche had been alarmed by the appearance of the man who had opened the gate and she now entreated her father to quit the place but the Count had observed the hunter s spear which he carried and the words from the tower encouraged him to await the event The gate was soon opened and several men in hunters habits who had heard above what had passed below appeared and having listened some time to the Count told him he was welcome to rest there for the night They then pressed him with much courtesy to enter and to partake of such fare as they were about to sit down to The Count who had observed them attentively while they spoke was cautious and somewhat suspicious but he was also weary fearful of the approaching storm and of encountering alpine heights in the obscurity of night being likewise somewhat confident in the strength and number of his attendants he after some further consideration determined to accept the invitation With this resolution he called his servants who advancing round the tower behind which some of them had silently listened to this conference followed their Lord the Lady Blanche and saint Foix into the fortress The strangers led them on to a large and rude hall partially seen by a fire that blazed at its extremity round which four men in the hunter s dress were seated and on the hearth were several dogs stretched in sleep In the middle of the hall stood a large table and over the fire some part of an animal was boiling As the Count approached the men arose and the dogs half raising themselves looked fiercely at the strangers but on hearing their masters voices kept their postures on the hearth Blanche looked round this gloomy and spacious hall then at the men and to her father who smiling cheerfully at her addressed himself to the hunters This is an hospitable hearth said he the blaze of a fire is reviving after having wandered so long in these dreary wilds Your dogs are tired what success have you had Such as we usually have replied one of the men who had been seated in the hall we kill our game with tolerable certainty These are fellow hunters said one of the men who had brought the Count hither that have lost their way and I have told them there is room enough in the fort for us all Very true very true replied his companion What luck have you had in the chace brothers We have killed two izards and that you will say is pretty well You mistake friend said the Count we are not hunters but travellers but if you will admit us to hunters fare we shall be well contented and will repay your kindness Sit down then brother said one of the men Jacques lay more fuel on the fire the kid will soon be ready bring a seat for the lady too Ma amselle will you taste our brandy it is true Barcelona and as bright as ever flowed from a keg Blanche timidly smiled and was going to refuse when her father prevented her by taking with a good humoured air the glass offered to his daughter and Mons saint Foix who was seated next her pressed her hand and gave her an encouraging look but her attention was engaged by a man who sat silently by the fire observing saint Foix with a steady and earnest eye You lead a jolly life here said the Count The life of a hunter is a pleasant and a healthy one and the repose is sweet which succeeds to your labour Yes replied one of his hosts our life is pleasant enough We live here only during the summer and autumnal months in winter the place is dreary and the swoln torrents that descend from the heights put a stop to the chace Tis a life of liberty and enjoyment said the Count I should like to pass a month in your way very well We find employment for our guns too said a man who stood behind the Count here are plenty of birds of delicious flavour that feed upon the wild thyme and herbs that grow in the vallies Now I think of it there is a brace of birds hung up in the stone gallery go fetch them Jacques we will have them dressed The Count now made enquiry concerning the method of pursuing the chace among the rocks and precipices of these romantic regions and was listening to a curious detail when a horn was sounded at the gate Blanche looked timidly at her father who continued to converse on the subject of the chace but whose countenance was somewhat expressive of anxiety and who often turned his eyes towards that part of the hall nearest the gate The horn sounded again and a loud halloo succeeded These are some of our companions returned from their day s labour said a man going lazily from his seat towards the gate and in a few minutes two men appeared each with a gun over his shoulder and pistols in his belt What cheer my lads what cheer said they as they approached What luck returned their companions have you brought home your supper You shall have none else Hah who the devil have you brought home said they in bad Spanish on perceiving the Count s party are they from France or Spain where did you meet with them They met with us and a merry meeting too replied his companion aloud in good French This chevalier and his party had lost their way and asked a night s lodging in the fort The others made no reply but threw down a kind of knapsack and drew forth several brace of birds The bag sounded heavily as it fell to the ground and the glitter of some bright metal within glanced on the eye of the Count who now surveyed with a more enquiring look the man that held the knapsack He was a tall robust figure of a hard countenance and had short black hair curling in his neck Instead of the hunter s dress he wore a faded military uniform sandals were laced on his broad legs and a kind of short trowsers hung from his waist On his head he wore a leathern cap somewhat resembling in shape an ancient Roman helmet but the brows that scowled beneath it would have characterized those of the barbarians who conquered Rome rather than those of a Roman soldier The Count at length turned away his eyes and remained silent and thoughtful till again raising them he perceived a figure standing in an obscure part of the hall fixed in attentive gaze on saint Foix who was conversing with Blanche and did not observe this but the Count soon after saw the same man looking over the shoulder of the soldier as attentively at himself He withdrew his eye when that of the Count met it who felt mistrust gathering fast upon his mind but feared to betray it in his countenance and forcing his features to assume a smile addressed Blanche on some indifferent subject When he again looked round he perceived that the soldier and his companion were gone The man who was called Jacques now returned from the stone gallery A fire is lighted there said he and the birds are dressing the table too is spread there for that place is warmer than this His companions approved of the removal and invited their guests to follow to the gallery of whom Blanche appeared distressed and remained seated and saint Foix looked at the Count who said he preferred the comfortable blaze of the fire he was then near The hunters however commended the warmth of the other apartment and pressed his removal with such seeming courtesy that the Count half doubting and half fearful of betraying his doubts consented to go The long and ruinous passages through which they went somewhat daunted him but the thunder which now burst in loud peals above made it dangerous to quit this place of shelter and he forbore to provoke his conductors by shewing that he distrusted them The hunters led the way with a lamp the Count and saint Foix who wished to please their hosts by some instances of familiarity carried each a seat and Blanche followed with faltering steps As she passed on part of her dress caught on a nail in the wall and while she stopped somewhat too scrupulously to disengage it the Count who was talking to saint Foix and neither of whom observed the circumstance followed their conductor round an abrupt angle of the passage and Blanche was left behind in darkness The thunder prevented them from hearing her call but having disengaged her dress she quickly followed as she thought the way they had taken A light that glimmered at a distance confirmed this belief and she proceeded towards an open door whence it issued conjecturing the room beyond to be the stone gallery the men had spoken of Hearing voices as she advanced she paused within a few paces of the chamber that she might be certain whether she was right and from thence by the light of a lamp that hung from the ceiling observed four men seated round a table over which they leaned in apparent consultation In one of them she distinguished the features of him whom she had observed gazing at saint Foix with such deep attention and who was now speaking in an earnest though restrained voice till one of his companions seeming to oppose him they spoke together in a loud and harsher tone Blanche alarmed by perceiving that neither her father or saint Foix were there and terrified at the fierce countenances and manners of these men was turning hastily from the chamber to pursue her search of the gallery when she heard one of the men say Let all dispute end here Who talks of danger Follow my advice and there will be none secure THEM and the rest are an easy prey Blanche struck with these words paused a moment to hear more There is nothing to be got by the rest said one of his companions I am never for blood when I can help it dispatch the two others and our business is done the rest may go May they so exclaimed the first ruffian with a tremendous oath What to tell how we have disposed of their masters and to send the king s troops to drag us to the wheel You was always a choice adviser I warrant we have not yet forgot saint Thomas s eve last year Blanche s heart now sunk with horror Her first impulse was to retreat from the door but when she would have gone her trembling frame refused to support her and having tottered a few paces to a more obscure part of the passage she was compelled to listen to the dreadful councils of those who she was no longer suffered to doubt were banditti In the next moment she heard the following words Why you would not murder the whole GANG I warrant our lives are as good as theirs replied his comrade If we don t kill them they will hang us better they should die than we be hanged Better better cried his comrades To commit murder is a hopeful way of escaping the gallows said the first ruffian many an honest fellow has run his head into the noose that way though There was a pause of some moments during which they appeared to be considering Confound those fellows exclaimed one of the robbers impatiently they ought to have been here by this time they will come back presently with the old story and no booty if they were here our business would be plain and easy I see we shall not be able to do the business to night for our numbers are not equal to the enemy and in the morning they will be for marching off and how can we detain them without force I have been thinking of a scheme that will do said one of his comrades if we can dispatch the two chevaliers silently it will be easy to master the rest That s a plausible scheme in good faith said another with a smile of scorn If I can eat my way through the prison wall I shall be at liberty How can we dispatch them SILENTLY By poison replied his companions Well said that will do said the second ruffian that will give a lingering death too and satisfy my revenge These barons shall take care how they again tempt our vengeance I knew the son the moment I saw him said the man whom Blanche had observed gazing on saint Foix though he does not know me the father I had almost forgotten Well you may say what you will said the third ruffian but I don t believe he is the Baron and I am as likely to know as any of you for I was one of them that attacked him with our brave lads that suffered And was not I another said the first ruffian I tell you he is the Baron but what does it signify whether he is or not shall we let all this booty go out of our hands It is not often we have such luck at this While we run the chance of the wheel for smuggling a few pounds of tobacco to cheat the king s manufactory and of breaking our necks down the precipices in the chace of our food and now and then rob a brother smuggler or a straggling pilgrim of what scarcely repays us the powder we fire at them shall we let such a prize as this go Why they have enough about them to keep us for I am not for that I am not for that replied the third robber let us make the most of them only if this is the Baron I should like to have a flash the more at him for the sake of our brave comrades that he brought to the gallows Aye aye flash as much as you will rejoined the first man but I tell you the Baron is a taller man Confound your quibbling said the second ruffian shall we let them go or not If we stay here much longer they will take the hint and march off without our leave Let them be who they will they are rich or why all those servants Did you see the ring he you call the Baron had on his finger it was a diamond but he has not got it on now he saw me looking at it I warrant and took it off Aye and then there is the picture did you see that She has not taken that off observed the first ruffian it hangs at her neck if it had not sparkled so I should not have found it out for it was almost hid by her dress those are diamonds too and a rare many of them there must be to go round such a large picture But how are we to manage this business said the second ruffian let us talk of that there is no fear of there being booty enough but how are we to secure it Aye aye said his comrades let us talk of that and remember no time is to be lost I am still for poison observed the third but consider their number why there are nine or ten of them and armed too when I saw so many at the gate I was not for letting them in you know nor you either I thought they might be some of our enemies replied the second I did not so much mind numbers But you must mind them now rejoined his comrade or it will be worse for you We are not more than six and how can we master ten by open force I tell you we must give some of them a dose and the rest may then be managed I ll tell you a better way rejoined the other impatiently draw closer Blanche who had listened to this conversation in an agony which it would be impossible to describe could no longer distinguish what was said for the ruffians now spoke in lowered voices but the hope that she might save her friends from the plot if she could find her way quickly to them suddenly re animated her spirits and lent her strength enough to turn her steps in search of the gallery Terror however and darkness conspired against her and having moved a few yards the feeble light that issued from the chamber no longer even contended with the gloom and her foot stumbling over a step that crossed the passage she fell to the ground The noise startled the banditti who became suddenly silent and then all rushed to the passage to examine whether any person was there who might have overheard their councils Blanche saw them approaching and perceived their fierce and eager looks but before she could raise herself they discovered and seized her and as they dragged her towards the chamber they had quitted her screams drew from them horrible threatenings Having reached the room they began to consult what they should do with her Let us first know what she had heard said the chief robber How long have you been in the passage lady and what brought you there Let us first secure that picture said one of his comrades approaching the trembling Blanche Fair lady by your leave that picture is mine come surrender it or I shall seize it Blanche entreating their mercy immediately gave up the miniature while another of the ruffians fiercely interrogated her concerning what she had overheard of their conversation when her confusion and terror too plainly telling what her tongue feared to confess the ruffians looked expressively upon one another and two of them withdrew to a remote part of the room as if to consult further These are diamonds by saint Peter exclaimed the fellow who had been examining the miniature and here is a very pretty picture too faith as handsome a young chevalier as you would wish to see by a summer s sun Lady this is your spouse I warrant for it is the spark that was in your company just now Blanche sinking with terror conjured him to have pity on her and delivering him her purse promised to say nothing of what had passed if he would suffer her to return to her friends He smiled ironically and was going to reply when his attention was called off by a distant noise and while he listened he grasped the arm of Blanche more firmly as if he feared she would escape from him and she again shrieked for help The approaching sounds called the ruffians from the other part of the chamber We are betrayed said they but let us listen a moment perhaps it is only our comrades come in from the mountains and if so our work is sure listen A distant discharge of shot confirmed this supposition for a moment but in the next the former sounds drawing nearer the clashing of swords mingled with the voices of loud contention and with heavy groans were distinguished in the avenue leading to the chamber While the ruffians prepared their arms they heard themselves called by some of their comrades afar off and then a shrill horn was sounded without the fortress a signal it appeared they too well understood for three of them leaving the Lady Blanche to the care of the fourth instantly rushed from the chamber While Blanche trembling and nearly fainting was supplicating for release she heard amid the tumult that approached the voice of saint Foix and she had scarcely renewed her shriek when the door of the room was thrown open and he appeared much disfigured with blood and pursued by several ruffians Blanche neither saw or heard any more her head swam her sight failed and she became senseless in the arms of the robber who had detained her When she recovered she perceived by the gloomy light that trembled round her that she was in the same chamber but neither the Count saint Foix or any other person appeared and she continued for some time entirely still and nearly in a state of stupefaction But the dreadful images of the past returning she endeavoured to raise herself that she might seek her friends when a sullen groan at a little distance reminded her of saint Foix and of the condition in which she had seen him enter this room then starting from the floor by a sudden effort of horror she advanced to the place whence the sound had proceeded where a body was lying stretched upon the pavement and where by the glimmering light of a lamp she discovered the pale and disfigured countenance of saint Foix Her horrors at that moment may be easily imagined He was speechless his eyes were half closed and on the hand which she grasped in the agony of despair cold damps had settled While she vainly repeated his name and called for assistance steps approached and a person entered the chamber who she soon perceived was not the Count her father but what was her astonishment when supplicating him to give his assistance to saint Foix she discovered Ludovico He scarcely paused to recognise her but immediately bound up the wounds of the Chevalier and perceiving that he had fainted probably from loss of blood ran for water but he had been absent only a few moments when Blanche heard other steps approaching and while she was almost frantic with apprehension of the ruffians the light of a torch flashed upon the walls and then Count De Villefort appeared with an affrighted countenance and breathless with impatience calling upon his daughter At the sound of his voice she rose and ran to his arms while he letting fall the bloody sword he held pressed her to his bosom in a transport of gratitude and joy and then hastily enquired for saint Foix who now gave some signs of life Ludovico soon after returning with water and brandy the former was applied to his lips and the latter to his temples and hands and Blanche at length saw him unclose his eyes and then heard him enquire for her but the joy she felt on this occasion was interrupted by new alarms when Ludovico said it would be necessary to remove Mons saint Foix immediately and added The banditti that are out my Lord were expected home an hour ago and they will certainly find us if we delay That shrill horn they know is never sounded by their comrades but on most desperate occasions and it echoes among the mountains for many leagues round I have known them brought home by its sound even from the Pied de Melicant Is any body standing watch at the great gate my Lord Nobody replied the Count the rest of my people are now scattered about I scarcely know where Go Ludovico collect them together and look out yourself and listen if you hear the feet of mules Ludovico then hurried away and the Count consulted as to the means of removing saint Foix who could not have borne the motion of a mule even if his strength would have supported him in the saddle While the Count was telling that the banditti whom they had found in the fort were secured in the dungeon Blanche observed that he was himself wounded and that his left arm was entirely useless but he smiled at her anxiety assuring her the wound was trifling The Count s servants except two who kept watch at the gate now appeared and soon after Ludovico I think I hear mules coming along the glen my Lord said he but the roaring of the torrent below will not let me be certain however I have brought what will serve the Chevalier he added shewing a bear s skin fastened to a couple of long poles which had been adapted for the purpose of bringing home such of the banditti as happened to be wounded in their encounters Ludovico spread it on the ground and placing the skins of several goats upon it made a kind of bed into which the Chevalier who was however now much revived was gently lifted and the poles being raised upon the shoulders of the guides whose footing among these steeps could best be depended upon he was borne along with an easy motion Some of the Count s servants were also wounded but not materially and their wounds being bound up they now followed to the great gate As they passed along the hall a loud tumult was heard at some distance and Blanche was terrified It is only those villains in the dungeon my Lady said Ludovico They seem to be bursting it open said the Count No my Lord replied Ludovico it has an iron door we have nothing to fear from them but let me go first and look out from the rampart They quickly followed him and found their mules browsing before the gates where the party listened anxiously but heard no sound except that of the torrent below and of the early breeze sighing among the branches of the old oak that grew in the court and they were now glad to perceive the first tints of dawn over the mountain tops When they had mounted their mules Ludovico undertaking to be their guide led them by an easier path than that by which they had formerly ascended into the glen We must avoid that valley to the east my Lord said he or we may meet the banditti they went out that way in the morning The travellers soon after quitted this glen and found themselves in a narrow valley that stretched towards the north west The morning light upon the mountains now strengthened fast and gradually discovered the green hillocks that skirted the winding feet of the cliffs tufted with cork tree and ever green oak The thunder clouds being dispersed had left the sky perfectly serene and Blanche was revived by the fresh breeze and by the view of verdure which the late rain had brightened Soon after the sun arose when the dripping rocks with the shrubs that fringed their summits and many a turfy slope below sparkled in his rays A wreath of mist was seen floating along the extremity of the valley but the gale bore it before the travellers and the sun beams gradually drew it up towards the summit of the mountains They had proceeded about a league when saint Foix having complained of extreme faintness they stopped to give him refreshment and that the men who bore him might rest Ludovico had brought from the fort some flasks of rich Spanish wine which now proved a reviving cordial not only to saint Foix but to the whole party though to him it gave only temporary relief for it fed the fever that burned in his veins and he could neither disguise in his countenance the anguish he suffered or suppress the wish that he was arrived at the inn where they had designed to pass the preceding night While they thus reposed themselves under the shade of the dark green pines the Count desired Ludovico to explain shortly by what means he had disappeared from the north apartment how he came into the hands of the banditti and how he had contributed so essentially to serve him and his family for to him he justly attributed their present deliverance Ludovico was going to obey him when suddenly they heard the echo of a pistol shot from the way they had passed and they rose in alarm hastily to pursue their route CHAPTER XIII Ah why did Fate his steps decoy In stormy paths to roam Remote from all congenial joy BEATTIE Emily mean while was still suffering anxiety as to the fate of Valancourt but Theresa having at length found a person whom she could entrust on her errand to the steward informed her that the messenger would return on the following day and Emily promised to be at the cottage Theresa being too lame to attend her In the evening therefore Emily set out alone for the cottage with a melancholy foreboding concerning Valancourt while perhaps the gloom of the hour might contribute to depress her spirits It was a grey autumnal evening towards the close of the season heavy mists partially obscured the mountains and a chilling breeze that sighed among the beech woods strewed her path with some of their last yellow leaves These circling in the blast and foretelling the death of the year gave an image of desolation to her mind and in her fancy seemed to announce the death of Valancourt Of this she had indeed more than once so strong a presentiment that she was on the point of returning home feeling herself unequal to an encounter with the certainty she anticipated but contending with her emotions she so far commanded them as to be able to proceed While she walked mournfully on gazing on the long volumes of vapour that poured upon the sky and watching the swallows tossed along the wind now disappearing among tempestuous clouds and then emerging for a moment in circles upon the calmer air the afflictions and vicissitudes of her late life seemed pourtrayed in these fleeting images thus had she been tossed upon the stormy sea of misfortune for the last year with but short intervals of peace if peace that could be called which was only the delay of evils And now when she had escaped from so many dangers was become independent of the will of those who had oppressed her and found herself mistress of a large fortune now when she might reasonably have expected happiness she perceived that she was as distant from it as ever She would have accused herself of weakness and ingratitude in thus suffering a sense of the various blessings she possessed to be overcome by that of a single misfortune had this misfortune affected herself alone but when she had wept for Valancourt even as living tears of compassion had mingled with those of regret and while she lamented a human being degraded to vice and consequently to misery reason and humanity claimed these tears and fortitude had not yet taught her to separate them from those of love in the present moments however it was not the certainty of his guilt but the apprehension of his death of a death also to which she herself however innocently appeared to have been in some degree instrumental that oppressed her This fear increased as the means of certainty concerning it approached and when she came within view of Theresa s cottage she was so much disordered and her resolution failed her so entirely that unable to proceed she rested on a bank beside her path where as she sat the wind that groaned sullenly among the lofty branches above seemed to her melancholy imagination to bear the sounds of distant lamentation and in the pauses of the gust she still fancied she heard the feeble and far off notes of distress Attention convinced her that this was no more than fancy but the increasing gloom which seemed the sudden close of day soon warned her to depart and with faltering steps she again moved toward the cottage Through the casement appeared the cheerful blaze of a wood fire and Theresa who had observed Emily approaching was already at the door to receive her It is a cold evening madam said she storms are coming on and I thought you would like a fire Do take this chair by the hearth Emily thanking her for this consideration sat down and then looking in her face on which the wood fire threw a gleam she was struck with its expression and unable to speak sunk back in her chair with a countenance so full of woe that Theresa instantly comprehended the occasion of it but she remained silent Ah said Emily at length it is unnecessary for me to ask the result of your enquiry your silence and that look sufficiently explain it he is dead Alas my dear young lady replied Theresa while tears filled her eyes this world is made up of trouble the rich have their share as well as the poor But we must all endeavour to bear what Heaven pleases He is dead then interrupted Emily Valancourt is dead A well a day I fear he is replied Theresa You fear said Emily do you only fear Alas yes madam I fear he is neither the steward or any of the Epourville family have heard of him since he left Languedoc and the Count is in great affliction about him for he says he was always punctual in writing but that now he has not received a line from him since he left Languedoc he appointed to be at home three weeks ago but he has neither come or written and they fear some accident has befallen him Alas that ever I should live to cry for his death I am old and might have died without being missed but he Emily was faint and asked for some water and Theresa alarmed by the voice in which she spoke hastened to her assistance and while she held the water to Emily s lips continued My dear young mistress do not take it so to heart the Chevalier may be alive and well for all this let us hope the best O no I cannot hope said Emily I am acquainted with circumstances that will not suffer me to hope I am somewhat better now and can hear what you have to say Tell me I entreat the particulars of what you know Stay till you are a little better mademoiselle you look sadly O no Theresa tell me all while I have the power to hear it said Emily tell me all I conjure you Well madam I will then but the steward did not say much for Richard says he seemed shy of talking about Mons Valancourt and what he gathered was from Gabriel one of the servants who said he had heard it from my lord s gentleman What did he hear said Emily Why madam Richard has but a bad memory and could not remember half of it and if I had not asked him a great many questions I should have heard little indeed But he says that Gabriel said that he and all the other servants were in great trouble about M Valancourt for that he was such a kind young gentleman they all loved him as well as if he had been their own brother and now to think what was become of him For he used to be so courteous to them all and if any of them had been in fault M Valancourt was the first to persuade my lord to forgive them And then if any poor family was in distress M Valancourt was the first too to relieve them though some folks not a great way off could have afforded that much better than he And then said Gabriel he was so gentle to every body and for all he had such a noble look with him he never would command and call about him as some of your quality people do and we never minded him the less for that Nay says Gabriel for that matter we minded him the more and would all have run to obey him at a word sooner than if some folks had told us what to do at full length aye and were more afraid of displeasing him too than of them that used rough words to us Emily who no longer considered it to be dangerous to listen to praise bestowed on Valancourt did not attempt to interrupt Theresa but sat attentive to her words though almost overwhelmed with grief My Lord continued Theresa frets about M Valancourt sadly and the more because they say he had been rather harsh against him lately Gabriel says he had it from my Lord s valet that M Valancourt had COMPORTED himself wildly at Paris and had spent a great deal of money more a great deal than my Lord liked for he loves money better than M Valancourt who had been led astray sadly Nay for that matter M Valancourt had been put into prison at Paris and my Lord says Gabriel refused to take him out and said he deserved to suffer and when old Gregoire the butler heard of this he actually bought a walking stick to take with him to Paris to visit his young master but the next thing we hear is that M Valancourt is coming home O it was a joyful day when he came but he was sadly altered and my Lord looked very cool upon him and he was very sad indeed And soon after he went away again into Languedoc and since that time we have never seen him Theresa paused and Emily sighing deeply remained with her eyes fixed upon the floor without speaking After a long pause she enquired what further Theresa had heard Yet why should I ask she added what you have already told is too much O Valancourt thou art gone forever gone and I I have murdered thee These words and the countenance of despair which accompanied them alarmed Theresa who began to fear that the shock of the intelligence Emily had just received had affected her senses My dear young lady be composed said she and do not say such frightful words You murder M Valancourt dear heart Emily replied only by a heavy sigh Dear lady it breaks my heart to see you look so said Theresa do not sit with your eyes upon the ground and all so pale and melancholy it frightens me to see you Emily was still silent and did not appear to hear any thing that was said to her Besides mademoiselle continued Theresa M Valancourt may be alive and merry yet for what we know At the mention of his name Emily raised her eyes and fixed them in a wild gaze upon Theresa as if she was endeavouring to understand what had been said Aye my dear lady said Theresa mistaking the meaning of this considerate air M Valancourt may be alive and merry yet On the repetition of these words Emily comprehended their import but instead of producing the effect intended they seemed only to heighten her distress She rose hastily from her chair paced the little room with quick steps and often sighing deeply clasped her hands and shuddered Meanwhile Theresa with simple but honest affection endeavoured to comfort her put more wood on the fire stirred it up into a brighter blaze swept the hearth set the chair which Emily had left in a warmer situation and then drew forth from a cupboard a flask of wine It is a stormy night madam said she and blows cold do come nearer the fire and take a glass of this wine it will comfort you as it has done me often and often for it is not such wine as one gets every day it is rich Languedoc and the last of six flasks that M Valancourt sent me the night before he left Gascony for Paris They have served me ever since as cordials and I never drink it but I think of him and what kind words he said to me when he gave them Theresa says he you are not young now and should have a glass of good wine now and then I will send you a few flasks and when you taste them you will sometimes remember me your friend Yes those were his very words me your friend Emily still paced the room without seeming to hear what Theresa said who continued speaking And I have remembered him often enough poor young gentleman for he gave me this roof for a shelter and that which has supported me Ah he is in heaven with my blessed master if ever saint was Theresa s voice faltered she wept and set down the flask unable to pour out the wine Her grief seemed to recall Emily from her own who went towards her but then stopped and having gazed on her for a moment turned suddenly away as if overwhelmed by the reflection that it was Valancourt whom Theresa lamented While she yet paced the room the still soft note of an oboe or flute was heard mingling with the blast the sweetness of which affected Emily s spirits she paused a moment in attention the tender tones as they swelled along the wind till they were lost again in the ruder gust came with a plaintiveness that touched her heart and she melted into tears Aye said Theresa drying her eyes there is Richard our neighbour s son playing on the oboe it is sad enough to hear such sweet music now Emily continued to weep without replying He often plays of an evening added Theresa and sometimes the young folks dance to the sound of his oboe But dear young lady do not cry so and pray take a glass of this wine continued she pouring some into a glass and handing it to Emily who reluctantly took it Taste it for M Valancourt s sake said Theresa as Emily lifted the glass to her lips for he gave it me you know madam Emily s hand trembled and she spilt the wine as she withdrew it from her lips For whose sake who gave the wine said she in a faltering voice M Valancourt dear lady I knew you would be pleased with it It is the last flask I have left Emily set the wine upon the table and burst into tears while Theresa disappointed and alarmed tried to comfort her but she only waved her hand entreated she might be left alone and wept the more A knock at the cottage door prevented Theresa from immediately obeying her mistress and she was going to open it when Emily checking her requested she would not admit any person but afterwards recollecting that she had ordered her servant to attend her home she said it was only Philippe and endeavoured to restrain her tears while Theresa opened the door A voice that spoke without drew Emily s attention She listened turned her eyes to the door when a person now appeared and immediately a bright gleam that flashed from the fire discovered Valancourt Emily on perceiving him started from her chair trembled and sinking into it again became insensible to all around her A scream from Theresa now told that she knew Valancourt whom her imperfect sight and the duskiness of the place had prevented her from immediately recollecting but his attention was immediately called from her to the person whom he saw falling from a chair near the fire and hastening to her assistance he perceived that he was supporting Emily The various emotions that seized him upon thus unexpectedly meeting with her from whom he had believed he had parted for ever and on beholding her pale and lifeless in his arms may perhaps be imagined though they could neither be then expressed or now described any more than Emily s sensations when at length she unclosed her eyes and looking up again saw Valancourt The intense anxiety with which he regarded her was instantly changed to an expression of mingled joy and tenderness as his eye met hers and he perceived that she was reviving But he could only exclaim Emily as he silently watched her recovery while she averted her eye and feebly attempted to withdraw her hand but in these the first moments which succeeded to the pangs his supposed death had occasioned her she forgot every fault which had formerly claimed indignation and beholding Valancourt such as he had appeared when he won her early affection she experienced emotions of only tenderness and joy This alas was but the sunshine of a few short moments recollections rose like clouds upon her mind and darkening the illusive image that possessed it she again beheld Valancourt degraded Valancourt unworthy of the esteem and tenderness she had once bestowed upon him her spirits faltered and withdrawing her hand she turned from him to conceal her grief while he yet more embarrassed and agitated remained silent A sense of what she owed to herself restrained her tears and taught her soon to overcome in some degree the emotions of mingled joy and sorrow that contended at her heart as she rose and having thanked him for the assistance he had given her bade Theresa good evening As she was leaving the cottage Valancourt who seemed suddenly awakened as from a dream entreated in a voice that pleaded powerfully for compassion a few moments attention Emily s heart perhaps pleaded as powerfully but she had resolution enough to resist both together with the clamorous entreaties of Theresa that she would not venture home alone in the dark and had already opened the cottage door when the pelting storm compelled her to obey their requests Silent and embarrassed she returned to the fire while Valancourt with increasing agitation paced the room as if he wished yet feared to speak and Theresa expressed without restraint her joy and wonder upon seeing him Dear heart sir said she I never was so surprised and overjoyed in my life We were in great tribulation before you came for we thought you was dead and were talking and lamenting about you just when you knocked at the door My young mistress there was crying fit to break her heart Emily looked with much displeasure at Theresa but before she could speak Valancourt unable to repress the emotion which Theresa s imprudent discovery occasioned exclaimed O my Emily am I then still dear to you Did you indeed honour me with a thought a tear O heavens you weep you weep now Theresa sir said Emily with a reserved air and trying to conquer her tears has reason to remember you with gratitude and she was concerned because she had not lately heard of you Allow me to thank you for the kindness you have shewn her and to say that since I am now upon the spot she must not be further indebted to you Emily said Valancourt no longer master of his emotions is it thus you meet him whom once you meant to honour with your hand thus you meet him who has loved you suffered for you Yet what do I say Pardon me pardon me mademoiselle saint Aubert I know not what I utter I have no longer any claim upon your remembrance I have forfeited every pretension to your esteem your love Yes let me not forget that I once possessed your affections though to know that I have lost them is my severest affliction Affliction do I call it that is a term of mildness Dear heart said Theresa preventing Emily from replying talk of once having her affections Why my dear young lady loves you now better than she does any body in the whole world though she pretends to deny it This is insupportable said Emily Theresa you know not what you say Sir if you respect my tranquillity you will spare me from the continuance of this distress I do respect your tranquillity too much voluntarily to interrupt it replied Valancourt in whose bosom pride now contended with tenderness and will not be a voluntary intruder I would have entreated a few moments attention yet I know not for what purpose You have ceased to esteem me and to recount to you my sufferings will degrade me more without exciting even your pity Yet I have been O Emily I am indeed very wretched added Valancourt in a voice that softened from solemnity into grief What is my dear young master going out in all this rain said Theresa No he shall not stir a step Dear dear to see how gentlefolks can afford to throw away their happiness Now if you were poor people there would be none of this To talk of unworthiness and not caring about one another when I know there are not such a kind hearted lady and gentleman in the whole province nor any that love one another half so well if the truth was spoken Emily in extreme vexation now rose from her chair I must be gone said she the storm is over Stay Emily stay mademoiselle saint Aubert said Valancourt summoning all his resolution I will no longer distress you by my presence Forgive me that I did not sooner obey you and if you can sometimes pity one who in losing you has lost all hope of peace May you be happy Emily however wretched I remain happy as my fondest wish would have you His voice faltered with the last words and his countenance changed while with a look of ineffable tenderness and grief he gazed upon her for an instant and then quitted the cottage Dear heart dear heart cried Theresa following him to the door why Monsieur Valancourt how it rains what a night is this to turn him out in Why it will give him his death and it was but now you was crying mademoiselle because he was dead Well young ladies do change their mind in a minute as one may say Emily made no reply for she heard not what was said while lost in sorrow and thought she remained in her chair by the fire with her eyes fixed and the image of Valancourt still before them M Valancourt is sadly altered madam said Theresa he looks so thin to what he used to do and so melancholy and then he wears his arm in a sling Emily raised her eyes at these words for she had not observed this last circumstance and she now did not doubt that Valancourt had received the shot of her gardener at Tholouse with this conviction her pity for him returning she blamed herself for having occasioned him to leave the cottage during the storm Soon after her servants arrived with the carriage and Emily having censured Theresa for her thoughtless conversation to Valancourt and strictly charging her never to repeat any hints of the same kind to him withdrew to her home thoughtful and disconsolate Meanwhile Valancourt had returned to a little inn of the village whither he had arrived only a few moments before his visit to Theresa s cottage on the way from Tholouse to the chateau of the Count de Duvarney where he had not been since he bade adieu to Emily at Chateau le Blanc in the neighbourhood of which he had lingered for a considerable time unable to summon resolution enough to quit a place that contained the object most dear to his heart There were times indeed when grief and despair urged him to appear again before Emily and regardless of his ruined circumstances to renew his suit Pride however and the tenderness of his affection which could not long endure the thought of involving her in his misfortunes at length so far triumphed over passion that he relinquished this desperate design and quitted Chateau le Blanc But still his fancy wandered among the scenes which had witnessed his early love and on his way to Gascony he stopped at Tholouse where he remained when Emily arrived concealing yet indulging his melancholy in the gardens where he had formerly passed with her so many happy hours often recurring with vain regret to the evening before her departure for Italy when she had so unexpectedly met him on the terrace and endeavouring to recall to his memory every word and look which had then charmed him the arguments he had employed to dissuade her from the journey and the tenderness of their last farewel In such melancholy recollections he had been indulging when Emily unexpectedly arrived to him on this very terrace the evening after her arrival at Tholouse His emotions on thus seeing her can scarcely be imagined but he so far overcame the first promptings of love that he forbore to discover himself and abruptly quitted the gardens Still however the vision he had seen haunted his mind he became more wretched than before and the only solace of his sorrow was to return in the silence of the night to follow the paths which he believed her steps had pressed during the day and to watch round the habitation where she reposed It was in one of these mournful wanderings that he had received by the fire of the gardener who mistook him for a robber a wound in his arm which had detained him at Tholouse till very lately under the hands of a surgeon There regardless of himself and careless of his friends whose late unkindness had urged him to believe that they were indifferent as to his fate he remained without informing them of his situation and now being sufficiently recovered to bear travelling he had taken La Vallee in his way to Estuviere the Count s residence partly for the purpose of hearing of Emily and of being again near her and partly for that of enquiring into the situation of poor old Theresa who he had reason to suppose had been deprived of her stipend small as it was and which enquiry had brought him to her cottage when Emily happened to be there This unexpected interview which had at once shewn him the tenderness of her love and the strength of her resolution renewed all the acuteness of the despair that had attended their former separation and which no effort of reason could teach him in these moments to subdue Her image her look the tones of her voice all dwelt on his fancy as powerfully as they had late appeared to his senses and banished from his heart every emotion except those of love and despair Before the evening concluded he returned to Theresa s cottage that he might hear her talk of Emily and be in the place where she had so lately been The joy felt and expressed by that faithful servant was quickly changed to sorrow when she observed at one moment his wild and phrensied look and at another the dark melancholy that overhung him After he had listened and for a considerable time to all she had to relate concerning Emily he gave Theresa nearly all the money he had about him though she repeatedly refused it declaring that her mistress had amply supplied her wants and then drawing a ring of value from his finger he delivered it her with a solemn charge to present it to Emily of whom he entreated as a last favour that she would preserve it for his sake and sometimes when she looked upon it remember the unhappy giver Theresa wept as she received the ring but it was more from sympathy than from any presentiment of evil and before she could reply Valancourt abruptly left the cottage She followed him to the door calling upon his name and entreating him to return but she received no answer and saw him no more CHAPTER XIV Call up him that left half told The story of Cambuscan bold MILTON On the following morning as Emily sat in the parlour adjoining the library reflecting on the scene of the preceding night Annette rushed wildly into the room and without speaking sunk breathless into a chair It was some time before she could answer the anxious enquiries of Emily as to the occasion of her emotion but at length she exclaimed I have seen his ghost madam I have seen his ghost Who do you mean said Emily with extreme impatience It came in from the hall madam continued Annette as I was crossing to the parlour Who are you speaking of repeated Emily Who came in from the hall It was dressed just as I have seen him often and often added Annette Ah who could have thought Emily s patience was now exhausted and she was reprimanding her for such idle fancies when a servant entered the room and informed her that a stranger without begged leave to speak with her It immediately occurred to Emily that this stranger was Valancourt and she told the servant to inform him that she was engaged and could not see any person The servant having delivered his message returned with one from the stranger urging the first request and saying that he had something of consequence to communicate while Annette who had hitherto sat silent and amazed now started up and crying It is Ludovico it is Ludovico ran out of the room Emily bade the servant follow her and if it really was Ludovico to shew him into the parlour In a few minutes Ludovico appeared accompanied by Annette who as joy rendered her forgetful of all rules of decorum towards her mistress would not suffer any person to be heard for some time but herself Emily expressed surprise and satisfaction on seeing Ludovico in safety and the first emotions increased when he delivered letters from Count De Villefort and the Lady Blanche informing her of their late adventure and of their present situation at an inn among the Pyrenees where they had been detained by the illness of Mons saint Foix and the indisposition of Blanche who added that the Baron saint Foix was just arrived to attend his son to his chateau where he would remain till the perfect recovery of his wounds and then return to Languedoc but that her father and herself purposed to be at La Vallee on the following day She added that Emily s presence would be expected at the approaching nuptials and begged she would be prepared to proceed in a few days to Chateau le Blanc For an account of Ludovico s adventure she referred her to himself and Emily though much interested concerning the means by which he had disappeared from the north apartments had the forbearance to suspend the gratification of her curiosity till he had taken some refreshment and had conversed with Annette whose joy on seeing him in safety could not have been more extravagant had he arisen from the grave Meanwhile Emily perused again the letters of her friends whose expressions of esteem and kindness were very necessary consolations to her heart awakened as it was by the late interview to emotions of keener sorrow and regret The invitation to Chateau le Blanc was pressed with so much kindness by the Count and his daughter who strengthened it by a message from the Countess and the occasion of it was so important to her friend that Emily could not refuse to accept it nor though she wished to remain in the quiet shades of her native home could she avoid perceiving the impropriety of remaining there alone since Valancourt was again in the neighbourhood Sometimes too she thought that change of scenery and the society of her friends might contribute more than retirement to restore her to tranquillity When Ludovico again appeared she desired him to give a detail of his adventure in the north apartments and to tell by what means he became a companion of the banditti with whom the Count had found him He immediately obeyed while Annette who had not yet had leisure to ask him many questions on the subject prepared to listen with a countenance of extreme curiosity venturing to remind her lady of her incredulity concerning spirits in the castle of Udolpho and of her own sagacity in believing in them while Emily blushing at the consciousness of her late credulity observed that if Ludovico s adventure could justify Annette s superstition he had probably not been here to relate it Ludovico smiled at Annette and bowed to Emily and then began as follows You may remember madam that on the night when I sat up in the north chamber my lord the Count and Mons Henri accompanied me thither and that while they remained there nothing happened to excite any alarm When they were gone I made a fire in the bed room and not being inclined to sleep I sat down on the hearth with a book I had brought with me to divert my mind I confess I did sometimes look round the chamber with something like apprehension O very like it I dare say interrupted Annette and I dare say too if the truth was known you shook from head to foot Not quite so bad as that replied Ludovico smiling but several times as the wind whistled round the castle and shook the old casements I did fancy I heard odd noises and once or twice I got up and looked about me but nothing was to be seen except the grim figures in the tapestry which seemed to frown upon me as I looked at them I had sat thus for above an hour continued Ludovico when again I thought I heard a noise and glanced my eyes round the room to discover what it came from but not perceiving any thing I began to read again and when I had finished the story I was upon I felt drowsy and dropped asleep But presently I was awakened by the noise I had heard before and it seemed to come from that part of the chamber where the bed stood and then whether it was the story I had been reading that affected my spirits or the strange reports that had been spread of these apartments I don t know but when I looked towards the bed again I fancied I saw a man s face within the dusky curtains At the mention of this Emily trembled and looked anxiously remembering the spectacle she had herself witnessed there with Dorothee I confess madam my heart did fail me at that instant continued Ludovico but a return of the noise drew my attention from the bed and I then distinctly heard a sound like that of a key turning in a lock but what surprised me more was that I saw no door where the sound seemed to come from In the next moment however the arras near the bed was slowly lifted and a person appeared behind it entering from a small door in the wall He stood for a moment as if half retreating with his head bending under the arras which concealed the upper part of his face except his eyes scowling beneath the tapestry as he held it and then while he raised it higher I saw the face of another man behind looking over his shoulder I know not how it was but though my sword was upon the table before me I had not the power just then to seize it but sat quite still watching them with my eyes half shut as if I was asleep I suppose they thought me so and were debating what they should do for I heard them whisper and they stood in the same posture for the value of a minute and then I thought I perceived other faces in the duskiness beyond the door and heard louder whispers This door surprises me said Emily because I understood that the Count had caused the arras to be lifted and the walls examined suspecting that they might have concealed a passage through which you had departed It does not appear so extraordinary to me madam replied Ludovico that this door should escape notice because it was formed in a narrow compartment which appeared to be part of the outward wall and if the Count had not passed over it he might have thought it was useless to search for a door where it seemed as if no passage could communicate with one but the truth was that the passage was formed within the wall itself But to return to the men whom I saw obscurely beyond the door and who did not suffer me to remain long in suspense concerning their design They all rushed into the room and surrounded me though not before I had snatched up my sword to defend myself But what could one man do against four They soon disarmed me and having fastened my arms and gagged my mouth forced me through the private door leaving my sword upon the table to assist as they said those who should come in the morning to look for me in fighting against the ghosts They then led me through many narrow passages cut as I fancied in the walls for I had never seen them before and down several flights of steps till we came to the vaults underneath the castle and then opening a stone door which I should have taken for the wall itself we went through a long passage and down other steps cut in the solid rock when another door delivered us into a cave After turning and twining about for some time we reached the mouth of it and I found myself on the sea beach at the foot of the cliffs with the chateau above A boat was in waiting into which the ruffians got forcing me along with them and we soon reached a small vessel that was at anchor where other men appeared when setting me aboard two of the fellows who had seized me followed and the other two rowed back to the shore while we set sail I soon found out what all this meant and what was the business of these men at the chateau We landed in Rousillon and after lingering several days about the shore some of their comrades came down from the mountains and carried me with them to the fort where I remained till my Lord so unexpectedly arrived for they had taken good care to prevent my running away having blindfolded me during the journey and if they had not done this I think I never could have found my road to any town through the wild country we traversed After I reached the fort I was watched like a prisoner and never suffered to go out without two or three companions and I became so weary of life that I often wished to get rid of it Well but they let you talk said Annette they did not gagg you after they got you away from the chateau so I don t see what reason there was to be so very weary of living to say nothing about the chance you had of seeing me again Ludovico smiled and Emily also who enquired what was the motive of these men for carrying him off I soon found out madam resumed Ludovico that they were pirates who had during many years secreted their spoil in the vaults of the castle which being so near the sea suited their purpose well To prevent detection they had tried to have it believed that the chateau was haunted and having discovered the private way to the north apartments which had been shut up ever since the death of the lady marchioness they easily succeeded The housekeeper and her husband who were the only persons that had inhabited the castle for some years were so terrified by the strange noises they heard in the nights that they would live there no longer a report soon went abroad that it was haunted and the whole country believed this the more readily I suppose because it had been said that the lady marchioness had died in a strange way and because my lord never would return to the place afterwards But why said Emily were not these pirates contented with the cave why did they think it necessary to deposit their spoil in the castle The cave madam replied Ludovico was open to any body and their treasures would not long have remained undiscovered there but in the vaults they were secure so long as the report prevailed of their being haunted Thus then it appears that they brought at midnight the spoil they took on the seas and kept it till they had opportunities of disposing of it to advantage The pirates were connected with Spanish smugglers and banditti who live among the wilds of the Pyrenees and carry on various kinds of traffic such as nobody would think of and with this desperate horde of banditti I remained till my lord arrived I shall never forget what I felt when I first discovered him I almost gave him up for lost but I knew that if I shewed myself the banditti would discover who he was and probably murder us all to prevent their secret in the chateau being detected I therefore kept out of my lord s sight but had a strict watch upon the ruffians and determined if they offered him or his family violence to discover myself and fight for our lives Soon after I overheard some of them laying a most diabolical plan for the murder and plunder of the whole party when I contrived to speak to some of my lord s attendants telling them what was going forward and we consulted what was best to be done meanwhile my lord alarmed at the absence of the Lady Blanche demanded her and the ruffians having given some unsatisfactory answer my lord and Mons saint Foix became furious so then we thought it a good time to discover the plot and rushing into the chamber I called out Treachery my lord count defend yourself His lordship and the chevalier drew their swords directly and a hard battle we had but we conquered at last as madam you are already informed of by my Lord Count This is an extraordinary adventure said Emily and much praise is due Ludovico to your prudence and intrepidity There are some circumstances however concerning the north apartments which still perplex me but perhaps you may be able to explain them Did you ever hear the banditti relate any thing extraordinary of these rooms No madam replied Ludovico I never heard them speak about the rooms except to laugh at the credulity of the old housekeeper who once was very near catching one of the pirates it was since the Count arrived at the chateau he said and he laughed heartily as he related the trick he had played off A blush overspread Emily s cheek and she impatiently desired Ludovico to explain himself Why my lady said he as this fellow was one night in the bed room he heard somebody approaching through the next apartment and not having time to lift up the arras and unfasten the door he hid himself in the bed just by There he lay for some time in as great a fright I suppose As you was in interrupted Annette when you sat up so boldly to watch by yourself Aye said Ludovico in as great a fright as he ever made any body else suffer and presently the housekeeper and some other person came up to the bed when he thinking they were going to examine it bethought him that his only chance of escaping detection was by terrifying them so he lifted up the counterpane but that did not do till he raised his face above it and then they both set off he said as if they had seen the devil and he got out of the rooms undiscovered Emily could not forbear smiling at this explanation of the deception which had given her so much superstitious terror and was surprised that she could have suffered herself to be thus alarmed till she considered that when the mind has once begun to yield to the weakness of superstition trifles impress it with the force of conviction Still however she remembered with awe the mysterious music which had been heard at midnight near Chateau le Blanc and she asked Ludovico if he could give any explanation of it but he could not I only know madam he added that it did not belong to the pirates for I have heard them laugh about it and say they believed the devil was in league with them there Yes I will answer for it he was said Annette her countenance brightening I was sure all along that he or his spirits had something to do with the north apartments and now you see madam I am right at last It cannot be denied that his spirits were very busy in that part of the chateau replied Emily smiling But I am surprised Ludovico that these pirates should persevere in their schemes after the arrival of the Count what could they expect but certain detection I have reason to believe madam replied Ludovico that it was their intention to persevere no longer than was necessary for the removal of the stores which were deposited in the vaults and it appeared that they had been employed in doing so from within a short period after the Count s arrival but as they had only a few hours in the night for this business and were carrying on other schemes at the same time the vaults were not above half emptied when they took me away They gloried exceedingly in this opportunity of confirming the superstitious reports that had been spread of the north chambers were careful to leave every thing there as they had found it the better to promote the deception and frequently in their jocose moods would laugh at the consternation which they believed the inhabitants of the castle had suffered upon my disappearing and it was to prevent the possibility of my betraying their secret that they had removed me to such a distance From that period they considered the chateau as nearly their own but I found from the discourse of their comrades that though they were cautious at first in shewing their power there they had once very nearly betrayed themselves Going one night as was their custom to the north chambers to repeat the noises that had occasioned such alarm among the servants they heard as they were about to unfasten the secret door voices in the bed room My lord has since told me that himself and M Henri were then in the apartment and they heard very extraordinary sounds of lamentation which it seems were made by these fellows with their usual design of spreading terror and my lord has owned he then felt somewhat more than surprise but as it was necessary to the peace of his family that no notice should be taken he was silent on the subject and enjoined silence to his son Emily recollecting the change that had appeared in the spirits of the Count after the night when he had watched in the north room now perceived the cause of it and having made some further enquiries upon this strange affair she dismissed Ludovico and went to give orders for the accommodation of her friends on the following day In the evening Theresa lame as she was came to deliver the ring with which Valancourt had entrusted her and when she presented it Emily was much affected for she remembered to have seen him wear it often in happier days She was however much displeased that Theresa had received it and positively refused to accept it herself though to have done so would have afforded her a melancholy pleasure Theresa entreated expostulated and then described the distress of Valancourt when he had given the ring and repeated the message with which he had commissioned her to deliver it and Emily could not conceal the extreme sorrow this recital occasioned her but wept and remained lost in thought Alas my dear young lady said Theresa why should all this be I have known you from your infancy and it may well be supposed I love you as if you was my own and wish as much to see you happy M Valancourt to be sure I have not known so long but then I have reason to love him as though he was my own son I know how well you love one another or why all this weeping and wailing Emily waved her hand for Theresa to be silent who disregarding the signal continued And how much you are alike in your tempers and ways and that if you were married you would be the happiest couple in the whole province then what is there to prevent your marrying Dear dear to see how some people fling away their happiness and then cry and lament about it just as if it was not their own doing and as if there was more pleasure in wailing and weeping than in being at peace Learning to be sure is a fine thing but if it teaches folks no better than that why I had rather be without it if it would teach them to be happier I would say something to it then it would be learning and wisdom too Age and long services had given Theresa a privilege to talk but Emily now endeavoured to check her loquacity and though she felt the justness of some of her remarks did not choose to explain the circumstances that had determined her conduct towards Valancourt She therefore only told Theresa that it would much displease her to hear the subject renewed that she had reasons for her conduct which she did not think it proper to mention and that the ring must be returned with an assurance that she could not accept it with propriety and at the same time she forbade Theresa to repeat any future message from Valancourt as she valued her esteem and kindness Theresa was afflicted and made another attempt though feeble to interest her for Valancourt but the unusual displeasure expressed in Emily s countenance soon obliged her to desist and she departed in wonder and lamentation To relieve her mind in some degree from the painful recollections that intruded upon it Emily busied herself in preparations for the journey into Languedoc and while Annette who assisted her spoke with joy and affection of the safe return of Ludovico she was considering how she might best promote their happiness and determined if it appeared that his affection was as unchanged as that of the simple and honest Annette to give her a marriage portion and settle them on some part of her estate These considerations led her to the remembrance of her father s paternal domain which his affairs had formerly compelled him to dispose of to M Quesnel and which she frequently wished to regain because saint Aubert had lamented that the chief lands of his ancestors had passed into another family and because they had been his birth place and the haunt of his early years To the estate at Tholouse she had no peculiar attachment and it was her wish to dispose of this that she might purchase her paternal domains if M Quesnel could be prevailed on to part with them which as he talked much of living in Italy did not appear very improbable CHAPTER XV Sweet is the breath of vernal shower The bees collected treasures sweet Sweet music s melting fall but sweeter yet The still small voice of gratitude GRAY On the following day the arrival of her friend revived the drooping Emily and La Vallee became once more the scene of social kindness and of elegant hospitality Illness and the terror she had suffered had stolen from Blanche much of her sprightliness but all her affectionate simplicity remained and though she appeared less blooming she was not less engaging than before The unfortunate adventure on the Pyrenees had made the Count very anxious to reach home and after little more than a week s stay at La Vallee Emily prepared to set out with her friends for Languedoc assigning the care of her house during her absence to Theresa On the evening preceding her departure this old servant brought again the ring of Valancourt and with tears entreated her mistress to receive it for that she had neither seen or heard of M Valancourt since the night when he delivered it to her As she said this her countenance expressed more alarm than she dared to utter but Emily checking her own propensity to fear considered that he had probably returned to the residence of his brother and again refusing to accept the ring bade Theresa preserve it till she saw him which with extreme reluctance she promised to do On the following day Count De Villefort with Emily and the Lady Blanche left La Vallee and on the ensuing evening arrived at the Chateau le Blanc where the Countess Henri and M Du Pont whom Emily was surprised to find there received them with much joy and congratulation She was concerned to observe that the Count still encouraged the hopes of his friend whose countenance declared that his affection had suffered no abatement from absence and was much distressed when on the second evening after her arrival the Count having withdrawn her from the Lady Blanche with whom she was walking renewed the subject of M Du Pont s hopes The mildness with which she listened to his intercessions at first deceiving him as to her sentiments he began to believe that her affection for Valancourt being overcome she was at length disposed to think favourably of M Du Pont and when she afterwards convinced him of his mistake he ventured in the earnestness of his wish to promote what he considered to be the happiness of two persons whom he so much esteemed gently to remonstrate with her on thus suffering an ill placed affection to poison the happiness of her most valuable years Observing her silence and the deep dejection of her countenance he concluded with saying I will not say more now but I will still believe my dear Mademoiselle saint Aubert that you will not always reject a person so truly estimable as my friend Du Pont He spared her the pain of replying by leaving her and she strolled on somewhat displeased with the Count for having persevered to plead for a suit which she had repeatedly rejected and lost amidst the melancholy recollections which this topic had revived till she had insensibly reached the borders of the woods that screened the monastery of saint Clair when perceiving how far she had wandered she determined to extend her walk a little farther and to enquire about the abbess and some of her friends among the nuns Though the evening was now drawing to a close she accepted the invitation of the friar who opened the gate and anxious to meet some of her old acquaintances proceeded towards the convent parlour As she crossed the lawn that sloped from the front of the monastery towards the sea she was struck with the picture of repose exhibited by some monks sitting in the cloisters which extended under the brow of the woods that crowned this eminence where as they meditated at this twilight hour holy subjects they sometimes suffered their attention to be relieved by the scene before them nor thought it profane to look at nature now that it had exchanged the brilliant colours of day for the sober hue of evening Before the cloisters however spread an ancient chesnut whose ample branches were designed to screen the full magnificence of a scene that might tempt the wish to worldly pleasures but still beneath the dark and spreading foliage gleamed a wide extent of ocean and many a passing sail while to the right and left thick woods were seen stretching along the winding shores So much as this had been admitted perhaps to give to the secluded votary an image of the dangers and vicissitudes of life and to console him now that he had renounced its pleasures by the certainty of having escaped its evils As Emily walked pensively along considering how much suffering she might have escaped had she become a votaress of the order and remained in this retirement from the time of her father s death the vesper bell struck up and the monks retired slowly toward the chapel while she pursuing her way entered the great hall where an unusual silence seemed to reign The parlour too which opened from it she found vacant but as the evening bell was sounding she believed the nuns had withdrawn into the chapel and sat down to rest for a moment before she returned to the chateau where however the increasing gloom made her now anxious to be Not many minutes had elapsed before a nun entering in haste enquired for the abbess and was retiring without recollecting Emily when she made herself known and then learned that a mass was going to be performed for the soul of sister Agnes who had been declining for some time and who was now believed to be dying Of her sufferings the sister gave a melancholy account and of the horrors into which she had frequently started but which had now yielded to a dejection so gloomy that neither the prayers in which she was joined by the sisterhood or the assurances of her confessor had power to recall her from it or to cheer her mind even with a momentary gleam of comfort To this relation Emily listened with extreme concern and recollecting the frenzied manners and the expressions of horror which she had herself witnessed of Agnes together with the history that sister Frances had communicated her compassion was heightened to a very painful degree As the evening was already far advanced Emily did not now desire to see her or to join in the mass and after leaving many kind remembrances with the nun for her old friends she quitted the monastery and returned over the cliffs towards the chateau meditating upon what she had just heard till at length she forced her mind upon less interesting subjects The wind was high and as she drew near the chateau she often paused to listen to its awful sound as it swept over the billows that beat below or groaned along the surrounding woods and while she rested on a cliff at a short distance from the chateau and looked upon the wide waters seen dimly beneath the last shade of twilight she thought of the following address TO THE WINDS Viewless through heaven s vast vault your course ye steer Unknown from whence ye come or whither go Mysterious pow rs I hear ye murmur low Till swells your loud gust on my startled ear And awful seems to say some God is near I love to list your midnight voices float In the dread storm that o er the ocean rolls And while their charm the angry wave controuls Mix with its sullen roar and sink remote Then rising in the pause a sweeter note The dirge of spirits who your deeds bewail A sweeter note oft swells while sleeps the gale But soon ye sightless pow rs your rest is o er Solemn and slow ye rise upon the air Speak in the shrouds and bid the sea boy fear And the faint warbled dirge is heard no more Oh then I deprecate your awful reign The loud lament yet bear not on your breath Bear not the crash of bark far on the main Bear not the cry of men who cry in vain The crew s dread chorus sinking into death Oh give not these ye pow rs I ask alone As rapt I climb these dark romantic steeps The elemental war the billow s moan I ask the still sweet tear that listening Fancy weeps

none	none	 On the following evening the view of the convent towers rising among the shadowy woods reminded Emily of the nun whose condition had so much affected her and anxious to know how she was as well as to see some of her former friends she and the Lady Blanche extended their walk to the monastery At the gate stood a carriage which from the heat of the horses appeared to have just arrived but a more than common stillness pervaded the court and the cloisters through which Emily and Blanche passed in their way to the great hall where a nun who was crossing to the stair case replied to the enquiries of the former that sister Agnes was still living and sensible but that it was thought she could not survive the night In the parlour they found several of the boarders who rejoiced to see Emily and told her many little circumstances that had happened in the convent since her departure and which were interesting to her only because they related to persons whom she had regarded with affection While they thus conversed the abbess entered the room and expressed much satisfaction at seeing Emily but her manner was unusually solemn and her countenance dejected Our house said she after the first salutations were over is truly a house of mourning a daughter is now paying the debt of nature You have heard perhaps that our daughter Agnes is dying 
3379_132601_000006_000000	train-clean-360	Emily expressed her sincere concern 
3379_132601_000007_000000	train-clean-360	 Her death presents to us a great and awful lesson continued the abbess let us read it and profit by it let it teach us to prepare ourselves for the change that awaits us all 
none	none	You are young and have it yet in your power to secure the peace that passeth all understanding the peace of conscience Preserve it in your youth that it may comfort you in age for vain alas and imperfect are the good deeds of our latter years if those of our early life have been evil Emily would have said that good deeds she hoped were never vain but she considered that it was the abbess who spoke and she remained silent The latter days of Agnes resumed the abbess have been exemplary would they might atone for the errors of her former ones Her sufferings now alas are great let us believe that they will make her peace hereafter I have left her with her confessor and a gentleman whom she has long been anxious to see and who is just arrived from Paris They I hope will be able to administer the repose which her mind has hitherto wanted Emily fervently joined in the wish During her illness she has sometimes named you resumed the abbess perhaps it would comfort her to see you when her present visitors have left her we will go to her chamber if the scene will not be too melancholy for your spirits But indeed to such scenes however painful we ought to accustom ourselves for they are salutary to the soul and prepare us for what we are ourselves to suffer Emily became grave and thoughtful for this conversation brought to her recollection the dying moments of her beloved father and she wished once more to weep over the spot where his remains were buried During the silence which followed the abbess speech many minute circumstances attending his last hours occurred to her his emotion on perceiving himself to be in the neighbourhood of Chateau le Blanc his request to be interred in a particular spot in the church of this monastery and the solemn charge he had delivered to her to destroy certain papers without examining them She recollected also the mysterious and horrible words in those manuscripts upon which her eye had involuntarily glanced and though they now and indeed whenever she remembered them revived an excess of painful curiosity concerning their full import and the motives for her father s command it was ever her chief consolation that she had strictly obeyed him in this particular Little more was said by the abbess who appeared too much affected by the subject she had lately left to be willing to converse and her companions had been for some time silent from the same cause when this general reverie was interrupted by the entrance of a stranger Monsieur Bonnac who had just quitted the chamber of sister Agnes He appeared much disturbed but Emily fancied that his countenance had more the expression of horror than of grief Having drawn the abbess to a distant part of the room he conversed with her for some time during which she seemed to listen with earnest attention and he to speak with caution and a more than common degree of interest When he had concluded he bowed silently to the rest of the company and quitted the room The abbess soon after proposed going to the chamber of sister Agnes to which Emily consented though not without some reluctance and Lady Blanche remained with the boarders below At the door of the chamber they met the confessor whom as he lifted up his head on their approach Emily observed to be the same that had attended her dying father but he passed on without noticing her and they entered the apartment where on a mattress was laid sister Agnes with one nun watching in the chair beside her Her countenance was so much changed that Emily would scarcely have recollected her had she not been prepared to do so it was ghastly and overspread with gloomy horror her dim and hollow eyes were fixed on a crucifix which she held upon her bosom and she was so much engaged in thought as not to perceive the abbess and Emily till they stood at the bed side Then turning her heavy eyes she fixed them in wild horror upon Emily and screaming exclaimed Ah that vision comes upon me in my dying hours Emily started back in terror and looked for explanation to the abbess who made her a signal not to be alarmed and calmly said to Agnes Daughter I have brought Mademoiselle saint Aubert to visit you I thought you would be glad to see her Agnes made no reply but still gazing wildly upon Emily exclaimed It is her very self Oh there is all that fascination in her look which proved my destruction What would you have what is it you came to demand Retribution It will soon be yours it is yours already How many years have passed since last I saw you My crime is but as yesterday Yet I am grown old beneath it while you are still young and blooming blooming as when you forced me to commit that most abhorred deed O could I once forget it yet what would that avail the deed is done Emily extremely shocked would now have left the room but the abbess taking her hand tried to support her spirits and begged she would stay a few moments when Agnes would probably be calm whom now she tried to sooth But the latter seemed to disregard her while she still fixed her eyes on Emily and added What are years of prayers and repentance they cannot wash out the foulness of murder Yes murder Where is he where is he Look there look there see where he stalks along the room Why do you come to torment me now continued Agnes while her straining eyes were bent on air why was not I punished before O do not frown so sternly

none	none	til she herself Why do you look so piteously upon me and smile too smile on me What groan was that Agnes sunk down apparently lifeless and Emily unable to support herself leaned against the bed while the abbess and the attendant nun were applying the usual remedies to Agnes Peace said the abbess when Emily was going to speak the delirium is going off she will soon revive When was she thus before daughter Not of many weeks madam replied the nun but her spirits have been much agitated by the arrival of the gentleman she wished so much to see Yes observed the abbess that has undoubtedly occasioned this paroxysm of frenzy When she is better we will leave her to repose Emily very readily consented but though she could now give little assistance she was unwilling to quit the chamber while any might be necessary When Agnes recovered her senses she again fixed her eyes on Emily but their wild expression was gone and a gloomy melancholy had succeeded It was some moments before she recovered sufficient spirits to speak she then said feebly The likeness is wonderful surely it must be something more than fancy Tell me I conjure you she added addressing Emily though your name is saint Aubert are you not the daughter of the Marchioness What Marchioness said Emily in extreme surprise for she had imagined from the calmness of Agnes s manner that her intellects were restored The abbess gave her a significant glance but she repeated the question What Marchioness exclaimed Agnes I know but of one the Marchioness de Villeroi Emily remembering the emotion of her late father upon the unexpected mention of this lady and his request to be laid near to the tomb of the Villerois now felt greatly interested and she entreated Agnes to explain the reason of her question The abbess would now have withdrawn Emily from the room who being however detained by a strong interest repeated her entreaties Bring me that casket sister said Agnes I will shew her to you yet you need only look in that mirror and you will behold her you surely are her daughter such striking resemblance is never found but among near relations The nun brought the casket and Agnes having directed her how to unlock it she took thence a miniature in which Emily perceived the exact resemblance of the picture which she had found among her late father s papers Agnes held out her hand to receive it gazed upon it earnestly for some moments in silence and then with a countenance of deep despair threw up her eyes to Heaven and prayed inwardly 
3379_132601_000027_000002	train-clean-360	When she had finished she returned the miniature to Emily Keep it said she I bequeath it to you for I must believe it is your right 
none	none	I have frequently observed the resemblance between you but never till this day did it strike upon my conscience so powerfully Stay sister do not remove the casket there is another picture I would shew Emily trembled with expectation and the abbess again would have withdrawn her Agnes is still disordered said she you observe how she wanders In these moods she says any thing and does not scruple as you have witnessed to accuse herself of the most horrible crimes Emily however thought she perceived something more than madness in the inconsistencies of Agnes whose mention of the Marchioness and production of her picture had interested her so much that she determined to obtain further information if possible respecting the subject of it The nun returned with the casket and Agnes pointing out to her a secret drawer she took from it another miniature Here said Agnes as she offered it to Emily learn a lesson for your vanity at least look well at this picture and see if you can discover any resemblance between what I was and what I am Emily impatiently received the miniature which her eyes had scarcely glanced upon before her trembling hands had nearly suffered it to fall it was the resemblance of the portrait of Signora Laurentini which she had formerly seen in the castle of Udolpho the lady who had disappeared in so mysterious a manner and whom Montoni had been suspected of having caused to be murdered In silent astonishment Emily continued to gaze alternately upon the picture and the dying nun endeavouring to trace a resemblance between them which no longer existed Why do you look so sternly on me said Agnes mistaking the nature of Emily s emotion I have seen this face before said Emily at length was it really your resemblance You may well ask that question replied the nun but it was once esteemed a striking likeness of me Look at me well and see what guilt has made me I then was innocent the evil passions of my nature slept Sister added she solemnly and stretching forth her cold damp hand to Emily who shuddered at its touch Sister beware of the first indulgence of the passions beware of the first Their course if not checked then is rapid their force is uncontroulable they lead us we know not whither they lead us perhaps to the commission of crimes for which whole years of prayer and penitence cannot atone Such may be the force of even a single passion that it overcomes every other and sears up every other approach to the heart Possessing us like a fiend it leads us on to the acts of a fiend making us insensible to pity and to conscience And when its purpose is accomplished like a fiend it leaves us to the torture of those feelings which its power had suspended not annihilated to the tortures of compassion remorse and conscience Then we awaken as from a dream and perceive a new world around us we gaze in astonishment and horror but the deed is committed not all the powers of heaven and earth united can undo it and the spectres of conscience will not fly

none	none	Laurentini fell into convulsions as she uttered the last words and Emily unable any longer to endure the horror of the scene hurried from the room and sent some nuns to the assistance of the abbess The Lady Blanche and the boarders who were in the parlour now assembled round Emily and alarmed by her manner and affrighted countenance asked a hundred questions which she avoided answering further than by saying that she believed sister Agnes was dying They received this as a sufficient explanation of her terror and had then leisure to offer restoratives which at length somewhat revived Emily whose mind was however so much shocked with the terrible surmises and perplexed with doubts by some words from the nun that she was unable to converse and would have left the convent immediately had she not wished to know whether Laurentini would survive the late attack After waiting some time she was informed that the convulsions having ceased Laurentini seemed to be reviving and Emily and Blanche were departing when the abbess appeared who drawing the former aside said she had something of consequence to say to her but as it was late she would not detain her then and requested to see her on the following day Emily promised to visit her and having taken leave returned with the Lady Blanche towards the chateau on the way to which the deep gloom of the woods made Blanche lament that the evening was so far advanced for the surrounding stillness and obscurity rendered her sensible of fear though there was a servant to protect her while Emily was too much engaged by the horrors of the scene she had just witnessed to be affected by the solemnity of the shades otherwise than as they served to promote her gloomy reverie from which however she was at length recalled by the Lady Blanche who pointed out at some distance in the dusky path they were winding two persons slowly advancing It was impossible to avoid them without striking into a still more secluded part of the wood whither the strangers might easily follow but all apprehension vanished when Emily distinguished the voice of Mons Du Pont and perceived that his companion was the gentleman whom she had seen at the monastery and who was now conversing with so much earnestness as not immediately to perceive their approach When Du Pont joined the ladies the stranger took leave and they proceeded to the chateau where the Count when he heard of Mons Bonnac claimed him for an acquaintance and on learning the melancholy occasion of his visit to Languedoc and that he was lodged at a small inn in the village begged the favour of Mons

none	none	The latter was happy to do so and the scruples of reserve which made M Bonnac hesitate to accept the invitation being at length overcome they went to the chateau where the kindness of the Count and the sprightliness of his son were exerted to dissipate the gloom that overhung the spirits of the stranger M Bonnac was an officer in the French service and appeared to be about fifty his figure was tall and commanding his manners had received the last polish and there was something in his countenance uncommonly interesting for over features which in youth must have been remarkably handsome was spread a melancholy that seemed the effect of long misfortune rather than of constitution or temper The conversation he held during supper was evidently an effort of politeness and there were intervals in which unable to struggle against the feelings that depressed him he relapsed into silence and abstraction from which however the Count sometimes withdrew him in a manner so delicate and benevolent that Emily while she observed him almost fancied she beheld her late father The party separated at an early hour and then in the solitude of her apartment the scenes which Emily had lately witnessed returned to her fancy with dreadful energy That in the dying nun she should have discovered Signora Laurentini who instead of having been murdered by Montoni was as it now seemed herself guilty of some dreadful crime excited both horror and surprise in a high degree nor did the hints which she had dropped respecting the marriage of the Marchioness de Villeroi and the enquiries she had made concerning Emily s birth occasion her a less degree of interest though it was of a different nature The history which sister Frances had formerly related and had said to be that of Agnes it now appeared was erroneous but for what purpose it had been fabricated unless the more effectually to conceal the true story Emily could not even guess Above all her interest was excited as to the relation which the story of the late Marchioness de Villeroi bore to that of her father for that some kind of relation existed between them the grief of saint Aubert upon hearing her named his request to be buried near her and her picture which had been found among his papers certainly proved Sometimes it occurred to Emily that he might have been the lover to whom it was said the Marchioness was attached when she was compelled to marry the Marquis de Villeroi but that he had afterwards cherished a passion for her she could not suffer herself to believe for a moment The papers which he had so solemnly enjoined her to destroy she now fancied had related to this connection and she wished more earnestly than before to know the reasons that made him consider the injunction necessary which had her faith in his principles been less would have led to believe that there was a mystery in her birth dishonourable to her parents which those manuscripts might have revealed Reflections similar to these engaged her mind during the greater part of the night and when at length she fell into a slumber it was only to behold a vision of the dying nun and to awaken in horrors like those she had witnessed On the following morning she was too much indisposed to attend her appointment with the abbess and before the day concluded she heard that sister Agnes was no more Mons Bonnac received this intelligence with concern but Emily observed that he did not appear so much affected now as on the preceding evening immediately after quitting the apartment of the nun whose death was probably less terrible to him than the confession he had been then called upon to witness However this might be he was perhaps consoled in some degree by a knowledge of the legacy bequeathed him since his family was large and the extravagance of some part of it had lately been the means of involving him in great distress and even in the horrors of a prison and it was the grief he had suffered from the wild career of a favourite son with the pecuniary anxieties and misfortunes consequent upon it that had given to his countenance the air of dejection which had so much interested Emily To his friend Mons

3379_132601_000064_000004	train-clean-360	Amiable and unfortunate Valancourt 
none	none	Valancourt exclaimed Mons Du Pont Of what family The Valancourts Counts Duvarney replied Mons Bonnac The emotion of Mons Du Pont when he discovered the generous benefactor of his friend to be the rival of his love can only be imagined but having overcome his first surprise he dissipated the apprehensions of Mons Bonnac by acquainting him that Valancourt was at liberty and had lately been in Languedoc after which his affection for Emily prompted him to make some enquiries respecting the conduct of his rival during his stay at Paris of which M Bonnac appeared to be well informed The answers he received were such as convinced him that Valancourt had been much misrepresented and painful as was the sacrifice he formed the just design of relinquishing his pursuit of Emily to a lover who it now appeared was not unworthy of the regard with which she honoured him The conversation of Mons Bonnac discovered that Valancourt some time after his arrival at Paris had been drawn into the snares which determined vice had spread for him and that his hours had been chiefly divided between the parties of the captivating Marchioness and those gaming assemblies to which the envy or the avarice of his brother officers had spared no art to seduce him In these parties he had lost large sums in efforts to recover small ones and to such losses the Count De Villefort and Mons Henri had been frequent witnesses His resources were at length exhausted and the Count his brother exasperated by his conduct refused to continue the supplies necessary to his present mode of life when Valancourt in consequence of accumulated debts was thrown into confinement where his brother suffered him to remain in the hope that punishment might effect a reform of conduct which had not yet been confirmed by long habit In the solitude of his prison Valancourt had leisure for reflection and cause for repentance here too the image of Emily which amidst the dissipation of the city had been obscured but never obliterated from his heart revived with all the charms of innocence and beauty to reproach him for having sacrificed his happiness and debased his talents by pursuits which his nobler faculties would formerly have taught him to consider were as tasteless as they were degrading But though his passions had been seduced his heart was not depraved nor had habit riveted the chains that hung heavily on his conscience and as he retained that energy of will which was necessary to burst them he at length emancipated himself from the bondage of vice but not till after much effort and severe suffering Being released by his brother from the prison where he had witnessed the affecting meeting between Mons Bonnac and his wife with whom he had been for some time acquainted the first use of his liberty formed a striking instance of his humanity and his rashness for with nearly all the money just received from his brother he went to a gaming house and gave it as a last stake for the chance of restoring his friend to freedom and to his afflicted family The event was fortunate and while he had awaited the issue of this momentous stake he made a solemn vow never again to yield to the destructive and fascinating vice of gaming Having restored the venerable Mons Bonnac to his rejoicing family he hurried from Paris to Estuviere and in the delight of having made the wretched happy forgot for a while his own misfortunes Soon however he remembered that he had thrown away the fortune without which he could never hope to marry Emily and life unless passed with her now scarcely appeared supportable for her goodness refinement and simplicity of heart rendered her beauty more enchanting if possible to his fancy than it had ever yet appeared Experience had taught him to understand the full value of the qualities which he had before admired but which the contrasted characters he had seen in the world made him now adore and these reflections increasing the pangs of remorse and regret occasioned the deep dejection that had accompanied him even into the presence of Emily of whom he considered himself no longer worthy To the ignominy of having received pecuniary obligations from the Marchioness Chamfort or any other lady of intrigue as the Count De Villefort had been informed or of having been engaged in the depredating schemes of gamesters Valancourt had never submitted and these were some of such scandals as often mingle with truth against the unfortunate Count De Villefort had received them from authority which he had no reason to doubt and which the imprudent conduct he had himself witnessed in Valancourt had certainly induced him the more readily to believe Being such as Emily could not name to the Chevalier he had no opportunity of refuting them and when he confessed himself to be unworthy of her esteem he little suspected that he was confirming to her the most dreadful calumnies Thus the mistake had been mutual and had remained so when Mons Bonnac explained the conduct of his generous but imprudent young friend to Du Pont who with severe justice determined not only to undeceive the Count on this subject but to resign all hope of Emily Such a sacrifice as his love rendered this was deserving of a noble reward and Mons 
3379_132601_000071_000010	train-clean-360	Bonnac if it had been possible for him to forget the benevolent Valancourt would have wished that Emily might accept the just Du Pont 
none	none	When the Count was informed of the error he had committed he was extremely shocked at the consequence of his credulity and the account which Mons Bonnac gave of his friend s situation while at Paris convinced him that Valancourt had been entrapped by the schemes of a set of dissipated young men with whom his profession had partly obliged him to associate rather than by an inclination to vice and charmed by the humanity and noble though rash generosity which his conduct towards Mons Bonnac exhibited he forgave him the transient errors that had stained his youth and restored him to the high degree of esteem with which he had regarded him during their early acquaintance But as the least reparation he could now make Valancourt was to afford him an opportunity of explaining to Emily his former conduct he immediately wrote to request his forgiveness of the unintentional injury he had done him and to invite him to Chateau le Blanc Motives of delicacy with held the Count from informing Emily of this letter and of kindness from acquainting her with the discovery respecting Valancourt till his arrival should save her from the possibility of anxiety as to its event and this precaution spared her even severer inquietude than the Count had foreseen since he was ignorant of the symptoms of despair which Valancourt s late conduct had betrayed CHAPTER XVII But in these cases We still have judgment here that we but teach Bloody instructions which being taught return To plague the inventor thus even handed justice Commends the ingredients of our poison d chalice To our own lips MACBETH Some circumstances of an extraordinary nature now withdrew Emily from her own sorrows and excited emotions which partook of both surprise and horror A few days followed that on which Signora Laurentini died her will was opened at the monastery in the presence of the superiors and Mons Bonnac when it was found that one third of her personal property was bequeathed to the nearest surviving relative of the late Marchioness de Villeroi and that Emily was the person With the secret of Emily s family the abbess had long been acquainted and it was in observance of the earnest request of saint Aubert who was known to the friar that attended him on his death bed that his daughter had remained in ignorance of her relationship to the Marchioness But some hints which had fallen from Signora Laurentini during her last interview with Emily and a confession of a very extraordinary nature given in her dying hours had made the abbess think it necessary to converse with her young friend on the topic she had not before ventured to introduce and it was for this purpose that she had requested to see her on the morning that followed her interview with the nun Emily s indisposition had then prevented the intended conversation but now after the will had been examined she received a summons which she immediately obeyed and became informed of circumstances that powerfully affected her As the narrative of the abbess was however deficient in many particulars of which the reader may wish to be informed and the history of the nun is materially connected with the fate of the Marchioness de Villeroi we shall omit the conversation that passed in the parlour of the convent and mingle with our relation a brief history of LAURENTINI DI UDOLPHO Who was the only child of her parents and heiress of the ancient house of Udolpho in the territory of Venice It was the first misfortune of her life and that which led to all her succeeding misery that the friends who ought to have restrained her strong passions and mildly instructed her in the art of governing them nurtured them by early indulgence But they cherished their own failings in her for their conduct was not the result of rational kindness and when they either indulged or opposed the passions of their child they gratified their own Thus they indulged her with weakness and reprehended her with violence her spirit was exasperated by their vehemence instead of being corrected by their wisdom and their oppositions became contest for victory in which the due tenderness of the parents and the affectionate duties of the child were equally forgotten but as returning fondness disarmed the parents resentment soonest Laurentini was suffered to believe that she had conquered and her passions became stronger by every effort that had been employed to subdue them The death of her father and mother in the same year left her to her own discretion under the dangerous circumstances attendant on youth and beauty She was fond of company delighted with admiration yet disdainful of the opinion of the world when it happened to contradict her inclinations had a gay and brilliant wit and was mistress of all the arts of fascination Her conduct was such as might have been expected from the weakness of her principles and the strength of her passions Among her numerous admirers was the late Marquis de Villeroi who on his tour through Italy saw Laurentini at Venice where she usually resided and became her passionate adorer Equally captivated by the figure and accomplishments of the Marquis who was at that period one of the most distinguished noblemen of the French court she had the art so effectually to conceal from him the dangerous traits of her character and the blemishes of her late conduct that he solicited her hand in marriage Before the nuptials were concluded she retired to the castle of Udolpho whither the Marquis followed and where her conduct relaxing from the propriety which she had lately assumed discovered to him the precipice on which he stood A minuter enquiry than he had before thought it necessary to make convinced him that he had been deceived in her character and she whom he had designed for his wife afterwards became his mistress Having passed some weeks at Udolpho he was called abruptly to France whither he returned with extreme reluctance for his heart was still fascinated by the arts of Laurentini with whom however he had on various pretences delayed his marriage but to reconcile her to this separation he now gave repeated promises of returning to conclude the nuptials as soon as the affair which thus suddenly called him to France should permit Soothed in some degree by these assurances she suffered him to depart and soon after her relative Montoni arriving at Udolpho renewed the addresses which she had before refused and which she now again rejected Meanwhile her thoughts were constantly with the Marquis de Villeroi for whom she suffered all the delirium of Italian love cherished by the solitude to which she confined herself for she had now lost all taste for the pleasures of society and the gaiety of amusement Her only indulgences were to sigh and weep over a miniature of the Marquis to visit the scenes that had witnessed their happiness to pour forth her heart to him in writing and to count the weeks the days which must intervene before the period that he had mentioned as probable for his return But this period passed without bringing him and week after week followed in heavy and almost intolerable expectation During this interval Laurentini s fancy occupied incessantly by one idea became disordered and her whole heart being devoted to one object life became hateful to her when she believed that object lost Several months passed during which she heard nothing from the Marquis de Villeroi and her days were marked at intervals with the phrensy of passion and the sullenness of despair She secluded herself from all visitors and sometimes remained in her apartment for weeks together refusing to speak to every person except her favourite female attendant writing scraps of letters reading again and again those she had received from the Marquis weeping over his picture and speaking to it for many hours upbraiding reproaching and caressing it alternately At length a report reached her that the Marquis had married in France and after suffering all the extremes of love jealousy and indignation she formed the desperate resolution of going secretly to that country and if the report proved true of attempting a deep revenge To her favourite woman only she confided the plan of her journey and she engaged her to partake of it Having collected her jewels which descending to her from many branches of her family were of immense value and all her cash to a very large amount they were packed in a trunk which was privately conveyed to a neighbouring town whither Laurentini with this only servant followed and thence proceeded secretly to Leghorn where they embarked for France When on her arrival in Languedoc she found that the Marquis de Villeroi had been married for some months her despair almost deprived her of reason and she alternately projected and abandoned the horrible design of murdering the Marquis his wife and herself At length she contrived to throw herself in his way with an intention of reproaching him for his conduct and of stabbing herself in his presence but when she again saw him who so long had been the constant object of her thoughts and affections resentment yielded to love her resolution failed she trembled with the conflict of emotions that assailed her heart and fainted away The Marquis was not proof against her beauty and sensibility all the energy with which he had first loved returned for his passion had been resisted by prudence rather than overcome by indifference and since the honour of his family would not permit him to marry her he had endeavoured to subdue his love and had so far succeeded as to select the then Marchioness for his wife whom he loved at first with a tempered and rational affection But the mild virtues of that amiable lady did not recompense him for her indifference which appeared notwithstanding her efforts to conceal it and he had for some time suspected that her affections were engaged by another person when Laurentini arrived in Languedoc This artful Italian soon perceived that she had regained her influence over him and soothed by the discovery she determined to live and to employ all her enchantments to win his consent to the diabolical deed which she believed was necessary to the security of her happiness She conducted her scheme with deep dissimulation and patient perseverance and having completely estranged the affections of the Marquis from his wife whose gentle goodness and unimpassioned manners had ceased to please when contrasted with the captivations of the Italian she proceeded to awaken in his mind the jealousy of pride for it was no longer that of love and even pointed out to him the person to whom she affirmed the Marchioness had sacrificed her honour but Laurentini had first extorted from him a solemn promise to forbear avenging himself upon his rival This was an important part of her plan for she knew that if his desire of vengeance was restrained towards one party it would burn more fiercely towards the other and he might then perhaps be prevailed on to assist in the horrible act which would release him from the only barrier that with held him from making her his wife The innocent Marchioness meanwhile observed with extreme grief the alteration in her husband s manners He became reserved and thoughtful in her presence his conduct was austere and sometimes even rude and he left her for many hours together to weep for his unkindness and to form plans for the recovery of his affection His conduct afflicted her the more because in obedience to the command of her father she had accepted his hand though her affections were engaged to another whose amiable disposition she had reason to believe would have ensured her happiness This circumstance Laurentini had discovered soon after her arrival in France and had made ample use of it in assisting her designs upon the Marquis to whom she adduced such seeming proof of his wife s infidelity that in the frantic rage of wounded honour he consented to destroy his wife A slow poison was administered and she fell a victim to the jealousy and subtlety of Laurentini and to the guilty weakness of her husband But the moment of Laurentini s triumph the moment to which she had looked forward for the completion of all her wishes proved only the commencement of a suffering that never left her to her dying hour The passion of revenge which had in part stimulated her to the commission of this atrocious deed died even at the moment when it was gratified and left her to the horrors of unavailing pity and remorse which would probably have empoisoned all the years she had promised herself with the Marquis de Villeroi had her expectations of an alliance with him been realized But he too had found the moment of his revenge to be that of remorse as to himself and detestation as to the partner of his crime the feeling which he had mistaken for conviction was no more and he stood astonished and aghast that no proof remained of his wife s infidelity now that she had suffered the punishment of guilt Even when he was informed that she was dying he had felt suddenly and unaccountably reassured of her innocence nor was the solemn assurance she made him in her last hour capable of affording him a stronger conviction of her blameless conduct In the first horrors of remorse and despair he felt inclined to deliver up himself and the woman who had plunged him into this abyss of guilt into the hands of justice but when the paroxysm of his suffering was over his intention changed Laurentini however he saw only once afterwards and that was to curse her as the instigator of his crime and to say that he spared her life only on condition that she passed the rest of her days in prayer and penance Overwhelmed with disappointment on receiving contempt and abhorrence from the man for whose sake she had not scrupled to stain her conscience with human blood and touched with horror of the unavailing crime she had committed she renounced the world and retired to the monastery of saint Claire a dreadful victim to unresisted passion The Marquis immediately after the death of his wife quitted Chateau le Blanc to which he never returned and endeavoured to lose the sense of his crime amidst the tumult of war or the dissipations of a capital but his efforts were vain a deep dejection hung over him ever after for which his most intimate friend could not account and he at length died with a degree of horror nearly equal to that which Laurentini had suffered The physician who had observed the singular appearance of the unfortunate Marchioness after death had been bribed to silence and as the surmises of a few of the servants had proceeded no further than a whisper the affair had never been investigated Whether this whisper ever reached the father of the Marchioness and if it did whether the difficulty of obtaining proof deterred him from prosecuting the Marquis de Villeroi is uncertain but her death was deeply lamented by some part of her family and particularly by her brother M saint Aubert for that was the degree of relationship which had existed between Emily s father and the Marchioness and there is no doubt that he suspected the manner of her death Many letters passed between the Marquis and him soon after the decease of his beloved sister the subject of which was not known but there is reason to believe that they related to the cause of her death and these were the papers together with some letters of the Marchioness who had confided to her brother the occasion of her unhappiness which saint Aubert had so solemnly enjoined his daughter to destroy and anxiety for her peace had probably made him forbid her to enquire into the melancholy story to which they alluded Such indeed had been his affliction on the premature death of this his favourite sister whose unhappy marriage had from the first excited his tenderest pity that he never could hear her named or mention her himself after her death except to Madame saint Aubert From Emily whose sensibility he feared to awaken he had so carefully concealed her history and name that she was ignorant till now that she ever had such a relative as the Marchioness de Villeroi and from this motive he had enjoined silence to his only surviving sister Madame Cheron who had scrupulously observed his request It was over some of the last pathetic letters of the Marchioness that saint Aubert was weeping when he was observed by Emily on the eve of her departure from La Vallee and it was her picture which he had so tenderly caressed Her disastrous death may account for the emotion he had betrayed on hearing her named by La Voisin and for his request to be interred near the monument of the Villerois where her remains were deposited but not those of her husband who was buried where he died in the north of France The confessor who attended saint Aubert in his last moments recollected him to be the brother of the late Marchioness when saint Aubert from tenderness to Emily had conjured him to conceal the circumstance and to request that the abbess to whose care he particularly recommended her would do the same a request which had been exactly observed Laurentini on her arrival in France had carefully concealed her name and family and the better to disguise her real history had on entering the convent caused the story to be circulated which had imposed on sister Frances and it is probable that the abbess who did not preside in the convent at the time of her noviciation was also entirely ignorant of the truth The deep remorse that seized on the mind of Laurentini together with the sufferings of disappointed passion for she still loved the Marquis again unsettled her intellects and after the first paroxysms of despair were passed a heavy and silent melancholy had settled upon her spirits which suffered few interruptions from fits of phrensy till the time of her death During many years it had been her only amusement to walk in the woods near the monastery in the solitary hours of night and to play upon a favourite instrument to which she sometimes joined the delightful melody of her voice in the most solemn and melancholy airs of her native country modulated by all the energetic feeling that dwelt in her heart The physician who had attended her recommended it to the superior to indulge her in this whim as the only means of soothing her distempered fancy and she was suffered to walk in the lonely hours of night attended by the servant who had accompanied her from Italy but as the indulgence transgressed against the rules of the convent it was kept as secret as possible and thus the mysterious music of Laurentini had combined with other circumstances to produce a report that not only the chateau but its neighbourhood was haunted Soon after her entrance into this holy community and before she had shewn any symptoms of insanity there she made a will in which after bequeathing a considerable legacy to the convent she divided the remainder of her personal property which her jewels made very valuable between the wife of Mons Bonnac who was an Italian lady and her relation and the nearest surviving relative of the late Marchioness de Villeroi As Emily saint Aubert was not only the nearest but the sole relative this legacy descended to her and thus explained to her the whole mystery of her father s conduct The resemblance between Emily and her unfortunate aunt had frequently been observed by Laurentini and had occasioned the singular behaviour which had formerly alarmed her but it was in the nun s dying hour when her conscience gave her perpetually the idea of the Marchioness that she became more sensible than ever of this likeness and in her phrensy deemed it no resemblance of the person she had injured but the original herself The bold assertion that had followed on the recovery of her senses that Emily was the daughter of the Marchioness de Villeroi arose from a suspicion that she was so for knowing that her rival when she married the Marquis was attached to another lover she had scarcely scrupled to believe that her honour had been sacrificed like her own to an unresisted passion Of a crime however to which Emily had suspected from her phrensied confession of murder that she had been instrumental in the castle of Udolpho Laurentini was innocent and she had herself been deceived concerning the spectacle that formerly occasioned her so much terror and had since compelled her for a while to attribute the horrors of the nun to a consciousness of a murder committed in that castle It may be remembered that in a chamber of Udolpho hung a black veil whose singular situation had excited Emily s curiosity and which afterwards disclosed an object that had overwhelmed her with horror for on lifting it there appeared instead of the picture she had expected within a recess of the wall a human figure of ghastly paleness stretched at its length and dressed in the habiliments of the grave What added to the horror of the spectacle was that the face appeared partly decayed and disfigured by worms which were visible on the features and hands On such an object it will be readily believed that no person could endure to look twice Emily it may be recollected had after the first glance let the veil drop and her terror had prevented her from ever after provoking a renewal of such suffering as she had then experienced Had she dared to look again her delusion and her fears would have vanished together and she would have perceived that the figure before her was not human but formed of wax The history of it is somewhat extraordinary though not without example in the records of that fierce severity which monkish superstition has sometimes inflicted on mankind A member of the house of Udolpho having committed some offence against the prerogative of the church had been condemned to the penance of contemplating during certain hours of the day a waxen image made to resemble a human body in the state to which it is reduced after death This penance serving as a memento of the condition at which he must himself arrive had been designed to reprove the pride of the Marquis of Udolpho which had formerly so much exasperated that of the Romish church and he had not only superstitiously observed this penance himself which he had believed was to obtain a pardon for all his sins but had made it a condition in his will that his descendants should preserve the image on pain of forfeiting to the church a certain part of his domain that they also might profit by the humiliating moral it conveyed The figure therefore had been suffered to retain its station in the wall of the chamber but his descendants excused themselves from observing the penance to which he had been enjoined This image was so horribly natural that it is not surprising Emily should have mistaken it for the object it resembled nor since she had heard such an extraordinary account concerning the disappearing of the late lady of the castle and had such experience of the character of Montoni that she should have believed this to be the murdered body of the lady Laurentini and that he had been the contriver of her death The situation in which she had discovered it occasioned her at first much surprise and perplexity but the vigilance with which the doors of the chamber where it was deposited were afterwards secured had compelled her to believe that Montoni not daring to confide the secret of her death to any person had suffered her remains to decay in this obscure chamber The ceremony of the veil however and the circumstance of the doors having been left open even for a moment had occasioned her much wonder and some doubts but these were not sufficient to overcome her suspicion of Montoni and it was the dread of his terrible vengeance that had sealed her lips in silence concerning what she had seen in the west chamber Emily in discovering the Marchioness de Villeroi to have been the sister of Mons saint Aubert was variously affected but amidst the sorrow which she suffered for her untimely death she was released from an anxious and painful conjecture occasioned by the rash assertion of Signora Laurentini concerning her birth and the honour of her parents Her faith in saint Aubert s principles would scarcely allow her to suspect that he had acted dishonourably and she felt such reluctance to believe herself the daughter of any other than her whom she had always considered and loved as a mother that she would hardly admit such a circumstance to be possible yet the likeness which it had frequently been affirmed she bore to the late Marchioness the former behaviour of Dorothee the old housekeeper the assertion of Laurentini and the mysterious attachment which saint Aubert had discovered awakened doubts as to his connection with the Marchioness which her reason could neither vanquish or confirm From these however she was now relieved and all the circumstances of her father s conduct were fully explained but her heart was oppressed by the melancholy catastrophe of her amiable relative and by the awful lesson which the history of the nun exhibited the indulgence of whose passions had been the means of leading her gradually to the commission of a crime from the prophecy of which in her early years she would have recoiled in horror and exclaimed that it could not be a crime which whole years of repentance and of the severest penance had not been able to obliterate from her conscience CHAPTER XVIII Then fresh tears Stood on her cheek as doth the honey dew Upon a gather d lily almost wither d SHAKESPEARE After the late discoveries Emily was distinguished at the chateau by the Count and his family as a relative of the house of Villeroi and received if possible more friendly attention than had yet been shewn her Count De Villefort s surprise at the delay of an answer to his letter which had been directed to Valancourt at Estuviere was mingled with satisfaction for the prudence which had saved Emily from a share of the anxiety he now suffered though when he saw her still drooping under the effect of his former error all his resolution was necessary to restrain him from relating the truth that would afford her a momentary relief The approaching nuptials of the Lady Blanche now divided his attention with this subject of his anxiety for the inhabitants of the chateau were already busied in preparations for that event and the arrival of Mons saint Foix was daily expected In the gaiety which surrounded her Emily vainly tried to participate her spirits being depressed by the late discoveries and by the anxiety concerning the fate of Valancourt that had been occasioned by the description of his manner when he had delivered the ring She seemed to perceive in it the gloomy wildness of despair and when she considered to what that despair might have urged him her heart sunk with terror and grief The state of suspense as to his safety to which she believed herself condemned till she should return to La Vallee appeared insupportable and in such moments she could not even struggle to assume the composure that had left her mind but would often abruptly quit the company she was with and endeavour to sooth her spirits in the deep solitudes of the woods that overbrowed the shore Here the faint roar of foaming waves that beat below and the sullen murmur of the wind among the branches around were circumstances in unison with the temper of her mind and she would sit on a cliff or on the broken steps of her favourite watch tower observing the changing colours of the evening clouds and the gloom of twilight draw over the sea till the white tops of billows riding towards the shore could scarcely be discerned amidst the darkened waters The lines engraved by Valancourt on this tower she frequently repeated with melancholy enthusiasm and then would endeavour to check the recollections and the grief they occasioned and to turn her thoughts to indifferent subjects One evening having wandered with her lute to this her favourite spot she entered the ruined tower and ascended a winding staircase that led to a small chamber which was less decayed than the rest of the building and whence she had often gazed with admiration on the wide prospect of sea and land that extended below The sun was now setting on that tract of the Pyrenees which divided Languedoc from Rousillon and placing herself opposite to a small grated window which like the wood tops beneath and the waves lower still gleamed with the red glow of the west she touched the chords of her lute in solemn symphony and then accompanied it with her voice in one of the simple and affecting airs to which in happier days Valancourt had often listened in rapture and which she now adapted to the following lines TO MELANCHOLY Spirit of love and sorrow hail Thy solemn voice from far I hear Mingling with ev ning s dying gale Hail with this sadly pleasing tear O at this still this lonely hour Thine own sweet hour of closing day Awake thy lute whose charmful pow r Shall call up Fancy to obey To paint the wild romantic dream That meets the poet s musing eye As on the bank of shadowy stream He breathes to her the fervid sigh O lonely spirit let thy song Lead me through all thy sacred haunt The minister s moon light aisles along Where spectres raise the midnight chaunt I hear their dirges faintly swell Then sink at once in silence drear While from the pillar d cloister s cell Dimly their gliding forms appear Lead where the pine woods wave on high Whose pathless sod is darkly seen As the cold moon with trembling eye Darts her long beams the leaves between Lead to the mountain s dusky head Where far below in shade profound Wide forests plains and hamlets spread And sad the chimes of vesper sound Or guide me where the dashing oar Just breaks the stillness of the vale As slow it tracks the winding shore To meet the ocean s distant sail To pebbly banks that Neptune laves With measur d surges loud and deep Where the dark cliff bends o er the waves And wild the winds of autumn sweep There pause at midnight s spectred hour And list the long resounding gale And catch the fleeting moon light s pow r O er foaming seas and distant sail The soft tranquillity of the scene below where the evening breeze scarcely curled the water or swelled the passing sail that caught the last gleam of the sun and where now and then a dipping oar was all that disturbed the trembling radiance conspired with the tender melody of her lute to lull her mind into a state of gentle sadness and she sung the mournful songs of past times till the remembrances they awakened were too powerful for her heart her tears fell upon the lute over which she drooped and her voice trembled and was unable to proceed Though the sun had now sunk behind the mountains and even his reflected light was fading from their highest points Emily did not leave the watch tower but continued to indulge her melancholy reverie till a footstep at a little distance startled her and on looking through the grate she observed a person walking below whom however soon perceiving to be Mons Bonnac she returned to the quiet thoughtfulness his step had interrupted After some time she again struck her lute and sung her favourite air but again a step disturbed her and as she paused to listen she heard it ascending the stair case of the tower The gloom of the hour perhaps made her sensible to some degree of fear which she might not otherwise have felt for only a few minutes before she had seen Mons Bonnac pass The steps were quick and bounding and in the next moment the door of the chamber opened and a person entered whose features were veiled in the obscurity of twilight but his voice could not be concealed for it was the voice of Valancourt At the sound never heard by Emily without emotion she started in terror astonishment and doubtful pleasure and had scarcely beheld him at her feet when she sunk into a seat overcome by the various emotions that contended at her heart and almost insensible to that voice whose earnest and trembling calls seemed as if endeavouring to save her Valancourt as he hung over Emily deplored his own rash impatience in having thus surprised her for when he had arrived at the chateau too anxious to await the return of the Count who he understood was in the grounds he went himself to seek him when as he passed the tower he was struck by the sound of Emily s voice and immediately ascended It was a considerable time before she revived but when her recollection returned she repulsed his attentions with an air of reserve and enquired with as much displeasure as it was possible she could feel in these first moments of his appearance the occasion of his visit Ah Emily said Valancourt that air those words alas I have then little to hope when you ceased to esteem me you ceased also to love me Most true sir replied Emily endeavouring to command her trembling voice and if you had valued my esteem you would not have given me this new occasion for uneasiness Valancourt s countenance changed suddenly from the anxieties of doubt to an expression of surprise and dismay he was silent a moment and then said I had been taught to hope for a very different reception Is it then true Emily that I have lost your regard forever am I to believe that though your esteem for me may return your affection never can Can the Count have meditated the cruelty which now tortures me with a second death The voice in which he spoke this alarmed Emily as much as his words surprised her and with trembling impatience she begged that he would explain them Can any explanation be necessary said Valancourt do you not know how cruelly my conduct has been misrepresented that the actions of which you once believed me guilty and O Emily how could you so degrade me in your opinion even for a moment those actions I hold in as much contempt and abhorrence as yourself Are you indeed ignorant that Count de Villefort has detected the slanders that have robbed me of all I hold dear on earth and has invited me hither to justify to you my former conduct It is surely impossible you can be uninformed of these circumstances and I am again torturing myself with a false hope The silence of Emily confirmed this supposition for the deep twilight would not allow Valancourt to distinguish the astonishment and doubting joy that fixed her features For a moment she continued unable to speak then a profound sigh seemed to give some relief to her spirits and she said Valancourt I was till this moment ignorant of all the circumstances you have mentioned the emotion I now suffer may assure you of the truth of this and that though I had ceased to esteem I had not taught myself entirely to forget you This moment said Valancourt in a low voice and leaning for support against the window this moment brings with it a conviction that overpowers me I am dear to you then still dear to you my Emily Is it necessary that I should tell you so she replied is it necessary that I should say these are the first moments of joy I have known since your departure and that they repay me for all those of pain I have suffered in the interval Valancourt sighed deeply and was unable to reply but as he pressed her hand to his lips the tears that fell over it spoke a language which could not be mistaken and to which words were inadequate Emily somewhat tranquillized proposed returning to the chateau and then for the first time recollected that the Count had invited Valancourt thither to explain his conduct and that no explanation had yet been given But while she acknowledged this her heart would not allow her to dwell for a moment on the possibility of his unworthiness his look his voice his manner all spoke the noble sincerity which had formerly distinguished him and she again permitted herself to indulge the emotions of a joy more surprising and powerful than she had ever before experienced Neither Emily or Valancourt were conscious how they reached the chateau whither they might have been transferred by the spell of a fairy for any thing they could remember and it was not till they had reached the great hall that either of them recollected there were other persons in the world besides themselves The Count then came forth with surprise and with the joyfulness of pure benevolence to welcome Valancourt and to entreat his forgiveness of the injustice he had done him soon after which Mons Bonnac joined this happy group in which he and Valancourt were mutually rejoiced to meet When the first congratulations were over and the general joy became somewhat more tranquil the Count withdrew with Valancourt to the library where a long conversation passed between them in which the latter so clearly justified himself of the criminal parts of the conduct imputed to him and so candidly confessed and so feelingly lamented the follies which he had committed that the Count was confirmed in his belief of all he had hoped and while he perceived so many noble virtues in Valancourt and that experience had taught him to detest the follies which before he had only not admired he did not scruple to believe that he would pass through life with the dignity of a wise and good man or to entrust to his care the future happiness of Emily saint Aubert for whom he felt the solicitude of a parent Of this he soon informed her in a short conversation when Valancourt had left him While Emily listened to a relation of the services that Valancourt had rendered Mons Bonnac her eyes overflowed with tears of pleasure and the further conversation of Count De Villefort perfectly dissipated every doubt as to the past and future conduct of him to whom she now restored without fear the esteem and affection with which she had formerly received him When they returned to the supper room the Countess and Lady Blanche met Valancourt with sincere congratulations and Blanche indeed was so much rejoiced to see Emily returned to happiness as to forget for a while that Mons saint Foix was not yet arrived at the chateau though he had been expected for some hours but her generous sympathy was soon after rewarded by his appearance He was now perfectly recovered from the wounds received during his perilous adventure among the Pyrenees the mention of which served to heighten to the parties who had been involved in it the sense of their present happiness New congratulations passed between them and round the supper table appeared a group of faces smiling with felicity but with a felicity which had in each a different character The smile of Blanche was frank and gay that of Emily tender and pensive Valancourt s was rapturous tender and gay alternately Mons saint Foix s was joyous and that of the Count as he looked on the surrounding party expressed the tempered complacency of benevolence while the features of the Countess Henri and Mons Bonnac discovered fainter traces of animation Poor Mons Du Pont did not by his presence throw a shade of regret over the company for when he had discovered that Valancourt was not unworthy of the esteem of Emily he determined seriously to endeavour at the conquest of his own hopeless affection and had immediately withdrawn from Chateau le Blanc a conduct which Emily now understood and rewarded with her admiration and pity The Count and his guests continued together till a late hour yielding to the delights of social gaiety and to the sweets of friendship When Annette heard of the arrival of Valancourt Ludovico had some difficulty to prevent her going into the supper room to express her joy for she declared that she had never been so rejoiced at any ACCIDENT as this since she had found Ludovico himself CHAPTER XIX Now my task is smoothly done I can fly or I can run Quickly to the green earth s end Where the bow d welkin low doth bend And from thence can soar as soon To the corners of the moon MILTON The marriages of the Lady Blanche and Emily saint Aubert were celebrated on the same day and with the ancient baronial magnificence at Chateau le Blanc The feasts were held in the great hall of the castle which on this occasion was hung with superb new tapestry representing the exploits of Charlemagne and his twelve peers here were seen the Saracens with their horrible visors advancing to battle and there were displayed the wild solemnities of incantation and the necromantic feats exhibited by the magician JARL before the Emperor The sumptuous banners of the family of Villeroi which had long slept in dust were once more unfurled to wave over the gothic points of painted casements and music echoed in many a lingering close through every winding gallery and colonnade of that vast edifice As Annette looked down from the corridor upon the hall whose arches and windows were illuminated with brilliant festoons of lamps and gazed on the splendid dresses of the dancers the costly liveries of the attendants the canopies of purple velvet and gold and listened to the gay strains that floated along the vaulted roof she almost fancied herself in an enchanted palace and declared that she had not met with any place which charmed her so much since she read the fairy tales nay that the fairies themselves at their nightly revels in this old hall could display nothing finer while old Dorothee as she surveyed the scene sighed and said the castle looked as it was wont to do in the time of her youth After gracing the festivities of Chateau le Blanc for some days Valancourt and Emily took leave of their kind friends and returned to La Vallee where the faithful Theresa received them with unfeigned joy and the pleasant shades welcomed them with a thousand tender and affecting remembrances and while they wandered together over the scenes so long inhabited by the late Mons and Madame saint Aubert and Emily pointed out with pensive affection their favourite haunts her present happiness was heightened by considering that it would have been worthy of their approbation could they have witnessed it Valancourt led her to the plane tree on the terrace where he had first ventured to declare his love and where now the remembrance of the anxiety he had then suffered and the retrospect of all the dangers and misfortunes they had each encountered since last they sat together beneath its broad branches exalted the sense of their present felicity which on this spot sacred to the memory of saint Aubert they solemnly vowed to deserve as far as possible by endeavouring to imitate his benevolence by remembering that superior attainments of every sort bring with them duties of superior exertion and by affording to their fellow beings together with that portion of ordinary comforts which prosperity always owes to misfortune the example of lives passed in happy thankfulness to GOD and therefore in careful tenderness to his creatures Soon after their return to La Vallee the brother of Valancourt came to congratulate him on his marriage and to pay his respects to Emily with whom he was so much pleased as well as with the prospect of rational happiness which these nuptials offered to Valancourt that he immediately resigned to him a part of the rich domain the whole of which as he had no family would of course descend to his brother on his decease The estates at Tholouse were disposed of and Emily purchased of Mons Quesnel the ancient domain of her late father where having given Annette a marriage portion she settled her as the housekeeper and Ludovico as the steward but since both Valancourt and herself preferred the pleasant and long loved shades of La Vallee to the magnificence of Epourville they continued to reside there passing however a few months in the year at the birth place of saint Aubert in tender respect to his memory The legacy which had been bequeathed to Emily by Signora Laurentini she begged Valancourt would allow her to resign to Mons Bonnac and Valancourt when she made the request felt all the value of the compliment it conveyed The castle of Udolpho also descended to the wife of Mons Bonnac who was the nearest surviving relation of the house of that name and thus affluence restored his long oppressed spirits to peace and his family to comfort O how joyful it is to tell of happiness such as that of Valancourt and Emily to relate that after suffering under the oppression of the vicious and the disdain of the weak they were at length restored to each other to the beloved landscapes of their native country to the securest felicity of this life that of aspiring to moral and labouring for intellectual improvement to the pleasures of enlightened society and to the exercise of the benevolence which had always animated their hearts while the bowers of La Vallee became once more the retreat of goodness wisdom and domestic blessedness O useful may it be to have shewn that though the vicious can sometimes pour affliction upon the good their power is transient and their punishment certain and that innocence though oppressed by injustice shall supported by patience finally triumph over misfortune And if the weak hand that has recorded this tale has by its scenes beguiled the mourner of one hour of sorrow or by its moral taught him to sustain it the effort however humble has not been vain nor is the writer unrewarded End of Project Gutenberg s The Mysteries of Udolpho by Ann Radcliffe END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE MYSTERIES OF UDOLPHO This file should be
