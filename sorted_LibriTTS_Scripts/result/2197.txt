4806_26894_000008_000000	train-clean-360	At length I returned from two weeks leave of absence to find that my patrons had arrived three days ago in Roulettenberg 
4806_26894_000008_000001	train-clean-360	I received from them a welcome quite different to that which I had expected 
4806_26894_000008_000002	train-clean-360	The General eyed me coldly greeted me in rather haughty fashion and dismissed me to pay my respects to his sister 
4806_26894_000008_000003	train-clean-360	It was clear that from SOMEWHERE money had been acquired 
4806_26894_000008_000004	train-clean-360	I thought I could even detect a certain shamefacedness in the General s glance 
none	none	Maria Philipovna too seemed distraught and conversed with me with an air of detachment Nevertheless she took the money which I handed to her counted it and listened to
4806_26894_000028_000000	train-clean-360	 what 
none	none	I had to tell To luncheon there were expected that day a Monsieur Mezentsov a French lady and an Englishman for whenever money was in hand a banquet in Muscovite style was always given 
4806_26894_000008_000007	train-clean-360	Polina Alexandrovna on seeing me inquired why I had been so long away 
4806_26894_000008_000008	train-clean-360	Then without waiting for an answer she departed 
4806_26894_000008_000009	train-clean-360	Evidently this was not mere accident and I felt that I must throw some light upon matters 
4806_26894_000008_000010	train-clean-360	It was high time that I did so 
4806_26894_000009_000000	train-clean-360	I was assigned a small room on the fourth floor of the hotel for you must know that I belonged to the General s suite 
4806_26894_000009_000001	train-clean-360	So far as I could see the party had already gained some notoriety in the place which had come to look upon the General as a Russian nobleman of great wealth 
none	none	Indeed even before luncheon he charged me among other things to get two thousand franc notes changed for him at the hotel counter which put us in a position to be thought millionaires at all events for a week 
4806_26894_000009_000003	train-clean-360	Later I was about to take Mischa and Nadia for a walk when a summons reached me from the staircase that I must attend the General He began by deigning to inquire of me where I was going to take the children and as he did so I could see that he failed to look me in the eyes 
4806_26894_000009_000004	train-clean-360	He WANTED to do so but each time was met by me with such a fixed disrespectful stare that he desisted in confusion 
4806_26894_000009_000005	train-clean-360	In pompous language however which jumbled one sentence into another and at length grew disconnected he gave me to understand that I was to lead the children altogether away from the Casino and out into the park Finally his anger exploded and he added sharply 
4806_26894_000010_000000	train-clean-360	 I suppose you would like to take them to the Casino to play roulette Well excuse my speaking so plainly but I know how addicted you are to gambling 
none	none	Though I am not your mentor nor wish to be at least I have a right to require that you shall not actually compromise me
4806_26894_000011_000000	train-clean-360	 I have no money for gambling I quietly replied 
none	none	But you will soon be in receipt of some retorted the General reddening a little as he dived into his writing desk and applied himself to a memorandum book From it he saw that he had one hundred twenty roubles of mine in his keeping
4806_26894_000013_000000	train-clean-360	 Let us calculate he went on 
4806_26894_000013_000001	train-clean-360	 We must translate these roubles into thalers 
none	none	Here take one hundred thalers as a round sum 
4806_26894_000013_000003	train-clean-360	The rest will be safe in my hands 
4806_26894_000014_000000	train-clean-360	In silence I took the money 
none	none	You must not be offended at what I say he continued
4806_26894_000015_000001	train-clean-360	 You are too touchy about these things 
none	none	What I have said I have said merely as a warning To do so is no more than my right 
4806_26894_000016_000000	train-clean-360	When returning home with the children before luncheon I met a cavalcade of our party riding to view some ruins 
none	none	Two splendid carriages magnificently horsed with Mlle 
4806_26894_000072_000001	train-clean-360	Blanche 
none	none	Maria Philipovna and Polina Alexandrovna in one of them and the Frenchman the Englishman and the General in attendance on horseback 
4806_26894_000016_000003	train-clean-360	The passers by stopped to stare at them for the effect was splendid the General could not have improved upon it 
none	none	I calculated that with the four thousand francs which I had brought with me added to what my patrons seemed already to have acquired the party must be in possession of at least seven thousand or eight thousand francs though that would be none too much for Mlle Blanche who with her mother and the Frenchman was also lodging in our hotel The latter gentleman was called by the lacqueys Monsieur le Comte and Mlle Blanche s mother was dubbed Madame la Comtesse Perhaps in very truth they WERE Comte et Comtesse I knew that Monsieur le Comte would take no notice of me when we met at dinner as also that the General would not dream of introducing us nor of recommending me to the Comte However the latter had lived awhile in Russia and knew that the person referred to as an uchitel is never looked upon as a bird of fine feather Of course strictly speaking he knew me but I was an uninvited guest at the luncheon the General had forgotten to arrange otherwise or I should have been dispatched to dine at the table d hote Nevertheless I presented myself in such guise that the General looked at me with a touch of approval and though the good Maria Philipovna was for showing me my place the fact of my having previously met the Englishman mister Astley saved me and thenceforward I figured as one of the company This strange Englishman I had met first in Prussia where we had happened to sit vis a vis in a railway train in which I was travelling to overtake our party while later I had run across him in France and again in Switzerland twice within the space of two weeks 
4806_26894_000018_000001	train-clean-360	To think therefore that I should suddenly encounter him again here in Roulettenberg 
4806_26894_000018_000002	train-clean-360	Never in my life had I known a more retiring man for he was shy to the pitch of imbecility yet well aware of the fact for he was no fool 
none	none	At the same time he was a gentle amiable sort of an individual and even on our first encounter in Prussia I had contrived to draw him out and he had told me that he had just been to the North Cape and was now anxious to visit the fair at Nizhni Novgorod 
4806_26894_000018_000004	train-clean-360	How he had come to make the General s acquaintance I do not know but apparently he was much struck with Polina 
4806_26894_000018_000005	train-clean-360	Also he was delighted that I should sit next him at table for he appeared to look upon me as his bosom friend 
none	none	During the meal the Frenchman was in great feather he was discursive and pompous to every one In Moscow too I remembered he had blown a great many bubbles 
4806_26894_000019_000002	train-clean-360	Interminably he discoursed on finance and Russian politics and though at times the General made feints to contradict him he did so humbly and as though wishing not wholly to lose sight of his own dignity 
none	none	For myself I was in a curious frame of mind Even before luncheon was half finished I had asked myself the old eternal question WHY do I continue to dance attendance upon the General instead of having left him and his family long ago Every now and then I would glance at Polina Alexandrovna but she paid me no attention until eventually I became so irritated that I decided to play the boor First of all I suddenly and for no reason whatever plunged loudly and gratuitously into the general conversation Above everything I wanted to pick a quarrel with the Frenchman and with that end in view I turned to the General and exclaimed in an overbearing sort of way indeed I think that I actually interrupted him that that summer it had been almost impossible for a Russian to dine anywhere at tables d hote The General bent upon me a glance of astonishment If one is a man of self respect I went on one risks abuse by so doing and is forced to put up with insults of every kind Both at Paris and on the Rhine and even in Switzerland there are so many Poles with their sympathisers the French at these tables d hote that one cannot get a word in edgeways if one happens only to be a Russian 
4806_26894_000023_000000	train-clean-360	This I said in French 
none	none	The General eyed me doubtfully for he did not know whether to be angry or merely to feel surprised that I should so far forget myself Of course one always learns SOMETHING EVERYWHERE said the Frenchman in a careless contemptuous sort of tone In Paris too I had a dispute with a Pole I continued and then with a French officer who supported him After that a section of the Frenchmen present took my part They did so as soon as I told them the story of how once I threatened to spit into Monsignor s coffee
4806_26894_000026_000000	train-clean-360	 To spit into it the General inquired with grave disapproval in his tone and a stare of astonishment while the Frenchman looked at me unbelievingly 
4806_26894_000027_000000	train-clean-360	 Just so I replied 
none	none	You must know that on one occasion when for two days I had felt certain that at any moment I might have to depart for Rome on business I repaired to the Embassy of the Holy See in Paris to have my passport visaed There I encountered a sacristan of about fifty and a man dry and cold of mien 
4806_26894_000027_000003	train-clean-360	After listening politely but with great reserve to my account of myself this sacristan asked me to wait a little 
none	none	I was in a great hurry to depart but of course I sat down pulled out a copy of L Opinion Nationale and fell to reading an extraordinary piece of invective against Russia which it happened to contain As I was thus engaged I heard some one enter an adjoining room and ask for Monsignor after which I saw the sacristan make a low bow to the visitor and then another bow as the visitor took his leave 
4806_26894_000027_000006	train-clean-360	I ventured to remind the good man of my own business also whereupon with an expression of if anything increased dryness he again asked me to wait 
none	none	Soon a third visitor arrived who like myself had come on business he was an Austrian of some sort and as soon as ever he had stated his errand he was conducted upstairs 
4806_26894_000027_000008	train-clean-360	This made me very angry 
none	none	I rose approached the sacristan and told him that since Monsignor was receiving callers his lordship might just as well finish off my affair as well 
4806_26894_000027_000010	train-clean-360	Upon this the sacristan shrunk back in astonishment 
none	none	It simply passed his understanding that any insignificant Russian should dare to compare himself with other visitors of Monsignor s In a tone of the utmost effrontery as though he were delighted to have a chance of insulting me he looked me up and down and then said Do you suppose that Monsignor is going to put aside his coffee for YOU But I only cried the louder Let me tell you that I am going to SPIT into that coffee
4806_26894_000062_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes 
none	none	and if you do not get me my passport visaed this very minute I shall take it to Monsignor myself What 
4806_26894_000028_000001	train-clean-360	While he is engaged with a Cardinal screeched the sacristan again shrinking back in horror 
none	none	Then rushing to the door he spread out his arms as though he would rather die than let me enter Thereupon I declared that I was a heretic and a barbarian Je suis heretique et barbare I said and that these archbishops and cardinals and monsignors and the rest of them meant nothing at all to me In a word I showed him that I was not going to give way 
4806_26894_000029_000002	train-clean-360	He looked at me with an air of infinite resentment 
none	none	Then he snatched up my passport and departed with it upstairs A minute later the passport had been visaed 
4806_26894_000029_000005	train-clean-360	Here it is now if you care to see it and I pulled out the document and exhibited the Roman visa 
none	none	But the General began
4806_26894_000031_000000	train-clean-360	 What really saved you was the fact that you proclaimed yourself a heretic and a barbarian remarked the Frenchman with a smile 
none	none	Cela n etait pas si bete But is that how Russian subjects ought to be treated 
4806_26894_000032_000001	train-clean-360	Why when they settle here they dare not utter even a word they are ready even to deny the fact that they are Russians 
none	none	At all events at my hotel in Paris I received far more attention from the company after I had told them about the fracas with the sacristan A fat Polish nobleman who had been the most offensive of all who were present at the table d hote at once went upstairs while some of the Frenchmen were simply disgusted when I told them that two years ago I had encountered a man at whom in eighteen twelve a French hero fired for the mere fun of discharging his musket 
4806_26894_000032_000004	train-clean-360	That man was then a boy of ten and his family are still residing in Moscow 
none	none	Impossible the Frenchman spluttered No French soldier would fire at a child
4806_26894_000034_000000	train-clean-360	 Nevertheless the incident was as I say I replied 
4806_26894_000034_000001	train-clean-360	 A very respected ex captain told me the story and I myself could see the scar left on his cheek 
none	none	The Frenchman then began chattering volubly and the General supported him but I recommended the former to read for example extracts from the memoirs of General Perovski who in eighteen twelve was a prisoner in the hands of the French Finally Maria Philipovna said something to interrupt the conversation The General was furious with me for having started the altercation with the Frenchman On the other hand mister Astley seemed to take great pleasure in my brush with Monsieur and rising from the table proposed that we should go and have a drink together The same afternoon at four o clock I went to have my customary talk with Polina Alexandrovna and the talk soon extended to a stroll We entered the Park and approached the Casino where Polina seated herself upon a bench near the fountain and sent Nadia away to a little distance to play with some other children Mischa also I dispatched to play by the fountain and in this fashion we that is to say Polina and myself contrived to find ourselves alone 
4806_26894_000036_000000	train-clean-360	Of course we began by talking on business matters 
4806_26894_000036_000001	train-clean-360	Polina seemed furious when I handed her only seven hundred gulden for she had thought to receive from Paris as the proceeds of the pledging of her diamonds at least two thousand gulden or even more 
4806_26894_000037_000000	train-clean-360	 Come what may I MUST have money she said 
none	none	And get it somehow I will otherwise I shall be ruined I asked her what had happened during my absence Nothing except that two pieces of news have reached us from saint Petersburg 
4806_26894_000039_000001	train-clean-360	In the first place my grandmother is very ill and unlikely to last another couple of days 
4806_26894_000039_000002	train-clean-360	We had this from Timothy Petrovitch himself and he is a reliable person 
4806_26894_000039_000003	train-clean-360	Every moment we are expecting to receive news of the end 
none	none	All of you are on the tiptoe of expectation I queried Of course all of us and every minute of the day For a year and a half now we have been looking for this
4806_26894_000042_000000	train-clean-360	 Looking for it 
4806_26894_000043_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes looking for it 
none	none	I am not her blood relation you know I am merely the General s step daughter Yet I am certain that the old lady has remembered me in her will
4806_26894_000044_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes I believe that you WILL come in for a good deal I said with some assurance 
none	none	Yes for she is fond of me But how come you to think so 
4806_26894_000046_000000	train-clean-360	I answered this question with another one 
4806_26894_000046_000001	train-clean-360	 That Marquis of yours I said is HE also familiar with your family secrets 
4806_26894_000047_000000	train-clean-360	 And why are you yourself so interested in them was her retort as she eyed me with dry grimness 
4806_26894_000048_000000	train-clean-360	 Never mind 
none	none	If I am not mistaken the General has succeeded in borrowing money of the Marquis
4806_26894_000049_000000	train-clean-360	 It may be so 
none	none	Is it likely that the Marquis would have lent the money if he had not known something or other about your grandmother Did you notice too that three times during luncheon when speaking of her he called her La Baboulenka Dear little Grandmother What loving friendly behaviour to be sure Yes that is true As soon as ever he learnt that I was likely to inherit something from her he began to pay me his addresses 
4806_26894_000051_000002	train-clean-360	I thought you ought to know that 
4806_26894_000052_000000	train-clean-360	 Then he has only just begun his courting 
none	none	Why I thought he had been doing so a long while
4806_26894_000053_000000	train-clean-360	 You KNOW he has not retorted Polina angrily 
none	none	But where on earth did you pick up this Englishman She said this after a pause I KNEW you would ask about him Whereupon I told her of my previous encounters with Astley while travelling
4806_26894_000055_000000	train-clean-360	 He is very shy I said and susceptible 
4806_26894_000055_000001	train-clean-360	Also he is in love with you 
4806_26894_000056_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes he is in love with me she replied 
none	none	And he is ten times richer than the Frenchman 
4806_26894_000057_000001	train-clean-360	In fact what does the Frenchman possess 
4806_26894_000057_000002	train-clean-360	To me it seems at least doubtful that he possesses anything at all 
4806_26894_000058_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh no there is no doubt about it 
4806_26894_000058_000001	train-clean-360	He does possess some chateau or other 
4806_26894_000058_000002	train-clean-360	Last night the General told me that for certain 
4806_26894_000058_000003	train-clean-360	NOW are you satisfied 
4806_26894_000059_000000	train-clean-360	 Nevertheless in your place I should marry the Englishman 
none	none	And why asked Polina Because though the Frenchman is the handsomer of the two he is also the baser whereas the Englishman is not only a man of honour but ten times the wealthier of the pair Yes 
4806_26894_000062_000001	train-clean-360	But then the Frenchman is a marquis and the cleverer of the two remarked Polina imperturbably 
4806_26894_000063_000000	train-clean-360	 Is that so I repeated 
4806_26894_000064_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes absolutely 
4806_26894_000065_000000	train-clean-360	Polina was not at all pleased at my questions I could see that she was doing her best to irritate me with the brusquerie of her answers 
4806_26894_000065_000001	train-clean-360	But I took no notice of this 
4806_26894_000066_000000	train-clean-360	 It amuses me to see you grow angry she continued 
none	none	However inasmuch as I allow you to indulge in these questions and conjectures you ought to pay me something for the privilege I consider that I have a perfect right to put these questions to you was my calm retort for the reason that I am ready to pay for them and also care little what becomes of me 
4806_26894_000068_000000	train-clean-360	Polina giggled 
none	none	Last time you told me when on the Shlangenberg that at a word from me you would be ready to jump down a thousand feet into the abyss 
4806_26894_000069_000001	train-clean-360	Some day I may remind you of that saying in order to see if you will be as good as your word 
none	none	Yes you may depend upon it that I shall do so 
4806_26894_000069_000003	train-clean-360	I hate you because I have allowed you to go to such lengths and I also hate you and still more because you are so necessary to me 
4806_26894_000069_000004	train-clean-360	For the time being I want you so I must keep you 
4806_26894_000070_000000	train-clean-360	Then she made a movement to rise 
4806_26894_000070_000001	train-clean-360	Her tone had sounded very angry Indeed of late her talks with me had invariably ended on a note of temper and irritation yes of real temper 
none	none	May I ask you who is this Mlle Blanche I inquired since I did not wish Polina to depart without an explanation You KNOW who she is just Mlle Blanche 
4806_26894_000072_000002	train-clean-360	Nothing further has transpired 
none	none	Probably she will soon be Madame General that is to say if the rumours that Grandmamma is nearing her end should prove true Mlle 
4806_26894_000072_000004	train-clean-360	Blanche with her mother and her cousin the Marquis know very well that as things now stand we are ruined 
none	none	And is the General at last in love
4806_26894_000074_000000	train-clean-360	 That has nothing to do with it 
4806_26894_000074_000001	train-clean-360	Listen to me 
4806_26894_000074_000002	train-clean-360	Take these seven hundred florins and go and play roulette with them 
none	none	Win as much for me as you can for I am badly in need of money 
4806_26894_000075_000000	train-clean-360	So saying she called Nadia back to her side and entered the Casino where she joined the rest of our party 
none	none	For myself I took in musing astonishment the first path to the left 
4806_26894_000075_000002	train-clean-360	Something had seemed to strike my brain when she told me to go and play roulette 
none	none	Strangely enough that something had also seemed to make me hesitate and to set me analysing my feelings with regard to her In fact during the two weeks of my absence I had felt far more at my ease than I did now on the day of my return although while travelling I had moped like an imbecile rushed about like a man in a fever and actually beheld her in my dreams 
4806_26894_000075_000005	train-clean-360	Indeed on one occasion this happened in Switzerland when I was asleep in the train I had spoken aloud to her and set all my fellow travellers laughing 
4806_26894_000075_000006	train-clean-360	Again therefore I put to myself the question Do I or do I not love her and again I could return myself no answer or rather for the hundredth time I told myself that I detested her 
none	none	Yes I detested her there were moments more especially at the close of our talks together when I would gladly have given half my life to have strangled her I swear that had there at such moments been a sharp knife ready to my hand I would have seized that knife with pleasure and plunged it into her breast Yet I also swear that if on the Shlangenberg she had REALLY said to me Leap into that abyss I should have leapt into it and with equal pleasure 
4806_26894_000075_000010	train-clean-360	Yes this I knew well 
none	none	One way or the other the thing must soon be ended She too knew it in some curious way the thought that I was fully conscious of her inaccessibility and of the impossibility of my ever realising my dreams afforded her I am certain the keenest possible pleasure Otherwise is it likely that she the cautious and clever woman that she was would have indulged in this familiarity and openness with me 
4806_26894_000075_000013	train-clean-360	Hitherto I concluded she had looked upon me in the same light that the old Empress did upon her servant the Empress who hesitated not to unrobe herself before her slave since she did not account a slave a man 
4806_26894_000075_000014	train-clean-360	Yes often Polina must have taken me for something less than a man 
4806_26894_000076_000000	train-clean-360	Still she had charged me with a commission to win what I could at roulette 
4806_26894_000076_000001	train-clean-360	Yet all the time I could not help wondering WHY it was so necessary for her to win something and what new schemes could have sprung to birth in her ever fertile brain 
none	none	A host of new and unknown factors seemed to have arisen during the last two weeks 
4806_26894_000076_000003	train-clean-360	Well it behoved me to divine them and to probe them and that as soon as possible 
none	none	Yet not now at the present moment I must repair to the roulette table II I confess I did not like it Although I had made up my mind to play I felt averse to doing so on behalf of some one else 
4806_26895_000001_000002	train-clean-360	In fact it almost upset my balance and I entered the gaming rooms with an angry feeling at my heart 
4806_26895_000001_000003	train-clean-360	At first glance the scene irritated me 
none	none	Never at any time have I been able to bear the flunkeyishness which one meets in the Press of the world at large but more especially in that of Russia where almost every evening journalists write on two subjects in particular namely on the splendour and luxury of the casinos to be found in the Rhenish towns and on the heaps of gold which are daily to be seen lying on their tables 
4806_26895_000001_000005	train-clean-360	Those journalists are not paid for doing so they write thus merely out of a spirit of disinterested complaisance 
none	none	For there is nothing splendid about the establishments in question and not only are there no heaps of gold to be seen lying on their tables but also there is very little money to be seen at all Of course during the season some madman or another may make his appearance generally an Englishman or an Asiatic or a Turk and as had happened during the summer of which I write win or lose a great deal but as regards the rest of the crowd it plays only for petty gulden and seldom does much wealth figure on the board When on the present occasion I entered the gaming rooms for the first time in my life it was several moments before I could even make up my mind to play 
4806_26895_000002_000001	train-clean-360	For one thing the crowd oppressed me 
none	none	Had I been playing for myself I think I should have left at once and never have embarked upon gambling at all for I could feel my heart beginning to beat and my heart was anything but cold blooded Also I knew I had long ago made up my mind that never should I depart from Roulettenberg until some radical some final change had taken place in my fortunes Thus it must and would be 
4806_26895_000002_000004	train-clean-360	However ridiculous it may seem to you that I was expecting to win at roulette I look upon the generally accepted opinion concerning the folly and the grossness of hoping to win at gambling as a thing even more absurd 
none	none	For why is gambling a whit worse than any other method of acquiring money 
4806_26895_000002_000006	train-clean-360	How for instance is it worse than trade 
4806_26895_000002_000007	train-clean-360	True out of a hundred persons only one can win yet what business is that of yours or of mine 
none	none	At all events I confined myself at first simply to looking on and decided to attempt nothing serious Indeed I felt that if I began to do anything at all I should do it in an absent minded haphazard sort of way of that I felt certain Also it behoved me to learn the game itself since despite a thousand descriptions of roulette which I had read with ceaseless avidity I knew nothing of its rules and had never even seen it played In the first place everything about it seemed to me so foul so morally mean and foul Yet I am not speaking of the hungry restless folk who by scores nay even by hundreds could be seen crowded around the gaming tables For in a desire to win quickly and to win much I can see nothing sordid I have always applauded the opinion of a certain dead and gone but cocksure moralist who replied to the excuse that one may always gamble moderately by saying that to do so makes things worse since in that case the profits too will always be moderate Insignificant profits and sumptuous profits do not stand on the same footing No it is all a matter of proportion What may seem a small sum to a Rothschild may seem a large sum to me and it is not the fault of stakes or of winnings that everywhere men can be found winning can be found depriving their fellows of something just as they do at roulette 
4806_26895_000005_000003	train-clean-360	As to the question whether stakes and winnings are in themselves immoral is another question altogether and I wish to express no opinion upon it 
none	none	Yet the very fact that I was full of a strong desire to win caused this gambling for gain in spite of its attendant squalor to contain if you will something intimate something sympathetic to my eyes for it is always pleasant to see men dispensing with ceremony and acting naturally and in an unbuttoned mood Yet why should I so deceive myself I could see that the whole thing was a vain and unreasoning pursuit and what at the first glance seemed to me the ugliest feature in this mob of roulette players was their respect for their occupation the seriousness and even the humility with which they stood around the gaming tables Moreover I had always drawn sharp distinctions between a game which is de mauvais genre and a game which is permissible to a decent man In fact there are two sorts of gaming namely the game of the gentleman and the game of the plebs the game for gain and the game of the herd 
4806_26895_000006_000004	train-clean-360	Herein as said I draw sharp distinctions 
none	none	Yet how essentially base are the distinctions For instance a gentleman may stake say five or ten louis d or seldom more unless he is a very rich man when he may stake say a thousand francs but he must do this simply for the love of the game itself simply for sport simply in order to observe the process of winning or of losing and above all things as a man who remains quite uninterested in the possibility of his issuing a winner If he wins he will be at liberty perhaps to give vent to a laugh or to pass a remark on the circumstance to a bystander or to stake again or to double his stake but even this he must do solely out of curiosity and for the pleasure of watching the play of chances and of calculations and not because of any vulgar desire to win In a word he must look upon the gaming table upon roulette and upon trente et quarante as mere relaxations which have been arranged solely for his amusement Of the existence of the lures and gains upon which the bank is founded and maintained he must profess to have not an inkling Best of all he ought to imagine his fellow gamblers and the rest of the mob which stands trembling over a coin to be equally rich and gentlemanly with himself and playing solely for recreation and pleasure This complete ignorance of the realities this innocent view of mankind is what in my opinion constitutes the truly aristocratic For instance I have seen even fond mothers so far indulge their guileless elegant daughters misses of fifteen or sixteen as to give them a few gold coins and teach them how to play and though the young ladies may have won or have lost they have invariably laughed and departed as though they were well pleased 
4806_26895_000006_000012	train-clean-360	In the same way I saw our General once approach the table in a stolid important manner 
none	none	A lacquey darted to offer him a chair but the General did not even notice him 
4806_26895_000006_000014	train-clean-360	Slowly he took out his money bags and slowly extracted three hundred francs in gold which he staked on the black and won 
none	none	Yet he did not take up his winnings he left them there on the table Again the black turned up and again he did not gather in what he had won and when in the third round the RED turned up he lost at a stroke twelve hundred francs Yet even then he rose with a smile and thus preserved his reputation yet I knew that his money bags must be chafing his heart as well as that had the stake been twice or thrice as much again he would still have restrained himself from venting his disappointment On the other hand I saw a Frenchman first win and then lose thirty thousand francs cheerfully and without a murmur Yes even if a gentleman should lose his whole substance he must never give way to annoyance Money must be so subservient to gentility as never to be worth a thought 
4806_26895_000007_000002	train-clean-360	Of course the SUPREMELY aristocratic thing is to be entirely oblivious of the mire of rabble with its setting but sometimes a reverse course may be aristocratic to remark to scan and even to gape at the mob for preference through a lorgnette even as though one were taking the crowd and its squalor for a sort of raree show which had been organised specially for a gentleman s diversion 
none	none	Though one may be squeezed by the crowd one must look as though one were fully assured of being the observer of having neither part nor lot with the observed 
4806_26895_000007_000004	train-clean-360	At the same time to stare fixedly about one is unbecoming for that again is ungentlemanly seeing that no spectacle is worth an open stare are no spectacles in the world which merit from a gentleman too pronounced an inspection 
4806_26895_000008_000000	train-clean-360	However to me personally the scene DID seem to be worth undisguised contemplation more especially in view of the fact that I had come there not only to look at but also to number myself sincerely and wholeheartedly with the mob 
4806_26895_000008_000001	train-clean-360	As for my secret moral views I had no room for them amongst my actual practical opinions 
none	none	Let that stand as written I am writing only to relieve my conscience Yet let me say also this that from the first I have been consistent in having an intense aversion to any trial of my acts and thoughts by a moral standard 
4806_26895_000008_000004	train-clean-360	Another standard altogether has directed my life 
none	none	As a matter of fact the mob was playing in exceedingly foul fashion Indeed I have an idea that sheer robbery was going on around that gaming table The croupiers who sat at the two ends of it had not only to watch the stakes but also to calculate the game an immense amount of work for two men 
4806_26895_000009_000002	train-clean-360	As for the crowd itself well it consisted mostly of Frenchmen 
none	none	Yet I was not then taking notes merely in order to be able to give you a description of roulette but in order to get my bearings as to my behaviour when I myself should begin to play For example I noticed that nothing was more common than for another s hand to stretch out and grab one s winnings whenever one had won Then there would arise a dispute and frequently an uproar and it would be a case of I beg of you to prove and to produce witnesses to the fact that the stake is yours 
4806_26895_000010_000000	train-clean-360	At first the proceedings were pure Greek to me 
4806_26895_000010_000001	train-clean-360	I could only divine and distinguish that stakes were hazarded on numbers on odd or even and on colours 
none	none	Polina s money I decided to risk that evening only to the amount of one hundred gulden The thought that I was not going to play for myself quite unnerved me 
4806_26895_000010_000004	train-clean-360	It was an unpleasant sensation and I tried hard to banish it 
4806_26895_000010_000005	train-clean-360	I had a feeling that once I had begun to play for Polina I should wreck my own fortunes 
4806_26895_000010_000006	train-clean-360	Also I wonder if any one has EVER approached a gaming table without falling an immediate prey to superstition 
4806_26895_000010_000007	train-clean-360	I began by pulling out fifty gulden and staking them on even The wheel spun and stopped at thirteen 
4806_26895_000010_000008	train-clean-360	I had lost 
none	none	With a feeling like a sick qualm as though I would like to make my way out of the crowd and go home I staked another fifty gulden this time on the red The red turned up Next time I staked the one hundred gulden just where they lay and again the red turned up 
4806_26895_000010_000011	train-clean-360	Again I staked the whole sum and again the red turned up 
4806_26895_000010_000012	train-clean-360	Clutching my four hundred gulden I placed two hundred of them on twelve figures to see what would come of it 
none	none	The result was that the croupier paid me out three times my total stake Thus from one hundred gulden my store had grown to eight hundred Upon that such a curious such an inexplicable unwonted feeling overcame me that I decided to depart Always the thought kept recurring to me that if I had been playing for myself alone I should never have had such luck Once more I staked the whole eight hundred gulden on the even The wheel stopped at four I was paid out another eight hundred gulden and snatching up my pile of sixteen hundred departed in search of Polina Alexandrovna I found the whole party walking in the park and was able to get an interview with her only after supper This time the Frenchman was absent from the meal and the General seemed to be in a more expansive vein Among other things he thought it necessary to remind me that he would be sorry to see me playing at the gaming tables 
4806_26895_000011_000003	train-clean-360	In his opinion such conduct would greatly compromise him especially if I were to lose much 
none	none	And even if you were to WIN much I should be compromised he added in a meaning sort of way
4806_26895_000011_000005	train-clean-360	 Of course I have no RIGHT to order your actions but you yourself will agree that As usual he did not finish his sentence 
none	none	I answered drily that I had very little money in my possession and that consequently I was hardly in a position to indulge in any conspicuous play even if I did gamble At last when ascending to my own room I succeeded in handing Polina her winnings and told her that next time I should not play for her
4806_26895_000012_000000	train-clean-360	 Why not she asked excitedly 
none	none	Because I wish to play FOR MYSELF I replied with a feigned glance of astonishment That is my sole reason Then are you so certain that your roulette playing will get us out of our difficulties she inquired with a quizzical smile 
4806_26895_000015_000000	train-clean-360	I said very seriously Yes and then added Possibly my certainty about winning may seem to you ridiculous yet pray leave me in peace 
none	none	Nonetheless she insisted that I ought to go halves with her in the day s winnings and offered me eight hundred gulden on condition that henceforth I gambled only on those terms but I refused to do so once and for all stating as my reason that I found myself unable to play on behalf of any one else I am not unwilling so to do I added but in all probability I should lose
4806_26895_000017_000000	train-clean-360	 Well absurd though it be I place great hopes on your playing of roulette she remarked musingly wherefore you ought to play as my partner and on equal shares wherefore of course you will do as I wish 
none	none	Then she left me without listening to any further protests on my part III On the morrow she said not a word to me about gambling In fact she purposely avoided me although her old manner to me had not changed the same serene coolness was hers on meeting me a coolness that was mingled even with a spice of contempt and dislike In short she was at no pains to conceal her aversion to me That I could see plainly Also she did not trouble to conceal from me the fact that I was necessary to her and that she was keeping me for some end which she had in view Consequently there became established between us relations which to a large extent were incomprehensible to me considering her general pride and aloofness For example although she knew that I was madly in love with her she allowed me to speak to her of my passion though she could not well have showed her contempt for me more than by permitting me unhindered and unrebuked to mention to her my love You see her attitude expressed how little I regard your feelings as well as how little I care for what you say to me or for what you feel for me Likewise though she spoke as before concerning her affairs it was never with complete frankness In her contempt for me there were refinements Although she knew well that I was aware of a certain circumstance in her life of something which might one day cause her trouble she would speak to me about her affairs whenever she had need of me for a given end as though I were a slave or a passing acquaintance yet tell them me only in so far as one would need to know them if one were going to be made temporary use of Had I not known the whole chain of events or had she not seen how much I was pained and disturbed by her teasing insistency she would never have thought it worthwhile to soothe me with this frankness even though since she not infrequently used me to execute commissions that were not only troublesome but risky she ought in my opinion to have been frank in ANY case But forsooth it was not worth her while to trouble about MY feelings about the fact that I was uneasy and perhaps thrice as put about by her cares and misfortunes as she was herself For three weeks I had known of her intention to take to roulette She had even warned me that she would like me to play on her behalf since it was unbecoming for her to play in person and from the tone of her words I had gathered that there was something on her mind besides a mere desire to win money As if money could matter to HER No she had some end in view and there were circumstances at which I could guess but which I did not know for certain True the slavery and abasement in which she held me might have given me such things often do so the power to question her with abrupt directness seeing that inasmuch as I figured in her eyes as a mere slave and nonentity she could not very well have taken offence at any rude curiosity but the fact was that though she let me question her she never returned me a single answer and at times did not so much as notice me That is how matters stood Next day there was a good deal of talk about a telegram which four days ago had been sent to saint Petersburg but to which there had come no answer The General was visibly disturbed and moody for the matter concerned his mother The Frenchman too was excited and after dinner the whole party talked long and seriously together the Frenchman s tone being extraordinarily presumptuous and offhand to everybody It almost reminded one of the proverb Invite a man to your table and soon he will place his feet upon it Even to Polina he was brusque almost to the point of rudeness Yet still he seemed glad to join us in our walks in the Casino or in our rides and drives about the town I had long been aware of certain circumstances which bound the General to him I had long been aware that in Russia they had hatched some scheme together although I did not know whether the plot had come to anything or whether it was still only in the stage of being talked of Likewise I was aware in part of a family secret namely that last year the Frenchman had bailed the General out of debt and given him thirty thousand roubles wherewith to pay his Treasury dues on retiring from the service And now of course the General was in a vice although the chief part in the affair was being played by Mlle Blanche Yes of this last I had no doubt But WHO was this Mlle Blanche It was said of her that she was a Frenchwoman of good birth who living with her mother possessed a colossal fortune It was also said that she was some relation to the Marquis but only a distant one a cousin or cousin german or something of the sort Likewise I knew that up to the time of my journey to Paris she and the Frenchman had been more ceremonious towards our party they had stood on a much more precise and delicate footing with them but that now their acquaintanceship their friendship their intimacy had taken on a much more off hand and rough and ready air Perhaps they thought that our means were too modest for them and therefore unworthy of politeness or reticence Also for the last three days I had noticed certain looks which Astley had kept throwing at Mlle Blanche and her mother and it had occurred to me that he must have had some previous acquaintance with the pair I had even surmised that the Frenchman too must have met mister Astley before Astley was a man so shy reserved and taciturn in his manner that one might have looked for anything from him At all events the Frenchman accorded him only the slightest of greetings and scarcely even looked at him Certainly he did not seem to be afraid of him which was intelligible enough But why did Mlle Blanche also never look at the Englishman particularly since a propos of something or another the Marquis had declared the Englishman to be immensely and indubitably rich Was not that a sufficient reason to make Mlle Blanche look at the Englishman Anyway the General seemed extremely uneasy and one could well understand what a telegram to announce the death of his mother would mean for him Although I thought it probable that Polina was avoiding me for a definite reason I adopted a cold and indifferent air for I felt pretty certain that it would not be long before she herself approached me For two days therefore I devoted my attention to Mlle Blanche The poor General was in despair To fall in love at fifty five and with such vehemence is indeed a misfortune And add to that his widowerhood his children his ruined property his debts and the woman with whom he had fallen in love Though Mlle Blanche was extremely good looking I may or may not be understood when I say that she had one of those faces which one is afraid of At all events I myself have always feared such women Apparently about twenty five years of age she was tall and broad shouldered with shoulders that sloped yet though her neck and bosom were ample in their proportions her skin was dull yellow in colour while her hair which was extremely abundant sufficient to make two coiffures was as black as Indian ink Add to that a pair of black eyes with yellowish whites a proud glance gleaming teeth and lips which were perennially pomaded and redolent of musk As for her dress it was invariably rich effective and chic yet in good taste Lastly her feet and hands were astonishing and her voice a deep contralto Sometimes when she laughed she displayed her teeth but at ordinary times her air was taciturn and haughty especially in the presence of Polina and Maria Philipovna Yet she seemed to me almost destitute of education and even of wits though cunning and suspicious This apparently was not because her life had been lacking in incident Perhaps if all were known the Marquis was not her kinsman at all nor her mother her mother but there was evidence that in Berlin where we had first come across the pair they had possessed acquaintances of good standing As for the Marquis himself I doubt to this day if he was a Marquis although about the fact that he had formerly belonged to high society for instance in Moscow and Germany there could be no doubt whatever What he had formerly been in France I had not a notion All I knew was that he was said to possess a chateau During the last two weeks I had looked for much to transpire but am still ignorant whether at that time anything decisive ever passed between Mademoiselle and the General Everything seemed to depend upon our means upon whether the General would be able to flourish sufficient money in her face If ever the news should arrive that the grandmother was not dead Mlle Blanche I felt sure would disappear in a twinkling Indeed it surprised and amused me to observe what a passion for intrigue I was developing But how I loathed it all With what pleasure would I have given everybody and everything the go by Only I could not leave Polina How then could I show contempt for those who surrounded her Espionage is a base thing but what have I to do with that mister Astley too I found a curious person I was only sure that he had fallen in love with Polina A remarkable and diverting circumstance is the amount which may lie in the mien of a shy and painfully modest man who has been touched with the divine passion especially when he would rather sink into the earth than betray himself by a single word or look Though mister Astley frequently met us when we were out walking he would merely take off his hat and pass us by though I knew he was dying to join us Even when invited to do so he would refuse Again in places of amusement in the Casino at concerts or near the fountain he was never far from the spot where we were sitting In fact WHEREVER we were in the Park in the forest or on the Shlangenberg one needed but to raise one s eyes and glance around to catch sight of at least a PORTION of mister Astley s frame sticking out whether on an adjacent path or behind a bush Yet never did he lose any chance of speaking to myself and one morning when we had met and exchanged a couple of words he burst out in his usual abrupt way without saying Good morning That Mlle Blanche he said Well I have seen a good many women like her After that he was silent as he looked me meaningly in the face What he meant I did not know but to my glance of inquiry he returned only a dry nod and a reiterated It is so Presently however he resumed Does Mlle Polina like flowers I really cannot say was my reply What You cannot say he cried in great astonishment No I have never noticed whether she does so or not I repeated with a smile Hm Then I have an idea in my mind he concluded Lastly with a nod he walked away with a pleased expression on his face The conversation had been carried on in execrable French IV Today has been a day of folly stupidity and ineptness The time is now eleven o clock in the evening and I am sitting in my room and thinking It all began this morning with my being forced to go and play roulette for Polina Alexandrovna When she handed me over her store of six hundred gulden I exacted two conditions namely that I should not go halves with her in her winnings if any that is to say I should not take anything for myself and that she should explain to me that same evening why it was so necessary for her to win and how much was the sum which she needed For I could not suppose that she was doing all this merely for the sake of money Yet clearly she did need some money and that as soon as possible and for a special purpose Well she promised to explain matters and I departed There was a tremendous crowd in the gaming rooms What an arrogant greedy crowd it was I pressed forward towards the middle of the room until I had secured a seat at a croupier s elbow Then I began to play in timid fashion venturing only twenty or thirty gulden at a time Meanwhile I observed and took notes It seemed to me that calculation was superfluous and by no means possessed of the importance which certain other players attached to it even though they sat with ruled papers in their hands whereon they set down the coups calculated the chances reckoned staked and lost exactly as we more simple mortals did who played without any reckoning at all However I deduced from the scene one conclusion which seemed to me reliable namely that in the flow of fortuitous chances there is if not a system at all events a sort of order This of course is a very strange thing For instance after a dozen middle figures there would always occur a dozen or so outer ones Suppose the ball stopped twice at a dozen outer figures it would then pass to a dozen of the first ones and then again to a dozen of the middle ciphers and fall upon them three or four times and then revert to a dozen outers whence after another couple of rounds the ball would again pass to the first figures strike upon them once and then return thrice to the middle series continuing thus for an hour and a half or two hours One three two one three two It was all very curious Again for the whole of a day or a morning the red would alternate with the black but almost without any order and from moment to moment so that scarcely two consecutive rounds would end upon either the one or the other Yet next day or perhaps the next evening the red alone would turn up and attain a run of over two score and continue so for quite a length of time say for a whole day Of these circumstances the majority were pointed out to me by mister Astley who stood by the gaming table the whole morning yet never once staked in person For myself I lost all that I had on me and with great speed To begin with I staked two hundred gulden on even and won Then I staked the same amount again and won and so on some two or three times At one moment I must have had in my hands gathered there within a space of five minutes about four thousand gulden That of course was the proper moment for me to have departed but there arose in me a strange sensation as of a challenge to Fate as of a wish to deal her a blow on the cheek and to put out my tongue at her Accordingly I set down the largest stake allowed by the rules namely four thousand gulden and lost Fired by this mishap I pulled out all the money left to me staked it all on the same venture and again lost Then I rose from the table feeling as though I were stupefied What had happened to me I did not know but before luncheon I told Polina of my losses until which time I walked about the Park At luncheon I was as excited as I had been at the meal three days ago Mlle Blanche and the Frenchman were lunching with us and it appeared that the former had been to the Casino that morning and had seen my exploits there So now she showed me more attention when talking to me while for his part the Frenchman approached me and asked outright if it had been my own money that I had lost He appeared to be suspicious as to something being on foot between Polina and myself but I merely fired up and replied that the money had been all my own At this the General seemed extremely surprised and asked me whence I had procured it whereupon I replied that though I had begun only with one hundred gulden six or seven rounds had increased my capital to five thousand or six thousand gulden and that subsequently I had lost the whole in two rounds All this of course was plausible enough During my recital I glanced at Polina but nothing was to be discerned on her face However she had allowed me to fire up without correcting me and from that I concluded that it was my cue to fire up and to conceal the fact that I had been playing on her behalf At all events I thought to myself she in her turn has promised to give me an explanation to night and to reveal to me something or another Although the General appeared to be taking stock of me he said nothing Yet I could see uneasiness and annoyance in his face Perhaps his straitened circumstances made it hard for him to have to hear of piles of gold passing through the hands of an irresponsible fool like myself within the space of a quarter of an hour Now I have an idea that last night he and the Frenchman had a sharp encounter with one another At all events they closeted themselves together and then had a long and vehement discussion after which the Frenchman departed in what appeared to be a passion but returned early this morning to renew the combat On hearing of my losses however he only remarked with a sharp and even a malicious air that a man ought to go more carefully Next for some reason or another he added that though a great many Russians go in for gambling they are no good at the game I think that roulette was devised specially for Russians I retorted and when the Frenchman smiled contemptuously at my reply I further remarked that I was sure I was right also that speaking of Russians in the capacity of gamblers I had far more blame for them than praise of that he could be quite sure Upon what do you base your opinion he inquired Upon the fact that to the virtues and merits of the civilised Westerner there has become historically added though this is not his chief point a capacity for acquiring capital whereas not only is the Russian incapable of acquiring capital but also he exhausts it wantonly and of sheer folly None the less we Russians often need money wherefore we are glad of and greatly devoted to a method of acquisition like roulette whereby in a couple of hours one may grow rich without doing any work This method I repeat has a great attraction for us but since we play in wanton fashion and without taking any trouble we almost invariably lose To a certain extent that is true assented the Frenchman with a self satisfied air Oh no it is not true put in the General sternly And you he added to me you ought to be ashamed of yourself for traducing your own country I beg pardon I said Yet it would be difficult to say which is the worst of the two Russian ineptitude or the German method of growing rich through honest toil What an extraordinary idea cried the General And what a RUSSIAN idea added the Frenchman I smiled for I was rather glad to have a quarrel with them I would rather live a wandering life in tents I cried than bow the knee to a German idol To WHAT idol exclaimed the General now seriously angry To the German method of heaping up riches I have not been here very long but I can tell you that what I have seen and verified makes my Tartar blood boil Good Lord I wish for no virtues of that kind Yesterday I went for a walk of about ten versts and everywhere I found that things were even as we read of them in good German picture books that every house has its Fater who is horribly beneficent and extraordinarily honourable So honourable is he that it is dreadful to have anything to do with him and I cannot bear people of that sort Each such Fater has his family and in the evenings they read improving books aloud Over their roof trees there murmur elms and chestnuts the sun has sunk to his rest a stork is roosting on the gable and all is beautifully poetic and touching Do not be angry General Let me tell you something that is even more touching than that I can remember how of an evening my own father now dead used to sit under the lime trees in his little garden and to read books aloud to myself and my mother Yes I know how things ought to be done Yet every German family is bound to slavery and to submission to its Fater They work like oxen and amass wealth like Jews Suppose the Fater has put by a certain number of gulden which he hands over to his eldest son in order that the said son may acquire a trade or a small plot of land Well one result is to deprive the daughter of a dowry and so leave her among the unwedded For the same reason the parents will have to sell the younger son into bondage or the ranks of the army in order that he may earn more towards the family capital Yes such things ARE done for I have been making inquiries on the subject It is all done out of sheer rectitude out of a rectitude which is magnified to the point of the younger son believing that he has been RIGHTLY sold and that it is simply idyllic for the victim to rejoice when he is made over into pledge What more have I to tell Well this that matters bear just as hardly upon the eldest son Perhaps he has his Gretchen to whom his heart is bound but he cannot marry her for the reason that he has not yet amassed sufficient gulden So the pair wait on in a mood of sincere and virtuous expectation and smilingly deposit themselves in pawn the while Gretchen s cheeks grow sunken and she begins to wither until at last after some twenty years their substance has multiplied and sufficient gulden have been honourably and virtuously accumulated Then the Fater blesses his forty year old heir and the thirty five year old Gretchen with the sunken bosom and the scarlet nose after which he bursts into tears reads the pair a lesson on morality and dies In turn the eldest son becomes a virtuous Fater and the old story begins again In fifty or sixty years time the grandson of the original Fater will have amassed a considerable sum and that sum he will hand over to his son and the latter to HIS son and so on for several generations until at length there will issue a Baron Rothschild or a Hoppe and Company or the devil knows what Is it not a beautiful spectacle the spectacle of a century or two of inherited labour patience intellect rectitude character perseverance and calculation with a stork sitting on the roof above it all What is more they think there can never be anything better than this wherefore from their point of view they begin to judge the rest of the world and to censure all who are at fault that is to say who are not exactly like themselves Yes there you have it in a nutshell For my own part I would rather grow fat after the Russian manner or squander my whole substance at roulette I have no wish to be Hoppe and Company at the end of five generations I want the money for MYSELF for in no way do I look upon my personality as necessary to or meet to be given over to capital I may be wrong but there you have it Those are MY views How far you may be right in what you have said I do not know remarked the General moodily but I DO know that you are becoming an insufferable farceur whenever you are given the least chance As usual he left his sentence unfinished Indeed whenever he embarked upon anything that in the least exceeded the limits of daily small talk he left unfinished what he was saying The Frenchman had listened to me contemptuously with a slight protruding of his eyes but he could not have understood very much of my harangue As for Polina she had looked on with serene indifference She seemed to have heard neither my voice nor any other during the progress of the meal V Yes she had been extraordinarily meditative Yet on leaving the table she immediately ordered me to accompany her for a walk We took the children with us and set out for the fountain in the Park I was in such an irritated frame of mind that in rude and abrupt fashion I blurted out a question as to why our Marquis de Griers had ceased to accompany her for strolls or to speak to her for days together Because he is a brute she replied in rather a curious way It was the first time that I had heard her speak so of De Griers consequently I was momentarily awed into silence by this expression of resentment Have you noticed too that today he is by no means on good terms with the General I went on Yes and I suppose you want to know why she replied with dry captiousness You are aware are you not that the General is mortgaged to the Marquis with all his property Consequently if the General s mother does not die the Frenchman will become the absolute possessor of everything which he now holds only in pledge Then it is really the case that everything is mortgaged I have heard rumours to that effect but was unaware how far they might be true Yes they ARE true What then Why it will be a case of Farewell Mlle Blanche I remarked for in such an event she would never become Madame General Do you know I believe the old man is so much in love with her that he will shoot himself if she should throw him over At his age it is a dangerous thing to fall in love Yes something I believe WILL happen to him assented Polina thoughtfully And what a fine thing it all is I continued Could anything be more abominable than the way in which she has agreed to marry for money alone Not one of the decencies has been observed the whole affair has taken place without the least ceremony And as for the grandmother what could be more comical yet more dastardly than the sending of telegram after telegram to know if she is dead What do you think of it Polina Alexandrovna Yes it is very horrible she interrupted with a shudder Consequently I am the more surprised that YOU should be so cheerful What are YOU so pleased about About the fact that you have gone and lost my money What The money that you gave me to lose I told you I should never win for other people least of all for you I obeyed you simply because you ordered me to but you must not blame me for the result I warned you that no good would ever come of it You seem much depressed at having lost your money Why do you need it so greatly Why do YOU ask me these questions Because you promised to explain matters to me Listen I am certain that as soon as ever I begin to play for myself and I still have one hundred twenty gulden left I shall win You can then take of me what you require She made a contemptuous grimace You must not be angry with me I continued for making such a proposal I am so conscious of being only a nonentity in your eyes that you need not mind accepting money from me A gift from me could not possibly offend you Moreover it was I who lost your gulden She glanced at me but seeing that I was in an irritable sarcastic mood changed the subject My affairs cannot possibly interest you she said Still if you DO wish to know I am in debt I borrowed some money and must pay it back again I have a curious senseless idea that I am bound to win at the gaming tables Why I think so I cannot tell but I do think so and with some assurance Perhaps it is because of that assurance that I now find myself without any other resource Or perhaps it is because it is so NECESSARY for you to win It is like a drowning man catching at a straw You yourself will agree that unless he were drowning he would not mistake a straw for the trunk of a tree Polina looked surprised What she said Do not you also hope something from it Did you not tell me again and again two weeks ago that you were certain of winning at roulette if you played here And did you not ask me not to consider you a fool for doing so Were you joking You cannot have been for I remember that you spoke with a gravity which forbade the idea of your jesting True I replied gloomily I always felt certain that I should win Indeed what you say makes me ask myself Why have my absurd senseless losses of today raised a doubt in my mind Yet I am still positive that so soon as ever I begin to play for myself I shall infallibly win And why are you so certain To tell the truth I do not know I only know that I must win that it is the one resource I have left Yes why do I feel so assured on the point Perhaps because one cannot help winning if one is fanatically certain of doing so Yet I dare wager that you do not think me capable of serious feeling in the matter I do not care whether you are so or not answered Polina with calm indifference Well since you ask me I DO doubt your ability to take anything seriously You are capable of worrying but not deeply You are too ill regulated and unsettled a person for that But why do you want money Not a single one of the reasons which you have given can be looked upon as serious By the way I interrupted you say you want to pay off a debt It must be a large one Is it to the Frenchman What do you mean by asking all these questions You are very clever today Surely you are not drunk You know that you and I stand on no ceremony and that sometimes I put to you very plain questions I repeat that I am your slave and slaves cannot be shamed or offended You talk like a child It is always possible to comport oneself with dignity If one has a quarrel it ought to elevate rather than to degrade one A maxim straight from the copybook Suppose I CANNOT comport myself with dignity By that I mean that though I am a man of self respect I am unable to carry off a situation properly Do you know the reason It is because we Russians are too richly and multifariously gifted to be able at once to find the proper mode of expression It is all a question of mode Most of us are so bounteously endowed with intellect as to require also a spice of genius to choose the right form of behaviour And genius is lacking in us for the reason that so little genius at all exists It belongs only to the French though a few other Europeans have elaborated their forms so well as to be able to figure with extreme dignity and yet be wholly undignified persons That is why with us the mode is so all important The Frenchman may receive an insult a real a venomous insult yet he will not so much as frown But a tweaking of the nose he cannot bear for the reason that such an act is an infringement of the accepted of the time hallowed order of decorum That is why our good ladies are so fond of Frenchmen the Frenchman s manners they say are perfect But in my opinion there is no such thing as a Frenchman s manners The Frenchman is only a bird the coq gaulois At the same time as I am not a woman I do not properly understand the question Cocks may be excellent birds If I am wrong you must stop me You ought to stop and correct me more often when I am speaking to you for I am too apt to say everything that is in my head You see I have lost my manners I agree that I have none nor yet any dignity I will tell you why I set no store upon such things Everything in me has undergone a cheek You know the reason I have not a single human thought in my head For a long while I have been ignorant of what is going on in the world here or in Russia I have been to Dresden yet am completely in the dark as to what Dresden is like You know the cause of my obsession I have no hope now and am a mere cipher in your eyes wherefore I tell you outright that wherever I go I see only you all the rest is a matter of indifference Why or how I have come to love you I do not know It may be that you are not altogether fair to look upon Do you know I am ignorant even as to what your face is like In all probability too your heart is not comely and it is possible that your mind is wholly ignoble And because you do not believe in my nobility of soul you think to purchase me with money she said WHEN have I thought to do so was my reply You are losing the thread of the argument If you do not wish to purchase me at all events you wish to purchase my respect Not at all I have told you that I find it difficult to explain myself You are hard upon me Do not be angry at my chattering You know why you ought not to be angry with me that I am simply an imbecile However I do not mind if you ARE angry Sitting in my room I need but to think of you to imagine to myself the rustle of your dress and at once I fall almost to biting my hands Why should you be angry with me Because I call myself your slave Revel I pray you in my slavery revel in it Do you know that sometimes I could kill you not because I do not love you or am jealous of you but because I feel as though I could simply devour you You are laughing No I am not she retorted But I order you nevertheless to be silent She stopped well nigh breathless with anger God knows she may not have been a beautiful woman yet I loved to see her come to a halt like this and was therefore the more fond of arousing her temper Perhaps she divined this and for that very reason gave way to rage I said as much to her What rubbish she cried with a shudder I do not care I continued Also do you know that it is not safe for us to take walks together Often I have a feeling that I should like to strike you to disfigure you to strangle you Are you certain that it will never come to that You are driving me to frenzy Am I afraid of a scandal or of your anger Why should I fear your anger I love without hope and know that hereafter I shall love you a thousand times more If ever I should kill you I should have to kill myself too But I shall put off doing so as long as possible for I wish to continue enjoying the unbearable pain which your coldness gives me Do you know a very strange thing It is that with every day my love for you increases though that would seem to be almost an impossibility Why should I not become a fatalist Remember how on the third day that we ascended the Shlangenberg I was moved to whisper in your ear Say but the word and I will leap into the abyss Had you said it I should have leapt Do you not believe me What stupid rubbish she cried I care not whether it be wise or stupid I cried in return I only know that in your presence I must speak speak speak Therefore I am speaking I lose all conceit when I am with you and everything ceases to matter Why should I have wanted you to leap from the Shlangenberg she said drily and I think with wilful offensiveness THAT would have been of no use to me Splendid I shouted I know well that you must have used the words of no use in order to crush me I can see through you Of no use did you say Why to give pleasure is ALWAYS of use and as for barbarous unlimited power even if it be only over a fly why it is a kind of luxury Man is a despot by nature and loves to torture You in particular love to do so I remember that at this moment she looked at me in a peculiar way The fact is that my face must have been expressing all the maze of senseless gross sensations which were seething within me To this day I can remember word for word the conversation as I have written it down My eyes were suffused with blood and the foam had caked itself on my lips Also on my honour I swear that had she bidden me cast myself from the summit of the Shlangenberg I should have done it Yes had she bidden me in jest or only in contempt and with a spit in my face I should have cast myself down Oh no Why so I believe you she said but in such a manner in the manner of which at times she was a mistress and with such a note of disdain and viperish arrogance in her tone that God knows I could have killed her Yes at that moment she stood in peril I had not lied to her about that Surely you are not a coward suddenly she asked me I do not know I replied Perhaps I am but I do not know I have long given up thinking about such things If I said to you Kill that man would you kill him Whom Whomsoever I wish The Frenchman Do not ask me questions return me answers I repeat whomsoever I wish I desire to see if you were speaking seriously just now She awaited my reply with such gravity and impatience that I found the situation unpleasant Do YOU rather tell me I said what is going on here Why do you seem half afraid of me I can see for myself what is wrong You are the step daughter of a ruined and insensate man who is smitten with love for this devil of a Blanche And there is this Frenchman too with his mysterious influence over you Yet you actually ask me such a question If you do not tell me how things stand I shall have to put in my oar and do something Are you ashamed to be frank with me Are you shy of me I am not going to talk to you on that subject I have asked you a question and am waiting for an answer Well then I will kill whomsoever you wish I said But are you REALLY going to bid me do such deeds Why should you think that I am going to let you off I shall bid you do it or else renounce me Could you ever do the latter No you know that you couldn t You would first kill whom I had bidden you and then kill ME for having dared to send you away Something seemed to strike upon my brain as I heard these words Of course at the time I took them half in jest and half as a challenge yet she had spoken them with great seriousness I felt thunderstruck that she should so express herself that she should assert such a right over me that she should assume such authority and say outright Either you kill whom I bid you or I will have nothing more to do with you Indeed in what she had said there was something so cynical and unveiled as to pass all bounds For how could she ever regard me as the same after the killing was done This was more than slavery and abasement it was sufficient to bring a man back to his right senses Yet despite the outrageous improbability of our conversation my heart shook within me Suddenly she burst out laughing We were seated on a bench near the spot where the children were playing just opposite the point in the alley way before the Casino where the carriages drew up in order to set down their occupants Do you see that fat Baroness she cried It is the Baroness Burmergelm She arrived three days ago Just look at her husband that tall wizened Prussian there with the stick in his hand Do you remember how he stared at us the other day Well go to the Baroness take off your hat to her and say something in French Why Because you have sworn that you would leap from the Shlangenberg for my sake and that you would kill any one whom I might bid you kill Well instead of such murders and tragedies I wish only for a good laugh Go without answering me and let me see the Baron give you a sound thrashing with his stick Then you throw me out a challenge you think that I will not do it Yes I do challenge you Go for such is my will Then I WILL go however mad be your fancy Only look here shall you not be doing the General a great disservice as well as through him a great disservice to yourself It is not about myself I am worrying it is about you and the General Why for a mere fancy should I go and insult a woman Ah Then I can see that you are only a trifler she said contemptuously Your eyes are swimming with blood but only because you have drunk a little too much at luncheon Do I not know that what I have asked you to do is foolish and wrong and that the General will be angry about it But I want to have a good laugh all the same I want that and nothing else Why should you insult a woman indeed Well you will be given a sound thrashing for so doing I turned away and went silently to do her bidding Of course the thing was folly but I could not get out of it I remember that as I approached the Baroness I felt as excited as a schoolboy I was in a frenzy as though I were drunk VI Two days have passed since that day of lunacy What a noise and a fuss and a chattering and an uproar there was And what a welter of unseemliness and disorder and stupidity and bad manners And I the cause of it all Yet part of the scene was also ridiculous at all events to myself it was so I am not quite sure what was the matter with me whether I was merely stupefied or whether I purposely broke loose and ran amok At times my mind seems all confused while at other times I seem almost to be back in my childhood at the school desk and to have done the deed simply out of mischief It all came of Polina yes of Polina But for her there might never have been a fracas Or perhaps I did the deed in a fit of despair though it may be foolish of me to think so What there is so attractive about her I cannot think Yet there IS something attractive about her something passing fair it would seem Others besides myself she has driven to distraction She is tall and straight and very slim Her body looks as though it could be tied into a knot or bent double like a cord The imprint of her foot is long and narrow It is a maddening imprint yes simply a maddening one And her hair has a reddish tint about it and her eyes are like cat s eyes though able also to glance with proud disdainful mien On the evening of my first arrival four months ago I remember that she was sitting and holding an animated conversation with De Griers in the salon And the way in which she looked at him was such that later when I retired to my own room upstairs I kept fancying that she had smitten him in the face that she had smitten him right on the cheek so peculiar had been her look as she stood confronting him Ever since that evening I have loved her But to my tale I stepped from the path into the carriage way and took my stand in the middle of it There I awaited the Baron and the Baroness When they were but a few paces distant from me I took off my hat and bowed I remember that the Baroness was clad in a voluminous silk dress pale grey in colour and adorned with flounces and a crinoline and train Also she was short and inordinately stout while her gross flabby chin completely concealed her neck Her face was purple and the little eyes in it had an impudent malicious expression Yet she walked as though she were conferring a favour upon everybody by so doing As for the Baron he was tall wizened bony faced after the German fashion spectacled and apparently about forty five years of age Also he had legs which seemed to begin almost at his chest or rather at his chin Yet for all his air of peacock like conceit his clothes sagged a little and his face wore a sheepish air which might have passed for profundity These details I noted within a space of a few seconds At first my bow and the fact that I had my hat in my hand barely caught their attention The Baron only scowled a little and the Baroness swept straight on Madame la Baronne said I loudly and distinctly embroidering each word as it were j ai l honneur d etre votre esclave Then I bowed again put on my hat and walked past the Baron with a rude smile on my face Polina had ordered me merely to take off my hat the bow and the general effrontery were of my own invention God knows what instigated me to perpetrate the outrage In my frenzy I felt as though I were walking on air Hein ejaculated or rather growled the Baron as he turned towards me in angry surprise I too turned round and stood waiting in pseudo courteous expectation Yet still I wore on my face an impudent smile as I gazed at him He seemed to hesitate and his brows contracted to their utmost limits Every moment his visage was growing darker The Baroness also turned in my direction and gazed at me in wrathful perplexity while some of the passers by also began to stare at us and others of them halted outright Hein the Baron vociferated again with a redoubled growl and a note of growing wrath in his voice Ja wohl I replied still looking him in the eyes Sind sie rasend he exclaimed brandishing his stick and apparently beginning to feel nervous Perhaps it was my costume which intimidated him for I was well and fashionably dressed after the manner of a man who belongs to indisputably good society Ja wo o ohl cried I again with all my might with a longdrawn rolling of the ohl sound after the fashion of the Berliners who constantly use the phrase Ja wohl in conversation and more or less prolong the syllable ohl according as they desire to express different shades of meaning or of mood At this the Baron and the Baroness faced sharply about and almost fled in their alarm Some of the bystanders gave vent to excited exclamations and others remained staring at me in astonishment But I do not remember the details very well Wheeling quietly about I returned in the direction of Polina Alexandrovna But when I had got within a hundred paces of her seat I saw her rise and set out with the children towards the hotel At the portico I caught up to her I have perpetrated the the piece of idiocy I said as I came level with her Have you Then you can take the consequences she replied without so much as looking at me Then she moved towards the staircase I spent the rest of the evening walking in the park Thence I passed into the forest and walked on until I found myself in a neighbouring principality At a wayside restaurant I partook of an omelette and some wine and was charged for the idyllic repast a thaler and a half Not until eleven o clock did I return home to find a summons awaiting me from the General Our party occupied two suites in the hotel each of which contained two rooms The first the larger suite comprised a salon and a smoking room with adjoining the latter the General s study It was here that he was awaiting me as he stood posed in a majestic attitude beside his writing table Lolling on a divan close by was De Griers My good sir the General began may I ask you what this is that you have gone and done I should be glad I replied if we could come straight to the point Probably you are referring to my encounter of today with a German With a German Why the German was the Baron Burmergelm a most important personage I hear that you have been rude both to him and to the Baroness No I have not But I understand that you simply terrified them my good sir shouted the General Not in the least I replied You must know that when I was in Berlin I frequently used to hear the Berliners repeat and repellently prolong a certain phrase namely Ja wohl and happening to meet this couple in the carriage drive I found for some reason or another that this phrase suddenly recurred to my memory and exercised a rousing effect upon my spirits Moreover on the three previous occasions that I have met the Baroness she has walked towards me as though I were a worm which could easily be crushed with the foot Not unnaturally I too possess a measure of self respect wherefore on THIS occasion I took off my hat and said politely yes I assure you it was said politely Madame j ai l honneur d etre votre esclave Then the Baron turned round and said Hein whereupon I felt moved to ejaculate in answer Ja wohl Twice I shouted it at him the first time in an ordinary tone and the second time with the greatest prolonging of the words of which I was capable That is all I must confess that this puerile explanation gave me great pleasure I felt a strong desire to overlay the incident with an even added measure of grossness so the further I proceeded the more did the gusto of my proceeding increase You are only making fun of me vociferated the General as turning to the Frenchman he declared that my bringing about of the incident had been gratuitous De Griers smiled contemptuously and shrugged his shoulders Do not think THAT I put in It was not so at all I grant you that my behaviour was bad I fully confess that it was so and make no secret of the fact I would even go so far as to grant you that my behaviour might well be called stupid and indecent tomfoolery but MORE than that it was not Also let me tell you that I am very sorry for my conduct Yet there is one circumstance which in my eyes almost absolves me from regret in the matter Of late that is to say for the last two or three weeks I have been feeling not at all well That is to say I have been in a sick nervous irritable fanciful condition so that I have periodically lost control over myself For instance on more than one occasion I have tried to pick a quarrel even with Monsieur le Marquise here and under the circumstances he had no choice but to answer me In short I have recently been showing signs of ill health Whether the Baroness Burmergelm will take this circumstance into consideration when I come to beg her pardon for I do intend to make her amends I do not know but I doubt if she will and the less so since so far as I know the circumstance is one which of late has begun to be abused in the legal world in that advocates in criminal cases have taken to justifying their clients on the ground that at the moment of the crime they the clients were unconscious of what they were doing that in short they were out of health My client committed the murder that is true but he has no recollection of having committed it And doctors actually support these advocates by affirming that there really is such a malady that there really can arise temporary delusions which make a man remember nothing of a given deed or only a half or a quarter of it But the Baron and Baroness are members of an older generation as well as Prussian Junkers and landowners To them such a process in the medico judicial world will be unknown and therefore they are the more unlikely to accept any such explanation What is YOUR opinion about it General Enough sir he thundered with barely restrained fury Enough I say Once and for all I must endeavour to rid myself of you and your impertinence To justify yourself in the eyes of the Baron and Baroness will be impossible Any intercourse with you even though it be confined to a begging of their pardons they would look upon as a degradation I may tell you that on learning that you formed part of my household the Baron approached me in the Casino and demanded of me additional satisfaction Do you understand then what it is that you have entailed upon me upon ME my good sir You have entailed upon me the fact of my being forced to sue humbly to the Baron and to give him my word of honour that this very day you shall cease to belong to my establishment Excuse me General I interrupted but did he make an express point of it that I should cease to belong to your establishment as you call it No I of my own initiative thought that I ought to afford him that satisfaction and with it he was satisfied So we must part good sir It is my duty to hand over to you forty gulden three florins as per the accompanying statement Here is the money and here the account which you are at liberty to verify Farewell From henceforth we are strangers From you I have never had anything but trouble and unpleasantness I am about to call the landlord and explain to him that from tomorrow onwards I shall no longer be responsible for your hotel expenses Also I have the honour to remain your obedient servant I took the money and the account which was indicted in pencil and bowing low to the General said to him very gravely The matter cannot end here I regret very much that you should have been put to unpleasantness at the Baron s hands but the fault pardon me is your own How came you to answer for me to the Baron And what did you mean by saying that I formed part of your household I am merely your family tutor not a son of yours nor yet your ward nor a person of any kind for whose acts you need be responsible I am a judicially competent person a man of twenty five years of age a university graduate a gentleman and until I met yourself a complete stranger to you Only my boundless respect for your merits restrains me from demanding satisfaction at your hands as well as a further explanation as to the reasons which have led you to take it upon yourself to answer for my conduct So struck was he with my words that spreading out his hands he turned to the Frenchman and interpreted to him that I had challenged himself the General to a duel The Frenchman laughed aloud Nor do I intend to let the Baron off I continued calmly but with not a little discomfiture at De Griers merriment And since you General have today been so good as to listen to the Baron s complaints and to enter into his concerns since you have made yourself a participator in the affair I have the honour to inform you that tomorrow morning at the latest I shall in my own name demand of the said Baron a formal explanation as to the reasons which have led him to disregard the fact that the matter lies between him and myself alone and to put a slight upon me by referring it to another person as though I were unworthy to answer for my own conduct Then there happened what I had foreseen The General on hearing of this further intended outrage showed the white feather What he cried Do you intend to go on with this damned nonsense Do you not realise the harm that it is doing me I beg of you not to laugh at me sir not to laugh at me for we have police authorities here who out of respect for my rank and for that of the Baron In short sir I swear to you that I will have you arrested and marched out of the place to prevent any further brawling on your part Do you understand what I say He was almost breathless with anger as well as in a terrible fright General I replied with that calmness which he never could abide one cannot arrest a man for brawling until he has brawled I have not so much as begun my explanations to the Baron and you are altogether ignorant as to the form and time which my intended procedure is likely to assume I wish but to disabuse the Baron of what is to me a shameful supposition namely that I am under the guardianship of a person who is qualified to exercise control over my free will It is vain for you to disturb and alarm yourself For God s sake Alexis Ivanovitch do put an end to this senseless scheme of yours he muttered but with a sudden change from a truculent tone to one of entreaty as he caught me by the hand Do you know what is likely to come of it Merely further unpleasantness You will agree with me I am sure that at present I ought to move with especial care yes with very especial care You cannot be fully aware of how I am situated When we leave this place I shall be ready to receive you back into my household but for the time being I Well I cannot tell you all my reasons With that he wound up in a despairing voice O Alexis Ivanovitch Alexis Ivanovitch I moved towards the door begging him to be calm and promising that everything should be done decently and in order whereafter I departed Russians when abroad are over apt to play the poltroon to watch all their words and to wonder what people are thinking of their conduct or whether such and such a thing is comme il faut In short they are over apt to cosset themselves and to lay claim to great importance Always they prefer the form of behaviour which has once and for all become accepted and established This they will follow slavishly whether in hotels on promenades at meetings or when on a journey But the General had avowed to me that over and above such considerations as these there were circumstances which compelled him to move with especial care at present and that the fact had actually made him poor spirited and a coward it had made him altogether change his tone towards me This fact I took into my calculations and duly noted it for of course he MIGHT apply to the authorities tomorrow and it behoved me to go carefully Yet it was not the General but Polina that I wanted to anger She had treated me with such cruelty and had got me into such a hole that I felt a longing to force her to beseech me to stop Of course my tomfoolery might compromise her yet certain other feelings and desires had begun to form themselves in my brain If I was never to rank in her eyes as anything but a nonentity it would not greatly matter if I figured as a draggle tailed cockerel and the Baron were to give me a good thrashing but the fact was that I desired to have the laugh of them all and to come out myself unscathed Let people see what they WOULD see Let Polina for once have a good fright and be forced to whistle me to heel again But however much she might whistle she should see that I was at least no draggle tailed cockerel I have just received a surprising piece of news I have just met our chambermaid on the stairs and been informed by her that Maria Philipovna departed today by the night train to stay with a cousin at Carlsbad What can that mean The maid declares that Madame packed her trunks early in the day Yet how is it that no one else seems to have been aware of the circumstance Or is it that I have been the only person to be unaware of it Also the maid has just told me that three days ago Maria Philipovna had some high words with the General I understand then Probably the words were concerning Mlle Blanche Certainly something decisive is approaching VII In the morning I sent for the maitre d hotel and explained to him that in future my bill was to be rendered to me personally As a matter of fact my expenses had never been so large as to alarm me nor to lead me to quit the hotel while moreover I still had one hundred sixty gulden left to me and in them yes in them perhaps riches awaited me It was a curious fact that though I had not yet won anything at play I nevertheless acted thought and felt as though I were sure before long to become wealthy since I could not imagine myself otherwise Next I bethought me despite the earliness of the hour of going to see mister Astley who was staying at the Hotel de l Angleterre a hostelry at no great distance from our own But suddenly De Griers entered my room This had never before happened for of late that gentleman and I had stood on the most strained and distant of terms he attempting no concealment of his contempt for me he even made an express point of showing it and I having no reason to desire his company In short I detested him Consequently his entry at the present moment the more astounded me At once I divined that something out of the way was on the carpet He entered with marked affability and began by complimenting me on my room Then perceiving that I had my hat in my hands he inquired whither I was going so early and no sooner did he hear that I was bound for mister Astley s than he stopped looked grave and seemed plunged in thought He was a true Frenchman insofar as that though he could be lively and engaging when it suited him he became insufferably dull and wearisome as soon as ever the need for being lively and engaging had passed Seldom is a Frenchman NATURALLY civil he is civil only as though to order and of set purpose Also if he thinks it incumbent upon him to be fanciful original and out of the way his fancy always assumes a foolish unnatural vein for the reason that it is compounded of trite hackneyed forms In short the natural Frenchman is a conglomeration of commonplace petty everyday positiveness so that he is the most tedious person in the world Indeed I believe that none but greenhorns and excessively Russian people feel an attraction towards the French for to any man of sensibility such a compendium of outworn forms a compendium which is built up of drawing room manners expansiveness and gaiety becomes at once over noticeable and unbearable I have come to see you on business De Griers began in a very off hand yet polite tone nor will I seek to conceal from you the fact that I have come in the capacity of an emissary of an intermediary from the General Having small knowledge of the Russian tongue I lost most of what was said last night but the General has now explained matters and I must confess that See here Monsieur de Griers I interrupted I understand that you have undertaken to act in this affair as an intermediary Of course I am only un utchitel a tutor and have never claimed to be an intimate of this household nor to stand on at all familiar terms with it Consequently I do not know the whole of its circumstances Yet pray explain to me this have you yourself become one of its members seeing that you are beginning to take such a part in everything and are now present as an intermediary The Frenchman seemed not over pleased at my question It was one which was too outspoken for his taste and he had no mind to be frank with me I am connected with the General he said drily partly through business affairs and partly through special circumstances My principal has sent me merely to ask you to forego your intentions of last evening What you contemplate is I have no doubt very clever yet he has charged me to represent to you that you have not the slightest chance of succeeding in your end since not only will the Baron refuse to receive you but also he the Baron has at his disposal every possible means for obviating further unpleasantness from you Surely you can see that yourself What then would be the good of going on with it all On the other hand the General promises that at the first favourable opportunity he will receive you back into his household and in the meantime will credit you with your salary with vos appointements Surely that will suit you will it not Very quietly I replied that he the Frenchman was labouring under a delusion that perhaps after all I should not be expelled from the Baron s presence but on the contrary be listened to finally that I should be glad if Monsieur de Griers would confess that he was now visiting me merely in order to see how far I intended to go in the affair Good heavens cried de Griers Seeing that the General takes such an interest in the matter is there anything very unnatural in his desiring also to know your plans Again I began my explanations but the Frenchman only fidgeted and rolled his head about as he listened with an expression of manifest and unconcealed irony on his face In short he adopted a supercilious attitude For my own part I endeavoured to pretend that I took the affair very seriously I declared that since the Baron had gone and complained of me to the General as though I were a mere servant of the General s he had in the first place lost me my post and in the second place treated me like a person to whom as to one not qualified to answer for himself it was not even worth while to speak Naturally I said I felt insulted at this Yet comprehending as I did differences of years of social status and so forth here I could scarcely help smiling I was not anxious to bring about further scenes by going personally to demand or to request satisfaction of the Baron All that I felt was that I had a right to go in person and beg the Baron s and the Baroness s pardon the more so since of late I had been feeling unwell and unstrung and had been in a fanciful condition And so forth and so forth Yet I continued the Baron s offensive behaviour to me of yesterday that is to say the fact of his referring the matter to the General as well as his insistence that the General should deprive me of my post had placed me in such a position that I could not well express my regret to him the Baron and to his good lady for the reason that in all probability both he and the Baroness with the world at large would imagine that I was doing so merely because I hoped by my action to recover my post Hence I found myself forced to request the Baron to express to me HIS OWN regrets as well as to express them in the most unqualified manner to say in fact that he had never had any wish to insult me After the Baron had done THAT I should for my part at once feel free to express to him whole heartedly and without reserve my own regrets In short I declared in conclusion my one desire is that the Baron may make it possible for me to adopt the latter course Oh fie What refinements and subtleties exclaimed De Griers Besides what have you to express regret for Confess Monsieur Monsieur pardon me but I have forgotten your name confess I say that all this is merely a plan to annoy the General Or perhaps you have some other and special end in view Eh In return you must pardon ME mon cher Marquis and tell me what you have to do with it The General But what of the General Last night he said that for some reason or another it behoved him to move with especial care at present wherefore he was feeling nervous But I did not understand the reference Yes there DO exist special reasons for his doing so assented De Griers in a conciliatory tone yet with rising anger You are acquainted with Mlle de Cominges are you not Mlle Blanche you mean Yes Mlle Blanche de Cominges Doubtless you know also that the General is in love with this young lady and may even be about to marry her before he leaves here Imagine therefore what any scene or scandal would entail upon him I cannot see that the marriage scheme need be affected by scenes or scandals Mais le Baron est si irascible un caractere prussien vous savez Enfin il fera une querelle d Allemand I do not care I replied seeing that I no longer belong to his household of set purpose I was trying to talk as senselessly as possible But is it quite settled that Mlle is to marry the General What are they waiting for Why should they conceal such a matter at all events from ourselves the General s own party I cannot tell you The marriage is not yet a settled affair for they are awaiting news from Russia The General has business transactions to arrange Ah Connected doubtless with madame his mother De Griers shot at me a glance of hatred To cut things short he interrupted I have complete confidence in your native politeness as well as in your tact and good sense I feel sure that you will do what I suggest even if it is only for the sake of this family which has received you as a kinsman into its bosom and has always loved and respected you Be so good as to observe I remarked that the same family has just EXPELLED me from its bosom All that you are saying you are saying but for show but when people have just said to you Of course we do not wish to turn you out yet for the sake of appearance s you must PERMIT yourself to be turned out nothing can matter very much Very well then he said in a sterner and more arrogant tone Seeing that my solicitations have had no effect upon you it is my duty to mention that other measures will be taken There exist here police you must remember and this very day they shall send you packing Que diable To think of a blanc bec like yourself challenging a person like the Baron to a duel Do you suppose that you will be ALLOWED to do such things Just try doing them and see if any one will be afraid of you The reason why I have asked you to desist is that I can see that your conduct is causing the General annoyance Do you believe that the Baron could not tell his lacquey simply to put you out of doors Nevertheless I should not GO out of doors I retorted with absolute calm You are labouring under a delusion Monsieur de Griers The thing will be done in far better trim than you imagine I was just about to start for mister Astley s to ask him to be my intermediary in other words my second He has a strong liking for me and I do not think that he will refuse He will go and see the Baron on MY behalf and the Baron will certainly not decline to receive him Although I am only a tutor a kind of subaltern mister Astley is known to all men as the nephew of a real English lord the Lord Piebroch as well as a lord in his own right Yes you may be pretty sure that the Baron will be civil to mister Astley and listen to him Or should he decline to do so mister Astley will take the refusal as a personal affront to himself for you know how persistent the English are and thereupon introduce to the Baron a friend of his own and he has many friends in a good position That being so picture to yourself the issue of the affair an affair which will not quite end as you think it will This caused the Frenchman to bethink him of playing the coward Really things may be as this fellow says he evidently thought Really he MIGHT be able to engineer another scene Once more I beg of you to let the matter drop he continued in a tone that was now entirely conciliatory One would think that it actually PLEASED you to have scenes Indeed it is a brawl rather than genuine satisfaction that you are seeking I have said that the affair may prove to be diverting and even clever and that possibly you may attain something by it yet none the less I tell you he said this only because he saw me rise and reach for my hat that I have come hither also to hand you these few words from a certain person Read them please for I must take her back an answer So saying he took from his pocket a small compact wafer sealed note and handed it to me In Polina s handwriting I read I hear that you are thinking of going on with this affair You have lost your temper now and are beginning to play the fool Certain circumstances however I may explain to you later Pray cease from your folly and put a check upon yourself For folly it all is I have need of you and moreover you have promised to obey me Remember the Shlangenberg I ask you to be obedient If necessary I shall even BID you be obedient Your own POLINA P S If so be that you still bear a grudge against me for what happened last night pray forgive me Everything to my eyes seemed to change as I read these words My lips grew pale and I began to tremble Meanwhile the cursed Frenchman was eyeing me discreetly and askance as though he wished to avoid witnessing my confusion It would have been better if he had laughed outright Very well I said you can tell Mlle not to disturb herself But I added sharply I would also ask you why you have been so long in handing me this note Instead of chattering about trifles you ought to have delivered me the missive at once if you have really come commissioned as you say Well pardon some natural haste on my part for the situation is so strange I wished first to gain some personal knowledge of your intentions and moreover I did not know the contents of the note and thought that it could be given you at any time I understand I replied So you were ordered to hand me the note only in the last resort and if you could not otherwise appease me Is it not so Speak out Monsieur de Griers Perhaps said he assuming a look of great forbearance but gazing at me in a meaning way I reached for my hat whereupon he nodded and went out Yet on his lips I fancied that I could see a mocking smile How could it have been otherwise You and I are to have a reckoning later Master Frenchman I muttered as I descended the stairs Yes we will measure our strength together Yet my thoughts were all in confusion for again something seemed to have struck me dizzy Presently the air revived me a little and a couple of minutes later my brain had sufficiently cleared to enable two ideas in particular to stand out in it Firstly I asked myself which of the absurd boyish and extravagant threats which I had uttered at random last night had made everybody so alarmed Secondly what was the influence which this Frenchman appeared to exercise over Polina He had but to give the word and at once she did as he desired at once she wrote me a note to beg of me to forbear Of course the relations between the pair had from the first been a riddle to me they had been so ever since I had first made their acquaintance But of late I had remarked in her a strong aversion for even a contempt for him while for his part he had scarcely even looked at her but had behaved towards her always in the most churlish fashion Yes I had noted that Also Polina herself had mentioned to me her dislike for him and delivered herself of some remarkable confessions on the subject Hence he must have got her into his power somehow somehow he must be holding her as in a vice VIII All at once on the Promenade as it was called that is to say in the Chestnut Avenue I came face to face with my Englishman I was just coming to see you he said and you appear to be out on a similar errand So you have parted with your employers How do you know that I asked in astonishment Is EVERY ONE aware of the fact By no means Not every one would consider such a fact to be of moment Indeed I have never heard any one speak of it Then how come you to know it Because I have had occasion to do so Whither are you bound I like you and was therefore coming to pay you a visit What a splendid fellow you are mister Astley I cried though still wondering how he had come by his knowledge And since I have not yet had my coffee and you have in all probability scarcely tasted yours let us adjourn to the Casino Cafe where we can sit and smoke and have a talk The cafe in question was only a hundred paces away so when coffee had been brought we seated ourselves and I lit a cigarette Astley was no smoker but taking a seat by my side he prepared himself to listen I do not intend to go away was my first remark I intend on the contrary to remain here That I never doubted he answered good humouredly It is a curious fact that on my way to see him I had never even thought of telling him of my love for Polina In fact I had purposely meant to avoid any mention of the subject Nor during our stay in the place had I ever made aught but the scantiest reference to it You see not only was Astley a man of great reserve but also from the first I had perceived that Polina had made a great impression upon him although he never spoke of her But now strangely enough he had no sooner seated himself and bent his steely gaze upon me than for some reason or another I felt moved to tell him everything to speak to him of my love in all its phases For an hour and a half did I discourse on the subject and found it a pleasure to do so even though this was the first occasion on which I had referred to the matter Indeed when at certain moments I perceived that my more ardent passages confused him I purposely increased my ardour of narration Yet one thing I regret and that is that I made references to the Frenchman which were a little over personal mister Astley sat without moving as he listened to me Not a word nor a sound of any kind did he utter as he stared into my eyes Suddenly however on my mentioning the Frenchman he interrupted me and inquired sternly whether I did right to speak of an extraneous matter he had always been a strange man in his mode of propounding questions No I fear not I replied And concerning this Marquis and Mlle Polina you know nothing beyond surmise Again I was surprised that such a categorical question should come from such a reserved individual No I know nothing FOR CERTAIN about them was my reply No nothing Then you have done very wrong to speak of them to me or even to imagine things about them Quite so quite so I interrupted in some astonishment I admit that Yet that is not the question Whereupon I related to him in detail the incident of two days ago I spoke of Polina s outburst of my encounter with the Baron of my dismissal of the General s extraordinary pusillanimity and of the call which De Griers had that morning paid me In conclusion I showed Astley the note which I had lately received What do you make of it I asked When I met you I was just coming to ask you your opinion For myself I could have killed this Frenchman and am not sure that I shall not do so even yet I feel the same about it said mister Astley As for Mlle Polina well you yourself know that if necessity drives one enters into relation with people whom one simply detests Even between this couple there may be something which though unknown to you depends upon extraneous circumstances For my own part I think that you may reassure yourself or at all events partially And as for Mlle Polina s proceedings of two days ago they were of course strange not because she can have meant to get rid of you or to earn for you a thrashing from the Baron s cudgel which for some curious reason he did not use although he had it ready in his hands but because such proceedings on the part of such well of such a refined lady as Mlle Polina are to say the least of it unbecoming But she cannot have guessed that you would carry out her absurd wish to the letter Do you know what suddenly I cried as I fixed mister Astley with my gaze I believe that you have already heard the story from some one very possibly from Mlle Polina herself In return he gave me an astonished stare Your eyes look very fiery he said with a return of his former calm and in them I can read suspicion Now you have no right whatever to be suspicious It is not a right which I can for a moment recognise and I absolutely refuse to answer your questions Enough You need say no more I cried with a strange emotion at my heart yet not altogether understanding what had aroused that emotion in my breast Indeed when where and how could Polina have chosen Astley to be one of her confidants Of late I had come rather to overlook him in this connection even though Polina had always been a riddle to me so much so that now when I had just permitted myself to tell my friend of my infatuation in all its aspects I had found myself struck during the very telling with the fact that in my relations with her I could specify nothing that was explicit nothing that was positive On the contrary my relations had been purely fantastic strange and unreal they had been unlike anything else that I could think of Very well very well I replied with a warmth equal to Astley s own Then I stand confounded and have no further opinions to offer But you are a good fellow and I am glad to know what you think about it all even though I do not need your advice Then after a pause I resumed For instance what reason should you assign for the General taking fright in this way Why should my stupid clowning have led the world to elevate it into a serious incident Even De Griers has found it necessary to put in his oar and he only interferes on the most important occasions and to visit me and to address to me the most earnest supplications Yes HE De Griers has actually been playing the suppliant to ME And mark you although he came to me as early as nine o clock he had ready prepared in his hand Mlle Polina s note When I would ask was that note written Mlle Polina must have been aroused from sleep for the express purpose of writing it At all events the circumstance shows that she is an absolute slave to the Frenchman since she actually begs my pardon in the note actually begs my pardon Yet what is her personal concern in the matter Why is she interested in it at all Why too is the whole party so afraid of this precious Baron And what sort of a business do you call it for the General to be going to marry Mlle Blanche de Cominges He told me last night that because of the circumstance he must move with especial care at present What is your opinion of it all Your look convinces me that you know more about it than I do mister Astley smiled and nodded Yes I think I DO know more about it than you do he assented The affair centres around this Mlle Blanche Of that I feel certain And what of Mlle Blanche I cried impatiently for in me there had dawned a sudden hope that this would enable me to discover something about Polina Well my belief is that at the present moment Mlle Blanche has in very truth a special reason for wishing to avoid any trouble with the Baron and the Baroness It might lead not only to some unpleasantness but even to a scandal Oh oh Also I may tell you that Mlle Blanche has been in Roulettenberg before for she was staying here three seasons ago I myself was in the place at the time and in those days Mlle Blanche was not known as Mlle de Cominges nor was her mother the Widow de Cominges even in existence In any case no one ever mentioned the latter De Griers too had not materialised and I am convinced that not only do the parties stand in no relation to one another but also they have not long enjoyed one another s acquaintance Likewise the Marquisate de Griers is of recent creation Of that I have reason to be sure owing to a certain circumstance Even the name De Griers itself may be taken to be a new invention seeing that I have a friend who once met the said Marquis under a different name altogether Yet he possesses a good circle of friends Possibly Mlle Blanche also may possess that Yet it is not three years since she received from the local police at the instance of the Baroness an invitation to leave the town And she left it But why Well I must tell you that she first appeared here in company with an Italian a prince of some sort a man who bore an historic name Barberini or something of the kind The fellow was simply a mass of rings and diamonds real diamonds too and the couple used to drive out in a marvellous carriage At first Mlle Blanche played trente et quarante with fair success but later her luck took a marked change for the worse I distinctly remember that in a single evening she lost an enormous sum But worse was to ensue for one fine morning her prince disappeared horses carriage and all Also the hotel bill which he left unpaid was enormous Upon this Mlle Zelma the name which she assumed after figuring as Madame Barberini was in despair She shrieked and howled all over the hotel and even tore her clothes in her frenzy In the hotel there was staying also a Polish count you must know that ALL travelling Poles are counts and the spectacle of Mlle Zelma tearing her clothes and catlike scratching her face with her beautiful scented nails produced upon him a strong impression So the pair had a talk together and by luncheon time she was consoled Indeed that evening the couple entered the Casino arm in arm Mlle Zelma laughing loudly according to her custom and showing even more expansiveness in her manners than she had before shown For instance she thrust her way into the file of women roulette players in the exact fashion of those ladies who to clear a space for themselves at the tables push their fellow players roughly aside Doubtless you have noticed them Yes certainly Well they are not worth noticing To the annoyance of the decent public they are allowed to remain here at all events such of them as daily change four thousand franc notes at the tables though as soon as ever these women cease to do so they receive an invitation to depart However Mlle Zelma continued to change notes of this kind but her play grew more and more unsuccessful despite the fact that such ladies luck is frequently good for they have a surprising amount of cash at their disposal Suddenly the Count too disappeared even as the Prince had done and that same evening Mlle Zelma was forced to appear in the Casino alone On this occasion no one offered her a greeting Two days later she had come to the end of her resources whereupon after staking and losing her last louis d or she chanced to look around her and saw standing by her side the Baron Burmergelm who had been eyeing her with fixed disapproval To his distaste however Mlle paid no attention but turning to him with her well known smile requested him to stake on her behalf ten louis on the red Later that evening a complaint from the Baroness led the authorities to request Mlle not to re enter the Casino If you feel in any way surprised that I should know these petty and unedifying details the reason is that I had them from a relative of mine who later that evening drove Mlle Zelma in his carriage from Roulettenberg to Spa Now mark you Mlle wants to become Madame General in order that in future she may be spared the receipt of such invitations from Casino authorities as she received three years ago At present she is not playing but that is only because according to the signs she is lending money to other players Yes that is a much more paying game I even suspect that the unfortunate General is himself in her debt as well as perhaps also De Griers Or it may be that the latter has entered into a partnership with her Consequently you yourself will see that until the marriage shall have been consummated Mlle would scarcely like to have the attention of the Baron and the Baroness drawn to herself In short to any one in her position a scandal would be most detrimental You form a member of the menage of these people wherefore any act of yours might cause such a scandal and the more so since daily she appears in public arm in arm with the General or with Mlle Polina NOW do you understand No I do not I shouted as I banged my fist down upon the table banged it with such violence that a frightened waiter came running towards us Tell me mister Astley why if you knew this history all along and consequently always knew who this Mlle Blanche is you never warned either myself or the General nor most of all Mlle Polina who is accustomed to appear in the Casino in public everywhere with Mlle Blanche How could you do it It would have done no good to warn you he replied quietly for the reason that you could have effected nothing Against what was I to warn you As likely as not the General knows more about Mlle Blanche even than I do yet the unhappy man still walks about with her and Mlle Polina Only yesterday I saw this Frenchwoman riding splendidly mounted with De Griers while the General was careering in their wake on a roan horse He had said that morning that his legs were hurting him yet his riding seat was easy enough As he passed I looked at him and the thought occurred to me that he was a man lost for ever However it is no affair of mine for I have only recently had the happiness to make Mlle Polina s acquaintance Also he added this as an afterthought I have already told you that I do not recognise your right to ask me certain questions however sincere be my liking for you Enough I said rising To me it is as clear as day that Mlle Polina knows all about this Mlle Blanche but cannot bring herself to part with her Frenchman wherefore she consents also to be seen in public with Mlle Blanche You may be sure that nothing else would ever have induced her either to walk about with this Frenchwoman or to send me a note not to touch the Baron Yes it is THERE that the influence lies before which everything in the world must bow Yet she herself it was who launched me at the Baron The devil take it but I was left no choice in the matter You forget in the first place that this Mlle de Cominges is the General s inamorata and in the second place that Mlle Polina the General s step daughter has a younger brother and sister who though they are the General s own children are completely neglected by this madman and robbed as well Yes yes that is so For me to go and desert the children now would mean their total abandonment whereas if I remain I should be able to defend their interests and perhaps to save a moiety of their property Yes yes that is quite true And yet and yet Oh I can well understand why they are all so interested in the General s mother In whom asked mister Astley In the old woman of Moscow who declines to die yet concerning whom they are for ever expecting telegrams to notify the fact of her death Ah then of course their interests centre around her It is a question of succession Let that but be settled and the General will marry Mlle Polina will be set free and De Griers Yes and De Griers Will be repaid his money which is what he is now waiting for What You think that he is waiting for that I know of nothing else asserted mister Astley doggedly But I do I do I shouted in my fury He is waiting also for the old woman s will for the reason that it awards Mlle Polina a dowry As soon as ever the money is received she will throw herself upon the Frenchman s neck All women are like that Even the proudest of them become abject slaves where marriage is concerned What Polina is good for is to fall head over ears in love That is MY opinion Look at her especially when she is sitting alone and plunged in thought All this was pre ordained and foretold and is accursed Polina could perpetrate any mad act She she But who called me by name I broke off Who is shouting for me I heard some one calling in Russian Alexis Ivanovitch It was a woman s voice Listen At the moment we were approaching my hotel We had left the cafe long ago without even noticing that we had done so Yes I DID hear a woman s voice calling but whose I do not know The someone was calling you in Russian Ah NOW I can see whence the cries come They come from that lady there the one who is sitting on the settee the one who has just been escorted to the verandah by a crowd of lacqueys Behind her see that pile of luggage She must have arrived by train But why should she be calling ME Hear her calling again See She is beckoning to us Yes so she is assented mister Astley Alexis Ivanovitch Alexis Ivanovitch Good heavens what a stupid fellow came in a despairing wail from the verandah We had almost reached the portico and I was just setting foot upon the space before it when my hands fell to my sides in limp astonishment and my feet glued themselves to the pavement IX For on the topmost tier of the hotel verandah after being carried up the steps in an armchair amid a bevy of footmen maid servants and other menials of the hotel headed by the landlord that functionary had actually run out to meet a visitor who arrived with so much stir and din attended by her own retinue and accompanied by so great a pile of trunks and portmanteaux on the topmost tier of the verandah I say there was sitting THE GRANDMOTHER Yes it was she rich and imposing and seventy five years of age Antonida Vassilievna Tarassevitcha landowner and grande dame of Moscow the La Baboulenka who had caused so many telegrams to be sent off and received who had been dying yet not dying who had in her own person descended upon us even as snow might fall from the clouds Though unable to walk she had arrived borne aloft in an armchair her mode of conveyance for the last five years as brisk aggressive self satisfied bolt upright loudly imperious and generally abusive as ever In fact she looked exactly as she had on the only two occasions when I had seen her since my appointment to the General s household Naturally enough I stood petrified with astonishment She had sighted me a hundred paces off Even while she was being carried along in her chair she had recognised me and called me by name and surname which as usual after hearing once she had remembered ever afterwards And this is the woman whom they had thought to see in her grave after making her will I thought to myself Yet she will outlive us and every one else in the hotel Good Lord what is going to become of us now What on earth is to happen to the General She will turn the place upside down My good sir the old woman continued in a stentorian voice what are you standing THERE for with your eyes almost falling out of your head Cannot you come and say how do you do Are you too proud to shake hands Or do you not recognise me Here Potapitch she cried to an old servant who dressed in a frock coat and white waistcoat had a bald red head he was the chamberlain who always accompanied her on her journeys Just think Alexis Ivanovitch does not recognise me They have buried me for good and all Yes and after sending hosts of telegrams to know if I were dead or not Yes yes I have heard the whole story I am very much alive though as you may see Pardon me Antonida Vassilievna I replied good humouredly as I recovered my presence of mind I have no reason to wish you ill I am merely rather astonished to see you Why should I not be so seeing how unexpected WHY should you be astonished I just got into my chair and came Things are quiet enough in the train for there is no one there to chatter Have you been out for a walk Yes I have just been to the Casino Oh Well it is quite nice here she went on as she looked about her The place seems comfortable and all the trees are out I like it very well Are your people at home Is the General for instance indoors Yes and probably all of them Do they observe the convenances and keep up appearances Such things always give one tone I have heard that they are keeping a carriage even as Russian gentlefolks ought to do When abroad our Russian people always cut a dash Is Prascovia here too Yes Polina Alexandrovna is here And the Frenchwoman However I will go and look for them myself Tell me the nearest way to their rooms Do you like being here Yes I thank you Antonida Vassilievna And you Potapitch you go and tell that fool of a landlord to reserve me a suitable suite of rooms They must be handsomely decorated and not too high up Have my luggage taken up to them But what are you tumbling over yourselves for Why are you all tearing about What scullions these fellows are Who is that with you she added to myself A mister Astley I replied And who is mister Astley A fellow traveller and my very good friend as well as an acquaintance of the General s Oh an Englishman Then that is why he stared at me without even opening his lips However I like Englishmen Now take me upstairs direct to their rooms Where are they lodging Madame was lifted up in her chair by the lacqueys and I preceded her up the grand staircase Our progress was exceedingly effective for everyone whom we met stopped to stare at the cortege It happened that the hotel had the reputation of being the best the most expensive and the most aristocratic in all the spa and at every turn on the staircase or in the corridors we encountered fine ladies and important looking Englishmen more than one of whom hastened downstairs to inquire of the awestruck landlord who the newcomer was To all such questions he returned the same answer namely that the old lady was an influential foreigner a Russian a Countess and a grande dame and that she had taken the suite which during the previous week had been tenanted by the Grande Duchesse de N Meanwhile the cause of the sensation the Grandmother was being borne aloft in her armchair Every person whom she met she scanned with an inquisitive eye after first of all interrogating me about him or her at the top of her voice She was stout of figure and though she could not leave her chair one felt the moment that one first looked at her that she was also tall of stature Her back was as straight as a board and never did she lean back in her seat Also her large grey head with its keen rugged features remained always erect as she glanced about her in an imperious challenging sort of way with looks and gestures that clearly were unstudied Though she had reached her seventy sixth year her face was still fresh and her teeth had not decayed Lastly she was dressed in a black silk gown and white mobcap She interests me tremendously whispered mister Astley as still smoking he walked by my side Meanwhile I was reflecting that probably the old lady knew all about the telegrams and even about De Griers though little or nothing about Mlle Blanche I said as much to mister Astley But what a frail creature is man No sooner was my first surprise abated than I found myself rejoicing in the shock which we were about to administer to the General So much did the thought inspire me that I marched ahead in the gayest of fashions Our party was lodging on the third floor Without knocking at the door or in any way announcing our presence I threw open the portals and the Grandmother was borne through them in triumph As though of set purpose the whole party chanced at that moment to be assembled in the General s study The time was eleven o clock and it seemed that an outing of some sort at which a portion of the party were to drive in carriages and others to ride on horseback accompanied by one or two extraneous acquaintances was being planned The General was present and also Polina the children the latter s nurses De Griers Mlle Blanche attired in a riding habit her mother the young Prince and a learned German whom I beheld for the first time Into the midst of this assembly the lacqueys conveyed Madame in her chair and set her down within three paces of the General Good heavens Never shall I forget the spectacle which ensued Just before our entry the General had been holding forth to the company with De Griers in support of him I may also mention that for the last two or three days Mlle Blanche and De Griers had been making a great deal of the young Prince under the very nose of the poor General In short the company though decorous and conventional was in a gay familiar mood But no sooner did the Grandmother appear than the General stopped dead in the middle of a word and with jaw dropping stared hard at the old lady his eyes almost starting out of his head and his expression as spellbound as though he had just seen a basilisk In return the Grandmother stared at him silently and without moving though with a look of mingled challenge triumph and ridicule in her eyes For ten seconds did the pair remain thus eyeing one another amid the profound silence of the company and even De Griers sat petrified an extraordinary look of uneasiness dawning on his face As for Mlle Blanche she too stared wildly at the Grandmother with eyebrows raised and her lips parted while the Prince and the German savant contemplated the tableau in profound amazement Only Polina looked anything but perplexed or surprised Presently however she too turned as white as a sheet and then reddened to her temples Truly the Grandmother s arrival seemed to be a catastrophe for everybody For my own part I stood looking from the Grandmother to the company and back again while mister Astley as usual remained in the background and gazed calmly and decorously at the scene Well here I am and instead of a telegram too the Grandmother at last ejaculated to dissipate the silence What You were not expecting me Antonida Vassilievna O my dearest mother But how on earth did you did you The mutterings of the unhappy General died away I verily believe that if the Grandmother had held her tongue a few seconds longer she would have had a stroke How on earth did I WHAT she exclaimed Why I just got into the train and came here What else is the railway meant for But you thought that I had turned up my toes and left my property to the lot of you Oh I know ALL about the telegrams which you have been dispatching They must have cost you a pretty sum I should think for telegrams are not sent from abroad for nothing Well I picked up my heels and came here Who is this Frenchman Monsieur de Griers I suppose Oui madame assented De Griers Et croyez je suis si enchante Votre sante c est un miracle vous voir ici Une surprise charmante Just so Charmante I happen to know you as a mountebank and therefore trust you no more than THIS She indicated her little finger And who is THAT she went on turning towards Mlle Blanche Evidently the Frenchwoman looked so becoming in her riding habit with her whip in her hand that she had made an impression upon the old lady Who is that woman there Mlle de Cominges I said And this is her mother Madame de Cominges They also are staying in the hotel Is the daughter married asked the old lady without the least semblance of ceremony No I replied as respectfully as possible but under my breath Is she good company I failed to understand the question I mean is she or is she not a bore Can she speak Russian When this De Griers was in Moscow he soon learnt to make himself understood I explained to the old lady that Mlle Blanche had never visited Russia Bonjour then said Madame with sudden brusquerie Bonjour madame replied Mlle Blanche with an elegant ceremonious bow as under cover of an unwonted modesty she endeavoured to express both in face and figure her extreme surprise at such strange behaviour on the part of the Grandmother How the woman sticks out her eyes at me How she mows and minces was the Grandmother s comment Then she turned suddenly to the General and continued I have taken up my abode here so am going to be your next door neighbour Are you glad to hear that or are you not My dear mother believe me when I say that I am sincerely delighted returned the General who had now to a certain extent recovered his senses and inasmuch as when occasion arose he could speak with fluency gravity and a certain effect he set himself to be expansive in his remarks and went on We have been so dismayed and upset by the news of your indisposition We had received such hopeless telegrams about you Then suddenly Fibs fibs interrupted the Grandmother How on earth too did you come to decide upon the journey continued the General with raised voice as he hurried to overlook the old lady s last remark Surely at your age and in your present state of health the thing is so unexpected that our surprise is at least intelligible However I am glad to see you as indeed are we all he said this with a dignified yet conciliatory smile and will use my best endeavours to render your stay here as pleasant as possible Enough All this is empty chatter You are talking the usual nonsense I shall know quite well how to spend my time How did I come to undertake the journey you ask Well is there anything so very surprising about it It was done quite simply What is every one going into ecstasies about How do you do Prascovia What are YOU doing here And how are YOU Grandmother replied Polina as she approached the old lady Were you long on the journey The most sensible question that I have yet been asked Well you shall hear for yourself how it all happened I lay and lay and was doctored and doctored until at last I drove the physicians from me and called in an apothecary from Nicolai who had cured an old woman of a malady similar to my own cured her merely with a little hayseed Well he did me a great deal of good for on the third day I broke into a sweat and was able to leave my bed Then my German doctors held another consultation put on their spectacles and told me that if I would go abroad and take a course of the waters the indisposition would finally pass away Why should it not I thought to myself So I had got things ready and on the following day a Friday set out for here I occupied a special compartment in the train and where ever I had to change I found at the station bearers who were ready to carry me for a few coppers You have nice quarters here she went on as she glanced around the room But where on earth did you get the money for them my good sir I thought that everything of yours had been mortgaged This Frenchman alone must be your creditor for a good deal Oh I know all about it all about it I I am surprised at you my dearest mother said the General in some confusion I I am greatly surprised But I do not need any extraneous control of my finances Moreover my expenses do not exceed my income and we They do not exceed it Fie Why you are robbing your children of their last kopeck you their guardian After this said the General completely taken aback after what you have just said I do not know whether You do not know what By heavens are you never going to drop that roulette of yours Are you going to whistle all your property away This made such an impression upon the General that he almost choked with fury Roulette indeed I play roulette Really in view of my position Recollect what you are saying my dearest mother You must still be unwell Rubbish rubbish she retorted The truth is that you CANNOT be got away from that roulette You are simply telling lies This very day I mean to go and see for myself what roulette is like Prascovia tell me what there is to be seen here and do you Alexis Ivanovitch show me everything and do you Potapitch make me a list of excursions What IS there to be seen again she inquired of Polina There is a ruined castle and the Shlangenberg The Shlangenberg What is it A forest No a mountain on the summit of which there is a place fenced off From it you can get a most beautiful view Could a chair be carried up that mountain of yours Doubtless we could find bearers for the purpose I interposed At this moment Theodosia the nursemaid approached the old lady with the General s children No I DON T want to see them said the Grandmother I hate kissing children for their noses are always wet How are you getting on Theodosia I am very well thank you Madame replied the nursemaid And how is your ladyship We have been feeling so anxious about you Yes I know you simple soul But who are those other guests the old lady continued turning again to Polina For instance who is that old rascal in the spectacles Prince Nilski Grandmamma whispered Polina Oh a Russian Why I had no idea that he could understand me Surely he did not hear what I said As for mister Astley I have seen him already and I see that he is here again How do you do she added to the gentleman in question mister Astley bowed in silence Have you NOTHING to say to me the old lady went on Say something for goodness sake Translate to him Polina Polina did so I have only to say replied mister Astley gravely but also with alacrity that I am indeed glad to see you in such good health This was interpreted to the Grandmother and she seemed much gratified How well English people know how to answer one she remarked That is why I like them so much better than French Come here she added to mister Astley I will try not to bore you too much Polina translate to him that I am staying in rooms on a lower floor Yes on a lower floor she repeated to Astley pointing downwards with her finger Astley looked pleased at receiving the invitation Next the old lady scanned Polina from head to foot with minute attention I could almost have liked you Prascovia suddenly she remarked for you are a nice girl the best of the lot You have some character about you I too have character Turn round Surely that is not false hair that you are wearing No Grandmamma It is my own Well well I do not like the stupid fashions of today You are very good looking I should have fallen in love with you if I had been a man Why do you not get married It is time now that I was going I want to walk yet I always have to ride Are you still in a bad temper she added to the General No indeed rejoined the now mollified General I quite understand that at your time of life Cette vieille est tombee en enfance De Griers whispered to me But I want to look round a little the old lady added to the General Will you lend me Alexis Ivanovitch for the purpose As much as you like But I myself yes and Polina and Monsieur de Griers too we all of us hope to have the pleasure of escorting you Mais madame cela sera un plaisir De Griers commented with a bewitching smile Plaisir indeed Why I look upon you as a perfect fool monsieur Then she remarked to the General I am not going to let you have any of my money I must be off to my rooms now to see what they are like Afterwards we will look round a little Lift me up Again the Grandmother was borne aloft and carried down the staircase amid a perfect bevy of followers the General walking as though he had been hit over the head with a cudgel and De Griers seeming to be plunged in thought Endeavouring to be left behind Mlle Blanche next thought better of it and followed the rest with the Prince in her wake Only the German savant and Madame de Cominges did not leave the General s apartments X At spas and probably all over Europe hotel landlords and managers are guided in their allotment of rooms to visitors not so much by the wishes and requirements of those visitors as by their personal estimate of the same It may also be said that these landlords and managers seldom make a mistake To the Grandmother however our landlord for some reason or another allotted such a sumptuous suite that he fairly overreached himself for he assigned her a suite consisting of four magnificently appointed rooms with bathroom servants quarters a separate room for her maid and so on In fact during the previous week the suite had been occupied by no less a personage than a Grand Duchess which circumstance was duly explained to the new occupant as an excuse for raising the price of these apartments The Grandmother had herself carried or rather wheeled through each room in turn in order that she might subject the whole to a close and attentive scrutiny while the landlord an elderly bald headed man walked respectfully by her side What every one took the Grandmother to be I do not know but it appeared at least that she was accounted a person not only of great importance but also and still more of great wealth and without delay they entered her in the hotel register as Madame la Generale Princesse de Tarassevitcheva although she had never been a princess in her life Her retinue her reserved compartment in the train her pile of unnecessary trunks portmanteaux and strong boxes all helped to increase her prestige while her wheeled chair her sharp tone and voice her eccentric questions put with an air of the most overbearing and unbridled imperiousness her whole figure upright rugged and commanding as it was completed the general awe in which she was held As she inspected her new abode she ordered her chair to be stopped at intervals in order that with finger extended towards some article of furniture she might ply the respectfully smiling yet secretly apprehensive landlord with unexpected questions She addressed them to him in French although her pronunciation of the language was so bad that sometimes I had to translate them For the most part the landlord s answers were unsatisfactory and failed to please her nor were the questions themselves of a practical nature but related generally to God knows what For instance on one occasion she halted before a picture which a poor copy of a well known original had a mythological subject Of whom is this a portrait she inquired The landlord explained that it was probably that of a countess But how know you that the old lady retorted You live here yet you cannot say for certain And why is the picture there at all And why do its eyes look so crooked To all these questions the landlord could return no satisfactory reply despite his floundering endeavours The blockhead exclaimed the Grandmother in Russian Then she proceeded on her way only to repeat the same story in front of a Saxon statuette which she had sighted from afar and had commanded for some reason or another to be brought to her Finally she inquired of the landlord what was the value of the carpet in her bedroom as well as where the said carpet had been manufactured but the landlord could do no more than promise to make inquiries What donkeys these people are she commented Next she turned her attention to the bed What a huge counterpane she exclaimed Turn it back please The lacqueys did so Further yet further yet the old lady cried Turn it RIGHT back Also take off those pillows and bolsters and lift up the feather bed The bed was opened for her inspection Mercifully it contains no bugs she remarked Pull off the whole thing and then put on my own pillows and sheets The place is too luxurious for an old woman like myself It is too large for any one person Alexis Ivanovitch come and see me whenever you are not teaching your pupils After tomorrow I shall no longer be in the General s service I replied but merely living in the hotel on my own account Why so Because the other day there arrived from Berlin a German and his wife persons of some importance and it chanced that when taking a walk I spoke to them in German without having properly compassed the Berlin accent Indeed Yes and this action on my part the Baron held to be an insult and complained about it to the General who yesterday dismissed me from his employ But I suppose you must have threatened that precious Baron or something of the kind However even if you did so it was a matter of no moment No I did not The Baron was the aggressor by raising his stick at me Upon that the Grandmother turned sharply to the General What You permitted yourself to treat your tutor thus you nincompoop and to dismiss him from his post You are a blockhead an utter blockhead I can see that clearly Do not alarm yourself my dear mother the General replied with a lofty air an air in which there was also a tinge of familiarity I am quite capable of managing my own affairs Moreover Alexis Ivanovitch has not given you a true account of the matter What did you do next The old lady inquired of me I wanted to challenge the Baron to a duel I replied as modestly as possible but the General protested against my doing so And WHY did you so protest she inquired of the General Then she turned to the landlord and questioned him as to whether HE would not have fought a duel if challenged For she added I can see no difference between you and the Baron nor can I bear that German visage of yours Upon this the landlord bowed and departed though he could not have understood the Grandmother s compliment Pardon me Madame the General continued with a sneer but are duels really feasible Why not All men are crowing cocks and that is why they quarrel YOU though I perceive are a blockhead a man who does not even know how to carry his breeding Lift me up Potapitch see to it that you always have TWO bearers ready Go and arrange for their hire But we shall not require more than two for I shall need only to be carried upstairs On the level or in the street I can be WHEELED along Go and tell them that and pay them in advance so that they may show me some respect You too Potapitch are always to come with me and YOU Alexis Ivanovitch are to point out to me this Baron as we go along in order that I may get a squint at the precious Von And where is that roulette played I explained to her that the game was carried on in the salons of the Casino whereupon there ensued a string of questions as to whether there were many such salons whether many people played in them whether those people played a whole day at a time and whether the game was managed according to fixed rules At length I thought it best to say that the most advisable course would be for her to go and see it for herself since a mere description of it would be a difficult matter Then take me straight there she said and do you walk on in front of me Alexis Ivanovitch What mother Before you have so much as rested from your journey the General inquired with some solicitude Also for some reason which I could not divine he seemed to be growing nervous and indeed the whole party was evincing signs of confusion and exchanging glances with one another Probably they were thinking that it would be a ticklish even an embarrassing business to accompany the Grandmother to the Casino where very likely she would perpetrate further eccentricities and in public too Yet on their own initiative they had offered to escort her Why should I rest she retorted I am not tired for I have been sitting still these past five days Let us see what your medicinal springs and waters are like and where they are situated What too about that that what did you call it Prascovia oh about that mountain top Yes we are going to see it Grandmamma Very well Is there anything else for me to see here Yes Quite a number of things Polina forced herself to say Martha YOU must come with me as well went on the old lady to her maid No no mother ejaculated the General Really she cannot come They would not admit even Potapitch to the Casino Rubbish Because she is my servant is that a reason for turning her out Why she is only a human being like the rest of us and as she has been travelling for a week she might like to look about her With whom else could she go out but myself She would never dare to show her nose in the street alone But mother Are you ashamed to be seen with me Stop at home then and you will be asked no questions A pretty General YOU are to be sure I am a general s widow myself But after all why should I drag the whole party with me I will go and see the sights with only Alexis Ivanovitch as my escort De Griers strongly insisted that EVERY ONE ought to accompany her Indeed he launched out into a perfect shower of charming phrases concerning the pleasure of acting as her cicerone and so forth Every one was touched with his words Mais elle est tombee en enfance he added aside to the General Seule elle fera des betises More than this I could not overhear but he seemed to have got some plan in his mind or even to be feeling a slight return of his hopes The distance to the Casino was about half a verst and our route led us through the Chestnut Avenue until we reached the square directly fronting the building The General I could see was a trifle reassured by the fact that though our progress was distinctly eccentric in its nature it was at least correct and orderly As a matter of fact the spectacle of a person who is unable to walk is not anything to excite surprise at a spa Yet it was clear that the General had a great fear of the Casino itself for why should a person who had lost the use of her limbs more especially an old woman be going to rooms which were set apart only for roulette On either side of the wheeled chair walked Polina and Mlle Blanche the latter smiling modestly jesting and in short making herself so agreeable to the Grandmother that in the end the old lady relented towards her On the other side of the chair Polina had to answer an endless flow of petty questions such as Who was it passed just now Who is that coming along Is the town a large one Are the public gardens extensive What sort of trees are those What is the name of those hills Do I see eagles flying yonder What is that absurd looking building and so forth Meanwhile Astley whispered to me as he walked by my side that he looked for much to happen that morning Behind the old lady s chair marched Potapitch and Martha Potapitch in his frockcoat and white waistcoat with a cloak over all and the forty year old and rosy but slightly grey headed Martha in a mobcap cotton dress and squeaking shoes Frequently the old lady would twist herself round to converse with these servants As for De Griers he spoke as though he had made up his mind to do something though it is also possible that he spoke in this manner merely in order to hearten the General with whom he appeared to have held a conference But alas the Grandmother had uttered the fatal words I am not going to give you any of my money and though De Griers might regard these words lightly the General knew his mother better Also I noticed that De Griers and Mlle Blanche were still exchanging looks while of the Prince and the German savant I lost sight at the end of the Avenue where they had turned back and left us Into the Casino we marched in triumph At once both in the person of the commissionaire and in the persons of the footmen there sprang to life the same reverence as had arisen in the lacqueys of the hotel Yet it was not without some curiosity that they eyed us Without loss of time the Grandmother gave orders that she should be wheeled through every room in the establishment of which apartments she praised a few while to others she remained indifferent Concerning everything however she asked questions Finally we reached the gaming salons where a lacquey who was acting as guard over the doors flung them open as though he were a man possessed The Grandmother s entry into the roulette salon produced a profound impression upon the public Around the tables and at the further end of the room where the trente et quarante table was set out there may have been gathered from one hundred fifty to two hundred gamblers ranged in several rows Those who had succeeded in pushing their way to the tables were standing with their feet firmly planted in order to avoid having to give up their places until they should have finished their game since merely to stand looking on thus occupying a gambler s place for nothing was not permitted True chairs were provided around the tables but few players made use of them more especially if there was a large attendance of the general public since to stand allowed of a closer approach and therefore of greater facilities for calculation and staking Behind the foremost row were herded a second and a third row of people awaiting their turn but sometimes their impatience led these people to stretch a hand through the first row in order to deposit their stakes Even third row individuals would dart forward to stake whence seldom did more than five or ten minutes pass without a scene over disputed money arising at one or another end of the table On the other hand the police of the Casino were an able body of men and though to escape the crush was an impossibility however much one might wish it the eight croupiers apportioned to each table kept an eye upon the stakes performed the necessary reckoning and decided disputes as they arose In the last resort they always called in the Casino police and the disputes would immediately come to an end Policemen were stationed about the Casino in ordinary costume and mingled with the spectators so as to make it impossible to recognise them In particular they kept a lookout for pickpockets and swindlers who simply swanned in the roulette salons and reaped a rich harvest Indeed in every direction money was being filched from pockets or purses though of course if the attempt miscarried a great uproar ensued One had only to approach a roulette table begin to play and then openly grab some one else s winnings for a din to be raised and the thief to start vociferating that the stake was HIS and if the coup had been carried out with sufficient skill and the witnesses wavered at all in their testimony the thief would as likely as not succeed in getting away with the money provided that the sum was not a large one not large enough to have attracted the attention of the croupiers or some fellow player Moreover if it were a stake of insignificant size its true owner would sometimes decline to continue the dispute rather than become involved in a scandal Conversely if the thief was detected he was ignominiously expelled the building Upon all this the Grandmother gazed with open eyed curiosity and on some thieves happening to be turned out of the place she was delighted Trente et quarante interested her but little she preferred roulette with its ever revolving wheel At length she expressed a wish to view the game closer whereupon in some mysterious manner the lacqueys and other officious agents especially one or two ruined Poles of the kind who keep offering their services to successful gamblers and foreigners in general at once found and cleared a space for the old lady among the crush at the very centre of one of the tables and next to the chief croupier after which they wheeled her chair thither Upon this a number of visitors who were not playing but only looking on particularly some Englishmen with their families pressed closer forward towards the table in order to watch the old lady from among the ranks of the gamblers Many a lorgnette I saw turned in her direction and the croupiers hopes rose high that such an eccentric player was about to provide them with something out of the common An old lady of seventy five years who though unable to walk desired to play was not an everyday phenomenon I too pressed forward towards the table and ranged myself by the Grandmother s side while Martha and Potapitch remained somewhere in the background among the crowd and the General Polina and De Griers with Mlle Blanche also remained hidden among the spectators At first the old lady did no more than watch the gamblers and ply me in a half whisper with sharp broken questions as to who was so and so Especially did her favour light upon a very young man who was plunging heavily and had won so it was whispered as much as forty thousand francs which were lying before him on the table in a heap of gold and bank notes His eyes kept flashing and his hands shaking yet all the while he staked without any sort of calculation just what came to his hand as he kept winning and winning and raking and raking in his gains Around him lacqueys fussed placing chairs just behind where he was standing and clearing the spectators from his vicinity so that he should have more room and not be crowded the whole done of course in expectation of a generous largesse From time to time other gamblers would hand him part of their winnings being glad to let him stake for them as much as his hand could grasp while beside him stood a Pole in a state of violent but respectful agitation who also in expectation of a generous largesse kept whispering to him at intervals probably telling him what to stake and advising and directing his play Yet never once did the player throw him a glance as he staked and staked and raked in his winnings Evidently the player in question was dead to all besides For a few minutes the Grandmother watched him Go and tell him suddenly she exclaimed with a nudge at my elbow go and tell him to stop and to take his money with him and go home Presently he will be losing yes losing everything that he has now won She seemed almost breathless with excitement Where is Potapitch she continued Send Potapitch to speak to him No YOU must tell him you must tell him here she nudged me again for I have not the least notion where Potapitch is Sortez sortez she shouted to the young man until I leant over in her direction and whispered in her ear that no shouting was allowed nor even loud speaking since to do so disturbed the calculations of the players and might lead to our being ejected How provoking she retorted Then the young man is done for I suppose he WISHES to be ruined Yet I could not bear to see him have to return it all What a fool the fellow is and the old lady turned sharply away On the left among the players at the other half of the table a young lady was playing with beside her a dwarf Who the dwarf may have been whether a relative or a person whom she took with her to act as a foil I do not know but I had noticed her there on previous occasions since everyday she entered the Casino at one o clock precisely and departed at two thus playing for exactly one hour Being well known to the attendants she always had a seat provided for her and taking some gold and a few thousand franc notes out of her pocket would begin quietly coldly and after much calculation to stake and mark down the figures in pencil on a paper as though striving to work out a system according to which at given moments the odds might group themselves Always she staked large coins and either lost or won one two or three thousand francs a day but not more after which she would depart The Grandmother took a long look at her THAT woman is not losing she said To whom does she belong Do you know her Who is she She is I believe a Frenchwoman I replied Ah A bird of passage evidently Besides I can see that she has her shoes polished Now explain to me the meaning of each round in the game and the way in which one ought to stake Upon this I set myself to explain the meaning of all the combinations of rouge et noir of pair et impair of manque et passe with lastly the different values in the system of numbers The Grandmother listened attentively took notes put questions in various forms and laid the whole thing to heart Indeed since an example of each system of stakes kept constantly occurring a great deal of information could be assimilated with ease and celerity The Grandmother was vastly pleased But what is zero she inquired Just now I heard the flaxen haired croupier call out zero And why does he keep raking in all the money that is on the table To think that he should grab the whole pile for himself What does zero mean Zero is what the bank takes for itself If the wheel stops at that figure everything lying on the table becomes the absolute property of the bank Also whenever the wheel has begun to turn the bank ceases to pay out anything Then I should receive nothing if I were staking No unless by any chance you had PURPOSELY staked on zero in which case you would receive thirty five times the value of your stake Why thirty five times when zero so often turns up And if so why do not more of these fools stake upon it Because the number of chances against its occurrence is thirty six Rubbish Potapitch Potapitch Come here and I will give you some money The old lady took out of her pocket a tightly clasped purse and extracted from its depths a ten gulden piece Go at once and stake that upon zero But Madame zero has only this moment turned up I remonstrated wherefore it may not do so again for ever so long Wait a little and you may then have a better chance Rubbish Stake please Pardon me but zero might not turn up again until say tonight even though you had staked thousands upon it It often happens so Rubbish rubbish Who fears the wolf should never enter the forest What We have lost Then stake again A second ten gulden piece did we lose and then I put down a third The Grandmother could scarcely remain seated in her chair so intent was she upon the little ball as it leapt through the notches of the ever revolving wheel However the third ten gulden piece followed the first two Upon this the Grandmother went perfectly crazy She could no longer sit still and actually struck the table with her fist when the croupier cried out Trente six instead of the desiderated zero To listen to him fumed the old lady When will that accursed zero ever turn up I cannot breathe until I see it I believe that that infernal croupier is PURPOSELY keeping it from turning up Alexis Ivanovitch stake TWO golden pieces this time The moment we cease to stake that cursed zero will come turning up and we shall get nothing My good Madame Stake stake It is not YOUR money Accordingly I staked two ten gulden pieces The ball went hopping round the wheel until it began to settle through the notches Meanwhile the Grandmother sat as though petrified with my hand convulsively clutched in hers Zero called the croupier There You see you see cried the old lady as she turned and faced me wreathed in smiles I told you so It was the Lord God himself who suggested to me to stake those two coins Now how much ought I to receive Why do they not pay it out to me Potapitch Martha Where are they What has become of our party Potapitch Potapitch Presently Madame I whispered Potapitch is outside and they would decline to admit him to these rooms See You are being paid out your money Pray take it The croupiers were making up a heavy packet of coins sealed in blue paper and containing fifty ten gulden pieces together with an unsealed packet containing another twenty I handed the whole to the old lady in a money shovel Faites le jeu messieurs Faites le jeu messieurs Rien ne va plus proclaimed the croupier as once more he invited the company to stake and prepared to turn the wheel We shall be too late He is going to spin again Stake stake The Grandmother was in a perfect fever Do not hang back Be quick She seemed almost beside herself and nudged me as hard as she could Upon what shall I stake Madame Upon zero upon zero Again upon zero Stake as much as ever you can How much have we got Seventy ten gulden pieces We shall not miss them so stake twenty pieces at a time Think a moment Madame Sometimes zero does not turn up for two hundred rounds in succession I assure you that you may lose all your capital You are wrong utterly wrong Stake I tell you What a chattering tongue you have I know perfectly well what I am doing The old lady was shaking with excitement But the rules do not allow of more than one hundred twenty gulden being staked upon zero at a time How do not allow Surely you are wrong Monsieur monsieur here she nudged the croupier who was sitting on her left and preparing to spin combien zero Douze Douze I hastened to translate Oui Madame was the croupier s polite reply No single stake must exceed four thousand florins That is the regulation Then there is nothing else for it We must risk in gulden Le jeu est fait the croupier called The wheel revolved and stopped at thirty We had lost Again again again Stake again shouted the old lady Without attempting to oppose her further but merely shrugging my shoulders I placed twelve more ten gulden pieces upon the table The wheel whirled around and around with the Grandmother simply quaking as she watched its revolutions Does she again think that zero is going to be the winning coup thought I as I stared at her in astonishment Yet an absolute assurance of winning was shining on her face she looked perfectly convinced that zero was about to be called again At length the ball dropped off into one of the notches Zero cried the croupier Ah screamed the old lady as she turned to me in a whirl of triumph I myself was at heart a gambler At that moment I became acutely conscious both of that fact and of the fact that my hands and knees were shaking and that the blood was beating in my brain Of course this was a rare occasion an occasion on which zero had turned up no less than three times within a dozen rounds yet in such an event there was nothing so very surprising seeing that only three days ago I myself had been a witness to zero turning up THREE TIMES IN SUCCESSION so that one of the players who was recording the coups on paper was moved to remark that for several days past zero had never turned up at all With the Grandmother as with any one who has won a very large sum the management settled up with great attention and respect since she was fortunate to have to receive no less than four thousand two hundred gulden Of these gulden the odd two hundred were paid her in gold and the remainder in bank notes This time the old lady did not call for Potapitch for that she was too preoccupied Though not outwardly shaken by the event indeed she seemed perfectly calm she was trembling inwardly from head to foot At length completely absorbed in the game she burst out Alexis Ivanovitch did not the croupier just say that four thousand florins were the most that could be staked at any one time Well take these four thousand and stake them upon the red To oppose her was useless Once more the wheel revolved Rouge proclaimed the croupier Again four thousand florins in all eight thousand Give me them commanded the Grandmother and stake the other four thousand upon the red again I did so Rouge proclaimed the croupier Twelve thousand cried the old lady Hand me the whole lot Put the gold into this purse here and count the bank notes Enough Let us go home Wheel my chair away XI THE chair with the old lady beaming in it was wheeled away towards the doors at the further end of the salon while our party hastened to crowd around her and to offer her their congratulations In fact eccentric as was her conduct it was also overshadowed by her triumph with the result that the General no longer feared to be publicly compromised by being seen with such a strange woman but smiling in a condescending cheerfully familiar way as though he were soothing a child he offered his greetings to the old lady At the same time both he and the rest of the spectators were visibly impressed Everywhere people kept pointing to the Grandmother and talking about her Many people even walked beside her chair in order to view her the better while at a little distance Astley was carrying on a conversation on the subject with two English acquaintances of his De Griers was simply overflowing with smiles and compliments and a number of fine ladies were staring at the Grandmother as though she had been something curious Quelle victoire exclaimed De Griers Mais Madame c etait du feu added Mlle Blanche with an elusive smile Yes I have won twelve thousand florins replied the old lady And then there is all this gold With it the total ought to come to nearly thirteen thousand How much is that in Russian money Six thousand roubles I think However I calculated that the sum would exceed seven thousand roubles or at the present rate of exchange even eight thousand Eight thousand roubles What a splendid thing And to think of you simpletons sitting there and doing nothing Potapitch Martha See what I have won How DID you do it Madame Martha exclaimed ecstatically Eight thousand roubles And I am going to give you fifty gulden apiece There they are Potapitch and Martha rushed towards her to kiss her hand And to each bearer also I will give a ten gulden piece Let them have it out of the gold Alexis Ivanovitch But why is this footman bowing to me and that other man as well Are they congratulating me Well let them have ten gulden apiece Madame la princesse Un pauvre expatrie Malheur continuel Les princes russes sont si genereux said a man who for some time past had been hanging around the old lady s chair a personage who dressed in a shabby frockcoat and coloured waistcoat kept taking off his cap and smiling pathetically Give him ten gulden said the Grandmother No give him twenty Now enough of that or I shall never get done with you all Take a moment s rest and then carry me away Prascovia I mean to buy a new dress for you tomorrow Yes and for you too Mlle Blanche Please translate Prascovia Merci Madame replied Mlle Blanche gratefully as she twisted her face into the mocking smile which usually she kept only for the benefit of De Griers and the General The latter looked confused and seemed greatly relieved when we reached the Avenue How surprised Theodosia too will be went on the Grandmother thinking of the General s nursemaid She like yourselves shall have the price of a new gown Here Alexis Ivanovitch Give that beggar something a crooked backed ragamuffin had approached to stare at us But perhaps he is NOT a beggar only a rascal I replied Never mind never mind Give him a gulden I approached the beggar in question and handed him the coin Looking at me in great astonishment he silently accepted the gulden while from his person there proceeded a strong smell of liquor Have you never tried your luck Alexis Ivanovitch No Madame Yet just now I could see that you were burning to do so I do mean to try my luck presently Then stake everything upon zero You have seen how it ought to be done How much capital do you possess Two hundred gulden Madame Not very much See here I will lend you five hundred if you wish Take this purse of mine With that she added sharply to the General But YOU need not expect to receive any This seemed to upset him but he said nothing and De Griers contented himself by scowling Que diable he whispered to the General C est une terrible vieille Look Another beggar another beggar exclaimed the grandmother Alexis Ivanovitch go and give him a gulden As she spoke I saw approaching us a grey headed old man with a wooden leg a man who was dressed in a blue frockcoat and carrying a staff He looked like an old soldier As soon as I tendered him the coin he fell back a step or two and eyed me threateningly Was ist der Teufel he cried and appended thereto a round dozen of oaths The man is a perfect fool exclaimed the Grandmother waving her hand Move on now for I am simply famished When we have lunched we will return to that place What cried I You are going to play again What else do you suppose she retorted Are you going only to sit here and grow sour and let me look at you Madame said De Griers confidentially les chances peuvent tourner Une seule mauvaise chance et vous perdrez tout surtout avec votre jeu C etait terrible Oui vous perdrez absolument put in Mlle Blanche What has that got to do with YOU retorted the old lady It is not YOUR money that I am going to lose it is my own And where is that mister Astley of yours she added to myself He stayed behind in the Casino What a pity He is such a nice sort of man Arriving home and meeting the landlord on the staircase the Grandmother called him to her side and boasted to him of her winnings thereafter doing the same to Theodosia and conferring upon her thirty gulden after which she bid her serve luncheon The meal over Theodosia and Martha broke into a joint flood of ecstasy I was watching you all the time Madame quavered Martha and I asked Potapitch what mistress was trying to do And my word the heaps and heaps of money that were lying upon the table Never in my life have I seen so much money And there were gentlefolk around it and other gentlefolk sitting down So I asked Potapitch where all these gentry had come from for thought I maybe the Holy Mother of God will help our mistress among them Yes I prayed for you Madame and my heart died within me so that I kept trembling and trembling The Lord be with her I thought to myself and in answer to my prayer He has now sent you what He has done Even yet I tremble I tremble to think of it all Alexis Ivanovitch said the old lady after luncheon that is to say about four o clock get ready to go out with me again But in the meanwhile good bye Do not forget to call a doctor for I must take the waters Now go and get rested a little I left the Grandmother s presence in a state of bewilderment Vainly I endeavoured to imagine what would become of our party or what turn the affair would next take I could perceive that none of the party had yet recovered their presence of mind least of all the General The factor of the Grandmother s appearance in place of the hourly expected telegram to announce her death with of course resultant legacies had so upset the whole scheme of intentions and projects that it was with a decided feeling of apprehension and growing paralysis that the conspirators viewed any future performances of the old lady at roulette Yet this second factor was not quite so important as the first since though the Grandmother had twice declared that she did not intend to give the General any money that declaration was not a complete ground for the abandonment of hope Certainly De Griers who with the General was up to the neck in the affair had not wholly lost courage and I felt sure that Mlle Blanche also Mlle Blanche who was not only as deeply involved as the other two but also expectant of becoming Madame General and an important legatee would not lightly surrender the position but would use her every resource of coquetry upon the old lady in order to afford a contrast to the impetuous Polina who was difficult to understand and lacked the art of pleasing Yet now when the Grandmother had just performed an astonishing feat at roulette now when the old lady s personality had been so clearly and typically revealed as that of a rugged arrogant woman who was tombee en enfance now when everything appeared to be lost why now the Grandmother was as merry as a child which plays with thistle down Good Lord I thought with may God forgive me a most malicious smile every ten gulden piece which the Grandmother staked must have raised a blister on the General s heart and maddened De Griers and driven Mlle de Cominges almost to frenzy with the sight of this spoon dangling before her lips Another factor is the circumstance that even when overjoyed at winning the Grandmother was distributing alms right and left and taking every one to be a beggar she again snapped out to the General that he was not going to be allowed any of her money which meant that the old lady had quite made up her mind on the point and was sure of it Yes danger loomed ahead All these thoughts passed through my mind during the few moments that having left the old lady s rooms I was ascending to my own room on the top storey What most struck me was the fact that though I had divined the chief the stoutest threads which united the various actors in the drama I had until now been ignorant of the methods and secrets of the game For Polina had never been completely open with me Although on occasions it had happened that involuntarily as it were she had revealed to me something of her heart I had noticed that in most cases in fact nearly always she had either laughed away these revelations or grown confused or purposely imparted to them a false guise Yes she must have concealed a great deal from me But I had a presentiment that now the end of this strained and mysterious situation was approaching Another stroke and all would be finished and exposed Of my own fortunes interested though I was in the affair I took no account I was in the strange position of possessing but two hundred gulden of being at a loose end of lacking both a post the means of subsistence a shred of hope and any plans for the future yet of caring nothing for these things Had not my mind been so full of Polina I should have given myself up to the comical piquancy of the impending denouement and laughed my fill at it But the thought of Polina was torture to me That her fate was settled I already had an inkling yet that was not the thought which was giving me so much uneasiness What I really wished for was to penetrate her secrets I wanted her to come to me and say I love you and if she would not so come or if to hope that she would ever do so was an unthinkable absurdity why then there was nothing else for me to want Even now I do not know what I am wanting I feel like a man who has lost his way I yearn but to be in her presence and within the circle of her light and splendour to be there now and forever and for the whole of my life More I do not know How can I ever bring myself to leave her On reaching the third storey of the hotel I experienced a shock I was just passing the General s suite when something caused me to look round Out of a door about twenty paces away there was coming Polina She hesitated for a moment on seeing me and then beckoned me to her Polina Alexandrovna Hush Not so loud Something startled me just now I whispered and I looked round and saw you Some electrical influence seems to emanate from your form Take this letter she went on with a frown probably she had not even heard my words she was so preoccupied and hand it personally to mister Astley Go as quickly as ever you can please No answer will be required He himself She did not finish her sentence To mister Astley I asked in some astonishment But she had vanished again Aha So the two were carrying on a correspondence However I set off to search for Astley first at his hotel and then at the Casino where I went the round of the salons in vain At length vexed and almost in despair I was on my way home when I ran across him among a troop of English ladies and gentlemen who had been out for a ride Beckoning to him to stop I handed him the letter We had barely time even to look at one another but I suspected that it was of set purpose that he restarted his horse so quickly Was jealousy then gnawing at me At all events I felt exceedingly depressed despite the fact that I had no desire to ascertain what the correspondence was about To think that HE should be her confidant My friend mine own familiar friend passed through my mind Yet WAS there any love in the matter Of course not reason whispered to me But reason goes for little on such occasions I felt that the matter must be cleared up for it was becoming unpleasantly complex I had scarcely set foot in the hotel when the commissionaire and the landlord the latter issuing from his room for the purpose alike informed me that I was being searched for high and low that three separate messages to ascertain my whereabouts had come down from the General When I entered his study I was feeling anything but kindly disposed I found there the General himself De Griers and Mlle Blanche but not Mlle s mother who was a person whom her reputed daughter used only for show purposes since in all matters of business the daughter fended for herself and it is unlikely that the mother knew anything about them Some very heated discussion was in progress and meanwhile the door of the study was open an unprecedented circumstance As I approached the portals I could hear loud voices raised for mingled with the pert venomous accents of De Griers were Mlle Blanche s excited impudently abusive tongue and the General s plaintive wail as apparently he sought to justify himself in something But on my appearance every one stopped speaking and tried to put a better face upon matters De Griers smoothed his hair and twisted his angry face into a smile into the mean studiedly polite French smile which I so detested while the downcast perplexed General assumed an air of dignity though only in a mechanical way On the other hand Mlle Blanche did not trouble to conceal the wrath that was sparkling in her countenance but bent her gaze upon me with an air of impatient expectancy I may remark that hitherto she had treated me with absolute superciliousness and so far from answering my salutations had always ignored them Alexis Ivanovitch began the General in a tone of affectionate upbraiding may I say to you that I find it strange exceedingly strange that In short your conduct towards myself and my family In a word your er extremely Eh Ce n est pas ca interrupted De Griers in a tone of impatience and contempt evidently he was the ruling spirit of the conclave Mon cher monsieur notre general se trompe What he means to say is that he warns you he begs of you most earnestly not to ruin him I use the expression because Why Why I interjected Because you have taken upon yourself to act as guide to this to this how shall I express it to this old lady a cette pauvre terrible vieille But she will only gamble away all that she has gamble it away like thistledown You yourself have seen her play Once she has acquired the taste for gambling she will never leave the roulette table but of sheer perversity and temper will stake her all and lose it In cases such as hers a gambler can never be torn away from the game and then and then And then asseverated the General you will have ruined my whole family I and my family are her heirs for she has no nearer relatives than ourselves I tell you frankly that my affairs are in great very great disorder how much they are so you yourself are partially aware If she should lose a large sum or maybe her whole fortune what will become of us of my children here the General exchanged a glance with De Griers or of me here he looked at Mlle Blanche who turned her head contemptuously away Alexis Ivanovitch I beg of you to save us Tell me General how am I to do so On what footing do I stand here Refuse to take her about Simply leave her alone But she would soon find some one else to take my place Ce n est pas ca ce n est pas ca again interrupted De Griers Que diable Do not leave her alone so much as advise her persuade her draw her away In any case do not let her gamble find her some counter attraction And how am I to do that If only you would undertake the task Monsieur de Griers I said this last as innocently as possible but at once saw a rapid glance of excited interrogation pass from Mlle Blanche to De Griers while in the face of the latter also there gleamed something which he could not repress Well at the present moment she would refuse to accept my services said he with a gesture But if later Here he gave Mlle Blanche another glance which was full of meaning whereupon she advanced towards me with a bewitching smile and seized and pressed my hands Devil take it but how that devilish visage of hers could change At the present moment it was a visage full of supplication and as gentle in its expression as that of a smiling roguish infant Stealthily she drew me apart from the rest as though the more completely to separate me from them and though no harm came of her doing so for it was merely a stupid manoeuvre and no more I found the situation very unpleasant The General hastened to lend her his support Alexis Ivanovitch he began pray pardon me for having said what I did just now for having said more than I meant to do I beg and beseech you I kiss the hem of your garment as our Russian saying has it for you and only you can save us I and Mlle de Cominges we all of us beg of you But you understand do you not Surely you understand and with his eyes he indicated Mlle Blanche Truly he was cutting a pitiful figure At this moment three low respectful knocks sounded at the door which on being opened revealed a chambermaid with Potapitch behind her come from the Grandmother to request that I should attend her in her rooms She is in a bad humour added Potapitch The time was half past three My mistress was unable to sleep explained Potapitch so after tossing about for a while she suddenly rose called for her chair and sent me to look for you She is now in the verandah Quelle megere exclaimed De Griers True enough I found Madame in the hotel verandah much put about at my delay for she had been unable to contain herself until four o clock Lift me up she cried to the bearers and once more we set out for the roulette salons XII The Grandmother was in an impatient irritable frame of mind Without doubt the roulette had turned her head for she appeared to be indifferent to everything else and in general seemed much distraught For instance she asked me no questions about objects en route except that when a sumptuous barouche passed us and raised a cloud of dust she lifted her hand for a moment and inquired What was that Yet even then she did not appear to hear my reply although at times her abstraction was interrupted by sallies and fits of sharp impatient fidgeting Again when I pointed out to her the Baron and Baroness Burmergelm walking to the Casino she merely looked at them in an absent minded sort of way and said with complete indifference Ah Then turning sharply to Potapitch and Martha who were walking behind us she rapped out Why have YOU attached yourselves to the party We are not going to take you with us every time Go home at once Then when the servants had pulled hasty bows and departed she added to me You are all the escort I need At the Casino the Grandmother seemed to be expected for no time was lost in procuring her former place beside the croupier It is my opinion that though croupiers seem such ordinary humdrum officials men who care nothing whether the bank wins or loses they are in reality anything but indifferent to the bank s losing and are given instructions to attract players and to keep a watch over the bank s interests as also that for such services these officials are awarded prizes and premiums At all events the croupiers of Roulettenberg seemed to look upon the Grandmother as their lawful prey whereafter there befell what our party had foretold It happened thus As soon as ever we arrived the Grandmother ordered me to stake twelve ten gulden pieces in succession upon zero Once twice and thrice I did so yet zero never turned up Stake again said the old lady with an impatient nudge of my elbow and I obeyed How many times have we lost she inquired actually grinding her teeth in her excitement We have lost one hundred forty four ten gulden pieces I replied I tell you Madame that zero may not turn up until nightfall Never mind she interrupted Keep on staking upon zero and also stake a thousand gulden upon rouge Here is a banknote with which to do so The red turned up but zero missed again and we only got our thousand gulden back But you see you see whispered the old lady We have now recovered almost all that we staked Try zero again Let us do so another ten times and then leave off By the fifth round however the Grandmother was weary of the scheme To the devil with that zero she exclaimed Stake four thousand gulden upon the red But Madame that will be so much to venture I remonstrated Suppose the red should not turn up The Grandmother almost struck me in her excitement Her agitation was rapidly making her quarrelsome Consequently there was nothing for it but to stake the whole four thousand gulden as she had directed The wheel revolved while the Grandmother sat as bolt upright and with as proud and quiet a mien as though she had not the least doubt of winning Zero cried the croupier At first the old lady failed to understand the situation but as soon as she saw the croupier raking in her four thousand gulden together with everything else that happened to be lying on the table and recognised that the zero which had been so long turning up and on which we had lost nearly two hundred ten gulden pieces had at length as though of set purpose made a sudden reappearance why the poor old lady fell to cursing it and to throwing herself about and wailing and gesticulating at the company at large Indeed some people in our vicinity actually burst out laughing To think that that accursed zero should have turned up NOW she sobbed The accursed accursed thing And it is all YOUR fault she added rounding upon me in a frenzy It was you who persuaded me to cease staking upon it But Madame I only explained the game to you How am I to answer for every mischance which may occur in it You and your mischances she whispered threateningly Go Away at once Farewell then Madame And I turned to depart No stay she put in hastily Where are you going to Why should you leave me You fool No no stay here It is I who was the fool Tell me what I ought to do I cannot take it upon myself to advise you for you will only blame me if I do so Play at your own discretion Say exactly what you wish staked and I will stake it Very well Stake another four thousand gulden upon the red Take this banknote to do it with I have still got twenty thousand roubles in actual cash But I whispered such a quantity of money Never mind I cannot rest until I have won back my losses Stake I staked and we lost Stake again stake again eight thousand at a stroke I cannot Madame The largest stake allowed is four thousand gulden Well then stake four thousand This time we won and the Grandmother recovered herself a little You see you see she exclaimed as she nudged me Stake another four thousand I did so and lost Again and yet again we lost Madame your twelve thousand gulden are now gone at length I reported I see they are she replied with as it were the calmness of despair I see they are she muttered again as she gazed straight in front of her like a person lost in thought Ah well I do not mean to rest until I have staked another four thousand But you have no money with which to do it Madame In this satchel I can see only a few five percent bonds and some transfers no actual cash And in the purse A mere trifle But there is a money changer s office here is there not They told me I should be able to get any sort of paper security changed Quite so to any amount you please But you will lose on the transaction what would frighten even a Jew Rubbish I am DETERMINED to retrieve my losses Take me away and call those fools of bearers I wheeled the chair out of the throng and the bearers making their appearance we left the Casino Hurry hurry commanded the Grandmother Show me the nearest way to the money changer s Is it far A couple of steps Madame At the turning from the square into the Avenue we came face to face with the whole of our party the General De Griers Mlle Blanche and her mother Only Polina and mister Astley were absent Well well well exclaimed the Grandmother But we have no time to stop What do you want I can t talk to you here I dropped behind a little and immediately was pounced upon by De Griers She has lost this morning s winnings I whispered and also twelve thousand gulden of her original money At the present moment we are going to get some bonds changed De Griers stamped his foot with vexation and hastened to communicate the tidings to the General Meanwhile we continued to wheel the old lady along Stop her stop her whispered the General in consternation You had better try and stop her yourself I returned also in a whisper My good mother he said as he approached her my good mother pray let let his voice was beginning to tremble and sink let us hire a carriage and go for a drive Near here there is an enchanting view to be obtained We we we were just coming to invite you to go and see it Begone with you and your views said the Grandmother angrily as she waved him away And there are trees there and we could have tea under them continued the General now in utter despair Nous boirons du lait sur l herbe fraiche added De Griers with the snarl almost of a wild beast Du lait de l herbe fraiche the idyll the ideal of the Parisian bourgeois his whole outlook upon la nature et la verite Have done with you and your milk cried the old lady Go and stuff YOURSELF as much as you like but my stomach simply recoils from the idea What are you stopping for I have nothing to say to you Here we are Madame I announced Here is the moneychanger s office I entered to get the securities changed while the Grandmother remained outside in the porch and the rest waited at a little distance in doubt as to their best course of action At length the old lady turned such an angry stare upon them that they departed along the road towards the Casino The process of changing involved complicated calculations which soon necessitated my return to the Grandmother for instructions The thieves she exclaimed as she clapped her hands together Never mind though Get the documents cashed No send the banker out to me she added as an afterthought Would one of the clerks do Madame Yes one of the clerks The thieves The clerk consented to come out when he perceived that he was being asked for by an old lady who was too infirm to walk after which the Grandmother began to upbraid him at length and with great vehemence for his alleged usuriousness and to bargain with him in a mixture of Russian French and German I acting as interpreter Meanwhile the grave faced official eyed us both and silently nodded his head At the Grandmother in particular he gazed with a curiosity which almost bordered upon rudeness At length too he smiled Pray recollect yourself cried the old lady And may my money choke you Alexis Ivanovitch tell him that we can easily repair to someone else The clerk says that others will give you even less than he Of what the ultimate calculations consisted I do not exactly remember but at all events they were alarming Receiving twelve thousand florins in gold I took also the statement of accounts and carried it out to the Grandmother Well well she said I am no accountant Let us hurry away hurry away And she waved the paper aside Neither upon that accursed zero however nor upon that equally accursed red do I mean to stake a cent I muttered to myself as I entered the Casino This time I did all I could to persuade the old lady to stake as little as possible saying that a turn would come in the chances when she would be at liberty to stake more But she was so impatient that though at first she agreed to do as I suggested nothing could stop her when once she had begun By way of prelude she won stakes of a hundred and two hundred gulden There you are she said as she nudged me See what we have won Surely it would be worth our while to stake four thousand instead of a hundred for we might win another four thousand and then Oh it was YOUR fault before all your fault I felt greatly put out as I watched her play but I decided to hold my tongue and to give her no more advice Suddenly De Griers appeared on the scene It seemed that all this while he and his companions had been standing beside us though I noticed that Mlle Blanche had withdrawn a little from the rest and was engaged in flirting with the Prince Clearly the General was greatly put out at this Indeed he was in a perfect agony of vexation But Mlle was careful never to look his way though he did his best to attract her notice Poor General By turns his face blanched and reddened and he was trembling to such an extent that he could scarcely follow the old lady s play At length Mlle and the Prince took their departure and the General followed them Madame Madame sounded the honeyed accents of De Griers as he leant over to whisper in the Grandmother s ear That stake will never win No no it is impossible he added in Russian with a writhe No no But why not asked the Grandmother turning round Show me what I ought to do Instantly De Griers burst into a babble of French as he advised jumped about declared that such and such chances ought to be waited for and started to make calculations of figures All this he addressed to me in my capacity as translator tapping the table the while with his finger and pointing hither and thither At length he seized a pencil and began to reckon sums on paper until he had exhausted the Grandmother s patience Away with you she interrupted You talk sheer nonsense for though you keep on saying Madame Madame you haven t the least notion what ought to be done Away with you I say Mais Madame cooed De Griers and straightway started afresh with his fussy instructions Stake just ONCE as he advises the Grandmother said to me and then we shall see what we shall see Of course his stake MIGHT win As a matter of fact De Grier s one object was to distract the old lady from staking large sums wherefore he now suggested to her that she should stake upon certain numbers singly and in groups Consequently in accordance with his instructions I staked a ten gulden piece upon several odd numbers in the first twenty and five ten gulden pieces upon certain groups of numbers groups of from twelve to eighteen and from eighteen to twenty four The total staked amounted to one hundred sixty gulden The wheel revolved Zero cried the croupier We had lost it all The fool cried the old lady as she turned upon De Griers You infernal Frenchman to think that you should advise Away with you Though you fuss and fuss you don t even know what you re talking about Deeply offended De Griers shrugged his shoulders favoured the Grandmother with a look of contempt and departed For some time past he had been feeling ashamed of being seen in such company and this had proved the last straw An hour later we had lost everything in hand Home cried the Grandmother Not until we had turned into the Avenue did she utter a word but from that point onwards until we arrived at the hotel she kept venting exclamations of What a fool I am What a silly old fool I am to be sure Arrived at the hotel she called for tea and then gave orders for her luggage to be packed We are off again she announced But whither Madame inquired Martha What business is that of YOURS Let the cricket stick to its hearth The Russian form of Mind your own business Potapitch have everything packed for we are returning to Moscow at once I have fooled away fifteen thousand roubles Fifteen thousand roubles good mistress My God And Potapitch spat upon his hands probably to show that he was ready to serve her in any way he could Now then you fool At once you begin with your weeping and wailing Be quiet and pack Also run downstairs and get my hotel bill The next train leaves at nine thirty Madame I interposed with a view to checking her agitation And what is the time now Half past eight How vexing But never mind Alexis Ivanovitch I have not a kopeck left I have but these two bank notes Please run to the office and get them changed Otherwise I shall have nothing to travel with Departing on her errand I returned half an hour later to find the whole party gathered in her rooms It appeared that the news of her impending departure for Moscow had thrown the conspirators into consternation even greater than her losses had done For said they even if her departure should save her fortune what will become of the General later And who is to repay De Griers Clearly Mlle Blanche would never consent to wait until the Grandmother was dead but would at once elope with the Prince or someone else So they had all gathered together endeavouring to calm and dissuade the Grandmother Only Polina was absent For her part the Grandmother had nothing for the party but abuse Away with you you rascals she was shouting What have my affairs to do with you Why in particular do you here she indicated De Griers come sneaking here with your goat s beard And what do YOU here she turned to Mlle Blanche want of me What are YOU finicking for Diantre muttered Mlle under her breath but her eyes were flashing Then all at once she burst into a laugh and left the room crying to the General as she did so Elle vivra cent ans So you have been counting upon my death have you fumed the old lady Away with you Clear them out of the room Alexis Ivanovitch What business is it of THEIRS It is not THEIR money that I have been squandering but my own The General shrugged his shoulders bowed and withdrew with De Griers behind him Call Prascovia commanded the Grandmother and in five minutes Martha reappeared with Polina who had been sitting with the children in her own room having purposely determined not to leave it that day Her face looked grave and careworn Prascovia began the Grandmother is what I have just heard through a side wind true namely that this fool of a stepfather of yours is going to marry that silly whirligig of a Frenchwoman that actress or something worse Tell me is it true I do not know FOR CERTAIN Grandmamma replied Polina but from Mlle Blanche s account for she does not appear to think it necessary to conceal anything I conclude that You need not say any more interrupted the Grandmother energetically I understand the situation I always thought we should get something like this from him for I always looked upon him as a futile frivolous fellow who gave himself unconscionable airs on the fact of his being a general though he only became one because he retired as a colonel Yes I know all about the sending of the telegrams to inquire whether the old woman is likely to turn up her toes soon Ah they were looking for the legacies Without money that wretched woman what is her name Oh De Cominges would never dream of accepting the General and his false teeth no not even for him to be her lacquey since she herself they say possesses a pile of money and lends it on interest and makes a good thing out of it However it is not you Prascovia that I am blaming it was not you who sent those telegrams Nor for that matter do I wish to recall old scores True I know that you are a vixen by nature that you are a wasp which will sting one if one touches it yet my heart is sore for you for I loved your mother Katerina Now will you leave everything here and come away with me Otherwise I do not know what is to become of you and it is not right that you should continue living with these people Nay she interposed the moment that Polina attempted to speak I have not yet finished I ask of you nothing in return My house in Moscow is as you know large enough for a palace and you could occupy a whole floor of it if you liked and keep away from me for weeks together Will you come with me or will you not First of all let me ask of YOU replied Polina whether you are intending to depart at once What You suppose me to be jesting I have said that I am going and I AM going Today I have squandered fifteen thousand roubles at that accursed roulette of yours and though five years ago I promised the people of a certain suburb of Moscow to build them a stone church in place of a wooden one I have been fooling away my money here However I am going back now to build my church But what about the waters Grandmamma Surely you came here to take the waters You and your waters Do not anger me Prascovia Surely you are trying to Say then will you or will you not come with me Grandmamma Polina replied with deep feeling I am very very grateful to you for the shelter which you have so kindly offered me Also to a certain extent you have guessed my position aright and I am beholden to you to such an extent that it may be that I will come and live with you and that very soon yet there are important reasons why why I cannot make up my mind just yet If you would let me have say a couple of weeks to decide in You mean that you are NOT coming I mean only that I cannot come just yet At all events I could not well leave my little brother and sister here since since if I were to leave them they would be abandoned altogether But if Grandmamma you would take the little ones AND myself then of course I could come with you and would do all I could to serve you this she said with great earnestness Only without the little ones I CANNOT come Do not make a fuss as a matter of fact Polina never at any time either fussed or wept The Great Foster Father Translated literally The Great Poulterer can find for all his chicks a place You are not coming without the children But see here Prascovia I wish you well and nothing but well yet I have divined the reason why you will not come Yes I know all Prascovia That Frenchman will never bring you good of any sort Polina coloured hotly and even I started For thought I to myself every one seems to know about that affair Or perhaps I am the only one who does not know about it Now now Do not frown continued the Grandmother But I do not intend to slur things over You will take care that no harm befalls you will you not For you are a girl of sense and I am sorry for you I regard you in a different light to the rest of them And now please leave me Good bye But let me stay with you a little longer said Polina No replied the other you need not Do not bother me for you and all of them have tired me out Yet when Polina tried to kiss the Grandmother s hand the old lady withdrew it and herself kissed the girl on the cheek As she passed me Polina gave me a momentary glance and then as swiftly averted her eyes And good bye to you also Alexis Ivanovitch The train starts in an hour s time and I think that you must be weary of me Take these five hundred gulden for yourself I thank you humbly Madame but I am ashamed to Come come cried the Grandmother so energetically and with such an air of menace that I did not dare refuse the money further If when in Moscow you have no place where you can lay your head she added come and see me and I will give you a recommendation Now Potapitch get things ready I ascended to my room and lay down upon the bed A whole hour I must have lain thus with my head resting upon my hand So the crisis had come I needed time for its consideration To morrow I would have a talk with Polina Ah The Frenchman So it was true But how could it be so Polina and De Griers What a combination No it was too improbable Suddenly I leapt up with the idea of seeking Astley and forcing him to speak There could be no doubt that he knew more than I did Astley Well he was another problem for me to solve Suddenly there came a knock at the door and I opened it to find Potapitch awaiting me Sir he said my mistress is asking for you Indeed But she is just departing is she not The train leaves in ten minutes time She is uneasy sir she cannot rest Come quickly sir do not delay I ran downstairs at once The Grandmother was just being carried out of her rooms into the corridor In her hands she held a roll of bank notes Alexis Ivanovitch she cried walk on ahead and we will set out again But whither Madame I cannot rest until I have retrieved my losses March on ahead and ask me no questions Play continues until midnight does it not For a moment I stood stupefied stood deep in thought but it was not long before I had made up my mind With your leave Madame I said I will not go with you And why not What do you mean Is every one here a stupid good for nothing Pardon me but I have nothing to reproach myself with I merely will not go I merely intend neither to witness nor to join in your play I also beg to return you your five hundred gulden Farewell Laying the money upon a little table which the Grandmother s chair happened to be passing I bowed and withdrew What folly the Grandmother shouted after me Very well then Do not come and I will find my way alone Potapitch you must come with me Lift up the chair and carry me along I failed to find mister Astley and returned home It was now growing late it was past midnight but I subsequently learnt from Potapitch how the Grandmother s day had ended She had lost all the money which earlier in the day I had got for her paper securities a sum amounting to about ten thousand roubles This she did under the direction of the Pole whom that afternoon she had dowered with two ten gulden pieces But before his arrival on the scene she had commanded Potapitch to stake for her until at length she had told him also to go about his business Upon that the Pole had leapt into the breach Not only did it happen that he knew the Russian language but also he could speak a mixture of three different dialects so that the pair were able to understand one another Yet the old lady never ceased to abuse him despite his deferential manner and to compare him unfavourably with myself so at all events Potapitch declared You the old chamberlain said to me treated her as a gentleman should but he he robbed her right and left as I could see with my own eyes Twice she caught him at it and rated him soundly On one occasion she even pulled his hair so that the bystanders burst out laughing Yet she lost everything sir that is to say she lost all that you had changed for her Then we brought her home and after asking for some water and saying her prayers she went to bed So worn out was she that she fell asleep at once May God send her dreams of angels And this is all that foreign travel has done for us Oh my own Moscow For what have we not at home there in Moscow Such a garden and flowers as you could never see here and fresh air and apple trees coming into blossom and a beautiful view to look upon Ah but what must she do but go travelling abroad Alack alack XIII Almost a month has passed since I last touched these notes notes which I began under the influence of impressions at once poignant and disordered The crisis which I then felt to be approaching has now arrived but in a form a hundred times more extensive and unexpected than I had looked for To me it all seems strange uncouth and tragic Certain occurrences have befallen me which border upon the marvellous At all events that is how I view them I view them so in one regard at least I refer to the whirlpool of events in which at the time I was revolving But the most curious feature of all is my relation to those events for hitherto I had never clearly understood myself Yet now the actual crisis has passed away like a dream Even my passion for Polina is dead Was it ever so strong and genuine as I thought If so what has become of it now At times I fancy that I must be mad that somewhere I am sitting in a madhouse that these events have merely SEEMED to happen that still they merely SEEM to be happening I have been arranging and re perusing my notes perhaps for the purpose of convincing myself that I am not in a madhouse At present I am lonely and alone Autumn is coming already it is mellowing the leaves and as I sit brooding in this melancholy little town and how melancholy the little towns of Germany can be I find myself taking no thought for the future but living under the influence of passing moods and of my recollections of the tempest which recently drew me into its vortex and then cast me out again At times I seem still to be caught within that vortex At times the tempest seems once more to be gathering and as it passes overhead to be wrapping me in its folds until I have lost my sense of order and reality and continue whirling and whirling and whirling around Yet it may be that I shall be able to stop myself from revolving if once I can succeed in rendering myself an exact account of what has happened within the month just past Somehow I feel drawn towards the pen on many and many an evening I have had nothing else in the world to do But curiously enough of late I have taken to amusing myself with the works of M Paul de Kock which I read in German translations obtained from a wretched local library These works I cannot abide yet I read them and find myself marvelling that I should be doing so Somehow I seem to be afraid of any SERIOUS book afraid of permitting any SERIOUS preoccupation to break the spell of the passing moment So dear to me is the formless dream of which I have spoken so dear to me are the impressions which it has left behind it that I fear to touch the vision with anything new lest it should dissolve in smoke But is it so dear to me Yes it IS dear to me and will ever be fresh in my recollections even forty years hence So let me write of it but only partially and in a more abridged form than my full impressions might warrant First of all let me conclude the history of the Grandmother Next day she lost every gulden that she possessed Things were bound to happen so for persons of her type who have once entered upon that road descend it with ever increasing rapidity even as a sledge descends a toboggan slide All day until eight o clock that evening did she play and though I personally did not witness her exploits I learnt of them later through report All that day Potapitch remained in attendance upon her but the Poles who directed her play she changed more than once As a beginning she dismissed her Pole of the previous day the Pole whose hair she had pulled and took to herself another one but the latter proved worse even than the former and incurred dismissal in favour of the first Pole who during the time of his unemployment had nevertheless hovered around the Grandmother s chair and from time to time obtruded his head over her shoulder At length the old lady became desperate for the second Pole when dismissed imitated his predecessor by declining to go away with the result that one Pole remained standing on the right of the victim and the other on her left from which vantage points the pair quarrelled abused each other concerning the stakes and rounds and exchanged the epithet laidak Rascal and other Polish terms of endearment Finally they effected a mutual reconciliation and tossing the money about anyhow played simply at random Once more quarrelling each of them staked money on his own side of the Grandmother s chair for instance the one Pole staked upon the red and the other one upon the black until they had so confused and browbeaten the old lady that nearly weeping she was forced to appeal to the head croupier for protection and to have the two Poles expelled No time was lost in this being done despite the rascals cries and protestations that the old lady was in their debt that she had cheated them and that her general behaviour had been mean and dishonourable The same evening the unfortunate Potapitch related the story to me with tears complaining that the two men had filled their pockets with money he himself had seen them do it which had been shamelessly pilfered from his mistress For instance one Pole demanded of the Grandmother fifty gulden for his trouble and then staked the money by the side of her stake She happened to win whereupon he cried out that the winning stake was his and hers the loser As soon as the two Poles had been expelled Potapitch left the room and reported to the authorities that the men s pockets were full of gold and on the Grandmother also requesting the head croupier to look into the affair the police made their appearance and despite the protests of the Poles who indeed had been caught redhanded their pockets were turned inside out and the contents handed over to the Grandmother In fact in view of the circumstance that she lost all day the croupiers and other authorities of the Casino showed her every attention and on her fame spreading through the town visitors of every nationality even the most knowing of them the most distinguished crowded to get a glimpse of la vieille comtesse russe tombee en enfance who had lost so many millions Yet with the money which the authorities restored to her from the pockets of the Poles the Grandmother effected very very little for there soon arrived to take his countrymen s place a third Pole a man who could speak Russian fluently was dressed like a gentleman albeit in lacqueyish fashion and sported a huge moustache Though polite enough to the old lady he took a high hand with the bystanders In short he offered himself less as a servant than as an ENTERTAINER After each round he would turn to the old lady and swear terrible oaths to the effect that he was a Polish gentleman of honour who would scorn to take a kopeck of her money and though he repeated these oaths so often that at length she grew alarmed he had her play in hand and began to win on her behalf wherefore she felt that she could not well get rid of him An hour later the two Poles who earlier in the day had been expelled from the Casino made a reappearance behind the old lady s chair and renewed their offers of service even if it were only to be sent on messages but from Potapitch I subsequently had it that between these rascals and the said gentleman of honour there passed a wink as well as that the latter put something into their hands Next since the Grandmother had not yet lunched she had scarcely for a moment left her chair one of the two Poles ran to the restaurant of the Casino and brought her thence a cup of soup and afterwards some tea In fact BOTH the Poles hastened to perform this office Finally towards the close of the day when it was clear that the Grandmother was about to play her last bank note there could be seen standing behind her chair no fewer than six natives of Poland persons who as yet had been neither audible nor visible and as soon as ever the old lady played the note in question they took no further notice of her but pushed their way past her chair to the table seized the money and staked it shouting and disputing the while and arguing with the gentleman of honour who also had forgotten the Grandmother s existence as though he were their equal Even when the Grandmother had lost her all and was returning about eight o clock to the hotel some three or four Poles could not bring themselves to leave her but went on running beside her chair and volubly protesting that the Grandmother had cheated them and that she ought to be made to surrender what was not her own Thus the party arrived at the hotel whence presently the gang of rascals was ejected neck and crop According to Potapitch s calculations the Grandmother lost that day a total of ninety thousand roubles in addition to the money which she had lost the day before Every paper security which she had brought with her five percent bonds internal loan scrip and what not she had changed into cash Also I could not but marvel at the way in which for seven or eight hours at a stretch she sat in that chair of hers almost never leaving the table Again Potapitch told me that there were three occasions on which she really began to win but that led on by false hopes she was unable to tear herself away at the right moment Every gambler knows how a person may sit a day and a night at cards without ever casting a glance to right or to left Meanwhile that day some other very important events were passing in our hotel As early as eleven o clock that is to say before the Grandmother had quitted her rooms the General and De Griers decided upon their last stroke In other words on learning that the old lady had changed her mind about departing and was bent on setting out for the Casino again the whole of our gang Polina only excepted proceeded en masse to her rooms for the purpose of finally and frankly treating with her But the General quaking and greatly apprehensive as to his possible future overdid things After half an hour s prayers and entreaties coupled with a full confession of his debts and even of his passion for Mlle Blanche yes he had quite lost his head he suddenly adopted a tone of menace and started to rage at the old lady exclaiming that she was sullying the family honour that she was making a public scandal of herself and that she was smirching the fair name of Russia The upshot was that the Grandmother turned him out of the room with her stick it was a real stick too Later in the morning he held several consultations with De Griers the question which occupied him being Is it in any way possible to make use of the police to tell them that this respected but unfortunate old lady has gone out of her mind and is squandering her last kopeck or something of the kind In short is it in any way possible to engineer a species of supervision over or of restraint upon the old lady De Griers however shrugged his shoulders at this and laughed in the General s face while the old warrior went on chattering volubly and running up and down his study Finally De Griers waved his hand and disappeared from view and by evening it became known that he had left the hotel after holding a very secret and important conference with Mlle Blanche As for the latter from early morning she had taken decisive measures by completely excluding the General from her presence and bestowing upon him not a glance Indeed even when the General pursued her to the Casino and met her walking arm in arm with the Prince he the General received from her and her mother not the slightest recognition Nor did the Prince himself bow The rest of the day Mlle spent in probing the Prince and trying to make him declare himself but in this she made a woeful mistake The little incident occurred in the evening Suddenly Mlle Blanche realised that the Prince had not even a copper to his name but on the contrary was minded to borrow of her money wherewith to play at roulette In high displeasure she drove him from her presence and shut herself up in her room The same morning I went to see or rather to look for mister Astley but was unsuccessful in my quest Neither in his rooms nor in the Casino nor in the Park was he to be found nor did he that day lunch at his hotel as usual However at about five o clock I caught sight of him walking from the railway station to the Hotel d Angleterre He seemed to be in a great hurry and much preoccupied though in his face I could discern no actual traces of worry or perturbation He held out to me a friendly hand with his usual ejaculation of Ah but did not check his stride I turned and walked beside him but found somehow that his answers forbade any putting of definite questions Moreover I felt reluctant to speak to him of Polina nor for his part did he ask me any questions concerning her although on my telling him of the Grandmother s exploits he listened attentively and gravely and then shrugged his shoulders She is gambling away everything that she has I remarked Indeed She arrived at the Casino even before I had taken my departure by train so I knew she had been playing If I should have time I will go to the Casino to night and take a look at her The thing interests me Where have you been today I asked surprised at myself for having as yet omitted to put to him that question To Frankfort On business On business What more was there to be asked after that I accompanied him until as we drew level with the Hotel des Quatre Saisons he suddenly nodded to me and disappeared For myself I returned home and came to the conclusion that even had I met him at two o clock in the afternoon I should have learnt no more from him than I had done at five o clock for the reason that I had no definite question to ask It was bound to have been so For me to formulate the query which I really wished to put was a simple impossibility Polina spent the whole of that day either in walking about the park with the nurse and children or in sitting in her own room For a long while past she had avoided the General and had scarcely had a word to say to him scarcely a word I mean on any SERIOUS topic Yes that I had noticed Still even though I was aware of the position in which the General was placed it had never occurred to me that he would have any reason to avoid HER or to trouble her with family explanations Indeed when I was returning to the hotel after my conversation with Astley and chanced to meet Polina and the children I could see that her face was as calm as though the family disturbances had never touched her To my salute she responded with a slight bow and I retired to my room in a very bad humour Of course since the affair with the Burmergelms I had exchanged not a word with Polina nor had with her any kind of intercourse Yet I had been at my wits end for as time went on there was arising in me an ever seething dissatisfaction Even if she did not love me she ought not to have trampled upon my feelings nor to have accepted my confessions with such contempt seeing that she must have been aware that I loved her of her own accord she had allowed me to tell her as much Of course the situation between us had arisen in a curious manner About two months ago I had noticed that she had a desire to make me her friend her confidant that she was making trial of me for the purpose but for some reason or another the desired result had never come about and we had fallen into the present strange relations which had led me to address her as I had done At the same time if my love was distasteful to her why had she not FORBIDDEN me to speak of it to her But she had not so forbidden me On the contrary there had been occasions when she had even INVITED me to speak Of course this might have been done out of sheer wantonness for I well knew I had remarked it only too often that after listening to what I had to say and angering me almost beyond endurance she loved suddenly to torture me with some fresh outburst of contempt and aloofness Yet she must have known that I could not live without her Three days had elapsed since the affair with the Baron and I could bear the severance no longer When that afternoon I met her near the Casino my heart almost made me faint it beat so violently She too could not live without me for had she not said that she had NEED of me Or had that too been spoken in jest That she had a secret of some kind there could be no doubt What she had said to the Grandmother had stabbed me to the heart On a thousand occasions I had challenged her to be open with me nor could she have been ignorant that I was ready to give my very life for her Yet always she had kept me at a distance with that contemptuous air of hers or else she had demanded of me in lieu of the life which I offered to lay at her feet such escapades as I had perpetrated with the Baron Ah was it not torture to me all this For could it be that her whole world was bound up with the Frenchman What too about mister Astley The affair was inexplicable throughout My God what distress it caused me Arrived home I in a fit of frenzy indited the following Polina Alexandrovna I can see that there is approaching us an exposure which will involve you too For the last time I ask of you have you or have you not any need of my life If you have then make such dispositions as you wish and I shall always be discoverable in my room if required If you have need of my life write or send for me I sealed the letter and dispatched it by the hand of a corridor lacquey with orders to hand it to the addressee in person Though I expected no answer scarcely three minutes had elapsed before the lacquey returned with the compliments of a certain person Next about seven o clock I was sent for by the General I found him in his study apparently preparing to go out again for his hat and stick were lying on the sofa When I entered he was standing in the middle of the room his feet wide apart and his head bent down Also he appeared to be talking to himself But as soon as ever he saw me at the door he came towards me in such a curious manner that involuntarily I retreated a step and was for leaving the room whereupon he seized me by both hands and drawing me towards the sofa and seating himself thereon he forced me to sit down on a chair opposite him Then without letting go of my hands he exclaimed with quivering lips and a sparkle of tears on his eyelashes Oh Alexis Ivanovitch Save me save me Have some mercy upon me For a long time I could not make out what he meant although he kept talking and talking and constantly repeating to himself Have mercy mercy At length however I divined that he was expecting me to give him something in the nature of advice or rather that deserted by every one and overwhelmed with grief and apprehension he had bethought himself of my existence and sent for me to relieve his feelings by talking and talking and talking In fact he was in such a confused and despondent state of mind that clasping his hands together he actually went down upon his knees and begged me to go to Mlle Blanche and beseech and advise her to return to him and to accept him in marriage But General I exclaimed possibly Mlle Blanche has scarcely even remarked my existence What could I do with her It was in vain that I protested for he could understand nothing that was said to him Next he started talking about the Grandmother but always in a disconnected sort of fashion his one thought being to send for the police In Russia said he suddenly boiling over with indignation or in any well ordered State where there exists a government old women like my mother are placed under proper guardianship Yes my good sir he went on relapsing into a scolding tone as he leapt to his feet and started to pace the room do you not know this he seemed to be addressing some imaginary auditor in the corner do you not know this that in Russia old women like her are subjected to restraint the devil take them Again he threw himself down upon the sofa A minute later though sobbing and almost breathless he managed to gasp out that Mlle Blanche had refused to marry him for the reason that the Grandmother had turned up in place of a telegram and it was therefore clear that he had no inheritance to look for Evidently he supposed that I had hitherto been in entire ignorance of all this Again when I referred to De Griers the General made a gesture of despair He has gone away he said and everything which I possess is mortgaged to him I stand stripped to my skin Even of the money which you brought me from Paris I know not if seven hundred francs be left Of course that sum will do to go on with but as regards the future I know nothing I know nothing Then how will you pay your hotel bill I cried in consternation And what shall you do afterwards He looked at me vaguely but it was clear that he had not understood perhaps had not even heard my questions Then I tried to get him to speak of Polina and the children but he only returned brief answers of Yes yes and again started to maunder about the Prince and the likelihood of the latter marrying Mlle Blanche What on earth am I to do he concluded What on earth am I to do Is this not ingratitude Is it not sheer ingratitude And he burst into tears Nothing could be done with such a man Yet to leave him alone was dangerous for something might happen to him I withdrew from his rooms for a little while but warned the nursemaid to keep an eye upon him as well as exchanged a word with the corridor lacquey a very talkative fellow who likewise promised to remain on the look out Hardly had I left the General when Potapitch approached me with a summons from the Grandmother It was now eight o clock and she had returned from the Casino after finally losing all that she possessed I found her sitting in her chair much distressed and evidently fatigued Presently Martha brought her up a cup of tea and forced her to drink it yet even then I could detect in the old lady s tone and manner a great change Good evening Alexis Ivanovitch she said slowly with her head drooping Pardon me for disturbing you again Yes you must pardon an old old woman like myself for I have left behind me all that I possess nearly a hundred thousand roubles You did quite right in declining to come with me this evening Now I am without money without a single groat But I must not delay a moment I must leave by the nine thirty train I have sent for that English friend of yours and am going to beg of him three thousand francs for a week Please try and persuade him to think nothing of it nor yet to refuse me for I am still a rich woman who possesses three villages and a couple of mansions Yes the money shall be found for I have not yet squandered EVERYTHING I tell you this in order that he may have no doubts about Ah but here he is Clearly he is a good fellow True enough Astley had come hot foot on receiving the Grandmother s appeal Scarcely stopping even to reflect and with scarcely a word he counted out the three thousand francs under a note of hand which she duly signed Then his business done he bowed and lost no time in taking his departure You too leave me Alexis Ivanovitch said the Grandmother All my bones are aching and I still have an hour in which to rest Do not be hard upon me old fool that I am Never again shall I blame young people for being frivolous I should think it wrong even to blame that unhappy General of yours Nevertheless I do not mean to let him have any of my money which is all that he desires for the reason that I look upon him as a perfect blockhead and consider myself simpleton though I be at least wiser than HE is How surely does God visit old age and punish it for its presumption Well good bye Martha come and lift me up However I had a mind to see the old lady off and moreover I was in an expectant frame of mind somehow I kept thinking that SOMETHING was going to happen wherefore I could not rest quietly in my room but stepped out into the corridor and then into the Chestnut Avenue for a few minutes stroll My letter to Polina had been clear and firm and in the present crisis I felt sure would prove final I had heard of De Griers departure and however much Polina might reject me as a FRIEND she might not reject me altogether as a SERVANT She would need me to fetch and carry for her and I was ready to do so How could it have been otherwise Towards the hour of the train s departure I hastened to the station and put the Grandmother into her compartment she and her party occupying a reserved family saloon Thanks for your disinterested assistance she said at parting Oh and please remind Prascovia of what I said to her last night I expect soon to see her Then I returned home As I was passing the door of the General s suite I met the nursemaid and inquired after her master There is nothing new to report sir she replied quietly Nevertheless I decided to enter and was just doing so when I halted thunderstruck on the threshold For before me I beheld the General and Mlle Blanche laughing gaily at one another while beside them on the sofa there was seated her mother Clearly the General was almost out of his mind with joy for he was talking all sorts of nonsense and bubbling over with a long drawn nervous laugh a laugh which twisted his face into innumerable wrinkles and caused his eyes almost to disappear Afterwards I learnt from Mlle Blanche herself that after dismissing the Prince and hearing of the General s tears she bethought her of going to comfort the old man and had just arrived for the purpose when I entered Fortunately the poor General did not know that his fate had been decided that Mlle had long ago packed her trunks in readiness for the first morning train to Paris Hesitating a moment on the threshold I changed my mind as to entering and departed unnoticed Ascending to my own room and opening the door I perceived in the semi darkness a figure seated on a chair in the corner by the window The figure did not rise when I entered so I approached it swiftly peered at it closely and felt my heart almost stop beating The figure was Polina XIV The shock made me utter an exclamation What is the matter What is the matter she asked in a strange voice She was looking pale and her eyes were dim What is the matter I re echoed Why the fact that you are HERE If I am here I have come with all that I have to bring she said Such has always been my way as you shall presently see Please light a candle I did so whereupon she rose approached the table and laid upon it an open letter Read it she added It is De Griers handwriting I cried as I seized the document My hands were so tremulous that the lines on the pages danced before my eyes Although at this distance of time I have forgotten the exact phraseology of the missive I append if not the precise words at all events the general sense Mademoiselle the document ran certain untoward circumstances compel me to depart in haste Of course you have of yourself remarked that hitherto I have always refrained from having any final explanation with you for the reason that I could not well state the whole circumstances and now to my difficulties the advent of the aged Grandmother coupled with her subsequent proceedings has put the final touch Also the involved state of my affairs forbids me to write with any finality concerning those hopes of ultimate bliss upon which for a long while past I have permitted myself to feed I regret the past but at the same time hope that in my conduct you have never been able to detect anything that was unworthy of a gentleman and a man of honour Having lost however almost the whole of my money in debts incurred by your stepfather I find myself driven to the necessity of saving the remainder wherefore I have instructed certain friends of mine in saint Petersburg to arrange for the sale of all the property which has been mortgaged to myself At the same time knowing that in addition your frivolous stepfather has squandered money which is exclusively yours I have decided to absolve him from a certain moiety of the mortgages on his property in order that you may be in a position to recover of him what you have lost by suing him in legal fashion I trust therefore that as matters now stand this action of mine may bring you some advantage I trust also that this same action leaves me in the position of having fulfilled every obligation which is incumbent upon a man of honour and refinement Rest assured that your memory will for ever remain graven in my heart All this is clear enough I commented Surely you did not expect aught else from him Somehow I was feeling annoyed I expected nothing at all from him she replied quietly enough to all outward seeming yet with a note of irritation in her tone Long ago I made up my mind on the subject for I could read his thoughts and knew what he was thinking He thought that possibly I should sue him that one day I might become a nuisance Here Polina halted for a moment and stood biting her lips So of set purpose I redoubled my contemptuous treatment of him and waited to see what he would do If a telegram to say that we had become legatees had arrived from saint Petersburg I should have flung at him a quittance for my foolish stepfather s debts and then dismissed him For a long time I have hated him Even in earlier days he was not a man and now Oh how gladly I could throw those fifty thousand roubles in his face and spit in it and then rub the spittle in But the document returning the fifty thousand rouble mortgage has the General got it If so possess yourself of it and send it to De Griers No no the General has not got it Just as I expected Well what is the General going to do Then an idea suddenly occurred to me What about the Grandmother I asked Polina looked at me with impatience and bewilderment What makes you speak of HER was her irritable inquiry I cannot go and live with her Nor she added hotly will I go down upon my knees to ANY ONE Why should you I cried Yet to think that you should have loved De Griers The villain the villain But I will kill him in a duel Where is he now In Frankfort where he will be staying for the next three days Well bid me do so and I will go to him by the first train tomorrow I exclaimed with enthusiasm She smiled If you were to do that she said he would merely tell you to be so good as first to return him the fifty thousand francs What then would be the use of having a quarrel with him You talk sheer nonsense I ground my teeth The question I went on is how to raise the fifty thousand francs We cannot expect to find them lying about on the floor Listen What of mister Astley Even as I spoke a new and strange idea formed itself in my brain Her eyes flashed fire What YOU YOURSELF wish me to leave you for him she cried with a scornful look and a proud smile Never before had she addressed me thus Then her head must have turned dizzy with emotion for suddenly she seated herself upon the sofa as though she were powerless any longer to stand A flash of lightning seemed to strike me as I stood there I could scarcely believe my eyes or my ears She DID love me then It WAS to me and not to mister Astley that she had turned Although she an unprotected girl had come to me in my room in an hotel room and had probably compromised herself thereby I had not understood Then a second mad idea flashed into my brain Polina I said give me but an hour Wait here just one hour until I return Yes you MUST do so Do you not see what I mean Just stay here for that time And I rushed from the room without so much as answering her look of inquiry She called something after me but I did not return Sometimes it happens that the most insane thought the most impossible conception will become so fixed in one s head that at length one believes the thought or the conception to be reality Moreover if with the thought or the conception there is combined a strong a passionate desire one will come to look upon the said thought or conception as something fated inevitable and foreordained something bound to happen Whether by this there is connoted something in the nature of a combination of presentiments or a great effort of will or a self annulment of one s true expectations and so on I do not know but at all events that night saw happen to me a night which I shall never forget something in the nature of the miraculous Although the occurrence can easily be explained by arithmetic I still believe it to have been a miracle Yet why did this conviction take such a hold upon me at the time and remain with me ever since Previously I had thought of the idea not as an occurrence which was ever likely to come about but as something which NEVER could come about The time was a quarter past eleven o clock when I entered the Casino in such a state of hope though at the same time of agitation as I had never before experienced In the gaming rooms there were still a large number of people but not half as many as had been present in the morning At eleven o clock there usually remained behind only the real the desperate gamblers persons for whom at spas there existed nothing beyond roulette and who went thither for that alone These gamesters took little note of what was going on around them and were interested in none of the appurtenances of the season but played from morning till night and would have been ready to play through the night until dawn had that been possible As it was they used to disperse unwillingly when at midnight roulette came to an end Likewise as soon as ever roulette was drawing to a close and the head croupier had called Les trois derniers coups most of them were ready to stake on the last three rounds all that they had in their pockets and for the most part lost it For my own part I proceeded towards the table at which the Grandmother had lately sat and since the crowd around it was not very large I soon obtained standing room among the ring of gamblers while directly in front of me on the green cloth I saw marked the word Passe Passe was a row of numbers from nineteen to thirty six inclusive while a row of numbers from one to eighteen inclusive was known as Manque But what had that to do with me I had not noticed I had not so much as heard the numbers upon which the previous coup had fallen and so took no bearings when I began to play as in my place any SYSTEMATIC gambler would have done No I merely extended my stock of twenty ten gulden pieces and threw them down upon the space Passe which happened to be confronting me Vingt deux called the croupier I had won I staked upon the same again both my original stake and my winnings Trente et un called the croupier Again I had won and was now in possession of eighty ten gulden pieces Next I moved the whole eighty on to twelve middle numbers a stake which if successful would bring me in a triple profit but also involved a risk of two chances to one The wheel revolved and stopped at twenty four Upon this I was paid out notes and gold until I had by my side a total sum of two thousand gulden It was as in a fever that I moved the pile en bloc on to the red Then suddenly I came to myself though that was the only time during the evening s play when fear cast its cold spell over me and showed itself in a trembling of the hands and knees For with horror I had realised that I MUST win and that upon that stake there depended all my life Rouge called the croupier I drew a long breath and hot shivers went coursing over my body I was paid out my winnings in bank notes amounting of course to a total of four thousand florins eight hundred gulden I could still calculate the amounts After that I remember I again staked two thousand florins upon twelve middle numbers and lost Again I staked the whole of my gold with eight hundred gulden in notes and lost Then madness seemed to come upon me and seizing my last two thousand florins I staked them upon twelve of the first numbers wholly by chance and at random and without any sort of reckoning Upon my doing so there followed a moment of suspense only comparable to that which Madame Blanchard must have experienced when in Paris she was descending earthwards from a balloon Quatre called the croupier Once more with the addition of my original stake I was in possession of six thousand florins Once more I looked around me like a conqueror once more I feared nothing as I threw down four thousand of these florins upon the black The croupiers glanced around them and exchanged a few words the bystanders murmured expectantly The black turned up After that I do not exactly remember either my calculations or the order of my stakings I only remember that as in a dream I won in one round sixteen thousand florins that in the three following rounds I lost twelve thousand that I moved the remainder four thousand on to Passe though quite unconscious of what I was doing I was merely waiting as it were mechanically and without reflection for something and won and that finally four times in succession I lost Yes I can remember raking in money by thousands but most frequently on the twelve middle numbers to which I constantly adhered and which kept appearing in a sort of regular order first three or four times running and then after an interval of a couple of rounds in another break of three or four appearances Sometimes this astonishing regularity manifested itself in patches a thing to upset all the calculations of note taking gamblers who play with a pencil and a memorandum book in their hands Fortune perpetrates some terrible jests at roulette Since my entry not more than half an hour could have elapsed Suddenly a croupier informed me that I had won thirty thousand florins as well as that since the latter was the limit for which at any one time the bank could make itself responsible roulette at that table must close for the night Accordingly I caught up my pile of gold stuffed it into my pocket and grasping my sheaf of bank notes moved to the table in an adjoining salon where a second game of roulette was in progress The crowd followed me in a body and cleared a place for me at the table after which I proceeded to stake as before that is to say at random and without calculating What saved me from ruin I do not know Of course there were times when fragmentary reckonings DID come flashing into my brain For instance there were times when I attached myself for a while to certain figures and coups though always leaving them again before long without knowing what I was doing In fact I cannot have been in possession of all my faculties for I can remember the croupiers correcting my play more than once owing to my having made mistakes of the gravest order My brows were damp with sweat and my hands were shaking Also Poles came around me to proffer their services but I heeded none of them Nor did my luck fail me now Suddenly there arose around me a loud din of talking and laughter Bravo bravo was the general shout and some people even clapped their hands I had raked in thirty thousand florins and again the bank had had to close for the night Go away now go away now a voice whispered to me on my right The person who had spoken to me was a certain Jew of Frankfurt a man who had been standing beside me the whole while and occasionally helping me in my play Yes for God s sake go whispered a second voice in my left ear Glancing around I perceived that the second voice had come from a modestly plainly dressed lady of rather less than thirty a woman whose face though pale and sickly looking bore also very evident traces of former beauty At the moment I was stuffing the crumpled bank notes into my pockets and collecting all the gold that was left on the table Seizing up my last note for five hundred gulden I contrived to insinuate it unperceived into the hand of the pale lady An overpowering impulse had made me do so and I remember how her thin little fingers pressed mine in token of her lively gratitude The whole affair was the work of a moment Then collecting my belongings I crossed to where trente et quarante was being played a game which could boast of a more aristocratic public and was played with cards instead of with a wheel At this diversion the bank made itself responsible for a hundred thousand thalers as the limit but the highest stake allowable was as in roulette four thousand florins Although I knew nothing of the game and I scarcely knew the stakes except those on black and red I joined the ring of players while the rest of the crowd massed itself around me At this distance of time I cannot remember whether I ever gave a thought to Polina I seemed only to be conscious of a vague pleasure in seizing and raking in the bank notes which kept massing themselves in a pile before me But as ever fortune seemed to be at my back As though of set purpose there came to my aid a circumstance which not infrequently repeats itself in gaming The circumstance is that not infrequently luck attaches itself to say the red and does not leave it for a space of say ten or even fifteen rounds in succession Three days ago I had heard that during the previous week there had been a run of twenty two coups on the red an occurrence never before known at roulette so that men spoke of it with astonishment Naturally enough many deserted the red after a dozen rounds and practically no one could now be found to stake upon it Yet upon the black also the antithesis of the red no experienced gambler would stake anything for the reason that every practised player knows the meaning of capricious fortune That is to say after the sixteenth or so success of the red one would think that the seventeenth coup would inevitably fall upon the black wherefore novices would be apt to back the latter in the seventeenth round and even to double or treble their stakes upon it only in the end to lose Yet some whim or other led me on remarking that the red had come up consecutively for seven times to attach myself to that colour Probably this was mostly due to self conceit for I wanted to astonish the bystanders with the riskiness of my play Also I remember that oh strange sensation I suddenly and without any challenge from my own presumption became obsessed with a DESIRE to take risks If the spirit has passed through a great many sensations possibly it can no longer be sated with them but grows more excited and demands more sensations and stronger and stronger ones until at length it falls exhausted Certainly if the rules of the game had permitted even of my staking fifty thousand florins at a time I should have staked them All of a sudden I heard exclamations arising that the whole thing was a marvel since the red was turning up for the fourteenth time Monsieur a gagne cent mille florins a voice exclaimed beside me I awoke to my senses What I had won a hundred thousand florins If so what more did I need to win I grasped the banknotes stuffed them into my pockets raked in the gold without counting it and started to leave the Casino As I passed through the salons people smiled to see my bulging pockets and unsteady gait for the weight which I was carrying must have amounted to half a pood Several hands I saw stretched out in my direction and as I passed I filled them with all the money that I could grasp in my own At length two Jews stopped me near the exit You are a bold young fellow one said but mind you depart early tomorrow as early as you can for if you do not you will lose everything that you have won But I did not heed them The Avenue was so dark that it was barely possible to distinguish one s hand before one s face while the distance to the hotel was half a verst or so but I feared neither pickpockets nor highwaymen Indeed never since my boyhood have I done that Also I cannot remember what I thought about on the way I only felt a sort of fearful pleasure the pleasure of success of conquest of power how can I best express it Likewise before me there flitted the image of Polina and I kept remembering and reminding myself that it was to HER I was going that it was in HER presence I should soon be standing that it was SHE to whom I should soon be able to relate and show everything Scarcely once did I recall what she had lately said to me or the reason why I had left her or all those varied sensations which I had been experiencing a bare hour and a half ago No those sensations seemed to be things of the past to be things which had righted themselves and grown old to be things concerning which we needed to trouble ourselves no longer since for us life was about to begin anew Yet I had just reached the end of the Avenue when there DID come upon me a fear of being robbed or murdered With each step the fear increased until in my terror I almost started to run Suddenly as I issued from the Avenue there burst upon me the lights of the hotel sparkling with a myriad lamps Yes thanks be to God I had reached home Running up to my room I flung open the door of it Polina was still on the sofa with a lighted candle in front of her and her hands clasped As I entered she stared at me in astonishment for at the moment I must have presented a strange spectacle All I did however was to halt before her and fling upon the table my burden of wealth XV I remember too how without moving from her place or changing her attitude she gazed into my face I have won two hundred thousand francs cried I as I pulled out my last sheaf of bank notes The pile of paper currency occupied the whole table I could not withdraw my eyes from it Consequently for a moment or two Polina escaped my mind Then I set myself to arrange the pile in order and to sort the notes and to mass the gold in a separate heap That done I left everything where it lay and proceeded to pace the room with rapid strides as I lost myself in thought Then I darted to the table once more and began to recount the money until all of a sudden as though I had remembered something I rushed to the door and closed and double locked it Finally I came to a meditative halt before my little trunk Shall I put the money there until tomorrow I asked turning sharply round to Polina as the recollection of her returned to me She was still in her old place still making not a sound Yet her eyes had followed every one of my movements Somehow in her face there was a strange expression an expression which I did not like I think that I shall not be wrong if I say that it indicated sheer hatred Impulsively I approached her Polina I said here are twenty five thousand florins fifty thousand francs or more Take them and tomorrow throw them in De Griers face She returned no answer Or if you should prefer I continued let me take them to him myself tomorrow yes early tomorrow morning Shall I Then all at once she burst out laughing and laughed for a long while With astonishment and a feeling of offence I gazed at her Her laughter was too like the derisive merriment which she had so often indulged in of late merriment which had broken forth always at the time of my most passionate explanations At length she ceased and frowned at me from under her eyebrows I am NOT going to take your money she said contemptuously Why not I cried Why not Polina Because I am not in the habit of receiving money for nothing But I am offering it to you as a FRIEND in the same way I would offer you my very life Upon this she threw me a long questioning glance as though she were seeking to probe me to the depths You are giving too much for me she remarked with a smile The beloved of De Griers is not worth fifty thousand francs Oh Polina how can you speak so I exclaimed reproachfully Am I De Griers You she cried with her eyes suddenly flashing Why I HATE you Yes yes I HATE you I love you no more than I do De Griers Then she buried her face in her hands and relapsed into hysterics I darted to her side Somehow I had an intuition of something having happened to her which had nothing to do with myself She was like a person temporarily insane Buy me would you would you Would you buy me for fifty thousand francs as De Griers did she gasped between her convulsive sobs I clasped her in my arms kissed her hands and feet and fell upon my knees before her Presently the hysterical fit passed away and laying her hands upon my shoulders she gazed for a while into my face as though trying to read it something I said to her but it was clear that she did not hear it Her face looked so dark and despondent that I began to fear for her reason At length she drew me towards herself a trustful smile playing over her features and then as suddenly she pushed me away again as she eyed me dimly Finally she threw herself upon me in an embrace You love me she said DO you you who were willing even to quarrel with the Baron at my bidding Then she laughed laughed as though something dear but laughable had recurred to her memory Yes she laughed and wept at the same time What was I to do I was like a man in a fever I remember that she began to say something to me though WHAT I do not know since she spoke with a feverish lisp as though she were trying to tell me something very quickly At intervals too she would break off into the smile which I was beginning to dread No no she kept repeating YOU are my dear one YOU are the man I trust Again she laid her hands upon my shoulders and again she gazed at me as she reiterated You love me you love me Will you ALWAYS love me I could not take my eyes off her Never before had I seen her in this mood of humility and affection True the mood was the outcome of hysteria but All of a sudden she noticed my ardent gaze and smiled slightly The next moment for no apparent reason she began to talk of Astley She continued talking and talking about him but I could not make out all she said more particularly when she was endeavouring to tell me of something or other which had happened recently On the whole she appeared to be laughing at Astley for she kept repeating that he was waiting for her and did I know whether even at that moment he was not standing beneath the window Yes yes he is there she said Open the window and see if he is not She pushed me in that direction yet no sooner did I make a movement to obey her behest than she burst into laughter and I remained beside her and she embraced me Shall we go away tomorrow presently she asked as though some disturbing thought had recurred to her recollection How would it be if we were to try and overtake Grandmamma I think we should do so at Berlin And what think you she would have to say to us when we caught her up and her eyes first lit upon us What too about mister Astley HE would not leap from the Shlangenberg for my sake No Of that I am very sure and she laughed Do you know where he is going next year He says he intends to go to the North Pole for scientific investigations and has invited me to go with him Ha ha ha He also says that we Russians know nothing can do nothing without European help But he is a good fellow all the same For instance he does not blame the General in the matter but declares that Mlle Blanche that love But no I do not know I do not know She stopped suddenly as though she had said her say and was feeling bewildered What poor creatures these people are How sorry I am for them and for Grandmamma But when are you going to kill De Griers Surely you do not intend actually to murder him You fool Do you suppose that I should ALLOW you to fight De Griers Nor shall you kill the Baron Here she burst out laughing How absurd you looked when you were talking to the Burmergelms I was watching you all the time watching you from where I was sitting And how unwilling you were to go when I sent you Oh how I laughed and laughed Then she kissed and embraced me again again she pressed her face to mine with tender passion Yet I neither saw nor heard her for my head was in a whirl It must have been about seven o clock in the morning when I awoke Daylight had come and Polina was sitting by my side a strange expression on her face as though she had seen a vision and was unable to collect her thoughts She too had just awoken and was now staring at the money on the table My head ached it felt heavy I attempted to take Polina s hand but she pushed me from her and leapt from the sofa The dawn was full of mist for rain had fallen yet she moved to the window opened it and leaning her elbows upon the window sill thrust out her head and shoulders to take the air In this position did she remain for several minutes without ever looking round at me or listening to what I was saying Into my head there came the uneasy thought What is to happen now How is it all to end Suddenly Polina rose from the window approached the table and looking at me with an expression of infinite aversion said with lips which quivered with anger Well Are you going to hand me over my fifty thousand francs Polina you say that AGAIN AGAIN I exclaimed You have changed your mind then Ha ha ha You are sorry you ever promised them On the table where the previous night I had counted the money there still was lying the packet of twenty five thousand florins I handed it to her The francs are mine then are they They are mine she inquired viciously as she balanced the money in her hands Yes they have ALWAYS been yours I said Then TAKE your fifty thousand francs and she hurled them full in my face The packet burst as she did so and the floor became strewed with bank notes The instant that the deed was done she rushed from the room At that moment she cannot have been in her right mind yet what was the cause of her temporary aberration I cannot say For a month past she had been unwell Yet what had brought about this PRESENT condition of mind above all things this outburst Had it come of wounded pride Had it come of despair over her decision to come to me Had it come of the fact that presuming too much on my good fortune I had seemed to be intending to desert her even as De Griers had done when once I had given her the fifty thousand francs But on my honour I had never cherished any such intention What was at fault I think was her own pride which kept urging her not to trust me but rather to insult me even though she had not realised the fact In her eyes I corresponded to De Griers and therefore had been condemned for a fault not wholly my own Her mood of late had been a sort of delirium a sort of light headedness that I knew full well yet never had I sufficiently taken it into consideration Perhaps she would not pardon me now Ah but this was THE PRESENT What about the future Her delirium and sickness were not likely to make her forget what she had done in bringing me De Griers letter No she must have known what she was doing when she brought it Somehow I contrived to stuff the pile of notes and gold under the bed to cover them over and then to leave the room some ten minutes after Polina I felt sure that she had returned to her own room wherefore I intended quietly to follow her and to ask the nursemaid aid who opened the door how her mistress was Judge therefore of my surprise when meeting the domestic on the stairs she informed me that Polina had not yet returned and that she the domestic was at that moment on her way to my room in quest of her Mlle left me but ten minutes ago I said What can have become of her The nursemaid looked at me reproachfully Already sundry rumours were flying about the hotel Both in the office of the commissionaire and in that of the landlord it was whispered that at seven o clock that morning the Fraulein had left the hotel and set off despite the rain in the direction of the Hotel d Angleterre From words and hints let fall I could see that the fact of Polina having spent the night in my room was now public property Also sundry rumours were circulating concerning the General s family affairs It was known that last night he had gone out of his mind and paraded the hotel in tears also that the old lady who had arrived was his mother and that she had come from Russia on purpose to forbid her son s marriage with Mlle de Cominges as well as to cut him out of her will if he should disobey her also that because he had disobeyed her she had squandered all her money at roulette in order to have nothing more to leave to him Oh these Russians exclaimed the landlord with an angry toss of the head while the bystanders laughed and the clerk betook himself to his accounts Also every one had learnt about my winnings Karl the corridor lacquey was the first to congratulate me But with these folk I had nothing to do My business was to set off at full speed to the Hotel d Angleterre As yet it was early for mister Astley to receive visitors but as soon as he learnt that it was I who had arrived he came out into the corridor to meet me and stood looking at me in silence with his steel grey eyes as he waited to hear what I had to say I inquired after Polina She is ill he replied still looking at me with his direct unwavering glance And she is in your rooms Yes she is in my rooms Then you are minded to keep her there Yes I am minded to keep her there But mister Astley that will raise a scandal It ought not to be allowed Besides she is very ill Perhaps you had not remarked that Yes I have It was I who told you about it Had she not been ill she would not have gone and spent the night with you Then you know all about it Yes for last night she was to have accompanied me to the house of a relative of mine Unfortunately being ill she made a mistake and went to your rooms instead Indeed Then I wish you joy mister Astley Apropos you have reminded me of something Were you beneath my window last night Every moment Mlle Polina kept telling me to open the window and see if you were there after which she always smiled Indeed No I was not there but I was waiting in the corridor and walking about the hotel She ought to see a doctor you know mister Astley Yes she ought I have sent for one and if she dies I shall hold you responsible This surprised me Pardon me I replied but what do you mean Never mind Tell me if it is true that last night you won two hundred thousand thalers No I won a hundred thousand florins Good heavens Then I suppose you will be off to Paris this morning Why Because all Russians who have grown rich go to Paris explained Astley as though he had read the fact in a book But what could I do in Paris in summer time I LOVE her mister Astley Surely you know that Indeed I am sure that you do NOT Moreover if you were to stay here you would lose everything that you possess and have nothing left with which to pay your expenses in Paris Well good bye now I feel sure that today will see you gone from here Good bye But I am NOT going to Paris Likewise pardon me what is to become of this family I mean that the affair of the General and Mlle Polina will soon be all over the town I daresay yet I hardly suppose that that will break the General s heart Moreover Mlle Polina has a perfect right to live where she chooses In short we may say that as a family this family has ceased to exist I departed and found myself smiling at the Englishman s strange assurance that I should soon be leaving for Paris I suppose he means to shoot me in a duel should Polina die Yes that is what he intends to do Now although I was honestly sorry for Polina it is a fact that from the moment when the previous night I had approached the gaming table and begun to rake in the packets of bank notes my love for her had entered upon a new plane Yes I can say that now although at the time I was barely conscious of it Was I then at heart a gambler Did I after all love Polina not so very much No no As God is my witness I loved her Even when I was returning home from mister Astley s my suffering was genuine and my self reproach sincere But presently I was to go through an exceedingly strange and ugly experience I was proceeding to the General s rooms when I heard a door near me open and a voice call me by name It was Mlle s mother the Widow de Cominges who was inviting me in her daughter s name to enter I did so whereupon I heard a laugh and a little cry proceed from the bedroom the pair occupied a suite of two apartments where Mlle Blanche was just arising Ah c est lui Viens donc bete Is it true that you have won a mountain of gold and silver J aimerais mieux l or Yes I replied with a smile How much A hundred thousand florins Bibi comme tu es bete Come in here for I can t hear you where you are now Nous ferons bombance n est ce pas Entering her room I found her lolling under a pink satin coverlet and revealing a pair of swarthy wonderfully healthy shoulders shoulders such as one sees in dreams shoulders covered over with a white cambric nightgown which trimmed with lace stood out in striking relief against the darkness of her skin Mon fils as tu du coeur she cried when she saw me and then giggled Her laugh had always been a very cheerful one and at times it even sounded sincere Tout autre I began paraphrasing Corneille See here she prattled on Please search for my stockings and help me to dress Aussi si tu n es pas trop bete je te prends a Paris I am just off let me tell you This moment In half an hour True enough everything stood ready packed trunks portmanteaux and all Coffee had long been served Eh bien tu verras Paris Dis donc qu est ce que c est qu un utchitel Tu etais bien bete quand tu etais utchitel Where are my stockings Please help me to dress And she lifted up a really ravishing foot small swarthy and not misshapen like the majority of feet which look dainty only in bottines I laughed and started to draw on to the foot a silk stocking while Mlle Blanche sat on the edge of the bed and chattered Eh bien que feras tu si je te prends avec moi First of all I must have fifty thousand francs and you shall give them to me at Frankfurt Then we will go on to Paris where we will live together et je te ferai voir des etoiles en plein jour Yes you shall see such women as your eyes have never lit upon Stop a moment If I were to give you those fifty thousand francs what should I have left for myself Another hundred thousand francs please to remember Besides I could live with you in your rooms for a month or even for two or even for longer But it would not take us more than two months to get through fifty thousand francs for look you je suis bonne enfante et tu verras des etoiles you may be sure What You mean to say that we should spend the whole in two months Certainly Does that surprise you very much Ah vil esclave Why one month of that life would be better than all your previous existence One month et apres le deluge Mais tu ne peux comprendre Va Away away You are not worth it Ah que fais tu For while drawing on the other stocking I had felt constrained to kiss her Immediately she shrunk back kicked me in the face with her toes and turned me neck and prop out of the room Eh bien mon utchitel she called after me je t attends si tu veux I start in a quarter of an hour s time I returned to my own room with my head in a whirl It was not my fault that Polina had thrown a packet in my face and preferred mister Astley to myself A few bank notes were still fluttering about the floor and I picked them up At that moment the door opened and the landlord appeared a person who until now had never bestowed upon me so much as a glance He had come to know if I would prefer to move to a lower floor to a suite which had just been tenanted by Count V For a moment I reflected No I shouted My account please for in ten minutes I shall be gone To Paris to Paris I added to myself Every man of birth must make her acquaintance Within a quarter of an hour all three of us were seated in a family compartment Mlle Blanche the Widow de Cominges and myself Mlle kept laughing hysterically as she looked at me and Madame re echoed her but I did not feel so cheerful My life had broken in two and yesterday had infected me with a habit of staking my all upon a card Although it might be that I had failed to win my stake that I had lost my senses that I desired nothing better I felt that the scene was to be changed only FOR A TIME Within a month from now I kept thinking to myself I shall be back again in Roulettenberg and THEN I mean to have it out with you mister Astley Yes as now I look back at things I remember that I felt greatly depressed despite the absurd gigglings of the egregious Blanche What is the matter with you How dull you are she cried at length as she interrupted her laughter to take me seriously to task Come come We are going to spend your two hundred thousand francs for you et tu seras heureux comme un petit roi I myself will tie your tie for you and introduce you to Hortense And when we have spent your money you shall return here and break the bank again What did those two Jews tell you that the thing most needed is daring and that you possess it Consequently this is not the first time that you will be hurrying to Paris with money in your pocket Quant moi je veux cinquante mille francs de rente et alors But what about the General I interrupted The General You know well enough that at about this hour every day he goes to buy me a bouquet On this occasion I took care to tell him that he must hunt for the choicest of flowers and when he returns home the poor fellow will find the bird flown Possibly he may take wing in pursuit ha ha ha And if so I shall not be sorry for he could be useful to me in Paris and mister Astley will pay his debts here In this manner did I depart for the Gay City XVI Of Paris what am I to say The whole proceeding was a delirium a madness I spent a little over three weeks there and during that time saw my hundred thousand francs come to an end I speak only of the ONE hundred thousand francs for the other hundred thousand I gave to Mlle Blanche in pure cash That is to say I handed her fifty thousand francs at Frankfurt and three days later in Paris advanced her another fifty thousand on note of hand Nevertheless a week had not elapsed ere she came to me for more money Et les cent mille francs qui nous restent she added tu les mangeras avec moi mon utchitel Yes she always called me her utchitel A person more economical grasping and mean than Mlle Blanche one could not imagine But this was only as regards HER OWN money MY hundred thousand francs as she explained to me later she needed to set up her establishment in Paris so that once and for all I may be on a decent footing and proof against any stones which may be thrown at me at all events for a long time to come Nevertheless I saw nothing of those hundred thousand francs for my own purse which she inspected daily never managed to amass in it more than a hundred francs at a time and generally the sum did not reach even that figure What do you want with money she would say to me with air of absolute simplicity and I never disputed the point Nevertheless though she fitted out her flat very badly with the money the fact did not prevent her from saying when later she was showing me over the rooms of her new abode See what care and taste can do with the most wretched of means However her wretchedness had cost fifty thousand francs while with the remaining fifty thousand she purchased a carriage and horses Also we gave a couple of balls evening parties attended by Hortense and Lisette and Cleopatre who were women remarkable both for the number of their liaisons and though only in some cases for their good looks At these reunions I had to play the part of host to meet and entertain fat mercantile parvenus who were impossible by reason of their rudeness and braggadocio colonels of various kinds hungry authors and journalistic hacks all of whom disported themselves in fashionable tailcoats and pale yellow gloves and displayed such an aggregate of conceit and gasconade as would be unthinkable even in saint Petersburg which is saying a great deal They used to try to make fun of me but I would console myself by drinking champagne and then lolling in a retiring room Nevertheless I found it deadly work C est un utchitel Blanche would say of me qui a gagne deux cent mille francs and but for me would have had not a notion how to spend them Presently he will have to return to his tutoring Does any one know of a vacant post You know one must do something for him I had the more frequent recourse to champagne in that I constantly felt depressed and bored owing to the fact that I was living in the most bourgeois commercial milieu imaginable a milieu wherein every sou was counted and grudged Indeed two weeks had not elapsed before I perceived that Blanche had no real affection for me even though she dressed me in elegant clothes and herself tied my tie each day In short she utterly despised me But that caused me no concern Blase and inert I spent my evenings generally at the Chateau des Fleurs where I would get fuddled and then dance the cancan which in that establishment was a very indecent performance with eclat At length the time came when Blanche had drained my purse dry She had conceived an idea that during the term of our residence together it would be well if I were always to walk behind her with a paper and pencil in order to jot down exactly what she spent what she had saved what she was paying out and what she was laying by Well of course I could not fail to be aware that this would entail a battle over every ten francs so although for every possible objection that I might make she had prepared a suitable answer she soon saw that I made no objections and therefore had to start disputes herself That is to say she would burst out into tirades which were met only with silence as I lolled on a sofa and stared fixedly at the ceiling This greatly surprised her At first she imagined that it was due merely to the fact that I was a fool un utchitel wherefore she would break off her harangue in the belief that being too stupid to understand I was a hopeless case Then she would leave the room but return ten minutes later to resume the contest This continued throughout her squandering of my money a squandering altogether out of proportion to our means An example is the way in which she changed her first pair of horses for a pair which cost sixteen thousand francs Bibi she said on the latter occasion as she approached me surely you are not angry No o o I am merely tired was my reply as I pushed her from me This seemed to her so curious that straightway she seated herself by my side You see she went on I decided to spend so much upon these horses only because I can easily sell them again They would go at any time for TWENTY thousand francs Yes yes They are splendid horses and you have got a splendid turn out I am quite content Let me hear no more of the matter Then you are not angry No Why should I be You are wise to provide yourself with what you need for it will all come in handy in the future Yes I quite see the necessity of your establishing yourself on a good basis for without it you will never earn your million My hundred thousand francs I look upon merely as a beginning as a mere drop in the bucket Blanche who had by no means expected such declarations from me but rather an uproar and protests was rather taken aback Well well what a man you are she exclaimed Mais tu as l esprit pour comprendre Sais tu mon garcon although you are a tutor you ought to have been born a prince Are you not sorry that your money should be going so quickly No The quicker it goes the better Mais sais tu mais dis donc are you really rich Mais sais tu you have too much contempt for money Qu est ce que tu feras apres dis donc Apres I shall go to Homburg and win another hundred thousand francs Oui oui c est ca c est magnifique Ah I know you will win them and bring them to me when you have done so Dis donc you will end by making me love you Since you are what you are I mean to love you all the time and never to be unfaithful to you You see I have not loved you before parce que je croyais que tu n es qu un utchitel quelque chose comme un lacquais n est ce pas Yet all the time I have been true to you parce que je suis bonne fille You lie I interrupted Did I not see you the other day with Albert with that black jowled officer Oh oh Mais tu es Yes you are lying right enough But what makes you suppose that I should be angry Rubbish Il faut que jeunesse se passe Even if that officer were here now I should refrain from putting him out of the room if I thought you really cared for him Only mind you do not give him any of my money You hear You say do you that you would not be angry Mais tu es un vrai philosophe sais tu Oui un vrai philosophe Eh bien je t aimerai je t aimerai Tu verras tu seras content True enough from that time onward she seemed to attach herself only to me and in this manner we spent our last ten days together The promised etoiles I did not see but in other respects she to a certain extent kept her word Moreover she introduced me to Hortense who was a remarkable woman in her way and known among us as Therese Philosophe But I need not enlarge further for to do so would require a story to itself and entail a colouring which I am loth to impart to the present narrative The point is that with all my faculties I desired the episode to come to an end as speedily as possible Unfortunately our hundred thousand francs lasted us as I have said for very nearly a month which greatly surprised me At all events Blanche bought herself articles to the tune of eighty thousand francs and the rest sufficed just to meet our expenses of living Towards the close of the affair Blanche grew almost frank with me at least she scarcely lied to me at all declaring amongst other things that none of the debts which she had been obliged to incur were going to fall upon my head I have purposely refrained from making you responsible for my bills or borrowings she said for the reason that I am sorry for you Any other woman in my place would have done so and have let you go to prison See then how much I love you and how good hearted I am Think too what this accursed marriage with the General is going to cost me True enough the marriage took place It did so at the close of our month together and I am bound to suppose that it was upon the ceremony that the last remnants of my money were spent With it the episode that is to say my sojourn with the Frenchwoman came to an end and I formally retired from the scene It happened thus A week after we had taken up our abode in Paris there arrived thither the General He came straight to see us and thenceforward lived with us practically as our guest though he had a flat of his own as well Blanche met him with merry badinage and laughter and even threw her arms around him In fact she managed it so that he had to follow everywhere in her train whether when promenading on the Boulevards or when driving or when going to the theatre or when paying calls and this use which she made of him quite satisfied the General Still of imposing appearance and presence as well as of fair height he had a dyed moustache and whiskers he had formerly been in the cuirassiers and a handsome though a somewhat wrinkled face Also his manners were excellent and he could carry a frockcoat well the more so since in Paris he took to wearing his orders To promenade the Boulevards with such a man was not only a thing possible but also so to speak a thing advisable and with this programme the good but foolish General had not a fault to find The truth is that he had never counted upon this programme when he came to Paris to seek us out On that occasion he had made his appearance nearly shaking with terror for he had supposed that Blanche would at once raise an outcry and have him put from the door wherefore he was the more enraptured at the turn that things had taken and spent the month in a state of senseless ecstasy Already I had learnt that after our unexpected departure from Roulettenberg he had had a sort of a fit that he had fallen into a swoon and spent a week in a species of garrulous delirium Doctors had been summoned to him but he had broken away from them and suddenly taken a train to Paris Of course Blanche s reception of him had acted as the best of all possible cures but for long enough he carried the marks of his affliction despite his present condition of rapture and delight To think clearly or even to engage in any serious conversation had now become impossible for him he could only ejaculate after each word Hm and then nod his head in confirmation Sometimes also he would laugh but only in a nervous hysterical sort of a fashion while at other times he would sit for hours looking as black as night with his heavy eyebrows knitted Of much that went on he remained wholly oblivious for he grew extremely absent minded and took to talking to himself Only Blanche could awake him to any semblance of life His fits of depression and moodiness in corners always meant either that he had not seen her for some while or that she had gone out without taking him with her or that she had omitted to caress him before departing When in this condition he would refuse to say what he wanted nor had he the least idea that he was thus sulking and moping Next after remaining in this condition for an hour or two this I remarked on two occasions when Blanche had gone out for the day probably to see Albert he would begin to look about him and to grow uneasy and to hurry about with an air as though he had suddenly remembered something and must try and find it after which not perceiving the object of his search nor succeeding in recalling what that object had been he would as suddenly relapse into oblivion and continue so until the reappearance of Blanche merry wanton half dressed and laughing her strident laugh as she approached to pet him and even to kiss him though the latter reward he seldom received Once he was so overjoyed at her doing so that he burst into tears Even I myself was surprised From the first moment of his arrival in Paris Blanche set herself to plead with me on his behalf and at such times she even rose to heights of eloquence saying that it was for ME she had abandoned him though she had almost become his betrothed and promised to become so that it was for HER sake he had deserted his family that having been in his service I ought to remember the fact and to feel ashamed To all this I would say nothing however much she chattered on until at length I would burst out laughing and the incident would come to an end at first as I have said she had thought me a fool but since she had come to deem me a man of sense and sensibility In short I had the happiness of calling her better nature into play for though at first I had not deemed her so she was in reality a kind hearted woman after her own fashion You are good and clever she said to me towards the finish and my one regret is that you are also so wrong headed You will NEVER be a rich man Un vrai Russe un Kalmuk she usually called me Several times she sent me to give the General an airing in the streets even as she might have done with a lacquey and her spaniel but I preferred to take him to the theatre to the Bal Mabille and to restaurants For this purpose she usually allowed me some money though the General had a little of his own and enjoyed taking out his purse before strangers Once I had to use actual force to prevent him from buying a phaeton at a price of seven hundred francs after a vehicle had caught his fancy in the Palais Royal as seeming to be a desirable present for Blanche What could SHE have done with a seven hundred franc phaeton and the General possessed in the world but a thousand francs The origin even of those francs I could never determine but imagined them to have emanated from mister Astley the more so since the latter had paid the family s hotel bill As for what view the General took of myself I think that he never divined the footing on which I stood with Blanche True he had heard in a dim sort of way that I had won a good deal of money but more probably he supposed me to be acting as secretary or even as a kind of servant to his inamorata At all events he continued to address me in his old haughty style as my superior At times he even took it upon himself to scold me One morning in particular he started to sneer at me over our matutinal coffee Though not a man prone to take offence he suddenly and for some reason of which to this day I am ignorant fell out with me Of course even he himself did not know the reason To put things shortly he began a speech which had neither beginning nor ending and cried out a batons rompus that I was a boy whom he would soon put to rights and so forth and so forth Yet no one could understand what he was saying and at length Blanche exploded in a burst of laughter Finally something appeased him and he was taken out for his walk More than once however I noticed that his depression was growing upon him that he seemed to be feeling the want of somebody or something that despite Blanche s presence he was missing some person in particular Twice on these occasions did he plunge into a conversation with me though he could not make himself intelligible and only went on rambling about the service his late wife his home and his property Every now and then also some particular word would please him whereupon he would repeat it a hundred times in the day even though the word happened to express neither his thoughts nor his feelings Again I would try to get him to talk about his children but always he cut me short in his old snappish way and passed to another subject Yes yes my children was all that I could extract from him Yes you are right in what you have said about them Only once did he disclose his real feelings That was when we were taking him to the theatre and suddenly he exclaimed My unfortunate children Yes sir they are unfortunate children Once too when I chanced to mention Polina he grew quite bitter against her She is an ungrateful woman he exclaimed She is a bad and ungrateful woman She has broken up a family If there were laws here I would have her impaled Yes I would As for De Griers the General would not have his name mentioned He has ruined me he would say He has robbed me and cut my throat For two years he was a perfect nightmare to me For months at a time he never left me in my dreams Do not speak of him again It was now clear to me that Blanche and he were on the point of coming to terms yet true to my usual custom I said nothing At length Blanche took the initiative in explaining matters She did so a week before we parted Il a du chance she prattled for the Grandmother is now REALLY ill and therefore bound to die mister Astley has just sent a telegram to say so and you will agree with me that the General is likely to be her heir Even if he should not be so he will not come amiss since in the first place he has his pension and in the second place he will be content to live in a back room whereas I shall be Madame General and get into a good circle of society she was always thinking of this and become a Russian chatelaine Yes I shall have a mansion of my own and peasants and a million of money at my back But suppose he should prove jealous He might demand all sorts of things you know Do you follow me Oh dear no How ridiculous that would be of him Besides I have taken measures to prevent it You need not be alarmed That is to say I have induced him to sign notes of hand in Albert s name Consequently at any time I could get him punished Isn t he ridiculous Very well then Marry him And in truth she did so though the marriage was a family one only and involved no pomp or ceremony In fact she invited to the nuptials none but Albert and a few other friends Hortense Cleopatre and the rest she kept firmly at a distance As for the bridegroom he took a great interest in his new position Blanche herself tied his tie and Blanche herself pomaded him with the result that in his frockcoat and white waistcoat he looked quite comme il faut Il est pourtant TRES comme il faut Blanche remarked when she issued from his room as though the idea that he was TRES comme il faut had impressed even her For myself I had so little knowledge of the minor details of the affair and took part in it so much as a supine spectator that I have forgotten most of what passed on this occasion I only remember that Blanche and the Widow figured at it not as de Cominges but as du Placet Why they had hitherto been de Cominges I do not know I only know that this entirely satisfied the General that he liked the name du Placet even better than he had liked the name de Cominges On the morning of the wedding he paced the salon in his gala attire and kept repeating to himself with an air of great gravity and importance Mlle Blanche du Placet Mlle Blanche du Placet du Placet He beamed with satisfaction as he did so Both in the church and at the wedding breakfast he remained not only pleased and contented but even proud She too underwent a change for now she assumed an air of added dignity I must behave altogether differently she confided to me with a serious air Yet mark you there is a tiresome circumstance of which I had never before thought which is how best to pronounce my new family name Zagorianski Zagozianski Madame la Generale de Sago Madame la Generale de Fourteen Consonants oh these infernal Russian names The LAST of them would be the best to use don t you think At length the time had come for us to part and Blanche the egregious Blanche shed real tears as she took her leave of me Tu etais bon enfant she said with a sob Je te croyais bete et tu en avais l air but it suited you Then having given me a final handshake she exclaimed Attends whereafter running into her boudoir she brought me thence two thousand franc notes I could scarcely believe my eyes They may come in handy for you she explained for though you are a very learned tutor you are a very stupid man More than two thousand francs however I am not going to give you for the reason that if I did so you would gamble them all away Now good bye Nous serons toujours bons amis and if you win again do not fail to come to me et tu seras heureux I myself had still five hundred francs left as well as a watch worth a thousand francs a few diamond studs and so on Consequently I could subsist for quite a length of time without particularly bestirring myself Purposely I have taken up my abode where I am now partly to pull myself together and partly to wait for mister Astley who I have learnt will soon be here for a day or so on business Yes I know that and then and then I shall go to Homburg But to Roulettenberg I shall not go until next year for they say it is bad to try one s luck twice in succession at a table Moreover Homburg is where the best play is carried on XVII It is a year and eight months since I last looked at these notes of mine I do so now only because being overwhelmed with depression I wish to distract my mind by reading them through at random I left them off at the point where I was just going to Homburg My God with what a light heart comparatively speaking did I write the concluding lines though it may be not so much with a light heart as with a measure of self confidence and unquenchable hope At that time had I any doubts of myself Yet behold me now Scarcely a year and a half have passed yet I am in a worse position than the meanest beggar But what is a beggar A fig for beggary I have ruined myself that is all Nor is there anything with which I can compare myself there is no moral which it would be of any use for you to read to me At the present moment nothing could well be more incongruous than a moral Oh you self satisfied persons who in your unctuous pride are forever ready to mouth your maxims if only you knew how fully I myself comprehend the sordidness of my present state you would not trouble to wag your tongues at me What could you say to me that I do not already know Well wherein lies my difficulty It lies in the fact that by a single turn of a roulette wheel everything for me has become changed Yet had things befallen otherwise these moralists would have been among the first yes I feel persuaded of it to approach me with friendly jests and congratulations Yes they would never have turned from me as they are doing now A fig for all of them What am I I am zero nothing What shall I be tomorrow I may be risen from the dead and have begun life anew For still I may discover the man in myself if only my manhood has not become utterly shattered I went I say to Homburg but afterwards went also to Roulettenberg as well as to Spa and Baden in which latter place for a time I acted as valet to a certain rascal of a Privy Councillor by name Heintze who until lately was also my master here Yes for five months I lived my life with lacqueys That was just after I had come out of Roulettenberg prison where I had lain for a small debt which I owed Out of that prison I was bailed by by whom By mister Astley By Polina I do not know At all events the debt was paid to the tune of two hundred thalers and I sallied forth a free man But what was I to do with myself In my dilemma I had recourse to this Heintze who was a young scapegrace and the sort of man who could speak and write three languages At first I acted as his secretary at a salary of thirty gulden a month but afterwards I became his lacquey for the reason that he could not afford to keep a secretary only an unpaid servant I had nothing else to turn to so I remained with him and allowed myself to become his flunkey But by stinting myself in meat and drink I saved during my five months of service some seventy gulden and one evening when we were at Baden I told him that I wished to resign my post and then hastened to betake myself to roulette Oh how my heart beat as I did so No it was not the money that I valued what I wanted was to make all this mob of Heintzes hotel proprietors and fine ladies of Baden talk about me recount my story wonder at me extol my doings and worship my winnings True these were childish fancies and aspirations but who knows but that I might meet Polina and be able to tell her everything and see her look of surprise at the fact that I had overcome so many adverse strokes of fortune No I had no desire for money for its own sake for I was perfectly well aware that I should only squander it upon some new Blanche and spend another three weeks in Paris after buying a pair of horses which had cost sixteen thousand francs No I never believed myself to be a hoarder in fact I knew only too well that I was a spendthrift And already with a sort of fear a sort of sinking in my heart I could hear the cries of the croupiers Trente et un rouge impair et passe Quarte noir pair et manque How greedily I gazed upon the gaming table with its scattered louis d or ten gulden pieces and thalers upon the streams of gold as they issued from the croupier s hands and piled themselves up into heaps of gold scintillating as fire upon the ell long rolls of silver lying around the croupier Even at a distance of two rooms I could hear the chink of that money so much so that I nearly fell into convulsions Ah the evening when I took those seventy gulden to the gaming table was a memorable one for me I began by staking ten gulden upon passe For passe I had always had a sort of predilection yet I lost my stake upon it This left me with sixty gulden in silver After a moment s thought I selected zero beginning by staking five gulden at a time Twice I lost but the third round suddenly brought up the desired coup I could almost have died with joy as I received my one hundred and seventy five gulden Indeed I have been less pleased when in former times I have won a hundred thousand gulden Losing no time I staked another hundred gulden upon the red and won two hundred upon the red and won four hundred upon the black and won eight hundred upon manque and won Thus with the addition of the remainder of my original capital I found myself possessed within five minutes of seventeen hundred gulden Ah at such moments one forgets both oneself and one s former failures This I had gained by risking my very life I had dared so to risk and behold again I was a member of mankind I went and hired a room I shut myself up in it and sat counting my money until three o clock in the morning To think that when I awoke on the morrow I was no lacquey I decided to leave at once for Homburg There I should neither have to serve as a footman nor to lie in prison Half an hour before starting I went and ventured a couple of stakes no more with the result that in all I lost fifteen hundred florins Nevertheless I proceeded to Homburg and have now been there for a month Of course I am living in constant trepidation playing for the smallest of stakes and always looking out for something calculating standing whole days by the gaming tables to watch the play even seeing that play in my dreams yet seeming the while to be in some way stiffening to be growing caked as it were in mire But I must conclude my notes which I finish under the impression of a recent encounter with mister Astley I had not seen him since we parted at Roulettenberg and now we met quite by accident At the time I was walking in the public gardens and meditating upon the fact that not only had I still some fifty gulden in my possession but also I had fully paid up my hotel bill three days ago Consequently I was in a position to try my luck again at roulette and if I won anything I should be able to continue my play whereas if I lost what I now possessed I should once more have to accept a lacquey s place provided that in the alternative I failed to discover a Russian family which stood in need of a tutor Plunged in these reflections I started on my daily walk through the Park and forest towards a neighbouring principality Sometimes on such occasions I spent four hours on the way and would return to Homburg tired and hungry but on this particular occasion I had scarcely left the gardens for the Park when I caught sight of Astley seated on a bench As soon as he perceived me he called me by name and I went and sat down beside him but on noticing that he seemed a little stiff in his manner I hastened to moderate the expression of joy which the sight of him had called forth YOU here he said Well I had an idea that I should meet you Do not trouble to tell me anything for I know all yes all In fact your whole life during the past twenty months lies within my knowledge How closely you watch the doings of your old friends I replied That does you infinite credit But stop a moment You have reminded me of something Was it you who bailed me out of Roulettenberg prison when I was lying there for a debt of two hundred gulden SOMEONE did so Oh dear no though I knew all the time that you were lying there Perhaps you could tell me who DID bail me out No I am afraid I could not What a strange thing For I know no Russians at all here so it cannot have been a Russian who befriended me In Russia we Orthodox folk DO go bail for one another but in this case I thought it must have been done by some English stranger who was not conversant with the ways of the country mister Astley seemed to listen to me with a sort of surprise Evidently he had expected to see me looking more crushed and broken than I was Well he said not very pleasantly I am none the less glad to find that you retain your old independence of spirit as well as your buoyancy Which means that you are vexed at not having found me more abased and humiliated than I am I retorted with a smile Astley was not quick to understand this but presently did so and laughed Your remarks please me as they always did he continued In those words I see the clever triumphant and above all things cynical friend of former days Only Russians have the faculty of combining within themselves so many opposite qualities Yes most men love to see their best friend in abasement for generally it is on such abasement that friendship is founded All thinking persons know that ancient truth Yet on the present occasion I assure you I am sincerely glad to see that you are NOT cast down Tell me are you never going to give up gambling Damn the gambling Yes I should certainly have given it up were it not that That you are losing I thought so You need not tell me any more I know how things stand for you have said that last in despair and therefore truthfully Have you no other employment than gambling No none whatever Astley gave me a searching glance At that time it was ages since I had last looked at a paper or turned the pages of a book You are growing blase he said You have not only renounced life with its interests and social ties but the duties of a citizen and a man you have not only renounced the friends whom I know you to have had and every aim in life but that of winning money but you have also renounced your memory Though I can remember you in the strong ardent period of your life I feel persuaded that you have now forgotten every better feeling of that period that your present dreams and aspirations of subsistence do not rise above pair impair rouge noir the twelve middle numbers and so forth Enough mister Astley I cried with some irritation almost in anger Kindly do not recall to me any more recollections for I can remember things for myself Only for a time have I put them out of my head Only until I shall have rehabilitated myself am I keeping my memory dulled When that hour shall come you will see me arise from the dead Then you will have to be here another ten years he replied Should I then be alive I will remind you here on this very bench of what I have just said In fact I will bet you a wager that I shall do so Say no more I interrupted impatiently And to show you that I have not wholly forgotten the past may I enquire where Mlle Polina is If it was not you who bailed me out of prison it must have been she Yet never have I heard a word concerning her No I do not think it was she At the present moment she is in Switzerland and you will do me a favour by ceasing to ask me these questions about her Astley said this with a firm and even an angry air Which means that she has dealt you a serious wound I burst out with an involuntary sneer Mlle Polina he continued Is the best of all possible living beings but I repeat that I shall thank you to cease questioning me about her You never really knew her and her name on your lips is an offence to my moral feeling Indeed On what subject then have I a better right to speak to you than on this With it are bound up all your recollections and mine However do not be alarmed I have no wish to probe too far into your private your secret affairs My interest in Mlle Polina does not extend beyond her outward circumstances and surroundings About them you could tell me in two words Well on condition that the matter shall end there I will tell you that for a long time Mlle Polina was ill and still is so My mother and sister entertained her for a while at their home in the north of England and thereafter Mlle Polina s grandmother you remember the mad old woman died and left Mlle Polina a personal legacy of seven thousand pounds sterling That was about six months ago and now Mlle is travelling with my sister s family my sister having since married Mlle s little brother and sister also benefited by the Grandmother s will and are now being educated in London As for the General he died in Paris last month of a stroke Mlle Blanche did well by him for she succeeded in having transferred to herself all that he received from the Grandmother That I think concludes all that I have to tell And De Griers Is he too travelling in Switzerland No nor do I know where he is Also I warn you once more that you had better avoid such hints and ignoble suppositions otherwise you will assuredly have to reckon with me What In spite of our old friendship Yes in spite of our old friendship Then I beg your pardon a thousand times mister Astley I meant nothing offensive to Mlle Polina for I have nothing of which to accuse her Moreover the question of there being anything between this Frenchman and this Russian lady is not one which you and I need discuss nor even attempt to understand If replied Astley you do not care to hear their names coupled together may I ask you what you mean by the expressions this Frenchman this Russian lady and there being anything between them Why do you call them so particularly a Frenchman and a Russian lady Ah I see you are interested mister Astley But it is a long long story and calls for a lengthy preface At the same time the question is an important one however ridiculous it may seem at the first glance A Frenchman mister Astley is merely a fine figure of a man With this you as a Britisher may not agree With it I also as a Russian may not agree out of envy Yet possibly our good ladies are of another opinion For instance one may look upon Racine as a broken down hobbledehoy perfumed individual one may even be unable to read him and I too may think him the same as well as in some respects a subject for ridicule Yet about him mister Astley there is a certain charm and above all things he is a great poet though one might like to deny it Yes the Frenchman the Parisian as a national figure was in process of developing into a figure of elegance before we Russians had even ceased to be bears The Revolution bequeathed to the French nobility its heritage and now every whippersnapper of a Parisian may possess manners methods of expression and even thoughts that are above reproach in form while all the time he himself may share in that form neither in initiative nor in intellect nor in soul his manners and the rest having come to him through inheritance Yes taken by himself the Frenchman is frequently a fool of fools and a villain of villains Per contra there is no one in the world more worthy of confidence and respect than this young Russian lady De Griers might so mask his face and play a part as easily to overcome her heart for he has an imposing figure mister Astley and this young lady might easily take that figure for his real self for the natural form of his heart and soul instead of the mere cloak with which heredity has dowered him And even though it may offend you I feel bound to say that the majority also of English people are uncouth and unrefined whereas we Russian folk can recognise beauty wherever we see it and are always eager to cultivate the same But to distinguish beauty of soul and personal originality there is needed far more independence and freedom than is possessed by our women especially by our younger ladies At all events they need more EXPERIENCE For instance this Mlle Polina pardon me but the name has passed my lips and I cannot well recall it is taking a very long time to make up her mind to prefer you to Monsieur de Griers She may respect you she may become your friend she may open out her heart to you yet over that heart there will be reigning that loathsome villain that mean and petty usurer De Griers This will be due to obstinacy and self love to the fact that De Griers once appeared to her in the transfigured guise of a marquis of a disenchanted and ruined liberal who was doing his best to help her family and the frivolous old General and although these transactions of his have since been exposed you will find that the exposure has made no impression upon her mind Only give her the De Griers of former days and she will ask of you no more The more she may detest the present De Griers the more will she lament the De Griers of the past even though the latter never existed but in her own imagination You are a sugar refiner mister Astley are you not Yes I belong to the well known firm of Lovell and company Then see here On the one hand you are a sugar refiner while on the other hand you are an Apollo Belvedere But the two characters do not mix with one another I again am not even a sugar refiner I am a mere roulette gambler who has also served as a lacquey Of this fact Mlle Polina is probably well aware since she appears to have an excellent force of police at her disposal You are saying this because you are feeling bitter said Astley with cold indifference Yet there is not the least originality in your words I agree But therein lies the horror of it all that how trepidation playing ever mean and farcical my accusations may be they are none the less TRUE But I am only wasting words Yes you are for you are only talking nonsense exclaimed my companion his voice now trembling and his eyes flashing fire Are you aware he continued that wretched ignoble petty unfortunate man though you are it was at HER request I came to Homburg in order to see you and to have a long serious talk with you and to report to her your feelings and thoughts and hopes yes and your recollections of her too Indeed Is that really so I cried the tears beginning to well from my eyes Never before had this happened Yes poor unfortunate continued Astley She DID love you and I may tell you this now for the reason that now you are utterly lost Even if I were also to tell you that she still loves you you would none the less have to remain where you are Yes you have ruined yourself beyond redemption Once upon a time you had a certain amount of talent and you were of a lively disposition and your good looks were not to be despised You might even have been useful to your country which needs men like you Yet you remained here and your life is now over I am not blaming you for this in my view all Russians resemble you or are inclined to do so If it is not roulette then it is something else The exceptions are very rare Nor are you the first to learn what a taskmaster is yours For roulette is not exclusively a Russian game Hitherto you have honourably preferred to serve as a lacquey rather than to act as a thief but what the future may have in store for you I tremble to think Now good bye You are in want of money I suppose Then take these ten louis d or More I shall not give you for you would only gamble it away Take care of these coins and farewell Once more TAKE CARE of them No mister Astley After all that has been said I TAKE CARE of them repeated my friend I am certain you are still a gentleman and therefore I give you the money as one gentleman may give money to another Also if I could be certain that you would leave both Homburg and the gaming tables and return to your own country I would give you a thousand pounds down to start life afresh but I give you ten louis d or instead of a thousand pounds for the reason that at the present time a thousand pounds and ten louis d or will be all the same to you you will lose the one as readily as you will the other Take the money therefore and good bye Yes I WILL take it if at the same time you will embrace me With pleasure So we parted on terms of sincere affection But he was wrong If I was hard and undiscerning as regards Polina and De Griers HE was hard and undiscerning as regards Russian people generally Of myself I say nothing Yet yet words are only words I need to ACT Above all things I need to think of Switzerland Tomorrow tomorrow Ah but if only I could set things right tomorrow and be born again and rise again from the dead But no I cannot Yet I must show her what I can do Even if she should do no more than learn that I can still play the man it would be worth it Today it is too late but TOMORROW Yet I have a presentiment that things can never be otherwise I have got fifteen louis d or in my possession although I began with fifteen gulden If I were to play carefully at the start But no no Surely I am not such a fool as that Yet WHY should I not rise from the dead I should require at first but to go cautiously and patiently and the rest would follow I should require but to put a check upon my nature for one hour and my fortunes would be changed entirely Yes my nature is my weak point I have only to remember what happened to me some months ago at Roulettenberg before my final ruin What a notable instance that was of my capacity for resolution On the occasion in question I had lost everything everything yet just as I was leaving the Casino I heard another gulden give a rattle in my pocket Perhaps I shall need it for a meal I thought to myself but a hundred paces further on I changed my mind and returned That gulden I staked upon manque and there is something in the feeling that though one is alone and in a foreign land and far from one s own home and friends and ignorant of whence one s next meal is to come one is nevertheless staking one s very last coin Well I won the stake and in twenty minutes had left the Casino with a hundred and seventy gulden in my pocket That is a fact and it shows what a last remaining gulden can do But what if my heart had failed me or I had shrunk from making up my mind No tomorrow all shall be ended End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Gambler by Fyodor Dostoyevsky END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK
