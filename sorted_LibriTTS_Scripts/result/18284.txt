the experiences of others nor can we know music by reading about it Only by taking it into our hearts and homes by admitting it to our intimate companionship can we approach a knowledge of the art that has enriched so many lives even though it has never yet completely fulfilled its function At the same time every music lover is helped to new ideas inspired to fresh efforts by suggestions and statements from those who have themselves had deep experiences in their search for the inner sanctuary of the Temple of Art Musicians have been too much inclined to treat their art as something to be exclusively appropriated by a favored class of men and women and are themselves greatly to blame for its mistaken isolation True music has its privileged class To this belongs the mind of creative genius that can formulate in tones the universal passions the eternal verities of the soul In it may also be numbered those gifted beings whose interpretative powers peculiarly adapt them to spread abroad the utterances of genius Precisely in the same way religion has its prophets and its ministers Music as well as religion is meant for everyone and the business of its ministers and teachers is to convey to all the message of its prophets The nineteenth century was the period of achievement There is every reason to believe that the twentieth century will be the period of still nobler achievement beyond all in the realm of the spirit Then will music find its most splendid opportunity and in our own free soil it will yield its richest fruitage Amid the favorable conditions of liberty it will flourish to the utmost and will come to afford blessed relief from the pressure of materialism During the era we are entering no unworthy teacher will be permitted to trifle with the unfolding musical instincts of childhood The study of music will take an honored place in the curriculum of every school academy college and university as an essential factor in culture Then music among us will come to reflect our deepest truest consciousness the American world view It is with a desire to stimulate thought and incite to action that the present volume has been prepared for every music lover The essays contained in it have not previously appeared in print They are composed to a large extent of materials used by the author in her lectures and informal talks on music and its history That her readers may be led to seek further acquaintance with the divine art is her earnest wish Many thanks are due L C Page Company of Boston for kind permission to use the portrait of Corelli from their Famous Violinists by Henry C Lahee AUBERTINE WOODWARD MOORE MADISON WIS FOR EVERY MUSIC LOVER I The Origin and Function of Music One of the most interesting of the many interesting stories of our civilization is the story of Music It affords an intimate knowledge of the inner life of man as manifested in different epochs of the world s history He who has failed to follow it has failed to comprehend the noblest phenomena of human progress Mythology and legendary lore abound in delightful traditions in regard to the birth of music The untutored philosophers of primitive humanity and the learned philosophers of ancient civilizations alike strove to solve the sweet elusive mystery surrounding the art Through the myths and legends based on their speculations runs a suggestion of divine origin The Egyptians of old saw in their sublime god Osiris and his ideal spouse Isis the authors of music Among the Hindus it was regarded as a priceless gift from the great god Brahma who was its creator and whose peerless consort Sarasvati was its guardian Poetic fancies in these lines permeate the early literature of diverse peoples This is not surprising Abundant testimony proves that the existence of music is coeval with that of mankind that it is based on the modulations of the human voice and the agitations of the human muscles and nerves caused by the infinite variations of the spiritual and emotional sensations needs and aspirations of humanity that it has grown with man s growth developed with man s development and that its origin is as divine as that of man Illustration MOZART The inevitable dualism which Emerson found bisecting all nature appears also in music which is both spiritual and material The spiritual part of music appeals to the spiritual part of man addressing each heart according to the cravings and capacities of each The material part of music may be compared to the body in which man s spirit is housed It is the vehicle which conveys the message of music from soul to soul through the medium of the human ear with its matchless harp of nerve fibres and its splendid sounding board the eardrum Music is the mirror which most perfectly reflects man s inner being and the essence of all things Ruskin saw clearly that he alone can love art well who loves better what art mirrors This may especially be applied to music which offers as a Beethoven has said a more lofty revelation than all wisdom and philosophy Having no model in nature being neither an imitation of any actual object nor a repetition of anything experienced music stands alone among the arts It represents the real thing as Schopenhauer has it the thing itself not the mere semblance Were we able to give a thoroughly satisfactory explanation of music he declares we should have the true philosophy of the universe Music is a kind of inarticulate unfathomable speech which leads us to the edge of the Infinite and impels us for a moment to gaze into it exclaimed Carlyle Wagner found in music the conscious language of feeling that which ennobles the sensual and realizes the spiritual Music is the harmonious voice of creation an echo of the invisible world one note of the divine concord which the entire universe is destined one day to sound wrote Mazzini Literature is rich in noble definitions of the divine art From a matter of fact standpoint music consists of a vast concourse of tones which are its raw materials and bear within themselves the possibility of being moulded into form Utterances and actions illustrating these raw materials are common to all living creatures A dog reiterating short barks of joy or giving vent to prolonged howls of distress is actuated by an impulse similar to that of the human infant as it uplifts its voice to express its small emotions The sounds uttered by primeval man as the direct expression of his emotions were unquestionably of a like nature The tendency to manifest feeling by means of sound is universally admitted and sound freighted with feeling is peculiarly exciting to human beings The agitations of a mob may be increased by the emotional tones of its prime movers and we all know that the power of an orator depends more on his skill in handling his voice than on what he says A craving for sympathy exists in all animate beings It is strong in mankind and becomes peculiarly intense in the type known as artistic The fulness of his own emotions compels the musician to utterance To strike a sympathetic chord in other sensitive breasts it becomes necessary to devise forms of expression that may be unmistakably intelligible Out of such elements the tone language has grown precisely as the word language grew out of men s early attempts to communicate facts to one another Its story records a slow painstaking building up of principles to control its raw materials for music as we understand it cannot exist without some kind of design Vague sounds produce vague fleeting impressions Definiteness in tonal relations and rhythmic plan is requisite to produce a defined enduring impression In primitive states of music rhythmic sounds were heard defined by the pulses but with little or no change of pitch and sounds varying in pitch without regularity of impulse A high degree of intellectuality was reached before our modern scales were evolved from long continued attempts at making well balanced successions of sounds As musical art advanced rhythm and melodic expression became united The study of the origin function and evolution of music according to modern scientific methods is a matter of comparatively recent date As late as eighteen thirty five a French writer of the history of music expressed profound regret that he had been unable to determine when music was invented or to discover the inventor s name It was his opinion that musical man had profited largely from the voices of the feathered tribes He seriously asserted that the duck had evidently furnished a model for the clarionet and oboe and Sir Chanticleer for the trumpet An entire chapter of his book he devoted to surmises concerning the Music before the Flood The poor man felt himself superior to the poetic fancies of the ancients which at least foreshadowed the Truth but had found no firm ground on which to stand Much finer were the instincts of Capellmeister Wolfgang Kasper Prince of Waldthurn whose historical treatise on Music appeared in Dresden in sixteen ninety He boldly declared the author of music to be the good God himself who fashioned the air to transmit musical sounds the ear to receive them the soul of man to throb with emotions demanding utterance and all nature to be filled with sources of inspiration The good Capellmeister was in close touch with the Truth It was in eighteen thirty five the same year that the French writer mentioned offered his wild speculations that Herbert Spencer from the standpoint of a scientist produced his essay on the Origin and Function of Music which has proved invaluable in arousing discriminating thought in these lines Many years elapsed before its worth to musicians was realized To day it is widely known and far reaching in its influence In those inner agitations which cause muscular expansion and contraction and find expression in the inflections and cadences of the voice Herbert Spencer saw the foundations of music He unhesitatingly defined it as emotional speech the language of the feelings whose function was to increase the sympathies and broaden the horizon of mankind Besides frankly placing music at the head of the fine arts he declared that those sensations of unexperienced felicity it arouses those impressions of an unknown ideal existence it calls forth may be regarded as a prophecy to the fulfilment of which music is itself partly instrumental Our strange capacity for being affected by melody and harmony cannot but imply that it is possible to realize the delights they suggest On these suppositions might be comprehended the power and significance of music which must otherwise remain a mystery The progress of musical culture he thought could not be too much applauded as a noble means of ministering to human welfare mister Spencer s theory has of late led to much controversy Its author has been censured for setting forth no explanation of the place of harmony in modern music and for not realizing what a musical composition is In his last volume Facts and Comments which contains many valuable thoughts not previously published he declares that his critics have obviously confounded the origin of a thing and that which originates from it Here we have a striking example of the way in which an hypothesis is made to appear untenable by representing it as being something which it does not profess to be he says I gave an account of the origin of music and now I am blamed because my conception of the origin of music does not include a conception of music as fully developed If to some one who said that an oak comes from an acorn it were replied that he had manifestly never seen an oak since an acorn contains no trace of all its complexities of form and structure the reply would not be thought a rational one but he believes it would be quite as rational as to suppose he had not realized what a musical composition is because his theory of the origin of music says nothing about the characteristics of an overture or a quartet Of the music of primeval man we can form an estimate from the music of still existing uncivilized races As the vocabulary of their speech is limited so the notes of their music are few but expressive gestures and modulations of the voice supplement both With advancing civilization the emotions of which the human heart are capable become more complex and demand larger means of expression Some belief in the healing helpful uplifting power of music has always prevailed It remains for independent practical modern man to present the art to the world as a thing of law and order whose ineffable beauty and beneficence may reach the lives of the average man and woman Without the growth of the individual music cannot grow without freedom of thought neither the language of tones nor that of words can gain full free utterance Freedom is essential to the life of the indwelling spirit Wherever the flow of thought and fancy is impeded or the energies of the individual held in check there music is cramped In China where conditions have crushed spiritual and intellectual liberty the art remains to this day in a crude rhythmical or percussion state although it was early honored as the gift of superior beings The Chinese philosopher detected a grand world music in the harmonious order of the heavens and the earth and wrote voluminous works on musical theory When it came to putting this into practice tones were combined in a pedantic fashion In all ages and climes music has ministered to religion and education The sacred Vedas bear testimony to the high place it held in Hindu worship and life Proud records of stone reveal its dignified role in the civilization of Egypt where Plato stated there had existed ten thousand years before his day music that could only have emanated from gods or godlike men The art was taught by the temple priests and the education of no young person was complete without a knowledge of it Egyptian musical culture impressed itself on the Greeks and also on the Israelites whose tone language gained warmth and coloring from various Oriental sources Hebrew scriptures abound in tributes to the worth of music which was intimately related to the political life mental consciousness and national sentiment of the Children of Israel Through music they approached the unseen King of kings with the plaintive outpourings of their grief laden hearts and with their joyful hymns of praise and thanksgiving From the polished Greeks we gained a basis for the scientific laws governing our musical art The splendid music of which we read in ancient writings has for the most part vanished with the lives it enriched Relegated to the guardianship of exclusive classes its most sacred secrets were kept from the people and it could not possibly have attained the expansion we know Music has been called the handmaiden of Christianity but may more appropriately be designated its loyal helpmeet Whatever synagogue or other melodies may have first served to voice the sentiments kindled by the Gospel of Glad Tidings it was inevitable that the new religious thought should seek and find new musical expression In shaping a ritual for general use an accompaniment of suitable music had to be considered The fathers of the church constituted themselves also the guides of music Those forms which give symmetry and proportion to the outward structure of the tonal art were pruned and polished under ecclesiastical surveillance until spontaneity was endangered Happily in the spirit of Christianity is that which ever proves a remedy for the mistakes of law givers The religion that inculcates respect for the individual has furthered the advance of music and of spirituality Beyond the confines of the church was another musical growth springing up by the wayside and in remote places Folk music it is called and it gives untrammeled utterance to human longings human grief and despair and human wondering over the mysteries of life death and the great Beyond Untutored people had always found vent in this kind of music for pent up feelings and the folk music of the Christian world during the Crusades gained a new element in the fragments of Oriental melody transplanted into its midst In time through the combined wisdom of gifted composers and large minded ecclesiastical rulers the music of the church and the music of the people became united and modern music was born Architecture painting sculpture and poetry possess practical proofs of their past achievements and on these their present endeavors are builded Modern music has been compelled to be the architect of its own fortunes It is the one new art of our era and as the youngest in the family of arts it has but recently reached a high state of development During those eleven Christian centuries from the latter part of the fourth century when the corner stone for our musical system was laid until the wonderful exploration period of the fifteenth was well advanced the masters of music were absorbed in controlling the elements of their art Since then event has crowded upon event with rapidly increasing ratio During the past two centuries the progress of the art has been like a tale in fairyland We now possess a magnificent musical vocabulary a splendid musical literature yet so accustomed are we to grand treasure troves we perhaps prize them no more than the meagre stores of the past were prized Music is often mentioned in literature as a means of discipline inspiration and refreshment We read in Homer that Achilles was instructed in the art that he might learn to moderate his passions Pythagoras father of Musical Science counseled his disciples to refresh themselves at the fount of music before retiring to their couches at night in order to restore the inner harmony of their souls and to seek strength in the morning from the same source Plato taught that music is as essential to the mind as air is to the body and that children should be familiarized with harmonies and rhythms that they might be more gentle harmonious and rhythmical consequently better fitted for speech and action Song brings of itself a cheerfulness that wakes the heart to joy exclaimed Euripides and certain it is a large measure of joy surrounds those who live in an atmosphere of music It has a magic wand that lifts man beyond the petty worries of his existence Music is a shower bath of the soul said Schopenhauer washing away all that is impure Or as Auerbach put it Music washes from the soul the dust of everyday life Realizing the influence of music Martin Luther sang the Reformation into the hearts of the people with his noble chorals in which every one might join He called music a mistress of order and good manners and introduced it into the schools as a means of refinement and discipline in whose presence anger and all evil would depart A schoolmaster said he ought to have skill in music otherwise I would not regard him neither should we ordain young men to the office of preaching unless they have been well exercised in the art for it maketh a fine people It were well if teachers and ministers to day more generally appreciated the value of music to them and their work Music is an essential factor in great national movements Every commander knows how inspiring and comforting it is to his men Napoleon Bonaparte who was not readily lifted out of himself and who complained that music jarred his nerves was shrewd enough to observe its effect on marching troops and to order the bands of different regiments to play daily in front of hospitals to soothe and cheer the wounded The one tune he prized Malbrook he hummed as he started for his last campaign In the solitude of saint Helena he said Of all liberal arts music has the greatest influence over the passions and it is that to which the legislator ought to give the most encouragement An art that in some form is found in the varied activities of all people at all times must be the common heritage of humanity It does not speak to one class but to mankind said Robert Franz the German song writer Alexander Bain called it the most available universal and influential of the fine arts and doctor Marx the musical theorist thought music beneficial to the moral and spiritual estate of the masses Truly indeed has it been said that its universality gives music its high worth Mirroring neither your inner life alone nor mine but the world s essence the transfiguration of what seems real the divine Ideal some spark of which glows in every bosom each individual may feel in it whatever he is capable of feeling The soul s language it takes up the thread dropped by words and gives utterance to those refined sentiments and holy aspirations words are inadequate to awaken or express Its message is borne from heart to heart revealing to each things unseen according as it is prepared to receive them In the Merchant of Venice Shakespeare made Lorenzo speak to Jessica of the harmony that is in immortal souls and say that whilst this muddy vesture of decay doth grossly close it in we cannot hear it To refine this muddy vesture to render the spirit attentive to bring light sweetness strength harmony and beauty into daily life is the central function of music which from the cradle to the grave is man s most intimate companion Richard Wagner devoutly believed it would prepare the way for an unspoiled unfettered humanity illumined by a perception of Truth and Beauty and united by a bond of sympathy and love This ideal union is the goal at which Tolstoi aims in his What is Art He defines art as a human activity to be enjoyed by all whose purpose is the transmission of the most exalted feelings to which men have arisen but the union he proposes would have to be consummated by a leveling process All art that cannot without preparation reach the uncultured classes is denounced by him He is most bitter in his denunciation of Wagner who fought for a democratic art but who wished to attain it by raising the lowliest of his fellow creatures to an ever loftier plane of high thinking and feeling According to Tolstoi art began to degenerate when it separated itself from religion There must have been dense mist before the Russian sage s mental vision when he fancied this separation possible Art especially musical art is a vital part of religion and cannot be put asunder from it Like thought music since the bonds of church and state have been broken has spread wide its pinions and soared to hitherto unsuspected heights All noble music is sacred Amid the marvelous material progress of to day music is more needed than ever Unburdened by the responsibility of fact it brings relief to the soul from the grinding pressure of constant grappling with knowledge The benefits of knowledge are great but it is also beneficial to be uplifted as we may be by music from out the perplexing labyrinth of the work a day world toward the realm of the Divine Ideal As a means of culture music is a potent factor in human civilization It is destined to wield even greater influence than has yet been known It has become the household art of to day As it enters more and more fully into the heart of the home and social life it will more and more enrich human existence and aid in ushering in the Kingdom of Heaven on Earth If music can do so much for mankind why are not all musicians great and good Ah my friend that is a hard question to answer and can only be fairly treated by asking another equally difficult question Why are not all people who have enjoyed the advantages of religion wise and noble Consider the gigantic machinery that has been put in motion to promulgate Christianity and note how slow men have been to appropriate the teachings of its founder Slow progress furnishes no argument against the mission either of religion or its comrade music In common with religion music kindles our finer sensibilities and brings us into an atmosphere superior to that which ordinarily surrounds us It requires wisdom to beautify commonplace conditions with what has been enjoyed in aerial regions Rightly applied music can lend itself to this illumination As it is better known its advantages will be more completely realized II Blunders in Music Study Like a voice from the Unseen the Eternal music speaks to the soul of man Its informing word being delivered in the language of the emotional nature finds some response to its appeal in every normal human breast Shakespeare indicated this truth when he had his Lorenzo in the Merchant of Venice say The man that hath no music in himself Nor is not moved with concord of sweet sounds Is fit for treasons stratagems and spoils The motions of his spirit are dull as night And his affections dark as Erebus Let no such man be trusted It is not the normal soul fresh from its Creator s hands that is fit for such dire evils but the soul perverted by false conditions and surroundings Where vice has become congenial and the impure reigns supreme that which rouses and expresses noble aspirations and pure emotions can find no room Normal instincts may also be dulled the inner being made as it were musically deaf and dumb by a false education which stifles and dwarfs the finer feelings or by circumstances which permit these to remain dormant The emotional natures of human beings differ as widely in kind and degree as the intellectual and physical natures In some people sensibility predominates and the irresistible activity of fancy and feeling compels the expression in rhythmic tone combinations of ideals grasped intuitively Thus musical genius manifests itself No amount of education can bring it into being but true culture and wise guidance are needed to equip it for its bold flight Neither diligence without genius nor genius without education will produce anything thorough as we read in Horace Other people with marked aptitude for musical expression have reproductive rather than creative endowments To them belongs talent in a greater or less degree and they are adapted to promulgate the message which genius formulated for mankind Talent may be ripened and brightened by suitable environments and fostering care There are besides persons led by genius or talent into other avenues than those of the tone world and the great public with its diverse grades of emotional and intellectual gifts The cultivation of the aesthetic tastes is profitable to all and no agency contributes so freely to it as music Too many people engaged in purely scientific or practical pursuits have failed to realize this In those nations known as musical and that have become so through generations occupied with the art music study is placed on an equal footing with any other worthy pursuit and no life interest is permitted to exclude musical enthusiasm Unless disabled by physical defects every one displays some sense of musical sound and rhythmic motion It is a constant occurrence for children without a word of direction to mark the time of a stirring tune with hands feet and swaying motions of the body A lullaby will almost invariably soothe a restless infant and most children old enough to distinguish and articulate groups of tones will make some attempt at singing the melodies they have often heard The average child begins music lessons with evident pleasure It should be no more difficult to strengthen the musical instincts than any other faculties On the contrary it too often chances that a child whose early song efforts have been in excellent time and tune and not without expression who has marched in time and beat time accurately will after a period of instruction utterly disregard sense of rhythm sing out of tune play wrong notes or fail to notice when the musical instrument used is ever so cruelly out of tune Uneducated people trusting to intuitive perceptions promptly decide that such or such a child or person has been spoiled by cultivation This is merely a failure to trace a result to its rightful cause which lies not in cultivation but in certain blunders in music study These blunders begin with the preliminary course on the piano or violin for instance when a child having no previous training in the rudiments of music starts with one weekly lesson and is required to practice a prescribed period daily without supervision To the difficulties of an introduction to a musical instrument are added those of learning to read notes to locate them to appreciate time values and much else The teacher it may be knows little of the inner life of music still less of child nature Manifold perplexities arise and faltering through these the pupil acquires a halting use of the musical vocabulary with other bad habits equally hard to correct A constant repetition of false notes wrong phrasing irregular accents faulty rhythms and a meaningless jumble of notes dulls the outer ear and deadens the inner tone sense Where there is genius or decided talent no obstacle can wholly bar the way to music Otherwise it retreats before the blundering approach Many a mother when advised to direct her child s practicing or at least to encourage it by her presence has excused herself on the plea that it would bore her to listen If the work bores the mother it is not surprising that the child attacks it with mind fixed on metal more attractive and eyes seeking the clock Occupations which are repellent in early life leave behind them a memory calculated to render them forever distasteful It is therefore a grave mistake not to make music study from the outset throb with vital interest An appeal to the intellect will quicken the aesthetic instincts be they never so slender and almost any one will love work that engages all the faculties Those pupils are fortunate who come under the influence of a teacher with strong well balanced personality and ripe knowledge and are treated as rational beings capable of feeling thinking and acting Too many music teachers learn their business by experimenting on beginners It has been suggested as a safeguard against their blunders and all ignorance carelessness and imposture that music might be placed under the same legal protection accorded other important factors in social life and that no one be permitted to teach it without a license granted by a competent board of judges after the applicant had passed a successful examination theoretical and practical This would be well if there was any certainty of choosing suitable persons to select the judges A practical Vienna musician H Geisler has recently created no little sensation by asserting that the pianoforte although indispensable for the advanced artist is worthless even harmful in primary training and that the methods used in teaching it are based on a total misapprehension of the musical development prescribed by nature Sensual and intellectual perceptions must actively exist he feels before they can be expressed by means of an instrument It is a mistake to presume that manual practice can call them into being or to disregard the supremacy of the tone sense He considers the human voice the primitive educational instrument of music and believes the reasonable order of musical education to be hearing singing performing This order is to be commended and might readily be followed if primary instruction was given in classes which being less expensive than private tuition would admit of more frequent lessons and the services of a competent teacher Classes afford the best opportunity for training the ear to accuracy in pitch the eye to steadiness in reading notes the mind to comprehension of key relationships form and rhythmic movement and the heart to a realization of the beauty and purport of music In classes the stimulating effect of healthy competition may be felt an impulse given to writing notes transposing phrases and melodies strengthening musical sentiment and refining the taste Both the French Solfege method and the English Tonic Sol fa system prove the advantage of rudimentary training in classes missus John Spencer Curwen wife of the president of the London Tonic Sol fa College and daughter in law of the late reverend John Curwen founder of the movement it represents has applied to pianoforte teaching the logical principles underlying the system which are those accepted by modern educators as the psychological basis of all education From her point of view the music lesson may be made attractive from the moment the pupil is placed at the instrument Time is taught by her as a mental science with the pulse as the central fact She proceeds rhythmically rather than arithmetically making constant appeals to that within the child which is associated with music As the ear is expected to verify every fact whether of time or pitch she deems essential to profitable practicing the daily supervision of some person who understands the teacher s requirements Many times a child who can readily explain the relative value of every note and dot will stumble in the time movement when confronted with a mixture of the same notes and dots This is because no mental connection has been established between the mechanical time sign and its sound which is the outgrowth of instinctive impulses Time confusion may also be caused by confiding too implicitly in loud and persistent counting instead of trusting to the intelligently guided rhythmic pulse The keenness of musical perception in the blind is a subject of frequent comment It is due to the fact that neither outer nor inner ear is distracted by the organ of sight and the mind is compelled to concentrate itself with peculiar intensity on the tone images aroused for its contemplation When one of the senses is weakened or lost the others become strong through the requirements made on them This shows how much may be gained in music study by throwing responsibility on those faculties it is desirable to develop There are numerous promising schemes for class work in operation in our own country some of them offering excellent advantages to the student From the music study in our public schools valuable results ought to come in time Thus far unfortunately it is too often conducted by teachers who are themselves without trained musical ability and who permit their pupils to shout rather than sing music of an inferior order to the accompaniment of a piano wretchedly out of tune The much beloved Phillips Brooks once said A school song in the heart of a child will do as much for his character as a fact in his memory or a principle in his intellect Unquestionably a love for good music inspired during the formative period is calculated to open unlimited possibilities and ours could readily be molded into a musical nation if a firm foundation for musical knowledge and appreciation were laid in our schools After the rudiments were mastered it could easily be decided which pupils had a natural bent demanding special training Where music study becomes compulsory the blunder of permitting the compulsion to be felt must be avoided Socrates of old in Plato s Republic advised making early education a sort of amusement Those who heed his counsel should not forget that in turning music study altogether into play work there is danger of weakening the will The tottering footsteps should be guided wisely as well as tenderly in the first approach to the Temple of Art that the pupil may learn to walk as well as to observe and think independently We most prize beauty that we are able to discern for ourselves We gain strength by intelligently conquering our own problems and perplexities Nothing is impossible as Mirabeau has said for one who can will The aim of music study is to know music to gain a correct conception of how it should sound and so as far as possible to make it sound This aim can never be reached by the mere cultivation of technical adroitness Untold sacrifices are made to day to what becomes the unrighteous mammon of technique when the mechanical side of practice is exalted above its interpretative aspects Schumann deemed brilliancy of execution only valuable when it served a higher purpose That higher purpose is to reach and express the soul of music Unless enriched by it all mechanism is dead It is not desirable that every one should perform acrobatic feats on some musical instrument or indulge in vocal pyrotechnics but it is desirable to extract music out of whatever technique may be attained Instead of racing onward with feverish haste to ever increased technical skill at the expense of other development it were well for the student to pause until each composition attacked be it but an exercise could be interpreted with accuracy intelligence and feeling We should then have more musicianly players and singers We should more often be brought under the magic spell of exquisitely shaded tone that may make a simple little melody alive with beauty Illustration BRAHMS A grave blunder of our present music study is the neglect of ensemble playing and singing Some of the noblest music written is for part singing and for two or more instruments Much profit and delight will be the result of making its acquaintance Four and eight hand piano arrangements of the great overtures and symphonies too are valuable and enjoyable They prepare the way for an appreciation of an orchestral performance of these masterpieces and broaden the musical horizon Where there are several music students in a family it is a pity for them to confine their efforts exclusively to the piano although every musician should have some knowledge of this household instrument That is a happy home whose members are united by the playing or singing of noble concerted music It is an absurd error to suppose that fine soloists cannot succeed in ensemble work or as accompanists Those who fail have been poorly grounded in their art They may give dazzling performances of works bristling with technical difficulties yet make a sad failure of some slow tender movement that calls for musicianly understanding and delicate treatment The truth is the requirements for an artistic accompanist or for artistic concerted work are the same as for an artistic soloist well directed musical aptitude love of art an ear attuned to listening and large experience in sight reading The music pupils public recital contributes no little to the blunders of the day in music study Especially with piano pupils the work of the year is likely to be shaped with reference to the supreme occasion when results attained may be exhibited in the presence of assembled parents and friends The popular demand being for the mastery of technique showy pieces are prepared whose mechanism so claims the attention that the principles underlying both technics and interpretation are neglected Well controlled hands fingers wrists and arms with excellent manipulation of the keyboard may be admired at the recital but little of that effective playing is heard which finds its way to the hearer s heart A dead monotony will too often recall the letter that killeth because devoid of the spirit that giveth life Sounding notes even sounding them smoothly clearly and rapidly is not necessarily making music and a succession of them without warmth and coloring is truly as inartistic as painting without shading If it were more commonly realized that it is an essential part of the music teacher s vocation to train the mind and the emotions and through them the will and the character there would be a higher standard for the music pupils recital No one would be permitted to play or sing in public who could not give an artistic as well as a technically correct performance Music students should lose no opportunity to hear the best music both vocal and instrumental Heard with understanding ears one good concert is often worth a dozen lessons yet many students know nothing in music beyond what they have practiced themselves or heard their fellow students give at rehearsals or recitals If they attend concerts at all it is rather to observe some schoolmaster method in their own particular branch than actually to enjoy music Trying to gain a musical education without a wide acquaintance with the literature of music is like attempting to form literary taste without knowing the world s great books To bathe in the glow of the mighty masterpieces of genius neutralizes much that is evil In music they are the only authoritative illustrations between notes and the ideals they represent they form the models and maxims by means of which we approach a knowledge of music In view of hearing good music breathing a musical atmosphere and being glorified into artists vast numbers of American girls seek foreign musical centres They are apt to go without suitable equipment mental or musical and with inadequate pecuniary provisions They expect to attain in a few months what they are doomed to discover would take years to accomplish and cannot fail to suffer for the blunder Many of them return home disappointed in their aims and ruined in health Many of them are stranded in strange lands A crusade should be started against indiscriminate going abroad for music study without thorough preparation in every respect The fact is a free true fearless hero such as Wagner found in his Siegfried is needed to slay with his invincible sword the dragon of sordid materialism and awaken the slumbering bride of genuine art A storm god is wanted to swing his hammer and finally dissipate the clouds that obscure the popular vision Some one has called for a plumed knight at the literary tournament with visor down lance in hand booted and spurred for the fight with prevalent errors One is equally needed at the musical tournament III The Musical Education That Educates There is a musical education that educates a musical education that refines strengthens broadens the character and the views that ripens every God given instinct and force It arouses noble thoughts and lofty ideals it quickens the perceptions opening up a world of beauty that is closed to the unobservant it bears its fortunate possessor into a charmed atmosphere where inspiring elevating influences prevail Its aim is nothing short of the absolutely symmetrical development of the spiritual intellectual and physical being in view of making the well rounded musician the well balanced individual The profits derived from a musical education are proportionate to the investment Careless work an utter disregard of principles in other words a mere dabbling with music will afford but superficial results It is precisely the same with a haphazard pursuit of any branch of art science or literature Through music the soul of mankind may be elevated the secret recesses of thought and feeling stirred and every emotion of which the individual is capable made active In order to attain its full benefits it is imperative to use it as a profound living force not as a mere surface decoration The musician ever shrouded in himself must cultivate his inmost being that he may turn it outward said Goethe A true musical education provides culture for the inmost being It tends to enlarge the sympathies enrich social relations and invest daily life with gracious dignity Those who gain it beautify their own lives and thus become able to make the world seem more beautiful to others Those who are never able to give utterance to the wealth of thought and feeling it has aroused in their hearts and imaginations are still happy in possessing the store After all our main business in art as in life is to strive Honest effort meets with its own reward even where it does not lead to what the world calls success It has been said that he who sows thoughts will reap deeds habits character The force of these words is exemplified in the proper study of music which results in a rich harvest of self restraint self reliance industry patience perseverance powers of observation retentive memory painstaking effort strength of mind and character To possess these qualities at their best abundant thought must be sown Merely to ring changes on the emotions will not elevate to the heights The musical education that educates makes of the reasoning powers a lever that keeps the emotions in their rightful channel Aristotle who dominated the world s thought for upwards of two thousand years attributed his acquirements to the command he had gained over his mind Fixedness of purpose steady undivided attention mental concentration accuracy alertness keen perception and wise discrimination are essential to achievement This is true of giant minds it is equally true of average intellects The right musical education will conduce to these habits Musical education without them must inevitably be a failure Music study is many sided To make it truly educative it must be pursued from both theoretical and practical standpoints It should include technical training which affords facility to express whatever a person may have for expression intellectual training which enables a person to grasp the constructive laws of the art its scope history and aesthetics with all that calls into play the analytic and imaginative faculties and spiritual development which imparts warmth and glow to everything Even those who do not advance far in music study would do well as they proceed to touch the art on as many sides as possible in view of enlarging the musical sense sharpening the musical perception concentrating and multiplying the agencies by virtue of which musical knowledge and proficiency are attained Truth said Madox Brown the Pre Raphaelite is the means of art its end the quickening of the soul Music does more than quicken the soul it reveals the soul makes it conscious of itself Springing from the deepest and best that is implanted in man it fertilizes the soil from which it uprises Both beauty and truth are essential to its welfare As Hamilton W Mabie has said We need beauty just as truly as we need truth for it is as much a part of our lives We have learned in part the lesson of morality but we have yet to learn the lesson of beauty This must be learned through the culture of the aesthetic taste a matter of slow growth which should begin with the rudiments and is best fostered in an atmosphere saturated with good music Too much stress cannot be laid on the importance of hearing good music When it falls on listening ears it removes all desire for anything coarse or unrefined Constant companionship with it prepares the ear to hear the inner being to receive and cannot fail to bring forth fruit The creations of noble minds form practical working forces in shaping character purifying taste and elevating standards A literary scholar cannot be made of one who has not been brought into close touch with the productions of the great masters in literature nor an artistic painter or sculptor of one who has never known a great painting or piece of statuary Neither can a thorough musician be made of any one who is ignorant of the master works of music It is well to realize with Goethe that the effect of good music is not caused by its novelty but strikes more deeply the more we are familiar with it The human voice being practically the foundation of music and the first music teacher every well educated musician should be able to use it and should have a clear understanding of its possibilities and limitations no matter what his specialty may be Composers and performers alike will derive benefit from some dealing with the vocal element Vocal culture is conducive to health and aids in gaining command of the nerves and muscles They who profit by it will best understand the varied nuances of intonation expression and coloring of which music is capable and will learn how to make a musical instrument sing Likewise vocalists should familiarize themselves with other domains of their art and should be able to handle some instrument more especially the piano or organ that they may be brought into intimate relations with the harmonic structure of music To make music study most effective the scientific methods of other departments of learning must be applied to it For the supreme good of both art and science need to be brought into close fellowship Art is the child of feeling and imagination science the child of reason Art requires the illumination of science science the insight of art Music combines within itself the qualities of art and science As a science it is a well ordered system of laws and cannot be comprehended without knowledge of these As an art it is its business to awaken a mood to express a sentiment it is knowledge made efficient by skill thought effect taste and feeling brought into active exercise No art no science affords opportunity for more magnificent mental discipline than music Moreover a careful earnest study of the art furnishes a stimulus to activity in other fruitful fields Although subordinate to life and character it contributes freely to these and its best results come from life that is exceeding rich and character that is strong true and enlightened through broad general culture The musical education that educates develops something more than mere players and singers it develops thinking feeling musicians in whom large personalities may be recognized Stephen A Emory of Boston whose studies in harmony are widely used and who left behind him an influence as a teacher that is far reaching divined the true secret of musical education from the rudiments upward and expressed his views freely and clearly He thought it indispensable for the musician to make music the central point of his efforts and equally indispensable for him to have as supports to this knowledge and theories from countless sources It must be as a noble river he said of the pursuit of music though small and unobserved in its source winding at first alone its tortuous way through opposing obstacles yet ever broadening and deepening fed by countless streams on either hand till it rolls onward in a mighty sweep at once a glory and a blessing to the earth To conquer music a musician must have conquered self As music can no more be absolutely conquered than self the effort to gain the mastery over both necessitates a continual healthy earnest striving which makes the individual grow in strength grace and happiness That musician has been rightly trained whose every thought mood and feeling every muscle and fibre have been brought under the subjection of his will Professor Huxley uttered the following words that may well be applied to a musical education That man I think has had a liberal education who has been so trained in his youth that his body is the ready servant of his will and does with ease and pleasure all the work that as a mechanism it is capable of whose intellect is a clear cold logic engine with all its parts of equal strength and in smooth working order ready like the steam engine to be turned to any kind of work and spin the gossamers as well as forge the anchors of the mind whose mind is stored with knowledge of the great and fundamental truths of nature and of the laws of her operations one who no stunted ascetic is full of life and fire but whose passions are trained to come to feel by a vigorous will the servant of a tender conscience who has learned to love all beauty whether of nature or of art to hate all vileness and to respect others as himself The correctness of applying the last clause to the musician will be questioned by those who delight in enlarging on the petty jealousies of musicians It will be learned in time that these foibles belong only to petty musicians and that no one knows better how to respect others as himself than one who has enjoyed the privilege of the musical education that educates IV How to Interpret Music Certain learned college professors were once heard discussing methods of literary criticism and interpretation They spoke of external and technical forms and how magnificently these were illustrated in the world s acknowledged masterpieces of literature Every work read or studied they decided should be carefully weighed measured and analyzed and should be judged solely by the maxims and laws deduced from classical standards The critical faculty must never be permitted to slumber or to sleep Above all the literary student should beware of trusting to impressions Not a word was uttered in regard to the contents of the masterpieces in question the special emotions the overwhelming passions they revealed the mighty experiences of which they were the result Nothing was said about the source of a great book in the life of its author or its value as a record of what many minds and hearts of an entire epoch have thought felt and desired The learned professors were so deeply concerned with what they considered the demands of strict scholarship that they lost sight of the spirit which animates every true work of art To them literature consisted of words phrases sentences figures of speech classical allusions and well constructed forms They regarded it apparently as an artificial product compounded according to traditional and cautiously prescribed recipes An aged man of letters present one who was characterized by his ripe scholarship his richly cultured personality sat listening in silence to the conversation Suddenly he rose up and in vibrant tones exclaimed Where hath the soul of literature fled its vital part If we are to trample upon our impressions the best that is within us will be chilled Of what avail is education if it does not lead to the unfolding of our God given intuitions Friends if the trend of modern criticism be to divorce literature from life the throb and thrill of great art will soon cease to be felt The lesson conveyed by these words may with equal propriety be applied to the field of music Viewing certain current tendencies the cultured musician is often moved to wonder where the soul of music has fled The critical faculty is keenly alive to day but musical criticism shorn of its better part musical appreciation can never lead to the insight requisite for true musical interpretation Observation and perception intellectual discernment and spiritual penetration are essential to gain insight into a great musical composition until its musical ideas the very grade and texture of its style are absolutely appropriated In his Death in the Desert Robert Browning tells of the three souls that make up the soul of man the soul which Does the soul which Knows feels thinks and wills and the soul which Is and which constitutes man s real self Appreciation of music requires the utmost activity of all three souls The more we are the broader our culture the more we think feel and know the more we will find in music doctor Hiram Corson commenting on Browning s words says the rectification or adjustment of what Is that which constitutes our true being should transcend all other aims of education If this fact were more generally accepted and enforced it could soon no longer be said that few persons reach maturity without the petrifaction of some faculty of mind and heart Every faculty we possess needs to be keenly alive for the interpretation of the best in music One who is accustomed to earnest thinking quick observation and sympathetic penetration will see hear and feel much that utterly escapes those whose best faculties have been permitted to lie dormant or become petrified The interpreter of music must have vital knowledge of the inner spiritual element of every work of art he attempts to reproduce His imagination must be kindled by it and musical imagination is infinitely more precious than musical mechanism It is by no means intended to underrate technical proficiency No one can be a satisfactory exponent of music whose technique is deficient however profound may be his musicianly understanding and feeling At the same time with every tone every measure mechanically correct a performance may fail to move the listener because it lacks warmth and glow Only they can make others feel who feel themselves but sentiment is apt to be confounded with sentimentality unless it is guided by a scholarly mind The more feeling is spiritualized with thought the nobler it will be Heart and head need to operate in company with well controlled physical forces in order that a fine interpretation of music may be attained Faultless technique in the service of a lofty ideal indeed ceases to be mechanical and becomes artistic A musical work of art originates in the deep well of the fertile imagination of genius and can only be drawn forth when the composer is in that highly exalted frame of mind we call inspiration The theme or musical subject is a vital spark of the divine fire and has flashed unbidden into his consciousness demanding undivided attention for its logical development With infinite care he molds and groups the musical factors which are his working forces and of which he has both an intuitive and a practical knowledge The manifold forms he fashions all combine for one purpose and lead persistently to one grand climax from which they may return to the repose whence they came Unity in diversity is the goal he sets before himself All aglow though he is with the joy of artistic production he dare not permit his mind to waver from the task in hand Music is not to be played with and the labor of composition is no trifling matter It demands the keenest mental activity the most profound mental concentration It demands consecration The composer thinks and works in tones in an ideal realm far removed from the realities of the external world His business is to bring his theme to its most magnificent unfolding treating it with absolute definiteness that his intention may be perfectly clear It is the business of the interpreter of music to be so thoroughly acquainted with the elements of which music is composed that he can promptly recognize the color complexion and individual character of every interval chord and chord combination every consonance and dissonance every timbre and nuance and every degree of phrasing and rhythm He must have so complete a mastery of his materials and working forces that his imagination may be influenced unimpeded by the emanations from the composer s imagination which animate the moving forms he commands It is his business to respond with his whole being to the appeal of the musical masterpiece he attempts to interpret and so express the emotions aroused by it from their slumbers in his own bosom that a responsive echo may be found in the bosoms of the listeners A most ingeniously constructed music box with the presentation of a complicated piece of music may fail to move a heart that will be stirred to its depths by a simple song into which the singer s whole soul has been thrown Though the mind of the inventive genius be a mystery that may not fully be explained its product is within the grasp of the intelligent seeker The aesthetic principles of musical construction rest on certain elementary laws governing both the human organism and the phenomena of sound and may become familiar to any one who is capable of study In the same way the established canons of musical expression observed by the skilful artist consciously or unconsciously are traceable to natural causes Without realizing the inherent properties of music as well as its technical possibilities and limitations we cannot know the art The tonal language is one that is not translatable into words It is composed of an infinite variety of tone forms now sharply contrasted now gradually blending into one another all logically connected all tending to form a perfect whole The profusion of harmonic melodic dynamic and rhythmic changes it brings forth invests it with a meaning far beyond that of words a musical meaning Every masterpiece of music clothes in tonal form some idea which originated in the composer s mind To the interpreter it is given to invest it with living sound Chords and chord combinations all have their individual characteristics Some cause satisfaction for instance others unrest When a chord of the dominant seventh is heard the educated musician knows that a solution is demanded The unspoiled ear and taste instinctively feel something unfinished and are disturbed if it be not followed by a return to the key chord Where the faculties are dormant or petrified its significance will be unobserved The story is told of a young lady whose musical education had been utterly hollow and false but who having been overwhelmed with flattery for her voice and her singing was deluded into a belief that she was destined to shine as a star on the operatic stage She consulted the famous basso Karl Formes who good naturedly had her sing for him He perceived at once that she possessed neither striking talent nor adequate training As a supreme test he struck on the piano a chord of the dominant seventh and asked the young aspirant for dramatic glory what she thought it meant Presuming it to be incumbent upon a prospective prima donna to have uppermost in her mind the grand passion she replied in a sentimental tone Love Promptly Karl Formes sounded the solution to the chord There is your answer quoth he I ask a question and it is thought I speak of love Go home my good girl and seek some other avocation You have a fair voice but you are tone deaf You can never make a musician A favorite motto of the piano teacher Leschetitzky is Think ten times before you play once If this rule were more generally observed we should have better interpreters of music A great composition should completely occupy mind and heart before it is attacked by fingers or voice In that case it would be analyzed as to its form its tonal structure its harmonic relations its phrasing and rhythms and its musical intention would become luminous The interpreter would understand where accents and other indications of expression should occur and why they should so occur and would be able in however feeble a way to find and reveal the true heart music that lies hidden in the notes It is never too early in a course of music study to consider the requirements of musical expression Persistent observance of them will inevitably quicken the artistic sense The rules to which they have given rise are for the most part simple and easily explained For obvious reasons all musical interpretation is expected to imitate song as closely as possible The human voice the primitive musical instrument in moments of excitement ascends to a higher pitch increasing in intensity of tone as it sweeps upward Consequently every progression from lower to higher tones whether played or sung demands a crescendo unless some plainly denoted characteristic of the music calls for different treatment A descending passage as a return to tranquillity requires a decrescendo The outpouring of a feeling toward its object whether to the endless heavens or forth into the boundless world or toward a definite limited goal resembles the surging the pressing onward of a flood said the great teacher doctor Adolph Kullak Reversely that feeling which draws its object into itself has a more tranquillizing movement that especially when the possession of the object is assured appeases itself in equable onward flow toward the goal of a normal state of satisfaction The emotional life is an undulating play of up surging and subsidence of pressing forward beyond temporal limitations and of resigned yielding to temporal necessities The crescendo and decrescendo are the means employed in music for the portrayal of this manifestation of emotional life Another important matter which may to a great extent be reduced to rule is that of accentuation Through it a tone picture is invested with animation and a clue is given to the disposition of tonal forms Accents are always required to mark the entrance of a theme a phrase or a melody Where there are several voices or parts as in a fugue each voice denotes its appearance with an accent Every daring assertion hazarded in music as in speech demands special emphasis Dissonances need to be brought out in such prominence that they may not appear to be accidental misconceptions and that confident expectation may be aroused of their ultimate resolution Accentuation must be regulated by the claims of musical delivery At all times too gentle an accent is without effect too glaring an accent is to be condemned Hans von Buelow strenuously advised young musicians to cultivate their ears and strive to attain musical beauty in what is termed phrasing which he regarded as the real beginning of greatness in a performer Phrasing and time keeping are two of the prime essentials in musical delivery and cannot be neglected with impunity Time may well be called the pulse of music Upon some occasions the pulse beats more rapidly than others It is incumbent on the interpreter of music to ascertain the harmonic and other causes which determine the tempo of a musical composition as well as those which make slight variations from it admissible Among other points to be noted is the fact that sudden transition from repose to restless activity calls for an accelerando while the reverse requires a rallentando It is absolutely imperative for one who would interpret music to cultivate the memory The musician who cannot play or sing without notes is compelled to expend a large amount of mental activity on reading these and will find it difficult to heed the manifold requirements of musical expression and delivery of which a few hints have here been given A musical composition is never thoroughly understood until it has been intelligently memorized One who can play or sing without notes is as free as a bird to soar aloft in the blue ether of musical imagination Illustration FRANZ LISZT Every interpreter of music longs for appreciative listeners and young musicians in especial often lament the lack of these It is well to remember that the genuine musical artist is able to create an atmosphere whose influences may compel an average audience to sympathetic listening A good plan for the artist is to be surrounded in fancy with an audience having sensitively attuned ears intellectual minds and warm throbbing hearts Music played in private before such an imaginary audience will gain in quality and when repeated before an actual public will hold that public captive We have it from Ruskin that all fatal faults in art that might otherwise be good arise from one or other of three things either from the pretence to feel what we do not the indolence in exercise necessary to obtain the power of expressing the Truth or the presumptuous insistence upon or indulgence in our own powers and delights with no care or wish that they should be useful to other people so only they should be admired by them These three fatal faults must be avoided or conquered by the person who would interpret music V How to Listen to Music Listening is an art It requires close and accurate attention sympathy imagination and genuine culture Listening to music is an art of high degree Many derive exquisite enjoyment from it for music is potent and universal in its appeal To listen intelligently to music is an accomplishment few have acquired A great painting presents itself as a completed whole before the observer s eye It holds on the canvas the fixed place given it by the master from whose genius it proceeded No intermediary force is needed to come between it and the impression it makes on the beholder Music on the contrary must be aroused from the written or printed page to living tone by the hand or voice of the interpreter and but a fragment at a time can be made perceptible to the listener s ear Like a panorama it comes and goes before the imagination its kaleidoscopic tints and forms now sharply contrasted now almost imperceptibly graduated one into the other but all shaping themselves into a logical union stamped with the design of a creative mind Properly to inspect the successive musical images and grasp their significance in parts and as a whole demands keen mental alertness Many are content to listen to music for the mere sensuous impression it creates as it wraps itself about the inner being lulling a perturbed spirit to rest or awakening longing and aspiration joy and sadness according to the nature of the music and the hearer s mood Some even take pleasure in formulating into words the sensations evoked by the ebb and flow of the tonal waves and fancy they are thus deriving intellectual profit from music From both ways of listening helpful results may accrue but by no means the greatest Music is far beyond words and in attempting to translate it into these we miss its musical meaning the best that is in it As listeners we derive our highest aesthetic and intellectual satisfaction from the ability to follow even anticipate the composer s intention now finding our expectations fulfilled now being agreeably disappointed Failure to catch the opening phrase and preliminary rhythms of the composition makes it impossible to appreciate the tonal forms into which they develop Nor may the mind linger over any one part if we would grasp the work as an unbroken whole That musical creation alone can afford the noblest delights that prompts and rewards the act of thus closely following the composer s thought An instance of absolute knowledge of music appears in an anecdote told of Johann Sebastian Bach When he was present at the performance of a fugue and one of his two most musical sons was with him he would as soon as the theme was heard whisper what devices and developments he thought should be introduced If the composer had conformed to his idea of construction he would jog his son to call attention to the fact Otherwise his exceeding modesty and reverent comprehension of the difficulties of the art made him the most lenient of critics Few have reached the luminous heights this master of masters trod Even a well cultivated ear and taste may often be baffled by the intricacies of a fugue symphony or other great work of musical art heard for the first time The best listener beyond the pale of genius will at times feel as one astray in a labyrinth of beauty to which for the moment no clue appears A single representation will rarely suffice to reveal the full worth of a masterpiece of music By hearing it often by admitting it or some reproduction of it to our own fireside we will become familiar with its contents and learn truly to know it Those who are fortunate enough to have been surrounded from childhood up by the choicest gems of the tonal language and whose minds are of the deceptive order will insensibly attain a refinement of taste and delicacy of perception no learned dissertation on music could afford At the same time an acquaintance with the materials and elements of which the art is composed and with the laws that govern them is essential to enable even one who has heard much to gain the complete enjoyment that comes from understanding Confident as we are that Prometheus captured his fire from Heaven we ought to learn something of its attributes before we accept it at his hands that we may be able to distinguish a true spark of the divine flame from a phosphorescent will o the wisp The idea so largely accepted that music is an unfathomable mystery like all half truths has wrought much mischief and has greatly retarded musical progress in social life Behind the Divine Art as behind Religion lies the inscrutable mystery of Life and in both there is a Holy of Holies only the consecrated may enter Before the portals of this are reached there is a broad fertile field for intellectual activity that all may work to advantage preparing the way to the inner sanctuary The musician is continually confronted with fresh evidence of the popular ignorance even among students of music in regard to the outward form and inner grace of what is conceded to be the most popular of all arts In a roomful of professed music lovers a definition of counterpoint was recently called for and no one present could give an intelligent answer This led to a discussion of musical questions which resulted in the disclosure that not one of the company could define melody harmony or rhythm or had the slightest conception of the meaning of the simplest component parts of the art in whose service they were making plentiful sacrifices Some knowledge of these things is absolutely imperative not alone to the student but to one as well who would listen intelligently to music Sound and motion constitute the essence of music Its raw materials are an infinitely rich mass of musical sounds that bear within themselves the possibility of being molded into form By the musical builders of the past they have been carefully considered mathematically calculated and have finally resolved themselves into a recognized scale composed of tones and half tones These are the composer s plastic resources He shapes them precisely as the sculptor fashions the pliable clay with which he strives to bring his ideal to realization All sounds are the result of atmospheric vibrations affecting the ear Musical sound or tone is produced by regular vibrations and differs from mere noise whose vibrations are irregular and confused The pitch of a musical tone rises in proportion with the rapidity of the vibrations that produce it Tones may be perceived by the human ear ranging from about sixteen vibrations in a second to nearly forty thousand more than eleven octaves Only about seven octaves are used in music The science of acoustics is full of interesting facts of this kind and is of profound value to any one who would gain an insight into the structure of music It is unfortunately much neglected The prime elements of music are Melody Harmony and Rhythm They are perhaps as little realized as its raw materials Melody is a well ordered succession of musical sounds heard one at a time and selected from a defined accepted series not taken at random from a heterogeneous store Harmony is a combination of well ordered sounds heard simultaneously and with suitable concord or agreement Rhythm is measured movement or the periodical recurrence of accent and signifies symmetry and proportion Melody unexhausted and inexhaustible is the initial force or as doctor Marx has called it the life blood of music Within itself it bears the germ of harmony and rhythm A succession of tones without harmonious and rhythmic regulation would be felt to lack something Melody has been designated the golden thread running through the maze of tone by which the ear is guided and the heart reached Helmholtz styled it the essential basis of music In a special sense it is artistically constructed song The creation of an expressive melody is a sure mark of genius Harmony arranges musical sounds with reference to their union and is regulated by artistic and aesthetic rules and requirements It has endless modes of transforming inverting and intensifying its materials thus continually affording new means of development All the intervals and chords used in music had to be discovered one by one It often took more than a century to bring into a general use a chord effect introduced by some adventuresome spirit Our scale intervals are the slowly gained triumphs of the human mind Modern music did not emerge from the darkness of the past until harmony as we know it came into active being Both melody and harmony are controlled by rhythm It is the master force of the musical organism Before man was the ebb and flow of nature had its rhythm On this elementary rhythm the one model music finds in nature the inventive mind of man has builded the wonderfully impressive art rhythms existing in the masterpieces of music Melodies are made up of smaller fragments known as motives phrases and periods or sentences all of which are judiciously repeated and varied and derive their individuality from the characteristics of their intervals and rhythms A motive is the text of a musical composition the theme of its discourse The most simple motive with proper handling may grow into a majestic structure In Beethoven s Fifth Symphony three G flats in eighth notes followed by an E flat in a half note form a text as of Fate knocking at the door which when developed leads to tremendous conflict ending in victory Those notes that repeat and modify the motive and are combined under one slur constitute the phrase which is similar to a clause in a sentence of words A period or sentence in music comprises a musical idea complete in itself though of a nature to produce when united with other harmonious ideas a perfect whole A simple melody is usually composed of eight measures or some number divisible by four There are exceptions as in God Save the King our America of which the first part contains six measures the second part eight Habit and instinct show us that no melody can end satisfactorily without some cadence leading to a note belonging to the tonic or key chord Very often the first part of a melody will end on a note of the dominant chord from which a progression will arise in the second part that leads satisfactorily to a concluding note in the tonic chord Counterpoint literally point against point is the art of so composing music in parts that several parts move simultaneously making harmony by their combination During the fifteenth sixteenth seventeenth and eighteenth centuries the masters of counterpoint shaped the musical materials in use to day So anxious were they to attain perfection of form they often lost sight of the spirit which alone can give vitality to musical utterances The great Bach infused this into his fugues the highest manifestation of the contrapuntal or polyphonic music of old Meanwhile the growth of the individual led to the growth of monophony in music in which one voice stands out prominently with an accompaniment of other voices Its instrumental flower was reached in the symphony Melody reigns supreme in monophonic music Both the canon and the fugue form a commonwealth in which all voices are rated alike Viewed rightly this suits the modern democratic instinct and there is to day a tendency to return to polyphonic writing It is individuality in union In the hands of genius it affords the most refined kind of harmony A thorough knowledge of counterpoint shows the mistake of regarding it merely as a dull relic of a dead past It is a living reality that if correctly studied leads to a solid dignified flowing style rich in design and independent in its individuality Counterpoint said a critic in the London Musical News shows the student how to make a harmonic phrase like a well shaped tree of which every bough twig and leaf secures for itself the greatest independence the fullest measure of light and air Composer interpreter and listener may all profit by a comprehension of counterpoint From its infancy modern music has been affected by two perpetually warring factors the Classical and the Romantic The first demands reverence for established ideals of formal beauty the second striking a note of revolt compels recognition of new ideals As in all other departments of art and life progress in music comes through the continual conflict between the conservative and the radical forces A position viewed as hazardous and unsuitable in one age becomes the accepted position of the next and those who have been denounced as musical heretics come to be regarded as musical heroes Very often the untutored public trusting to natural instincts will be in advance of the learned critic in accepting some startling innovation Old laws may pass away new laws may come but the eternal verities on which all manifestations of Truth and Beauty are based can never cease to be The scientific laws of music are transitory because they have been tentatively constructed during the gradual development of the musical faculty says W H Hadow in his valuable Studies in Modern Music No power in man is born at full growth it begins in germ and progresses according to the particular laws that condition its nature Hence it requires one kind of treatment at one stage another at another both being perfectly right and true in relation to their proper period But there are behind these special rules certain psychological laws which seem so far as we can understand them to be coeval with humanity itself and these form the permanent code by which music is to be judged The reason why in past ages the critics have been so often and so disastrously at fault is that they have mistaken the transitory for the permanent the rules of musical science for the laws of musical philosophy An acquaintance with form as the manifestation of law is essential to an intelligent hearing of music The listener should have at least a rudimentary knowledge of musical construction from the simplest ballad to the most complex symphony Having this knowledge it will be possible to receive undisturbed the impressions music has to give and to distinguish the trivial and commonplace from the noble and beautiful The oftener good music is heard the more completely it will be appreciated Therefore they listen best to music who hear the best continually The assertion is often heard that a person must be educated up to an enjoyment of high class music Certainly one who has heard nothing else must be educated down to an enjoyment of ragtime with its crude rhythms We know a true poem to the extent to which our spirits respond to the spiritual appeal it makes says doctor Hiram Corson It is the same with a true musical composition We must take something to it in order to receive something from it Beyond knowledge comes the intuitive feeling which is enriched by knowledge Through it we may feel the breath of life the spiritual appeal which belongs to every great work of art and which must forever remain inexplicable VI The Piano and Piano Players When Pythagoras Father of Musical Science some six centuries before our era marked and sounded musical intervals by mathematical division on a string stretched across a board he was unconsciously laying the foundation for our modern pianoforte How soon keys were added to the monochord as this measuring instrument was named cannot positively be ascertained 
7447_91186_000002_000002	train-clean-100	We may safely assume it was not slow in adopting the rude keyboard ascribed by tradition to Pan pipes and applied to the portable organ of early Christian communities 
none	none	After the tenth century the development of the monochord seems to have begun in earnest 
7447_91186_000003_000001	train-clean-100	Two or more strings of equal length are now divided and set in motion by flat metal wedges attached to the key levers and called tangents because they touched the strings 
7447_91186_000003_000002	train-clean-100	In response to the demand for increased range as many as twenty keys were brought to act on a few strings commanding often three octaves 
none	none	Guido d Arezzo the famous sight reading music teacher of the eleventh century advised his pupils to exercise the hand in the use of the monochord showing his knowledge of the keyboard 
7447_91186_000003_000004	train-clean-100	The keyed monochord gained the name clavichord 
7447_91186_000003_000005	train-clean-100	Its box like case was first placed on a table later on its own stand and increased in elegance 
7447_91186_000003_000006	train-clean-100	Not until the eighteenth century was each key provided with a separate string 
none	none	No unimped triumphal progress can be claimed for the various claviers or keyboard instruments that came into use Dance music found in them a congenial field thus causing many serious minded people to regard them as dangerous tempters to vanity and folly 
7447_91186_000004_000002	train-clean-100	In the year fifteen twenty nine Pietro Bembo a grave theoretician wrote to his daughter Helena at her convent school As to your request to be allowed to learn the clavier I answer that you cannot yet owing to your youth understand that playing is only suited for volatile frivolous women whereas I desire you to be the most lovable maiden in the world 
7447_91186_000004_000003	train-clean-100	Also it would bring you but little pleasure or renown if you should play badly while to play well you would be obliged to devote ten or twelve years to practice without being able to think of anything else 
7447_91186_000004_000004	train-clean-100	Consider a moment whether this would become you 
7447_91186_000004_000005	train-clean-100	If your friends wish you to play in order to give them pleasure tell them you do not desire to make yourself ridiculous in their eyes and be content with your books and your domestic occupations 
none	none	A different view was entertained in England during Queen Elizabeth s reign where claviers were in vogue styled virginals because as an ancient chronicle explained virgins do most commonly play on them The virginal was usually of oblong shape often resembling a lady s workbox 
7447_91186_000005_000001	train-clean-100	With the Virgin Queen it was a prime favorite although not named expressly for her as the flattering fashion of the time led many to assume 
7447_91186_000005_000002	train-clean-100	If she actually did justice to some of the airs with variations in the Queen Elizabeth Virginal Book she must indeed have been proficient on the instrument 
7447_91186_000005_000003	train-clean-100	Quaint doctor Charles Burney seventeen twenty six eighteen fourteen declares in his History of Music that no performer of his day could play them without at least a month s practice 
7447_91186_000006_000000	train-clean-100	The clavier gave promise of its destined career in the Elizabethan age Shakespeare immortalized it and William Byrd fifteen forty six sixteen twenty three became the first clavier master 
none	none	He and doctor John Bull fifteen sixty three sixteen twenty eight says Oscar Bie in his great work on The Clavier and Its Masters represent the two types which run through the entire history of the clavier 
7447_91186_000006_000002	train-clean-100	Byrd was the more intimate delicate spiritual intellect Bull the untamed genius the brilliant executant the less exquisitely refined artist 
7447_91186_000006_000003	train-clean-100	It is significant that these two types stand together on the threshold of clavier art Bull had gained his degree at Oxford the founding of whose chair of music is popularly attributed to Alfred the Great 
7447_91186_000007_000000	train-clean-100	As early as the year fourteen hundred claviers had appeared whose strings were plucked by quills attached to jacks at the end of the key levers 
7447_91186_000007_000001	train-clean-100	To this group belonged the virginal or virginals the clavicembalo the harpsichord or clavecin and the spinet 
7447_91186_000007_000002	train-clean-100	Stops were added as in the organ that varied effects might be produced and a second keyboard was often placed above the first 
7447_91186_000007_000003	train-clean-100	The case was either rectangular or followed the outlines of the harp a progenitor of this clavier type 
7447_91186_000007_000004	train-clean-100	It was often highly ornamented and handsomely mounted 
7447_91186_000007_000005	train-clean-100	Each string from the first had its due length and was tuned to its proper note 
7447_91186_000008_000000	train-clean-100	The secular music principle of the sixteenth century that called into active being the orchestra led also to a desire for richer musical expression in home and social life than the fashionable lute afforded and the clavier advanced in favor 
7447_91186_000008_000001	train-clean-100	In France by fifteen thirty the dance that promoter of pure instrumental music was freely transcribed for the clavier 
7447_91186_000008_000002	train-clean-100	Little more than a century later Jean Baptiste Lully sixteen thirty three sixteen eighty seven extensively employed the instrument in the orchestration of his operas and wrote solo dances for it 
none	none	Francois Couperin sixteen sixty eight seventeen thirty three now well nigh forgotten although once mentioned in the same breath with Moliere wrote the pioneer clavier instruction book 
7447_91186_000009_000001	train-clean-100	In it he directs scholars how to avoid a harsh tone and how to form a legato style 
7447_91186_000009_000002	train-clean-100	He advises parents to select teachers on whom implicit reliance may be placed and teachers to keep the claviers of beginners under lock and key that there may be no practicing without supervision 
7447_91186_000009_000003	train-clean-100	His suggestions deserve consideration to day 
7447_91186_000010_000000	train-clean-100	He was the first to encourage professional clavier playing among women His daughter Marguerite was the first woman appointed official court clavier player 
none	none	He composed for the clavier little picture tunes designed to depict sentiments moods phases of character and scenes from life He fashioned many charming turns of expression introduced an occasional tempo rubato foreshadowed the intellectual element in music and laid the corner stone of modern piano playing 
7447_91186_000010_000003	train-clean-100	Jean Philippe Rameau sixteen eighty three seventeen sixty four continued Couperin s work 
7447_91186_000011_000000	train-clean-100	What is generally recognized as the first period of clavier virtuosity begins with the Neapolitan Domenico Scarlatti sixteen eighty three seventeen fifty seven and Johann Sebastian Bach sixteen eighty five seventeen fifty the German of Germans 
7447_91186_000011_000001	train-clean-100	The style of Scarlatti is peculiarly the product of Italian love of beautiful tone and what he wrote though without depth of motive kept well in view the technical possibilities of the harpsichord 
7447_91186_000011_000002	train-clean-100	His Cat s Fugue and his one movement sonatas still appear on concert programmes 
7447_91186_000011_000003	train-clean-100	In a collection of thirty sonatas he explained his purpose in these words Amateur or professor whoever thou art seek not in these compositions for any profound feeling 
none	none	They are only a frolic of art meant to increase thy confidence in the clavier 
7447_91186_000012_000000	train-clean-100	In Germany with grand old Father Bach the keyboard instrument was found capable of mirroring a mighty soul 
none	none	The germ of all modern musical design lies in his clavier writings It has been aptly said of this master of masters that he constructed a great university of music from which all must graduate who would accomplish anything of value in music Men of genius from Mozart to the present time have extolled him for the beauty of his melodies and harmonies the expressiveness of his modulations the wealth spontaneity and logical clearness of his ideas and the superb architecture of his productions Students miss the soul of Bach because of the soulless mechanical way in which they deface his legacy to them His Twelve Little Preludes alone contain the materials for an entire system of music The Inventions too often treated as dry as dust studies are laden with beautiful figures and devices that furnish inspiration for all time As indicated by their title which signifies a compound of appropriate expression and just disposition of the members they were designed to cultivate the elements of musical taste as well as freedom and equality of the fingers 
7447_91186_000013_000003	train-clean-100	His Well Tempered Clavichord has been called the pianist s Sacred Book 
none	none	Its Preludes and Fugues illustrate every shade of human feeling and were especially designed to exemplify the mode of tuning known as equal temperament introduced into general use by Bach and still employed by your piano tuner and mine 
7447_91186_000014_000000	train-clean-100	Forkel his biographer has finely said that Bach considered the voices of his fugues a select company of persons conversing together 
none	none	Each was allowed to speak only when there was something to say bearing on the subject in hand 
7447_91186_000014_000002	train-clean-100	A highly characteristic motive or theme as significant as the noblest typical phrase developing into equally characteristic progressions and cadences is a striking feature of the Bach fugue 
7447_91186_000014_000003	train-clean-100	His Suites exalted forever the familiar dance tunes of the German people 
none	none	His wonderful Chromatic Fantasia and Fugue ushered the recitative into purely instrumental music 
7447_91186_000015_000000	train-clean-100	As a teacher he was genial kind encouraging and in every respect a model 
none	none	He obliged his pupils to write and understand as well as sound the notes In his noble modesty he never held himself aloof as superior to others 
7447_91186_000015_000003	train-clean-100	When pupils were discouraged he reminded them how hard he had always been compelled to work and assured them that equal industry would lead them to success 
7447_91186_000015_000004	train-clean-100	He gave the thumb its proper place on the keyboard and materially improved fingering 
7447_91186_000015_000005	train-clean-100	Tranquillity and poetic beauty being prime essentials of his playing he preferred to the more brilliant harpsichord or spinet the clavichord whose thrilling tremulous tone owing to its construction was exceedingly sensitive to the player s touch 
7447_91186_000015_000006	train-clean-100	The early hammer clavier or pianoforte invented in seventeen eleven by the Italian Cristofori who derived the hammer idea from the dulcimer did not attract him because of its extreme crudeness Nevertheless it was destined to develop into the musical instrument essential to the perfect interpretation of his clavier music 
7447_91186_000016_000000	train-clean-100	His son and pupil Philipp Emanuel Bach seventeen fourteen seventeen eighty eight proceeding on the principles established by his illustrious father prepared the way for the modern pianist

7447_91186_000016_000004	train-clean-100	From him Haydn gained much that he later transferred to the orchestra 
none	none	Impulse to the second period of clavier virtuosity was given by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart seventeen fifty six seventeen ninety one and Muzio Clementi seventeen fifty two eighteen thirty two Mozart who led the Viennese school developed the singing style of playing and the smooth flowing legato Leaving behind him the triumphs of his wonder boyhood with spinet and harpsichord he boldly entered the public concert hall with the pianoforte now greatly advanced by the improvements of Silbermann 
7447_91186_000017_000003	train-clean-100	Mozart brought into use its special features showed its capacity for tone shading and for the reflection of sentiment and may well be said to have launched it on its career Tradition declares that his hand was fashioned for clavier keys and that its graceful movements afforded the eye no less pleasure than the ear 
7447_91186_000017_000004	train-clean-100	His noble technique based on his profound study of the Bachs was spiritualized by his own glowing fancy 
7447_91186_000017_000005	train-clean-100	In his playing as in his compositions every note was a pearl of great price 
7447_91186_000017_000006	train-clean-100	With his piano concertos he showed how clavier and orchestra may converse earnestly together without either having its individuality marred

7447_91186_000018_000001	train-clean-100	Without great creative genius he occupied himself chiefly with the technical problems of the pianoforte 
7447_91186_000018_000002	train-clean-100	He opened the way for the sonority of tone and imposing diction of the modern style 
none	none	His music abounded in bold brilliant passages of single and double notes He is even credited with having trilled in octaves with one hand

7447_91186_000020_000001	train-clean-100	Every accent of his dramatic music was embodied in his piano compositions 
none	none	Tones furnished him unmistakably a language that needed no commentary In him says Oscar Bie there were no tricks of technique to be admired no mere virtuosity to praise but he stirred his hearers to the depths of their hearts 
7447_91186_000020_000004	train-clean-100	Amid his storm and stress whispering and listening his awakening of the soul an original naturalism of piano playing was recognized side by side with the naturalism of his creative art

7447_91186_000029_000004	train-clean-100	Many technical means of expression were invented by him and a wholly new fingering was required for his purposes 
7447_91186_000029_000005	train-clean-100	He taught the use of a loose wrist absolute independence of the fingers and a new manipulation of the pedals 
7447_91186_000029_000006	train-clean-100	To carry out his designs the third or sustaining pedal became necessary His highest ambition in his own words was to leave to piano players the foot prints of attained advance In eighteen thirty nine he ventured on the first pure piano recital ever given in the concert hall 
7447_91186_000029_000007	train-clean-100	His series of performances in this line covering the entire range of piano literature in addition to his own compositions given entirely without notes led the public to expect playing by heart from all other artists 
none	none	As a great pianist a composer of original conceptions a magnetic conductor an influential teacher an intelligent writer on musical subjects and a devoted promoter of the interests of art he stands out in bold relief one of the grand figures in the history of music His piano paraphrases and transcriptions are poetic re settings of tone creations he had thoroughly assimilated and made his own In his original works which Saint Saens was perhaps the first to appreciate students are now beginning to discover the ripe fruits of his genius Faithful ones among the pupils who flocked about him in classic Weimar spread wide his influence but also much harm was done in his name by charlatans who calling themselves Liszt pupils cast broadcast the fallacy that piano pounding was genuine pianistic power Large hearted liberal minded whole souled in his devotion to his art and its true interests Franz Liszt seemed wholly without personal jealousies and befriended and brought into public notice a large number of artists Hector Berlioz declared that to him belonged the sincere admiration of earnest minds as well as the involuntary homage of the envious At the opening of the Baireuth Temple of German Art in eighteen seventy six Richard Wagner paid him this tribute in the midst of a joyful company Here is one who first gave me faith in my work when no one knew anything of me

7447_91186_000032_000000	train-clean-100	A rival of Liszt in the concert field especially before a Parisian public was Sigismund Thalberg eighteen twelve eighteen seventy one who visited this country in eighteen fifty five and literally popularized the piano in America

7447_91186_000034_000001	train-clean-100	Anton Rubinstein eighteen thirty eighteen ninety four was the impressionist the subjective artist who re created every composition he played 
none	none	The Russian tone colorist he has been called and the warmth and glow with which he invested every nuance can never be forgotten by those who were privileged to hear his Titanic interpretations over whose very blemishes was cast the glamor of the impassioned temperament that caused them May Heaven forgive me for every wrong note I have struck he exclaimed to a youthful admirer after one of his concerts in this country during the season of eighteen seventy two three Certainly the listener under the spell of his magnetism could forgive almost forget 
7447_91186_000034_000004	train-clean-100	Hans von Buelow eighteen thirty eighteen ninety four was the objective artist whose scholarly attainments and musicianly discernment unraveled the most tangled web of phrasing and interpretation 
none	none	His Beethoven recitals when he was in America in eighteen seventy five six were of especial value to piano students 
7447_91186_000034_000006	train-clean-100	As a piano virtuoso a teacher a conductor and an editor of musical works he was a marked educational factor in music 
7447_91186_000035_000000	train-clean-100	In his youth Johannes Brahms eighteen thirty three eighteen ninety seven the great apostle of modern intellectual music made his debut before the musical world as a brilliant and versatile pianist 
7447_91186_000035_000001	train-clean-100	Once when about to play in public Beethoven s magnificent Kreutzer Sonata with Remenyi who was the first to recognize his genius he discovered that the piano was half a tone below concert pitch and rather than spoil the effect by having the violin tuned down the boy of nineteen unhesitatingly transposed the piano part which he was playing from memory into a higher key 
none	none	The fire energy and breadth of his rendering together with the splendid musicianship displayed by this feat deeply impressed the great violinist Joachim who was present and who became enthusiastic in his praise 
7447_91186_000035_000003	train-clean-100	Schumann on making his acquaintance proclaimed the advent of a genius who wrote music in which the spirit of the age found its consummation and who at the piano unveiled wonders 
7447_91186_000035_000004	train-clean-100	By others he has been called the greatest contrapuntist after Bach the greatest architectonist after Beethoven the man of creative power who assimilated the older forms and invested them with a new life entirely his own 
7447_91186_000035_000005	train-clean-100	His piano works are a rich addition to the pianist s store but whoever would unveil their beautiful proportions all aglow as they are with sacred fire must have taken a master s degree

7447_91186_000038_000000	train-clean-100	Perhaps the most famous piano teacher of recent times is Theodore Leschetitzky of Vienna 
7447_91186_000038_000001	train-clean-100	His method is that of common sense based on keen analytical faculties and he never trains the hand apart from the musical sense

none	none	Of some of those who are familiar figures in our musical centres it has been said that Teresa Carreno learned from Rubinstein the art of piano necromancy that Rosenthal is an amazing technician whose interpretations lack tenderness that De Pachmann is on terms of intimacy with Chopin and that Rafael Joseffy the disciple of Tausig combines all that is best in the others with striking methods of his own Great is the piano splendid its literature many its earnest students numerous its worthy exponents That it is so often made a means of empty show is not the fault of the piano it is due to a tendency of the day that calls for superficial glamor Herbert Spencer was not so wrong as some of the critics seem to think when in his last volume he said that teachers of music and music performers were often corrupters of music Those certainly are corrupters of music who use the piano solely for meaningless technical feats VII The Poetry and Leadership of Chopin

7447_91187_000004_000000	train-clean-100	In these few bold strokes one who knew him by virtue of close art and race kinship presents an incomparable outline sketch of the Polish tone poet who explored the harmonic vastness of the pianoforte and made his own all its mystic secrets 
7447_91187_000005_000000	train-clean-100	Born and bred on Poland s soil son of a French father and a Polish mother Frederic Chopin eighteen oh nine eighteen forty nine combined within himself two natures each complementing the other both uniting to form a personality not understood by every casual observer 
7447_91187_000005_000001	train-clean-100	He is described as kind courteous possessed of the most captivating grace and ease of manner now inclined to languorous melancholy now scintillating with a joyous vivacity that was contagious 
7447_91187_000005_000002	train-clean-100	His sensitive nature like the most exquisitely constructed sounding board vibrated with the despairing sadness the suppressed wrath and the sublime fortitude of the brave haughty unhappy people he loved and with his own homesickness when afar from his cherished native land 
7447_91187_000006_000000	train-clean-100	Patriot and tone poet in every fibre of his being his genius inevitably claimed as its own the soul s divinest language pure music unfettered by words 
7447_91187_000006_000001	train-clean-100	The profound reserve of his nature made it peculiarly agreeable to him to gratify the haunting demands of his lyric muse through the medium of the one musical instrument that lends itself in privacy to the exploitation of all the mysteries of harmony 
7447_91187_000006_000002	train-clean-100	Strong conviction in regard to his own calling and clear perception of the hidden powers and future mission of the piano early compelled him to consecrate to it his unfaltering devotion 
7447_91187_000006_000003	train-clean-100	He evolved from its more intimate domain effects in sympathy with those of the orchestra yet purely individual 
7447_91187_000006_000004	train-clean-100	He enriched it with new melodic harmonic and rhythmic devices adapted to itself alone and endowed it with a warmth of tone coloring that spiritualized it for all time 
7447_91187_000007_000000	train-clean-100	To the piano he confided all the conflicts that raged within him all the courage and living hope that sustained him 
7447_91187_000007_000001	train-clean-100	In giving tonal form to the deep things of the soul which are universal in their essence and application he embodied universal rather than merely individual emotional experiences and thus unbared what was most sacred to himself without jarring on the innate reticence which made purely personal confidences impossible 
7447_91187_000007_000002	train-clean-100	Although his mode of expression was peculiarly his own he had received a strong impulse from the popular music of Poland 
none	none	As a child he had become familiar with the folk songs and dances heard in the harvest fields and at market and village festivals 
7447_91187_000007_000004	train-clean-100	They were his earliest models on them were builded his first themes 
none	none	As Bach glorified the melodies of the German people so Chopin glorified those of the Poles 
7447_91187_000007_000006	train-clean-100	The national tonality became to him a vehicle to be freighted with his own individual conceptions 
7447_91187_000008_000000	train-clean-100	 I should like to be to my people what Uhland was to the Germans he once said to a friend 
7447_91187_000008_000001	train-clean-100	He addressed himself to the heart of this people and immortalized its joys sorrows and caprices by the force of his splendid art 
none	none	Those who have attempted to interpret him as the sentimental hero of minor moods the tone poet in whom the weakness of despair predominates have missed the leaping flames the vivid intensity and the heroic manliness permeated with genuine love of beauty that animated him 
7447_91187_000008_000003	train-clean-100	True art softens the harshest accents of suffering by placing superior to it some elevating idea 
7447_91187_000008_000004	train-clean-100	So in the most melancholy strains of his music one who heeds well may detect the presence of a lofty ideal that uplifts and strengthens the travailing soul 
7447_91187_000008_000005	train-clean-100	It has been said of him that he had a sad heart but a joyful mind 
none	none	The two teachers of Chopin were Adalbert Zwyny a Bohemian violinist who taught the piano and Joseph Elsner a violinist organist and theorist
7447_91187_000009_000001	train-clean-100	 From Zwyny and Elsner even the greatest dunce must learn something he is quoted as saying 
7447_91187_000009_000002	train-clean-100	Neither of these men attempted to hamper his free growth by rigid technical restraints 
7447_91187_000009_000003	train-clean-100	Their guidance left him master of his own genius at liberty to soar like the lark into the ethereal blue of the skies He respected them both 
7447_91187_000009_000004	train-clean-100	A revering affection was cherished by him for Elsner to whom he owed his sense of personal responsibility to his art his habits of serious study and his intimate acquaintance with Bach 
7447_91187_000010_000000	train-clean-100	There is food for thought in the fact that this Prince Charming of the piano whose magic touch awakened the Sleeping Beauty of the instrument of wood and wires never had a lesson in his life from a mere piano specialist 
7447_91187_000010_000001	train-clean-100	Liszt once said Chopin was the only pianist he ever knew that could play the violin on the piano 
none	none	If he could do so it was because he had harkened to the voice of the violin and resolved to show that the piano too could produce thrilling effects 
7447_91187_000010_000003	train-clean-100	In the same way he had listened to the human voice and determined that the song of his own instrument should be heard 
7447_91187_000010_000004	train-clean-100	Those who give ear to the piano alone will never learn the secret of calling forth its supreme eloquence 
7447_91187_000011_000000	train-clean-100	We can see and hear this Raphael of Music at the piano so many and so eloquent have been the descriptions given of his playing 
7447_91187_000011_000001	train-clean-100	It is easy to fancy him sweeping the ivory keys with his gossamer touch that enveloped with ethereal beauty the most unaccustomed of his complicated chromatic modulations 
none	none	We can feel his individuality pulsating through every tone evoked by those individualized fingers of his as they weave measures for sylphs of dreamland or summon to warfare heroes of the ideal world We are entranced by his luxuriant tone coloring induced to a large extent by his original management of the pedals We marvel at his softly whispered yet ever clearly distinct pianissimo at the full round tone of its relative fortissimo that was never harsh or noisy and at all the exquisitely graded nuances that lay between with those time fluctuations expressive of the ebb and flow of his poetic inner being No wonder Balzac maintained that if Chopin should but drum on the table his fingers would evoke subtle sounding music 
7447_91187_000012_000000	train-clean-100	And what an example he has left for teachers 
7447_91187_000012_000001	train-clean-100	Delicately strung as he was he must often have endured tortures from the best of his pupils but so thoroughly was he consecrated to his art that he never faltered in his efforts to lift those who confided in him to the aerial heights he had found 
7447_91187_000012_000002	train-clean-100	A vivid picture of his method of teaching is given in the lectures on Frederic Chopin s Works and Their Proper Interpretation by the Pole Jean Kleczynski 
7447_91187_000013_000000	train-clean-100	The basis of this method consisted in refinement of touch for the attainment of which a natural easy position of the hand was considered by Chopin a prime requisite 
7447_91187_000013_000001	train-clean-100	He prepared each hand with infinite care before permitting any attempt at the reproduction of musical ideas 
7447_91187_000013_000002	train-clean-100	In order to place it to advantage he caused it to be thrown lightly on the keyboard so that the five fingers rested on the notes E F sharp G sharp A sharp and B and without change of position required the practice of exercises calculated to insure independence 
none	none	The pupil was instructed to go through these exercises first staccato effected by a free movement of the wrist an admirable means of counteracting heaviness and clumsiness then legato staccato then accented legato then pure legato modifying the power from pp to ff and the movement from andante to prestissimo 
7447_91187_000014_000000	train-clean-100	He was exceedingly particular about arpeggio work and insisted upon the repetition of every note and passage until all harshness and roughness of tone were eliminated 
7447_91187_000014_000001	train-clean-100	 Is that a dog barking he was known to exclaim to an unlucky pupil whose attack in the opening arpeggio of a Clementi study lacked the desired quality 
7447_91187_000014_000002	train-clean-100	A very independent use of the thumb was prescribed by him 
7447_91187_000014_000003	train-clean-100	He never hesitated about placing it on a black key when convenient and had it passed by muscle action alone in scales and broken chords whose zealous practice in different forms of touch accent rhythm and tone were demanded by him 
none	none	Individualization of the fingers was one of his strong points and he believed in assigning to each of them its appropriate part In a good mechanism he said the aim is not to play everything with an equal sound but to acquire beautiful quality of touch and perfect shading Of prime importance in his eyes was a clear elastic singing tone one whose exquisite delicacy could never be confounded with feebleness Every dynamic nuance he exacted of fingers that fell with freedom and elasticity on the keys and he knew how to augment the warmth and richness of tone coloring by setting in vibration sympathetic harmonics of the principal notes through judicious employment of the damper pedal 
7447_91187_000016_000000	train-clean-100	By precept and example he advocated frequent playing of the preludes and fugues of Bach as a means of cultivating musical intelligence muscular independence and touch and tone discrimination 
7447_91187_000016_000001	train-clean-100	His musical heroes were Bach and Mozart for they represented to him nature strong individuality and poetry in music 
7447_91187_000016_000002	train-clean-100	At one time he undertook to write a method or school of piano playing but never progressed beyond the opening sentences 
none	none	A message directly from him would have been invaluable to students and might have averted many unlucky misapprehensions of himself and his works 
7447_91187_000016_000004	train-clean-100	Those of his contemporaries who have harkened with rapture to his playing have declared that he alone could adequately interpret his tone creations or make perfectly intelligible his method 
none	none	Pupils of his and their pupils have faithfully endeavored to transmit to the musical world the tradition of his individual style 
7447_91187_000016_000006	train-clean-100	The elect few have come into touch with his vision of beauty but it has been mercilessly misinterpreted by thousands of ruthless aspirants to musical honors in the schoolroom the students recital and the concert hall 
none	none	Whoever plays Chopin with sledge hammer fingers will deaden all sense of his poetry charm and grace 
7447_91187_000017_000001	train-clean-100	Whoever approaches him with weak sentimentalism will miss altogether his dignity and strength 
none	none	It has been said of him that he was Woman in his tenderness and realization of the beautiful and Man in his energy and force of mind 
7447_91187_000017_000003	train-clean-100	The highest type of artist and human being is thus represented 
7447_91187_000017_000004	train-clean-100	To interpret him requires simplicity purity of style refined technique poetic imagination and genuine sentiment not fitful fictitious sentimentality 
7447_91187_000018_000000	train-clean-100	In regard to the much discussed tempo rubato of Chopin many and fatal blunders have been made 
7447_91187_000018_000001	train-clean-100	Players without number have gone stumbling over the piano keys with a tottering spasmodic gait serenely fancying they are heeding the master s design 
7447_91187_000018_000002	train-clean-100	Reckless out of time playing disfigures what is meant to express the fluctuation of thought the soul s agitation the rolling of the waves of time and eternity 
7447_91187_000018_000003	train-clean-100	The rubato from rubare to rob represents a pliable movement that is certainly as old as the Greek drama in declamation and was employed in intoning the Gregorian chant 
7447_91187_000018_000004	train-clean-100	The recitative of the sixteenth century gave it prominence and it passed into instrumental music 
7447_91187_000018_000005	train-clean-100	Indications of it in Bach are too often neglected 
7447_91187_000018_000006	train-clean-100	Beethoven used it effectively Chopin appropriated it as one of his most potent auxiliaries 
none	none	In playing he emphasized the saying of Mozart Let your left hand be the orchestra conductor while his right hand balanced and swayed the melody and its arabesques according to the natural pulsation of the emotions
7447_91187_000018_000008	train-clean-100	 You see that tree exclaimed Liszt its leaves tremble with every breath of the wind but the tree remains unshaken that is the rubato There are storms to which even the tree yields 
7447_91187_000018_000009	train-clean-100	To realize them to divine the laws which regulate the undulating tempest tossed rubato requires highly matured artistic taste and absolute musical control 
7447_91187_000019_000000	train-clean-100	Too sensitive to enjoy playing before miscellaneous audiences whose unsympathetic curiosity he declared paralyzed him Chopin was at his best when interpreting music in private for a choice circle of friends or pupils or when absorbed in composition 
7447_91187_000019_000001	train-clean-100	It is not too much to say for him that he ushered in a new era for his chosen instrument spiritualizing its timbre liberating it from traditional orchestral and choral effects and elevating it to an independent power in the world of music 
none	none	Besides enriching the technique of the piano he augmented the materials of musical expression contributing fresh charms to those prime factors of music melody harmony and rhythm New chord extensions passages of double notes arabesques and harmonic combinations were devised by him and he so systematized the use of the pedals that the most varied nuances could be produced by them 
7447_91187_000020_000000	train-clean-100	In melody and general conception his tone poems sprang spontaneously from his glowing fancy but they were subjected to the most severe tests before they were permitted to go out into the world 
none	none	Every ingenious device that gave character to his exquisite cantilena and softened his most startling chord progressions was evolved by the vivid imagination of this master from hitherto hidden qualities of the pianoforte Without him neither it nor modern music could have been what it is 
7447_91187_000020_000003	train-clean-100	An accentuation like the ringing of distant bells is frequently heard in his music

shaped the character of Volker the Fiddler in the Nibelungen Lay had a glowing vision of the power of music and of the violin Players on the videl or fiddle abounded in the days of chivalry but Volker glorified by genius rises superior to his fellow minstrels The inspiring force of his martial strains renewed the courage of way worn heroes His gentle measures pure and melodious as a prayer lulled them to sorely needed rest And what a wonderful bow he wielded It was mighty and long fashioned like a sword with a keen edged outer blade and in his good right hand could deal a deft blow on either side Ever ready for action was he and his friendship for Hagen of Tronje furnished the main elements of that grim warrior s power Together they were long invincible smiting the foe with giant strokes accompanied by music The modern German poet Wilhelm Jordan in his Sigfridsage clothes Volker with the attributes of a violin king he loved and represents him tenderly handling the violin His noble portrayal of a violinist testifies no more fully to the mission of the musician than the creation of the Nibelungen bard In August Wilhelmj once hailed by Henrietta Sontag as the coming Paganini Richard Wagner saw Volker the Fiddler living anew until death a warrior true So he wrote in a dedicatory verse beneath a portrait of himself presented to Volker Wilhelmj as a souvenir of the first Baireuth festival The idea of a magic fiddle and a wonderworking fiddler was strongly rooted in the popular imagination of many peoples through many ages Typical illustrations are the Wonderful Musician of Grimm s Fairy Tales whose fiddling attracted man and beast and the lad of Norse folk lore who won a fiddle that could make people dance to any tune he chose In Norway the traditional violin teacher is the cascade haunting musical genius Fossegrim who when suitably propitiated seizes the right hand of one that seeks his aid and moves it across the strings until blood gushes from the finger tips Thenceforth the pupil becomes a master and can make trees leap rivers stay their course and people bow to his will Those of us who were brought up on English nursery rhymes early loved the fiddle Old King Cole that merry old soul was a prime favorite notwithstanding his fondness for pipe and bowl because when he called for them he called for his fiddlers three and their very fine fiddles According to Robert of Gloucester the real King Cole a popular monarch of Britain in the third century was the father of saint Helena the zealous friend of church music The nursery satire of doubtful antiquity is our sole evidence of his devotion to the art That John who stoutly refused to sell his fiddle in order to buy his wife a gown placed the ideal above the material It is to be hoped missus John enjoyed music more than gay attire Certainly the dame who was forced to dance without her shoe until the master found his fiddling stick knew the worth of the fiddler s art It may have been from a play on the word catgut that so many of these ditties represent pussy in relation with the fiddle True fiddler s magic belonged to the cat whose fiddling made the cow jump over the moon the little dog laugh and the dish run away with the spoon Rarely accomplished too was the cat that came fiddling out of the barn with a pair of bagpipes under her arm singing Fiddle cum fee the mouse has married the humble bee Scientists tell us that crickets grasshoppers locusts and the like are fiddlers Their hind legs are their fiddle bows and by drawing these briskly up and down the projecting veins of their wing covers they produce the sounds that characterize them Was it in imitation of these small winged creatures that man first experimented with the friction of bow and strings as a means of making music Scarcely It was the result of similar instinct on a larger human scale String instruments played with a bow may be traced to a remote period among various Oriental peoples An example of their simplest form exists in the ravanastron or banjo fiddle supposed to have been invented by King Ravana who reigned in Ceylon some five thousand years ago It is formed of a small cylindrical sounding body with a stick running through it for a neck a bridge and a single string of silk or at most two strings Its primitive bow was a long hairless cane rod which produced sound when drawn across the silk Better tone was derived from strings plucked with fingers or plectrum and so the rude contrivance remained long undeveloped The European violin is the logical outcome of the appliance of the bow to those progenitors of the pianoforte the Greek monochord and lyre precisely as our music is the outgrowth of the diatonic scale developed by the Greeks from those instruments Numerous obstacles stand in the way of defining its story but it is known that from the ninth century to the thirteenth bow instruments gained in importance They divided into two classes the viol proper with flat back and breast and indented sides to which belonged the veille videl or as it has been called guitar fiddle and the pear shaped type such as the gigue and rebec The latter is what Chaucer calls the rubible Possibly an impulse was given the fiddle by the Moorish rebab brought into Spain in the eighth century but ancient Celtic bards had long before this used a bow instrument the chrotta or crwth derived from the lyre which was introduced by the Romans in their colonizing expeditions As early as five hundred sixty A D Venantius Fortunatus Bishop of Poitiers wrote to the Duke of Champagne Let the barbarians praise thee with the harp Let the British crwth sing This instrument whose name signifies bulging box was common in Britain and was used in Wales until a comparatively recent period One of its distinguishing features was an opening in the lower part for the admission of the fingers while playing A fine specimen is preserved in the South Kensington Museum corresponding well to the following description by a Welsh poet of the fifteenth century A fair coffer with a bow a girdle a finger board and a bridge its value is a pound it has a frontlet formed like a wheel with the short nosed bow across In its centre are the circled sounding holes and the bulging of its back is somewhat like an old man but on its breast harmony reigns from the sycamore melodious music is obtained Six pegs if we screw them will tighten all its chords six advantageous strings are found which in a skilful hand produce a varied sound In this same museum is a curious wedge shaped boxwood fiddle decorated with allegorical scenes and dated fifteen seventy eight doctor Burney states that it has no more tone than a violin with a sordine It is said to have been presented by Queen Elizabeth to the Earl of Leicester and bears both of their coats of arms in silver on the sounding board Besides her other accomplishments the Virgin Queen we are told was a violinist During her reign we find the violin mentioned among instruments accompanying the drama and various festivities and viols of diverse kinds were freely used Shakespeare in Twelfth Night has Sir Toby enumerate among Sir Andrew Aguecheek s attractions skill on the viol de gamboys Sir Toby s blunder for the viola da gamba a fashionable bass viol held between the knees A part was written for this instrument in Bach s saint Matthew Passion and a number of celebrated performers on it are recorded in the eighteenth century Two of these were ladies missus Sarah Ottey and Miss Ford Violers and fiddlers formed an essential part of the retinue of many monarchs in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries Charles II of England had twenty four at his court with red bonnets and flaunting livery who played for him while he was dining according to the custom he had known at the French court during his exile Place was grudgingly yielded to the violin by friends of the less insistent viol Butler in Hudibras styled it a squeaking engine Earlier writers mention the scolding violin and describing the Maypole dance tell of not hearing the minstrelsie for the fiddling Thus all along its course it has had its opponents and deriders as well as its friends The soft toned viol had deeply indented sides to permit a free use of the bow was mostly supplied with frets like a guitar and had usually from five to seven strings Its different sizes corresponded with the soprano contralto tenor and bass of the human voice An extremely interesting treble viol much in vogue in the eighteenth century was the viola d amore with fourteen strings the seven of gut and silver being supplemented by seven sympathetic wire strings running below the finger board and tuned in unison with the bowstrings vibrating harmoniously while these are played A remarkably well preserved specimen of this instrument made by Eberle of Prague in seventeen thirty three and superbly carved on pegbox and scroll is in the fine private violin collection of mister D H Carr of Milwaukee Wisconsin It is one of the few genuine viola d amores extant The owner says of it The tone is simply wonderful mellow pure and strong and of that exquisite harmony that comes from the throne of Nature I know of no other genuine viola d amore and it compares with the modern copies I have seen as a Raphael or a Rubens with some cheap lithograph These modern copies are the result of recent efforts to revive the use of this fascinating instrument A barytone of a kindred nature was the viola di bordone or drone viol so called because there was a suggestion of the buzzing of drone flies or humble bees in the tones of its sympathetic strings which often numbered as many as twenty four These violas recall the Hardanger peasant fiddle of Norway of unknown origin and antiquity whose delicate metallic under strings quaver tremulously and mysteriously when the bow sets in motion the main strings At one time every family of distinction in Britain deemed a chest of viols consisting for the most part of two trebles two altos a barytone and a bass as indispensable to the household as the piano is thought to day It was made effective in accompanying the madrigal that delightful flower of the Elizabethan age Singers not always being available for all of the difficult voice parts viols of the same compass supplied the lack It was but a step for masters of music to compose pieces marked to be sung or played thus contributing to the forces that were lifting instrumental music above mere accompaniment for song or dance When musicians make demands musical instrument makers are ever ready to meet them and the viol steadily improved One who contributed to its progress was Gasper Duiffoprugcar fifteen fourteen fifteen seventy two a luthier and mosaic inlayer known in the Tyrol in Bologna Paris and Lyons The belief that he originated the violin rests chiefly on the elaborately ornamented forgeries bearing his name the work of French imitators from eighteen hundred to eighteen forty There is an etching supposed to be a copy of a portrait of himself carved on one of his viols with this motto I lived in the wood until I was slain by the relentless axe In life I was silent but in death my melody is exquisite The words might apply to the perfected violin whose evolution was going on all through that period of literary and artistic activity known as the Renaissance When or at whose hands it gained its present form is unknown The same doubt encircles its first master player Perhaps the earliest worthy of mention is one Baltzarini a Piedmontese appointed by Catherine de Medici in fifteen seventy seven to lead the music at the French court and said to have started the heroic and historical ballet in France He is sometimes confounded with Thomas Baltzar a violinist of Lubec who in sixteen fifty six introduced the practice of shifting in London where he wholly eclipsed David Mell a much admired clockmaker fiddler although the latter as a contemporary stoutly averred played sweeter was a well bred gentleman and was not given to excessive drinking as Baltzar was His marvelous feat of running his fingers to the end of the finger board and back again with all alacrity caused a learned Oxford connoisseur of music to look if he had hoofs Notwithstanding the jovial tastes of this German he was appointed leader by Charles II of the famous violins and had the final honor of a burial in Westminster Abbey Here reposed also in due time his successor in the royal band John Banister who had been sent by the king to France for study and who was the first Englishman unless the amateur Mell be counted to distinguish himself as a performer on the violin He wrote music for Shakespeare s Tempest and was the first to attempt in London concerts at which the audience paid for seats Announcements of the initial performance September thirty sixteen seventy two read These are to give notice that at mister Banister s house now called the Musick School over against the George Tavern in White Friars this present Monday will be performed musick by excellent masters beginning precisely at four o clock in the afternoon and every afternoon for the future at precisely the same hour Credit for shaping the first violin has been given Gasparo Bertolotti fifteen forty two sixteen oh nine called Gasparo da Salo from his birthplace a suburb of Brescia that pearl of Lombardy so long a bone of contention among nations Violins were doubtless made before his time but none are known to day dated earlier than his A pretty legend tells how this skilful viol maker imprisoned in his first violin the golden tones of the soprano voice of Marietta the maiden he loved and from whom death parted him Her likeness so the story runs is preserved in the angel face by Benevenuto Cellini adorning the head The instrument thus famed was purchased for three thousand Neapolitan ducats by Cardinal Aldobrandini who presented it to the treasury at Innsprueck Here it remained as a curiosity until the French took the city in eighteen oh nine when it was carried to Vienna and sold to a wealthy Bohemian collector after whose death it came into the possession of Ole Bull Gasparo s pupil Giovanni Paolo Maggini fifteen eighty one sixteen thirty one improved the principles of violin building and gave the world the modern viola and violoncello A rich viola like quality characterizes the Maggini violin De Beriot used one in his concerts and its plaintive tone was thought well suited to his style He refused to part with it for twenty thousand francs when Wieniawski in eighteen fifty nine wished to buy it To day it would command a far higher price It is stated on authority that not more than fifty instruments of its make now exist although a large number of French imitations claim recognition While Gasparo was founding the so called Brescian school Andrea Amati fifteen twenty fifteen eighty a viol and rebec maker of picturesque Cremona began to make violins doubtless to fill the orders of his patrons He must have believed the pinnacle of fame reached when King Charles IX of France in fifteen sixty six commissioned him to construct twenty four violins twelve large and twelve small pattern They were kept in the Chapel Royal Versailles until seventeen ninety when they were seized by the mob in the French Revolution and but one of them is known to have escaped destruction Heron Allen in his work on violin making gives a picture of it obtained through the courtesy of its owner George Somers an English gentleman Its tone is described as mellow and extremely beautiful but lacking in brilliancy As the Amati brothers Antonio and Geronimo Hieronymous Amati continued their father s trade producing instruments similar to his The family reached its flower in Nicolo Amati fifteen ninety six sixteen eighty four son of Geronimo He originated the Grand Amatis and attained a purer more resonant tone than his predecessors although not always adapted to modern concert use One of his violins was the favorite instrument of the French virtuoso Delphine Jean Alard eighteen fifteen eighteen eighty eight long violin professor at the Paris Conservatoire It has been described as sounding like the melodious voice of a child heard beside the rising tide Another fine specimen was exhibited by mister J D Partello in eighteen ninety three at the World s Fair in Chicago Nicolo Amati s influence was felt in his famous pupils Foremost among these was Antonio Stradivarius sixteen forty four seventeen thirty seven whose praises have been sung by poets and whose life was one of unwavering service His first attempts were mere copies but after he was equipped with his master s splendid legacy of tools and wood his originality asserted itself His Golden period was from seventeen hundred to seventeen twenty five but he accomplished good work until death overtook him From his bench were sent out some seven thousand instruments including tenors and violoncellos Of these perhaps two thousand were violins A romance encircling this master of Cremona tells that in youth he loved his master s daughter but that failing to win her heart and hand he gave himself wholly to his work He married finally a wealthy widow whose means enabled him to pursue his avocation undisturbed by monetary anxieties His labors steadily increased the family property until as rich as Stradivarius became a common saying in Cremona Because of his achievements and his personal worth he was held in high esteem Members of royal families prelates of the church men of wealth and culture throughout Europe were his personal friends as well as his clients His handsome home with his workshop and the roofshed where he stored his wood was until recently exhibited to visitors To day not a vestige of it remains Weary of the importunities of relic seekers the Cremonese have torn it down and have banished violins and every reminder of them from the town The tone of a Stradivarius in good condition is round full and exceedingly brilliant and displays remarkable equality as the player passes from string to string doctor Joseph Joachim owner of the famous Buda Pesth Strad writes of the maker that he seems to have given his violins a soul that speaks and a heart that beats The Tuscan Strad one of a set ordered by Marquis Ariberti for the Prince of Tuscany in sixteen ninety was sold two hundred years later to mister Brandt by a London firm for Ltwo thousand Lady Halle court violinist to Queen Alexandra owns the concert Strad of Ernst eighteen fourteen eighteen sixty five composer of the celebrated Elegie and values it at ten thousand dollars A magnificent Stradivarius violin with an exceedingly romantic history belongs to Carl Gaertner the veteran violinist and musician of Philadelphia and could not be purchased at any price Another violin builder from Nicolo Amati s workshop was Andrea Guarnerius sixteen thirty sixteen ninety five whose sons Giuseppe and Pietro followed in his footsteps The family name reached its highest distinction in his nephew Giuseppe Joseph Guarnerius sixteen eighty three seventeen forty five called del Gesu because on his labels the initials I H S surmounted by a Roman cross were placed after his name indicating that he belonged to a Jesuit society This Joseph of Cremona figures in story as a man of fascinating restless personality who for weeks would squander time and talents and then set to work with a zeal equalling that of Master Stradivarius Tradition has it that he was once imprisoned for some bit of lawlessness and was saved from despair by the jailor s daughter who brought him the tools and materials required for violin building What he esteemed the masterpiece of his lonely cell he presented as a souvenir to his gentle friend The violin about which this legend is woven dated seventeen forty two was bought by Ole Bull from the famous Tarisio collection and is now the property of his son mister Alexander Bull It has an unusually rich sonorous tone and splendid carrying powers Similar qualities are attributed to the Paganini Guarnerius del Gesu seventeen forty three known as the Canon and kept under glass at the Genoa Museum mister Hart a violin authority places highest in this make the King Joseph seventeen thirty seven long in the private collections of mister Hawley Hartford Connecticut and of mister Ralph Granger Paradise Valley California and recently put on the market by Lyon Healy of Chicago An interesting Nicolo Amati pupil was Jacob Steiner sixteen twenty one sixteen eighty three a Tyrolese who although bearing a glittering title violin maker to the Austrian Emperor was harassed with financial perplexities and died insane His most noted violins were the sixteen Elector Steiners one sent to each of the Electors and four to the Emperor During his life the average price of his violins was six florins A century after his death the Duke of Orleans Louis Philippe s grandfather paid three thousand five hundred florins for one of them It is also recorded that an American gentleman on La Fayette s staff in the Revolutionary War exchanged for a Steiner fifteen hundred acres of the tract where Pittsburg now stands Mozart s violin in the Mozarteum at Salzburg is a Steiner Many violin makers did good work in the past many are achieving success to day It has been confidently asserted that the violin reached its highest possibilities in the old Brescian and Cremona days Why should this be the case The same well defined principles based on acoustics and other modern sciences that have led to the steady improvement of other musical instruments ought surely to be of some advantage to the violin Indeed who knows but the day may come when the present will be considered its golden age While the men of Cremona were still fashioning their models the want of good strings was felt This was met by Angelo Angelucci known as the string maker of Naples a man who loved music and passed much time with violinists Through his painstaking efforts such perfection was reached that Tartini who was born the same year as he sixteen ninety two could play his most difficult compositions two hundred times on the Angelucci strings whereas he was continually interrupted by the snapping of others Improvements in the bow often called the tongue of the violin are due to the house of Tourte in Paris in the eighteenth century lightness elasticity and spring coming to it from Francis Tourte junior Three eminent virtuosi Corelli Tartini and Viotti whose united careers spanned a period of one hundred fifty years prepared the way for modern methods of violin playing Arcangelo Corelli sixteen fifty three seventeen thirteen left his home in Fusignano near Bologna a young violinist for an extended concert tour His gentle sensitive disposition proving unfitted to cope with the jealousy of Lully chief violinist in France and with sundry annoyances in other lands he returned to Italy and entered the service of Cardinal Ottoboni in Rome In the private apartments of the prelate there gathered a choice company of music lovers every Monday afternoon to hear his latest compositions Besides his solos these comprised groups of idealized dance tunes with harmony of mood for their bond of union and played by two violins a viola violoncello and harpsichord They were the parents of modern Chamber Music the place of assemblage furnishing the name Refined taste and purity of tone we are told distinguished the playing of Corelli and to him are attributed the systematization of bowing and the introduction of chord playing He heads the list of musicians who protest against talking where there is music On one occasion when his patron was addressing some remarks to another person he laid down his violin and on being asked the reason said he feared the music was disturbing the conversation This did not prevent him from being held in the highest esteem After his death Cardinal Ottoboni had a costly monument erected over his grave in the Pantheon and for many years a solemn service consisting of selections from his works was performed there on the anniversary of his funeral It was during a period of retirement in the monastery of Assisi that Giuseppi Tartini sixteen ninety two seventeen seventy resolved to quit the law course in the University of Padua and seek a career with his violin He became a great master of this a composer of works still regarded as classics and a scientific writer on musical physics His letter to his pupil Signora Maddelena Lombardini contains invaluable advice on violin practice and study especially on the use of the bow and his treatise on the acoustic phenomenon known as the third sound together with his work on musical embellishments may at any time be read with profit It was after hearing the eccentric violinist Veracini that His Satanic Majesty appeared to Tartini in a dream and played for him a violin solo surpassing in marvelous character anything that he had ever heard or imagined Trying to write it down in the morning he produced his famous Devil s Sonata with its double shakes and sinister laugh a favorite of the violinist but to the composer ever inferior to the music of his dreams It is rather curious that anything of a diabolic nature should be associated with this man of amiable and gentle disposition whose care of his scholars according to doctor Burney was constantly paternal Nardini his favorite and most famous pupil came from Leghorn to Padua to attend him with filial devotion in his last illness The talents of Corelli and Tartini seem to have been combined in the Piedmontese Giovanni Battiste Viotti seventeen fifty three eighteen twenty four a man of poetic philanthropic mind whose sensitive retiring disposition unfitted him for public life Wherever he appeared he outshone all other performers yet there was constantly something occurring to wound him At the Court of Versailles he left the platform in disgust because the noisy entrance of a distinguished guest interrupted his concerto In London after his means had been crippled by the French Revolution he was accused of political intrigue While living in seclusion near Hamburg he composed some of his finest works among them six violin duets which he prefaced with the words This work is the fruit of leisure afforded me by misfortune Some of the pieces were dictated by trouble others by hope At one time he embarked in a mercantile enterprise in London his transactions being regulated by the strictest integrity but as was inevitable he soon returned to Paris and his art After he had abandoned the concert room one of his greatest pleasures was in improvising violin parts to the piano performances of his friend Madame Montegerault to the delight of all present He never had more than seven or eight pupils but his influence has been widely felt Many anecdotes are told of his kindness and generosity and it is an interesting fact that among those who sought his advice and patronage was no less a personage than Rossini It must be because genius is little understood that its manifestations have so often been attributed to evil influences The popular mind could only explain the achievements of the Genoese wizard of the bow Nicolo Paganini seventeen eighty four eighteen forty by the belief that he had sold himself body and soul to the devil who stood ever at his elbow when he played When after a taxing concert season the weary violinist retired to a Swiss monastery for rest and practice amid peaceful surroundings rumor had it that he was imprisoned for some dark deed To crown the delusion his spectre was long supposed to stalk abroad giving fantastic performances on the violin It is his apparition Gilbert Parker conjures up in The Tall Master Paganini is described as a man of tall gaunt figure melancholy countenance and highly wrought nervous temperament His successors have all profited by his development of the violin s resources the result of combined genius and labor He was practically a pioneer in the effective use of chords arpeggio passages octaves and tenths double and triple harmonics and succession of harmonics in thirds and in sixths His long fingers were of invaluable service to him in unusual stretches and his fondness for pizzicato passages may be traced to his familiarity with the twang of his father s mandolin He shone chiefly in his own compositions which were written in keys best suited to the violin Students will find all that he knew of his instrument and everything he did in his Le Stregghe The Witches the Rondo de la Clochette and the Carnaval de Venise which have been handed down precisely as he left them in manuscript Signora Calcagno who at one time dazzled Italy by the boldness and brilliancy of her violin playing was his pupil when she was seven years old The only other person who could boast having direct instructions from him was his young fellow townsman Camillo Ernesto Sivori eighteen fifteen eighteen ninety four who was in his day a great celebrity in European musical centres and who was familiar to concert goers in this country especially in Boston during the late forties and early fifties He was thought to produce a small but electric tone and to play invariably in tune To him his master willed his Stradivarius violin besides having given him in life the famous Vuillaume copy of his Guarnerius a set of manuscript violin studies and a high artistic ideal A scholarly teacher and composer for the violin was the German Ludwig Spohr seventeen eighty four eighteen fifty nine who was born the same year as the wizard Paganini and who although having less scintillant genius than the weird Italian is believed to have had a more beneficent influence over violin playing in his treatment of the instrument He set an example of purity of style and roundness of tone and raised the violin concerto to its present dignity His violin school is a standard work From the beginning of the nineteenth century to the present time the lists of excellent violinists have rapidly increased and heights of technical skill have been reached by many that would have dazzled early violin masters The special tendencies of gifted leaders have divided players into defined schools Among noted exponents of the French school may be mentioned Alard and his pupil Sarasate Dancla and Sauret Charles August de Beriot eighteen oh two eighteen seventy was the actual founder of the Belgian school whose famous members include the names of Vieuxtemps Leonard Wieniawski Thomson and Ysaye Ferdinand David eighteen ten eighteen seventy three first head of the violin department at the Leipsic Conservatory gave impulse to the German school Among his famous pupils are doctor Joseph Joachim known as one of the musical giants of the nineteenth century August Wilhelmj the favorite of Wagner and Carl Gaertner who with his violin has done so much to cultivate a taste for classical music in Philadelphia Among the many lady violinists who have attained a high degree of excellence are Madame Norman Neruda now Lady Halle Teresina Tua Camilla Urso Geraldine Morgan Maud Powell and Leonora Jackson The only violinist whose memory was ever honored with public monuments was Ole Bull eighteen ten eighteen eighty who has been called the Paganini of the North Two statues of him have been unveiled by his countrymen one in his native city Bergen Norway and one in Minneapolis Minnesota These tributes have been paid not so much to the violinist who swayed the emotions of an audience and who could sing a melody on his instrument into the hearts of his hearers as to the patriot the man who turned the eyes of the world to his sturdy little fatherland and who gave the strongest impulse for everything it has accomplished in the past half century in art and in literature Another patriot violinist was the Hungarian Eduard Remenyi eighteen thirty eighteen ninety eight who first introduced Johannes Brahms to Liszt and should always be remembered as the discoverer of Brahms The great demand of the day in the violin field as in that of other musical instruments is for dazzling pyrotechnic feats It has perhaps reached its climax in the young Bohemian Jan Kubelik whose playing has been pronounced technically stupendous In the mad rush for advanced technique the soul of music it is meant to convey is alas too often forgotten Illustration JENNY LIND IX Queens of Song Our first queen of song was Vittoria Archilei that Florentine lady of noble birth who labored faithfully with the famous Academy to discover the secret of the Greek drama It was she who furthered the success of the embryo operas of Emilio del Cavalieri late in the sixteenth century and roused enthusiasm by her splendid interpretation for Jacopo Peri s Eurydice the first opera presented to the public She was called Euterpe by her Italian contemporaries because her superb voice artistic skill musical fire and intelligence fitted her to be the muse of music Her memory has been too little honored When Lully was giving opera to France he secured the company operation of Marthe le Rochois a gifted student of declamation and song at the Paris Academie Royale de Musique for whose establishment he had obtained letters patent in sixteen seventy two So great was his confidence in her judgment that he consulted her in all that pertained to his work Her greatest public triumph was in his Armide This earliest French queen of song is described as a brunette with mediocre figure and plain face who had wonderful magnetism and sparkling black eyes that mirrored the changeful sentiments of an impassioned soul Her acting and voice control were pronounced remarkable Her superior powers unspoiled simplicity frankness and generosity are extolled by that quaint historian of the opera Dury de Noinville On her retirement from the stage in sixteen ninety seven the king awarded her a pension of one thousand livres in token of appreciation and to this the Duc de Sully added five hundred livres She died in Paris in the seventieth year of her age her home having long been the resort of eminent artists and literary people Katherine Tofts who made her debut in Clayton s Arsinoe Queen of Cyprus about seventeen oh two was the first dramatic songstress of English birth and is described by Colley Cibber as a beautiful woman with a clear silvery toned flexible soprano Her professional career brought her fortune as well as fame but was short lived In the height of her bloom her reason gave way and although judicious treatment restored it for a time she did not return to the stage As the wife of mister Joseph Smith art connoisseur and collector of rare books and prints she went to Venice where her husband was British Consul and lived in much state until her malady returning it became necessary to seclude her Wandering through the garden of her home she fancied herself the queen of former days Steele in the Tattler attributes her disorder to her stage habit of absorbing herself in imaginary great personages While missus Tofts reigned in Clayton s opera Signora Francesca Margarita de l Epine a native of Tuscany sang Italian airs before and after it Tall swarthy brusque in manner she had a voice and a style that made her famous It was she who inaugurated the custom of giving farewell concerts Meeting with brilliant success at a performance announced as her last appearance she continued says doctor Burney to sing more last and positively last times and never left England at all There was a rivalry between the two queens of song which being a novelty furnished gossip and laughter for all London Hughes that agreeable poet wrote of it Music has learned the discords of the State And concerts jar with Whig and Tory hate Retiring in seventeen twenty two with a fortune of ten thousand pounds Margarita married the learned doctor Pepusch who was enabled by her means to pursue with ease his scientific studies In his library she found Queen Elizabeth s Virginal Book and being a skilled harpsichordist she so well mastered its intricacies that people thronged to her home to hear her play London was divided by another pair of rival queens of song in seventeen twenty five six One of these Francesca Cuzzoni a native of Parma had created such a furore on her first appearance three years earlier that the opera directors who had engaged her for the season at two thousand guineas were encouraged to charge four guineas for admission and her costumes were adopted by fashionable youth and beauty Although ugly and ill made she had a sweet clear dramatic contralto with unrivalled high notes intonations so fixed it seemed impossible for her to sing out of tune and a native flexibility that left unimpeded her creative fancy Handel in whose operas she sang composed airs calculated to display her charms but she confident of her supremacy rewarded him with conduct so capricious that finding her at last intolerable he sent to Italy for the noble Venetian lady Faustina Bordoni She was elegant in figure handsome of face had an amiable disposition a ringing mezzo soprano with a compass from B flat to G in altissimo and was renowned for her brilliant execution distinct enunciation beautiful shake happy memory for embellishments and fine expression However pleased the directors may have been at first to have two popular songstresses they were soon dismayed at the fierce rivalry that sprang up between them and was fanned to flames by Master Handel himself who now composed exclusively for Faustina By increasing the salary of her more tractable rival they finally disposed of Cuzzoni who thenceforth through her exaggerated demands managed to disgust her patrons wherever she appeared Her reckless extravagance left her wholly destitute after losing her voice and her husband Signor Sandoni a harpsichord maker She passed her last years in Bologna subsisting on a miserable pittance earned by covering buttons Faustina married Adolphe Hasse the German dramatic composer and at forty seven sang before Frederick the Great who was charmed with the freshness of her voice The couple lived until seventeen eighty three the one eighty three the other eighty four years of age doctor Burney visited them when they were advanced in the seventies and found Faustina a sprightly sensible old lady with a delightful store of reminiscences and her husband a communicative rational old gentleman quite free from pedantry pride and prejudice Gertrude Elizabeth Mara Germany s earliest noted queen of song began her public career in seventeen fifty five as a child violinist of six traveling with her father Johann Schmaeling a respectable musician of Hesse Cassel In London her musical gifts proved to include a phenomenal soprano voice which developed a compass from G to E altissimo unrivalled portamento di voce pure enunciation and precise intonation She became skilled in harmony theory sight reading and harpsichord playing When she sang her glowing countenance her supreme acting and the lights and shades of her voice made people forget the plainness of her features and the insignificance of her form and stature Her rendering of Handel s airs especially I Know that My Redeemer Liveth was pronounced faultless Frederick the Great who as soon expected pleasure from the neighing of a horse as from a German songstress vanquished on hearing her retained her as court singer While in his service she became the wife of Jean Mara a handsome dissipated court violoncellist whom she loved devotedly but who led her a sorry life Returning to London later she taught singing at two guineas a lesson Upon fear being expressed that her price double that of other teachers would limit her class she said her pupils having her voice as a model could learn in half the time required for those who had only the tinkling of a piano to imitate Though she believed singing should be taught by a singer a tenderness for her own experience made her insist that the best way to begin the musical education was by having the pupil learn to play the violin When she heard a songstress extolled for rapid vocalization she would ask Can she sing six plain notes This question might afford young singers food for reflection Madame Mara passed her declining years teaching singing near her native place and died at Reval in eighteen thirty three Two years earlier on her eighty third birthday Goethe offered her a poetic tribute At a London farewell concert given by Madame Mara in eighteen oh two she was assisted by missus Elizabeth Billington who has been ranked first among English born queens of song Her pure soprano had a range of three octaves from A to A with flute like upper tones She sang with neatness agility and precision could detect the least false intonation of instrument or voice and was attractive in appearance Haydn eulogized her genius in his diary and in the studio of Sir Joshua Reynolds who was painting her portrait as saint Cecilia exclaimed You have represented missus Billington listening to the angels you should have made them listening to her It was she who introduced Mozart s operas into England She only lived to be forty eight breaking down in eighteen eighteen from the effects of brutal treatment of her second husband a Frenchman named Felissent Last of the eighteenth century queens of song was Angelica Catalani born some forty miles from Rome in seventeen seventy nine destined by her father a local magistrate for the cloister and borne beyond its walls by her magnificent voice with its compass of three octaves from G to G She is described as a tall fair woman with a splendid presence large blue eyes features of perfect symmetry and a winning smile So great was her natural facility she could rise with ease from the faintest sound to the most superb crescendo could send her tones sweeping through the air with the most delicious undulations imitating the swell and fall of a bell and could trill like a bird on each note of a chromatic passage She dazzled her listeners but left the heart untouched Her domestic life was a happy one and her husband Captain de Vallebregue adored her although he knew so little about music that once when she complained that the piano was too high he had six inches cut off its legs Surrounded by adulation at home and abroad her self conceit became inordinate tempting her to the most absurd feats of skill Her excessive love of display and lack of artistic judgment and knowledge finally led her so far astray in pitch that she lost all prestige After seventeen years of retirement she died of cholera in eighteen forty nine in Paris A few days before she was stricken with the dire epidemic Jenny Lind sought and received her blessing A queen of song who profoundly impressed her age was Giuditta Pasta born near Milan in seventeen ninety eight of Hebrew parentage For her Bellini wrote La Sonnambula and Norma Donizetti his Anna Bolena Pacini his Niobe and she was the star of Rossini s leading operas of the time Her voice a mezzo soprano at first unequal weak of slender range and lacking flexibility acquired through her wonderful genius and industry a range of two octaves and a half reaching D in altissimo together with a sweetness a fluency and a chaste expressive style Although below medium height in impassioned moments she seemed to rise to queenly stature Both acting and singing were governed by ripe judgment profound sensibility and noble simplicity She died at Lake Como in eighteen sixty five So many queens of song have reigned from the beginning of the nineteenth century to the present time that only a few brilliant names may here be mentioned Among these Henrietta Sontag was the greatest German singer of the first half of the century A distinguished traveler tells of having found her when she was eight years old in eighteen twelve sitting on a table where her mother had placed her and singing the grand aria of the Queen of the Night from the Magic Flute her voice pure penetrating and of angelic tone flowing as unconsciously as a limpid rill from the mountain side At fifteen she made her regular debut and we are told that she sang with the volubility of a bird During her four years at the Conservatory of Prague she had won the prize in every class of vocal music piano and harmony Acquitting herself with ease in both German and Italian and being exceedingly versatile she won equal renown in the operas of Weber Mozart Rossini and Donizetti Paris in special marveled at the little German who could give satisfaction in Grand Opera Her voice a pure soprano reached to D in alt with upper notes like silvery bell tones and its natural pliability was cultivated by taste and incessant study She was of medium stature elegant form with light hair fair complexion and soft expressive blue eyes that lent an enchantment to features that were not otherwise striking In demeanor she was artless unaffected and ladylike Romantic stories were continually in circulation regarding suitors for her hand As the wife of Count Rossi an attache of the Sardinian legation she retired to private life in eighteen thirty and passed many happy years with her husband in various capitols of Europe When in eighteen forty eight owing to financial shipwreck she returned to the stage her voice still charmed by its exquisite purity spirituelle quality and supreme finish In eighteen fifty two she came to America and created an immense furore in the musical and fashionable world She died of cholera in Mexico in eighteen fifty four Born the same year as Madame Sontag was Wilhelmine Schroeder Devrient one of the world s noblest interpreters of German opera and German Lieder although surpassed by others in vocal resources She grew up on the stage and was trained by her father Friedrich Schroeder a baritone singer and her mother Sophie Schroeder known as the Siddons of Germany Her dramatic soprano was capable of producing the most tender powerful truthful and intensely thrilling effects although it was not specially tractable and was at times even harsh It was she who by her magnificent interpretation of Leonore in Beethoven s Fidelio first revealed the beauty of the part to the public In Wagner s operas she appeared as Senta in the Flying Dutchman Venus in Tannhaeuser and actually created the role of Adriano Colonna in Rienzi Goethe who had earlier failed to appreciate Schubert s matchless setting to his Erl King when he heard Madame Schroeder Devrient sing it exclaimed Had music instead of words been my vehicle of thought it is thus I should have framed the legend She died in eighteen sixty Full of caprice radiating the fire of genius wayward and playful as a child Maria Felicita Malibran swept like a dazzling meteor across the musical firmament M Arthur Pougin thus epitomizes her story Daughter of a Spaniard born in France married in America died in England buried in Belgium Comedienne at five married at seventeen dead at twenty eight immortal Beautiful brilliant gay as a ray of sunlight with frequent shadings of melancholy heart full of warmth and abandon devoted to the point of sacrifice courageous to temerity ardent for pleasure as for work with a will and energy indomitable A singer without a peer and a lyric tragedienne capable of exciting the instinctive enthusiasm of the masses and the reasonable admiration of connoisseurs Pianist composer poet she drew and painted with taste spoke fluently five languages was expert in all feminine work skilled in sport and outdoor exercises and possessed of a striking originality Such was Malibran in part for the whole could never be expressed Her genius developed under the iron control of her father Manuel del Popolo Garcia who compelled to submission her seemingly intractable voice until it became sonorous superb a brilliant and fascinating contralto with a range of over three octaves reaching E in alt Her own indomitable will and exceptional artistic intelligence were prime factors in the training In her heart searching tones and passionate acting her glowing soul was felt When she was but seventeen her father seeking an ideal climate started with his family for Mexico In New York she contracted her unfortunate marriage with the French banker M Malibran She soon returned to Paris and the stage and later having obtained a divorce married the famous violinist De Beriot with whom she had a brief but happy union Madame Malibran was said to be equally at home in any known school of her time Mozart and Cimarosa Boieldieu and Rossini Cherubini and Bellini were all grasped with the same sympathetic comprehension Sontag was her rival Pasta was yet in the height of her fame but no contrasts whatever dimmed the glory of Malibran A rare personal charm added to her artistic graces mister Chorley describing her in his recollections said that she was better than beautiful insomuch as a speaking Spanish human countenance by Murillo is ten times more fascinating than many a faultless face such as Guido could paint When her death was announced in eighteen thirty six Ole Bull who had known her well exclaimed I cannot realize it A woman with a soul of fire so highly endowed so intense How I wept on seeing her as Desdemona It is not possible she is dead Pauline Garcia thirteen years younger than her remarkable sister and with a voice similar in quality also did justice to her father s rigorous discipline and became famous She married M Viardot opera director and critic and after a brilliant career as a singer gave long and valuable service as a vocal teacher in Paris She remained in the full tide of her activity until she was long past the allotted threescore years and ten It is an interesting fact that Madame Mathilde Marchesi author of a noted vocal method twenty four books of Vocalises a volume of reminiscences and other works and once famed as a singer is only five years younger than Madame Viardot Garcia but at seventy six is still teaching still shining as an authority on the art of song Singers seem often to have been long lived In truth there is that in music which is life giving A songstress whose name will always be mentioned in the same breath with that of the tenor Mario who became her husband and with whom she toured the United States in eighteen fifty four was Giulia Grisi She was born in Milan in eighteen twelve made her debut at sixteen and had an undisputed reign of over a quarter of a century Her voice a pure soprano of finest quality brilliant and vibrating spanned two octaves from C to C She possessed the gift of beauty and was said to unite the tragic inspiration of Pasta with the fire and energy of Malibran A favorite role with her was that of the Druid priestess in Norma Her delivery of Casta Diva was said to be a transcendant effort of vocalization Living to day in London at the advanced age of ninety seven is the elder brother of Malibran and Viardot Garcia Manuel Garcia the inventor of the laryngoscope author of the renowned Art of Song and teacher of Jenny Lind It was in eighteen forty one that the ever beloved Swedish Nightingale then twenty one years old sought him in Paris with a voice worn from over exertion and lack of proper management In ten months she had gained all that master could teach her in tone production blending of the registers and breath control Her own genius her splendid individuality her indefatigable perseverance did the rest in investing her dramatic soprano with that sympathetic timbre that power of expressing every phase of her artistic conception that bird like quality of the upper notes that marvelous beauty and equality of the entire range of two octaves and three quarters from B below the stave to G on the fourth line that exquisite sonority that penetrating pianissimo that unrivalled messa di voce that mastery over technique of which so much has been written and said Jenny Lind was to Sweden what Ole Bull was to Norway the inspirer of noble achievement The faithful interpreter of the acknowledged masterpieces of genius in opera oratorio and song she also freely poured forth in gracious waves the poetic the rugged and the exquisitely polished lays of the Northland making them known for the first time to thousands of people It was through her pure and noble womanhood quite as much as through her artistic excellence that she swayed the public and left so deep and enduring an impression True to the backbone in her artistic allegiance she believed that art the expression and embodiment of the spiritual principle animating it could not fail to elevate to a high spiritual and moral standard the genuine artist She had lived thirty five happy years with her husband mister Otto Goldschmidt pianist conductor and composer who still survives her when death overtook her at their home on the Malvern Hills November two eighteen eighty seven When the end drew near one of her daughters threw open the window shutters to admit the morning sun As it came streaming into the room Jenny Lind uplifted her voice and it rang out firm and clear as she sang the opening measures of Schumann s glorious To the Sunshine The notes were her last A bust of her was unveiled in Westminster Abbey in eighteen ninety four A Swedish songstress with a powerful well trained voice who before Jenny Lind won operatic laurels in foreign lands was Henrietta Nissen Saloman also a pupil of Garcia Later the brilliant Swedish soprano Christine Nilsson with a voice of wonderful sweetness and beauty reaching with ease F in alt with the most thorough skill in vocalization with dramatic intuitions expressive powers and magnetic presence charmed the public on two continents in such roles as Marguerite Mignon Elsa Ophelia and Lucia She too bore through the world with her the northern songs she had learned to cherish in childhood Still another delightful dramatic soprano from the land of Jenny Lind is Sigrid Arnoldson who has a beautiful voice winning personality and pronounced musical intelligence She is still in her prime When the name of Adelina Patti is mentioned we always think of long enduring vocal powers many farewells and high prices Catalani in her full splendor earned about one hundred thousand dollars a season Malibran s profits for eighty five concerts at La Scala ran to ninety five thousand dollars Jenny Lind received two hundred eight thousand six hundred seventy five dollars for ninety five concerts under Barnum s management Patti has had as much as eight thousand three hundred ninety five dollars for one performance and long received a fee of five thousand dollars a night In coloratura roles she has been pronounced the greatest singer of her time both in opera and concert Her voice noted for its wide compass exceeding sweetness marvelous flexibility and perfect equality has been so wonderfully well cared for that even now in her sixtieth year she enjoys singing although she rarely appears in public Her sister Carlotta was also a coloratura vocalist of exquisite technique Queens of song now pass in swift review before the mind s eye We recall Marietta Alboni the greatest contralto of the middle of the last century with a voice rich mellow liquid pure and endowed with passionate tenderness the only pupil of Rossini Theresa Tietiens with her mighty dramatic soprano whose tones were softer than velvet and her noble acting Marie Piccolomini a winning mezzo soprano Parepa Rosa with her sweet strong voice and imposing stage presence Pescha Leutner the star of eighteen fifty six Louisa Pyne the English Sontag Parodi pupil of Pasta Etelka Gerster whose beautiful soprano could fascinate if it could not awe Pauline Lucca whose originality artistic temperament and intelligence placed her in the front rank of dramatic sopranos and many others Amalie Materna dramatic soprano at the Vienna Court Theatre from eighteen sixty nine to eighteen ninety six with great musical and dramatic intelligence with a voice of remarkable compass volume richness and sustaining power vibrant with passionate intensity and with a noble stage presence proved to be Wagner s ideal Bruennhilde and introduced the role at Bayreuth in eighteen seventy six She was also the creator of Kundry at the same place in eighteen eighty two She aroused unbounded enthusiasm as Elizabeth in Tannhaeuser and as Isolde in Tristan and Isolde She is not forgotten by those who heard her in various cities of this country The same may be said of Marianne Brandt who sang the part of Kundry at the second Parsifal representation at Bayreuth having been Frau Materna s alternate in eighteen eighty two With her superbly rich deep toned voice and her splendid vocal and dramatic control she thrilled her audiences in her Wagnerian roles in Beethoven s Fidelio and in all she attempted whether in opera or concert She was a magnificent horsewoman and was perhaps the only Bruennhilde who was able to give full play on the stage to her Valkyrie charger It is told by an eye witness that before a first appearance in a German city she was borne furiously on the stage at rehearsal by her spirited prancing steed and when she drew him up suddenly rearing and pawing the air near the footlights the members of the orchestra dropped their instruments and fled affrighted It was not long however before she succeeded in winning their confidence and all went well at the evening performance Six more radiant queens of song whose reign belongs to these modern times must be mentioned in conclusion Sembrich Nordica Calve Melba Sanderson and Eames These are but a few of the many present day rulers in the realms of song Marcella Sembrich a coloratura soprano from Galicia has a light penetrating marvelously sweet and exceedingly flexible voice with an almost perfect vocal mechanism As one of her admirers has said her tones are as clear as silver bells and there is something buoyant and jubilant in her mode of song With her genuine art and engaging personality she holds her audiences entranced and being wise enough to keep within her special genre she always succeeds as an actress She is a pupil of the Lampertis father and son studied the piano with Liszt becoming an excellent interpreter of Chopin and is no mean violinist An American born in Farmington Me Lillian Nordica pursued her vocal and musical studies at the New England Conservatory in Boston and after much experience in church concert and oratorio singing studied for the opera in Milan under Signor Sangiovanni She made her operatic debut at Brescia in Traviata and in Paris as Marguerite in Faust Her superb liquid soprano is pure smooth and equal throughout its entire large compass She combines feeling with that artistic understanding which regulates it and has been pronounced one of the most conscientious and intelligent singers of the day An admirable actress and extremely versatile she has been successful in Mozart s operas and has won high renown in her Wagnerian roles Emma Calve a Spaniard possessed of all a Spaniard s fire thrills bewilders her hearers though the more thoughtful among them wonder if they were not moved rather by her tremendous passionate force and powerful magnetism than by her vocal and histrionic art Her voice is superb yet she often loses a vocal opportunity for dramatic effect often mars its beauty in the excitement that tears a passion to tatters Withal there is a charm to her singing that can never be forgotten by those who have heard it Her first triumph was won as the interpreter of Santuzza in Cavalleria Rusticana Mascagni himself preparing her for the role She next created a furore as Carmen and with her fascinating gestures complete abandon grace and dazzling beauty made the part one of the most original and bewitching impersonations on the stage The Australian Nellie Melba who takes her stage name from Melbourne her birthplace has been compared to Patti as a vocal technician Her voice is divine but she seems powerless to animate her brilliant singing with the warmth that glows in her eyes As an actress she completely veils whatever emotions she may feel and while her marvelous vocalization overwhelms her audiences she meets with her greatest triumphs in operas that make the least demands on the dramatic powers Massenet wrote the title roles of his Esclarmonde and his Thais for a California girl Sybil Sanderson and himself trained her for their stage presentation Her success was assured when she made her debut in the first named opera at the Opera Comique in Paris in eighteen eighty nine She has a voice of that light pure flexible quality so characteristic of our countrywomen and is an admirable actress She is a pupil of Madame Marchesi Another distinguished pupil of the same teacher is Emma Eames who was born in China of New England parents and was educated in Boston and in Paris Her voice too is exceedingly flexible is fresh pure and clear her intonations are correct and her personality most attractive She has been very successful in Wagnerian roles makes a superb Elsa and in the Meistersinger an ideal Eva During her early years on the stage her extreme calmness amounted almost to aggravating frigidity but with time she has thawed She may well be considered a conscientious artist endowed with rare musical intuition There is no possession more perishable more delicate than the human voice When one considers the joy it is capable of shedding about it the blessings that may follow in its train it seems sad to think of the reckless waste caused by its neglect and mismanagement Its life is brief enough at best Let it be cherished to the utmost In America where there are to day more fine voices among women than in any other country and where time and means are so freely expended on the musical education of girls the twentieth century should produce nobler queens of song than the world has yet known First the American girl must learn that the real things of life are more to be prized than false semblances and that genuine musical culture resting on a foundation built with painstaking care and consecrated artistic zeal is of far higher and more enduring value than the most dazzling feats of display which lack solid intrinsic support X The Opera and Its Reformers The evolution of the drama is intimately associated with that of music and both are inseparably entwined with the unfolding of the spiritual life of the human race Man is essentially dramatic by nature and both history and tradition show it to have been among his earliest instincts to express his inner emotions by action and song From this tendency arose the Greek religious drama We find it in legendary times at the altar of Dionysus master of the resources of vitality in whose train followed the Muses actual leaders and conductors of human existence At seed time and harvest festivals a rude chorus grouped about the altar told the story of the god s wanderings and adventures in simple words accompanied by gesture dance and music This expression of thought and feeling mirrored the emotions of the worshipers kindled the imagination and strengthened the innate instinct for freedom Gradually the narrative detaching itself from the choral parts fell to individual singers the acting became more and more a distinct feature of the occasion ever increasing dramatic quality characterized the song and the materials were at hand for the Greek drama so fruitful to us in its results Greek poetry in its matchless beauty may still be enjoyed by all who have powers of literary appreciation Of Greek music we know little beyond the theories which form the basis for modern musical science and the fact that it was highly esteemed Aristotle tells us that it was an essential element in Greek stage plays and their greatest embellishment Both AEschylus and Sophocles were practical musicians and composed music for their dramas Euripides less musician than poet was at least able to have the music for his works prepared under his direction Indeed words music and scenic effect were inseparably connected in the Greek dramas Illustration CORELLI The enthusiasm these aroused is indicated by the fact that travelers from distant lands undertook perilous journeys to attend the famous performances at Athens often remaining in their seats twenty four hours before the play began in order to secure desirable places Fully fifty thousand spectators could be accommodated in the Lenaean Theatre whose stage machinery would make ours seem like a toy model Many of its theatrical exhibitions cost more than the Peloponnesian War In Greek life at the period of its glory music and the drama were esteemed elevating factors in culture The supreme things of human existence were pictured in them They expressed the world view of an entire people Under Roman dominion with its corrupting slavery they degenerated into mere sources of diversion and finally became associated with evil and degrading practices For this reason and because at best they represented pagan ideals theatrical representations were discouraged by the fathers of the primitive Christian Church The dramatic instinct was not condemned and its imperative needs were appealed to in the church service which early set forth in symbols all that was too mysterious and awe inspiring for words In order further to reach the mind through the senses scenes from the Scriptures were read in the churches illustrated with living pictures and music Gradually the characters personated began to speak and to move The drama rose anew at the foot of the altar Christian priests were its reformers its guardians and its actors Designed for the amusement as well as the instruction of the gaping multitudes it was necessarily a pretty crude affair Satan was introduced as the clown and laughter was provoked at his discomfiture when routed or at the destruction of those who wilfully cast themselves into his clutches It is not strange that the pious and learned saint Augustine in the fourth century regretted the polished dramatic performances at Alexandria that in his youth had afforded him so much genuine enjoyment Among the people the church play became so popular that in the course of time it was found necessary to erect more spacious stages in the open air Thus arose the Mystery Miracle Morality and Passion Plays the direct progenitors of the Opera and the Oratorio The descent of the Opera may be traced also to another source to the secular play which persisted in the face of ecclesiastical disfavor and the ban that excluded its players from the church sacraments Strolling histriones jongleurs and minstrels passed from court to court appeared in castle yards market places or village greens recited acted sang danced and played on musical instruments They afforded a welcome means of communication with the outside world they broke up the monotony of life when events were few As modern music rests on the two pillars of the Gregorian chant and the folk song so the opera rests on the two pillars of the religious drama and the people s play During the high tide of the revival of Greek learning in Italy late in the sixteenth century a group of the aspiring young nobility of Florence gentlemen and gentlewomen adopting the dignified name of the Academy resolved to recover the much discussed music of the Greek drama The place of rendezvous was the palace of Count Bardi a member of one of the oldest patrician families in Tuscany Edifying discourse and laudable exercises were indulged in by the guests among whom were several persons of genius and learning The meetings were presided over by the host himself a poet and composer as well as a patron of the fine arts The culture of the times demanded a higher gratification for man s dramatic cravings than either rude religious or secular plays afforded Other music was required to depict the emotions than that of the contrapuntist with its puzzling intricacies So thought these ardent Hellenists and a burning zeal possessed them to mate dramatic poetry with a music that would heighten and intensify its expression and effect They who seek are sure to find even if it be not always the object of their search In the earnest quest of these reformers for dramatic truth an unexpected treasure was disclosed Vincenzo Galilei father of Galileo Galilei opened the way He was the active champion of monody in which a principal melody was intoned or sung to the accompaniment of subordinate harmonies believing that in music designed to arouse personal feeling individualism should predominate The art music of the time was polyphonic that is constructed by so interweaving melodies that harmonies resulted Of solos in our modern sense nothing was known beyond the folk songs instinctive outpourings of the human heart and these learned composers had merely used as pegs on which to hang their counterpoint Not content with giving his ideas to the world in the form of a dialogue Galilei composed two musical monologues between fifteen eighty one and fifteen ninety one to the scene of Count Ugolino in Dante s Inferno and one to a passage in the Lamentations of Jeremiah These the chroniclers tell us he sang very sweetly accompanying himself on the lute He was also a fine performer on the viola A dramatic representation at a court marriage in fifteen ninety in which the artificially constructed ecclesiastical music illy fitted the text lauding the bride s loveliness gave a new impulse to the Academy efforts Soon there was produced at court by a company of highborn ladies and gentlemen two pastoral plays Il Satiro and La Disperazione di Fileno so set to music that they could be sung or declaimed throughout The author of the text was Signora Laura Guidiccioni of the Lucchesini family renowned in her day for her poetic gifts and brilliant attainments Signor Emilio del Cavalieri was the composer and he triumphantly announced his music as that of the ancients recovered having power to excite grief pity joy and pleasure These two musical dramas as they were called contained the germs of modern opera despite their crudities of harmony and monotonous melody That noble songstress Vittoria Archilei known as Euterpe among her Italian contemporaries greatly enhanced the success of the new venture with her superb voice artistic skill musical fire and splendid intelligence She whose excellence in music is generally known as we are told and who was able to draw tears from her audience at the right moment also aroused enthusiasm for a third work of a similar nature by the same authors Il Giuco della Cieco that appeared in fifteen ninety five Besides being the first to tell the entire story of a play musically and to utilize the solo Cavalieri introduced various ornaments into vocal music and increased the demands on instrumentation He did not succeed however in satisfying the Academicians with his attempt to grasp the medium between speech and song and his choruses were thought tedious because of their employment of the intricate polyphonic style Further reform was desired This came through Jacopo Peri maestro at the Medician court and after sixteen oh one at the court of Ferrara In studying Greek dramas as he states in one of his writings he became convinced that their musical expression was that of highly colored emotional speech Closely observing diverse modes of utterance in daily life he endeavored to reproduce soft gentle words by half spoken half sung tones sustained by an instrumental bass and to express excitement by extended intervals lively tempo and suitable distribution of dissonances in the accompaniment To him may be attributed the first dramatic recitative It appeared in his Daphne a Dramma per la Musica written to text by the poet Rinuccini and privately performed at the Palazzo Corsi in fifteen ninety seven This was actually the first opera although the term was not applied to such compositions until half a century later Several solos were added by the court singer Giulio Caccini who composed a number of songs for a single voice in imitation of Galilei as a contemporary stated but in a more beautiful and pleasing style Invited three years later to produce a similar work for the festivities attending the marriage of Henry IV of France with Maria di Medici Peri wrote his Eurydice and once more Signora Archilei interpreted the leading role greatly to the composer s satisfaction It was the first opera performed in public The singing had a bald accompaniment of an orchestra placed behind the scenes and consisting of a clavicembalo or harpsichord a viola da gamba a theorbo or large lute and a flute the last being used to imitate Pan pipes in the hands of one of the characters Seven years afterward for another court marriage a musical drama was written by a man of genius who completely broke the fetters of ancient polyphony This was Claudio Monteverde then in his thirty ninth year and chapel master to the Duke of Mantua He was the first composer to use unprepared chords of the seventh dominant and diminished and to emphasize passionate situations with dissonances He invented the tremolo and the pizzicato and originated the vocal duet His keen dramatic sense enabled him to arouse interest through contrasts conspicuously characteristic passages and independent orchestral preludes interludes and bits of descriptive tone painting His opera Orfeo sixteen oh eight had an orchestra of two harpsichords two bass viols two violas di gamba ten tenor viols two little French violins one harp two large guitars three small organs four trombones two cornets one piccolo one clarion and three trumpets In Tancredi e Clorinda produced in Venice in sixteen twenty four a string quartet indicated the galloping of horses a prototype of the Ride of the Valkyries Like Abbe Liszt he took holy orders late in life without ceasing to compose At seventy four years of age when the fire of his genius burned brightly as ever he wrote his last opera L Incoronazione di Poppea It may truly be said that Monteverde was the great operatic reformer the Wagner of the seventeenth century as Gluck was of the eighteenth An epoch making event in opera history was the opening in sixteen thirty seven of the first public opera house in commercial Venice whose wealth afforded her citizens leisure to cultivate art Soon popular demand led to the erection of many Italian opera houses At the same time growing taste for magnificence of stage setting and brilliant dazzling even extravagant song effects caused neglect of Academician principles The learned and gifted Neapolitan composer Alessandro Scarlatti father of the famous harpsichordist gave an impulse in his operas during the last quarter of the century to sensuous charm and beauty of melody He invested recitative with classic value enlarged the aria and devised the da capo which became a menace to dramatic truth In France the troubadours had borne melody into the domain of sentiment and laid a solid foundation for musical growth Adam de la Halle s pastoral Robin et Marion was an actual prototype of the opera During the seventeenth century Corneille and Moliere refined the dramatic taste of their compatriots Attempts to introduce Italian opera only resulted in arousing a desire for an opera in accord with French ideals This was gratified by Jean Battiste Lully who had come to the French court from Italy in boyhood and had risen in sixteen seventy two from a subordinate position to that of chief musician Undertaking to make reforms he succeeded in giving his adopted country a national opera He established the overture gave recitative rhetorical force added coloring to the orchestra and introduced the ballet New life was infused into the traditions he left when Jean Philippe Rameau in seventeen thirty three at fifty years of age wrote his first opera He was well known as a theorist and composer and was the author of a harmony treatise in which were set forth the laws of chord inversions and derivations a stroke of genius that hopelessly entangled him in perplexities His instrumentation was more highly colored his rhythms more varied than those of his predecessor and his sincerity of purpose more evident In common with other reformers he was accused of sacrificing the pleasures of the ear to vain harmonic speculations Some of his many operas were written to works of Racine He died in seventeen sixty four in his eighty first year A century earlier the English reached the culmination of their Golden Age of musical productiveness in Henry Purcell known as the most original genius England has produced His dramatic powers were fostered by the popular masques with their gorgeous show of color and rhythm and in mere boyhood he wrote music for several of them In sixteen seventy seven when only nineteen he produced his first opera He attempted no reform but his instinct for the true relation between the accents of speech and those of melody and recitative seems to have been unerring Saturated with native English melody tingling with fertile fancy and controlled by education whether he wrote for stage church or chamber he evinced a freshness and vigor a breezy picturesqueness and a wealth of rhythmic phrases and patterns and many new orchestral devices In seventeen ten fifteen years after his early death the giant Handel began to dominate musical England flooding the stage with operas of the Italian type and finally ushering in the reign of the oratorio The delicate plant of English opera never took root Italian influence had almost caused the decline of French opera when Christopher Willibald Gluck turned to Paris in seventeen seventy four as its regenerator In Vienna twelve years earlier he had already produced his Orfeo whose calm classic grandeur seemed the embodiment of the Greek art spirit His choice of subjects indicates the enterprise on which he had embarked He sought simplicity subjugation of music to poetic sentiment dramatic sincerity and organic unity His operatic version of Racine s Iphigenie en Aulide called forth unbounded enthusiasm in the French metropolis directly after his arrival and led to the warfare with the brilliant Italian Piccini which was as hot as any Wagner controversy The homage of all time is due this man of genius for the splendid courage with which he attacked shams He claimed it to be the divine right of the dramatic composer to have his works sung precisely as he had written them and protested against the innovations that had been permitted to suit the caprices and gratify the vanity of singers It was his idea that the Sinfonia in other words the Overture or Prelude should indicate the subject and prepare the spectators for the characters of the pieces and that the instrumental coloring should be adapted to the mood of the situation thus anticipating modern procedure He prepared the way for the work of Cherubini Auber Gounod Thomas Massenet Saint Saens and others In Germany Italian opera early introduced long remained fashionable Native dramatic tastes once fostered by minnesingers and strolling players were kept alive by the singspiel or song play composed of spoken dialogue and popular song which furnished the actual beginnings of German national music drama The threshold of this was reached the sanctuary of its treasures unlocked by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart who without thought of being a reformer unconsciously infused German spirit into Italian forms It was during the last five years of his brief life from seventeen eighty six to seventeen ninety one that he produced his operatic masterpieces The Marriage of Figaro Don Giovanni and The Magic Flute His marvelous musical and poetic genius supported by profound scholarship led him into hitherto untried regions of expression and to him it was given to bring humanity on the stage splendidly depicting the inner being of each character in tones Wagner said of him that he had instinctively found dramatic truth and had cast brilliant light on the relations of musician and poet Ludwig van Beethoven the great tone poet guided by his profound comprehension of the deep things of life and his active sympathies to absolute truthfulness in delineating human passions made the next advance in his one opera Fidelio written in eighteen oh five Ranked though it is rather as a symphony for voice and orchestra than as the musical complement of a dramatic poem there is nevertheless infused into some of its chief numbers more potent dramatic expression than is found in any previous opera Thoroughly cosmopolitan in subject it is nevertheless German in that its lofty earnestness of tone offers a protest against all shallowness and sensationalism The entire story of the opera is told in tones in the overture The next German to write overtures with a deliberate purpose to foreshadow what followed was Carl Maria von Weber whose greatest opera Der Freischuetz appeared in eighteen twenty one The initial force of the German romantic school he founded his operas on romantic themes and depicted in tones the things of the weird fantastic and elfish world that kindled his imagination He has been called the connecting link between Mozart and Wagner and in many of his theories he anticipated the latter National to the core he embodied in his music the finest qualities of the folk song and noble tone painter that he was he excelled his predecessors in his employment of the orchestra as a means of dramatic characterization Richard Wagner was long regarded as the great iconoclast whose business it was to destroy all that had gone before him in art but no one ever more profoundly reverenced Bach Mozart Beethoven and Weber than he The public was persistently informed that his compositions were beyond ordinary comprehension and yet designed as they were to picture man s essential life they have slowly but surely found their way to the popular heart It was the very essence of his musical dramatic creed that to have blood in its veins and sincerity in its soul art must come from the people and be addressed to the people He chose the national myth and hero tradition as the basis of his music drama because of the universality of their content and application and because he believed they reflected the German world view Himself he regarded as the Siegfried whose mission it was to slay the dragon of sordid materialism and awaken the slumbering bride of German art Bach and Chopin had anticipated him in some of his most startling chord progressions The motives of Bach s fugues and Beethoven s sonatas and symphonies and the so called leading motives of the Frenchman Hector Berlioz had preceded his typical motives Moreover the orchestration of Berlioz had been a precursor of his orchestral tone coloring Nevertheless everything he touched was so characteristically applied by him as to produce new impressions and to emphasize the idea of music as a language So peculiarly were music and poetry blended in the delicate tissue of his genius that one seemed inseparable from the other United he believed it to be their mission to inculcate high moral lessons of patriotism and love He gave the death blow to an opera whose sole aim is to tickle the ear Many an exquisite melody of Rossini and other Italian composers will long continue to live but their productions as wholes have mostly ceased to be satisfying to those of us who have Teutonic blood in our veins The Italian opera composer who holds the highest place to day in the heart of the serious musician is that grand old man of music Giuseppe Verdi whose genius enabled him to yield four times to the spirit of the age during his long career and who in his ripe old age endeavored to give Italy what Wagner had given the German nation XI Certain Famous Oratorios About the middle of the sixteenth century San Filippo Neri a zealous Florentine priest opened the chapel or oratory of his church in Rome for popular hours with his congregation His main object being to allure young people to pious offices and to detain them from worldly pleasure he endeavored to make the occasions attractive as well as edifying and supplemented religious discourse and spiritual songs with dramatized versions of Biblical stories provided with suitable music Associated with him in his labors for a good cause was no less a composer than that great reformer of Catholic church music Giovanni Pierluigi Sante da Palestrina whose harmonies were declared by a music loving Pope to be those of the celestial Jerusalem The laudable enterprise proved successful People flocked from all quarters to enjoy the gratuitous entertainments and a form of sacred musical art resulted that derived from them its name Roswitha a nun of the Gandersheim cloister in the tenth century made the earliest attempt recorded to invest church plays with artistic worth Her six religious dramas written in Latin for the use and edification of her sister nuns were published in a French setting in eighteen forty five It was a woman too Laura Guidiccioni a brilliant member of the Florence group of aristocratic truth seekers in art who wrote the text of the first religious musical dramatic composition to which the name oratorio became attached It was set to music of a declamatory style by Emilio del Cavalieri the author s collaborator in the pastoral plays that were really embryo operas The title of the piece The Representation of the Body and the Soul indicates the allegorical nature of the subject Its initial performance occurred at Rome February sixteen hundred in the oratory of San Filippo s church Santa Maria della Vallicella The composer had died some months earlier but his minute stage directions were accurately observed Behind the scenes was placed an orchestra comprising a double lyre a harpsichord a large guitar and two flutes to which was added a violin for the leading part in the ritornels that is instrumental preludes and interludes The chorus had seats assigned on the stage but rose to sing employing suitable movements and gestures Time Morality Pleasure and other solo characters bore in their hands musical instruments and seemed to play as they acted and declaimed their parts while the playing actually came from the concealed instruments The World the Body and Human Life illustrated the transitoriness of earthly affairs by flinging away the gorgeous decorations they had worn when they appeared on the stage and displaying their utter poverty and wretchedness in the face of death and dissolution The representation ended with a ballet danced sedately and reverently to music by the chorus Some idea of the oratorio in its infancy may be gained from this description Except that the subject had a religious bearing it differed little from the opera With Giacomo Carissimi director of music at San Apollinare Rome from sixteen twenty eight until his death in sixteen seventy four the paths of the two diverged He laid down lines that have been followed in the oratorio ever since Dancing and acting were excluded by him and the role of narrator introduced His broad simple treatment of chords enhanced the purity and beauty of everything he wrote and in his hand recitative gained character grace and musical expressiveness Only a small portion of his epoch making work has been preserved but quite enough to make clear his title Father of Oratorio and Cantata His pupil Alessandro Scarlatti founder of the Neapolitan school and practically the musical dictator of Naples from sixteen ninety four to seventeen twenty five was an incredibly prolific composer in almost every known species of musical form His many improvements in vocal and instrumental music operated greatly to the advantage of the oratorio Possessing feeling for orchestration to an unusual degree for his time he grouped musical instruments of different timbres with marked boldness and skill and was the first specially to orchestrate recitative His genius and knowledge enabled him to restore counterpoint to its rightful place and his oratorios show great gain in elasticity and form Another Alessandro he who bore the surname Stradella and was the hero of Flotow s opera of that name has figured so freely in romance that it is not easy to separate truth from fiction in accounts of his life doctor Parry says of him that he had a remarkable instinct for choral effects even piling progressions into a climax that his solo music aims at definiteness of structure that in sixteen seventy six he used a double orchestra whose principal instruments were violins and that his oratorios were specially significant as he cultivated all the resources of that form of art His most celebrated composition is an oratorio San Giovanni Battista and one of the airs attached to it Pieta Signore a beautiful symmetrical heart searching melody is sung to day although it is by no means as well known as it deserves According to tradition its tender worshipful strains sung in the church of the Holy Apostles at Rome by the composer himself once stayed the hand of an assassin whom jealousy had prompted to slay the Apollo della Musica So Alessandro Stradella was called because of his great gifts as singer and composer and his manly beauty A jubilant multitude surrounded him in life and loud lamentation arose when at length he fell a victim to envy and malice Thus the graceful legend runs Recent writers are trying to make us believe that the famous Pieta Signore was a later interpolation in San Giovanni Battista and that it may be attributed to this or that composer a century or more after the death of Stradella in sixteen eighty one Unless absolute proof be afforded us let us forbear from plucking this gem from his crown Composer of fifty operas and many other works magnificent organist and harpsichordist with musical genius of a Titanic order intellect that was swift sure and keen an indomitable will a lofty philosophy and a lordly personality George Friedrich Handel seemingly defeated by outrageous fortune wheeled about like some invincible general whose business it was to win the battle and entering the field of the oratorio gained a colossal victory He had for some time passed the half century milestone of his life when he scored his greatest achievements in this line and with magic touch transformed existing materials into the art form we know to day His Messiah which alone would have sufficed to immortalize him was produced in one of his herculean bursts of power within twenty three days when he was well advanced in his fifty seventh year It was first given to the public in Dublin April thirteen seventeen forty two seven months after its completion The enthusiasm it awakened was repeated when it was performed later in London Here indeed the audience became so transported that at the opening of the Hallelujah chorus every one present led by the king rose and remained standing a custom we follow to day Herder calls the Messiah a Christian epopee in musical sounds It is certainly written in the large grand style of a noble epic for it had large matters to express and its composer regarded music as a means of addressing heart and soul The theme is treated with reverence delicacy and judgment and the leading tone is that of a mighty hymn of rejoicing Following an overture that is in itself a revelation the opening tenor recitative Comfort Ye My People has a convincing ring that all is and will be well mingled with infinite tenderness and the succeeding aria Every Valley is pervaded with the freshness of earth newly arisen amid great glory The heart rending desolation of selections like the contralto air He was Despised only serves to accentuate the triumph of other portions Throughout there is a warmth a contrapuntal splendor a breadth an elasticity a richness of orchestration unknown in previous oratorio unless in parts of some of the master s own works Even in the duet and choruses remodeled from his chamber duets there is that jubilant character that makes them blend perfectly with the great whole Born and educated on German soil steeped during his wanderer s years in the spirit of the Italian muse and finally nourished on the cathedral music of England Handel became thoroughly cosmopolitan appropriating what he chose from the influences that surrounded him The English regard him as one of their national glories call him the Saxon Goliath the Michael Angelo of music a Bold Briareus with a hundred hands and have carved his form in enduring marble above his tomb in Westminster Abbey Nothing they have said can equal the tribute paid him by the dying giant Beethoven who pointing to Handel s works exclaimed There is the truth Another lofty yet wholly different personality born also in sixteen eighty five is found in Johann Sebastian Bach whose Passion Oratorios a direct outgrowth of the Passion plays of old furnish materials and inspiration for all time Handel worked in and for the public and fought his battles in the great world Bach was the lonely scholar who lived apart from outside turmoil and unabashed in the presence of earthly monarchs reigned supreme in the tone world A typical Teuton his music intensely earnest highly intellectual contains the essence of Teutonism and gives full rich copious expression to the inmost being of humanity The spirit of Protestant Germany is embodied in his religious tone productions which have proved to Protestantism a tower of strength His service in developing the choral alone is inestimable Nothing that he has written better represents the majesty and sublimity of his style than his Saint Matthew Passion with its surpassing utterances of human sorrow and infinite tenderness In the year seventeen ninety when Joseph Haydn had accepted an invitation to make a professional visit to London his young friend Mozart endeavored to dissuade him from going on account of his age but Haydn persisted declaring that he was still active and strong Eight years later at sixty six years of age he wrote his celebrated oratorio The Creation with all the vigor and sparkle of youth The rambles of years in the beautiful grounds of Esterhazy had attuned his soul to communion with nature and this work plainly shows his power of putting into tones the secrets nature revealed to him Blissful joyousness and child like naivete are among its characteristic features The style of Beethoven as a composer of sacred music is reflected in his single oratorio Christ on the Mount of Olives that like his single opera stands apart amply sufficient to prove what he was capable of accomplishing Mendelssohn in his saint Paul and his Elijah embodied a high ideal building on his predecessors and attaining especially in the latter an eclectic spirit that manifests keen discrimination The oratorios of Liszt the Christus saint Elizabeth and some lesser works reveal high purpose and original treatment of a revelation in tones of sacred events In the oratorios of the Frenchman Gounod preeminently in his Redemption it is interesting to find modern chorals based on those of the German Bach and in fact as it has been aptly said a modernized treatment of Bach s passion form What may be the next step in the evolution of the oratorio it were difficult to estimate Whether modern efforts can ever surpass or even equal the sublime productions in this field or whether creative genius will be turned into wholly new channels the future alone may determine Illustration SAINT SAENS

none	none	 Symphony and Symphonic Poem 
7594_91192_000003_000000	train-clean-360	That adventurous spirit Claudio Monteverde who nearly three hundred years ago made himself responsible for the first feeble utterances of an orchestra that tried to say something for itself divined the possibilities of expression in varying combinations of tone quality and gave vigorous impulse to the germ of the symphony already existing in the formless instrumental preludes and interludes of his predecessors among opera makers 
none	none	His revelation of the charm that lies in exploring the resources of instrumentation led to ever increasing demands on the orchestra 
7594_91192_000003_000002	train-clean-360	The prelude developed into the operatic overture whose business it became to prepare the spectator for what followed 
none	none	That music was capable of conveying an impression in her own tone language was apparent and in due time the symphony rose majestic from the forge of genius Prominent among the materials welded into it was the dance of obscure origin 
7594_91192_000004_000001	train-clean-360	As the vocal aria was the result of the simple folk song combined with the intense craving of song s master molders for individual expression so instrumental music striving to walk alone without support from words gained vital elements through the discovery that various phases of mental disposition might be indicated by alternating dance tunes differing in rhythm and movement according to Nature s own law of contrasts 
7594_91192_000004_000002	train-clean-360	That unity of purpose was essential to the effectiveness of the diversity was instinctively discerned 
none	none	The touch of authority was given to this kind of music during the last two decades of the seventeenth century by Arcangelo Corelli when he presented in the camera or private apartment of Cardinal Ottoboni s palace in Rome his idealized dance groups thoroughly united by harmony of mood yet affording a wholly new tone picture of this mood in each of several movements 
7594_91192_000005_000001	train-clean-360	These compositions were usually written for the harpsichord and perhaps three instruments of the viol order the master himself playing the leading melody on the violin 
none	none	He called them sonatas from sonare to sound a name originally applied to any piece that was sounded by instruments not sung by the human voice They prefigured the solo sonata the entire class of chamber music named from the place where they were performed and the symphony which is a sonata for the orchestra 
7594_91192_000005_000004	train-clean-360	Absolute music was set once for all on the right path by them 
none	none	They ushered in a new era of Art Purcell in England Domenico Scarlatti and Sammartini in Italy the Bachs in Germany and others continued to fashion the sonata form 
7594_91192_000006_000001	train-clean-360	It ceased to be a mere grouping of dances the name suite being applied to that and struck out into independent excursions in the domain of fancy 
7594_91192_000006_000002	train-clean-360	The prevailing melody of its monophonic style proved suitable to furnish a subject for the most animated discussion 
none	none	Three contrasting movements were adopted comprising a summons to attention an appeal to both intellect and emotions and a lively reaction after excitement 
7594_91192_000007_000000	train-clean-360	A German critic has jocosely remarked that the early writers meant the sonata to show first what they could do second what they could feel and third how glad they were to have finished 
7594_91192_000007_000001	train-clean-360	Time vastly increased its importance 
7594_91192_000007_000002	train-clean-360	Two subjects a melody in the tonic another usually in the dominant came to set forth the exposition of the opening movement leading to a free development with various episodes and an assured return to the original statement 
none	none	The prevailing character being thus defined the story readily unfolds aided by related keys in a slow movement and perhaps a minuet or scherzo and gains its denouement in a stirring finale written in the original key Each movement has its own subjects its individual development with harmony of plan and idea for a bond of union The name symphony from sinfonia a consonance of sounds applied originally to any selection played by a full band and later to instrumental overtures was given by Joseph Haydn to the orchestral sonata form inaugurated by him 
7594_91192_000008_000001	train-clean-360	His thirty years of musical service to the house of Esterhazy with an orchestra increasing from sixteen to twenty four pieces to experiment on as the solo virtuoso experiments on piano or violin brought him wholly under the spell of the instruments 
7594_91192_000008_000002	train-clean-360	Their individual characteristics afforded him continually new suggestions in regard to tone coloring and he rose often to audacity for his time in his harmonic devices 
7594_91192_000008_000003	train-clean-360	Grace and spirit originality of invention joyous abandon a fancy controlled by a studious mind a profusion of quaint humor and a proper division of light and shade combine to give the dominant note to his music 
7594_91192_000008_000004	train-clean-360	His symphonies recall the fairy tale with its sparkling once upon a time and yet like it are not without their mysterious shadows 
none	none	In everything he has written is felt that faculty of smiling amid grief and disappointment and pain that made Haydn the Father of the Symphony exclaim in his old age Life is a charming affair 
7594_91192_000009_000000	train-clean-360	With Mozart whose life work began after but ended before that of Haydn influencing and being influenced by the latter the symphony broadened in scope and grew richer in warmth of melodious expression definiteness of plan and completeness of form 
7594_91192_000009_000001	train-clean-360	His profoundly poetic musical nature with its high capacity for joy and sorrow and infinite longing was reflected in all that he wrote 
7594_91192_000009_000002	train-clean-360	By means of a generous employment of free counterpoint in other words a kind of polyphony in which the various voices use different melodies in harmonious combination he gained a potent auxiliary in his cunning workmanship and emphasized the folly of rejecting the contrapuntal experiences of for instance a Sebastian Bach Musical instruments as well as musical materials were his servants in developing the glowing fancies of his marvelously constructive brain 
7594_91192_000009_000003	train-clean-360	The crowning glory of his graceful perfection of outline and detail is the noble spirit of serenity which illumines all its beauty 
7594_91192_000010_000000	train-clean-360	Beethoven further advanced the technique of the symphony and proved its power to strike fire from the soul of man Varying his themes while repeating them adding spice to his episodes and working out his entire scheme with consummate skill he was able to construct from a motive of a few notes a mighty epic tone poem 
7594_91192_000010_000001	train-clean-360	He translated into superb orchestral pages the dreams of the human heart the soul s longing for liberty and all the holiest aspirations of the inner being 
7594_91192_000010_000002	train-clean-360	He discussed in tones problems of man s life and destiny ever displaying sublime faith that Fate however cruel is powerless to crush the spiritual being the real individuality 
7594_91192_000010_000003	train-clean-360	His conflicts never fail to end in triumph 
none	none	Well may it be said that the ultimate purpose of a symphony of Beethoven is to tell of those things from the deepest depths of which events are mere shadows and that as high feeling demands lofty utterance his tonal forms are inevitably worthy of their contents 
7594_91192_000011_000000	train-clean-360	Twenty six years younger than Beethoven Schubert lived but a year after he had passed away and died in eighteen twenty eight two years later than Weber and felt the glow of the spirit of romanticism 
7594_91192_000011_000001	train-clean-360	From the perennial fount of song within his breast there streamed fresh melodious strains through his symphonies the ninth and last of which the C major ranks him with the great symphonists 
none	none	Intense poetic sentiment dreamy yet strong musical individuality romantic fulness of plan to embody in tones the passionate emotions of a storm and stress period and much originality of orchestral treatment characterize the symphonies of Schumann He rises to towering heights in some passages but in his daring explorations through the tone world he is often betrayed into a vagueness of form largely traceable perhaps to lack of early technical discipline as well as to lack of mental clarity 
7594_91192_000011_000004	train-clean-360	Ultra romanticism was foreign to the nature and repulsive to the tastes of the refined elegant Mendelssohn yet in spite of himself its influence crept gently into his polished works 
none	none	As a symphonist he displayed fertility in picturesque sonorities facility in tracing the outlines and filling in the details of form keen sense of balance of orchestral tone thorough scientific knowledge of his materials and as some one has said became all but a master in the highest sense His overtures are unquestionably romantic and as their histrionic and scenic titles indicate partake of the nature of programme music 
7594_91192_000012_000000	train-clean-360	This brings us to Hector Berlioz the famous French symphonist the exponent par excellence of programme music that is music intended to illustrate a special story 
7594_91192_000012_000001	train-clean-360	He lived from eighteen oh three to eighteen sixty nine and because of his audacity in using new and startling tonal effects was called the most flagrant musical heretic of the nineteenth century 
7594_91192_000012_000002	train-clean-360	He was the first to impress on the world the idea of music as a definite language His recurrent themes called fixed ideas prefigured Wagner s leading motives His skill in combining instruments added new lustre to orchestration 
none	none	The personal style he created for himself was the result of his studies of older masterpieces above all those of Gluck which he knew by heart and of his philosophic researches 
7594_91192_000012_000004	train-clean-360	His four famous symphonic works are Fantastic Symphony Grand Funeral and Triumphal Symphony Harold in Italy and Romeo and Juliet In a preface to the first he thus explains his ideas The plan of a musical drama without words requires to be explained beforehand 
7594_91192_000012_000005	train-clean-360	The programme which is indispensable to the perfect comprehension of the work ought therefore to be considered in the light of the spoken text of an opera serving to lead up to the piece of music and indicate the character and expression 
7594_91192_000013_000000	train-clean-360	From programme music came the symphonic poem of which Franz Liszt was the creator 
none	none	Although he found this culmination of the romantic ideal in the field of instrumental music in his maturer years he displayed in it the full power of his genius His great works in this line are a Faust Symphony Les Preludes Orpheus Prometheus Mazeppa and Hamlet Symphonic in form although less restricted than the symphony these works are designed to give tone pictures of the subjects designated or at least of the moods they awaken Mazeppa for instance is described as depicting in a wild movement rising to frenzy the death ride of the hero a brief andante proclaims his collapse the following march introduced by trumpet fanfares and increasing to the noblest triumph his elevation and coronation 
7594_91192_000014_000000	train-clean-360	Camille Saint Saens without doubt the most original and intellectual modern French composer who at sixty seven years of age is still in the midst of his activity and who has made his own the spirit of the classic composers owes to the symphonic poem a great part of his reputation and has also written symphonies of great value 
7594_91192_000014_000001	train-clean-360	His orchestration is distinguished by its clarity power and exquisite coloring 
none	none	The orchestral music of Tschaikowsky who died in eighteen ninety three symphonies and symphonic poems are saturated with the glowing Russian spirit are intensely dramatic sometimes rising to tempestuous bursts of passion that are only held in check by the composer s scholarly control of his materials 
7594_91192_000014_000003	train-clean-360	A strong national flavor is also felt in the work of Christian Sinding the Norwegian whose D minor symphony has been styled a piece born of the gloomy romanticism of the North Edward Grieg known as the incarnation of the strong vigorous breezy spirit of the land of the midnight sun has put some of his most characteristic work into symphonic poems and orchestral suites 
7594_91192_000014_000004	train-clean-360	The first composer to convey a message from the North in tones to the European world was Gade the Dane known as the Symphony Master of the North who was born in eighteen seventeen and died in eighteen ninety 
7594_91192_000015_000000	train-clean-360	It is impossible to mention in a brief essay all the great workers in symphonic forms 
7594_91192_000015_000001	train-clean-360	One Titanic spirit Johannes Brahms eighteen thirty three eighteen ninety seven who succeeded in striking the dominant note of musical sublimity amid modern unrest is reserved for our final consideration 
none	none	Of him Schumann said This John is a prophet who will also write revelations and he has revealed to those who can read that high art is the abiding place of reason that it is moreover compounded of profundity of feeling yoked with profundity of intellectual mastery 
7594_91192_000015_000003	train-clean-360	doctor Riemann writes of him From Bach he inherited the depth from Haydn the humor from Mozart the charm from Beethoven the strength from Schubert the intimateness of his art 
7594_91192_000015_000004	train-clean-360	Truly a wonderfully gifted nature that was able to absorb such a fulness of great gifts and still not lose the best of gifts the strong individuality which makes the master 
7594_91192_000016_000000	train-clean-360	Wonderful is the power of instrumental music absolute music without words that may convey impressions deep and lasting no words could give 
none	none	All hail to the memory of Johannes Brahms who has reminded us of its true mission and delivered a message that will ring through the twentieth century Transcriber s Note In the caption for
