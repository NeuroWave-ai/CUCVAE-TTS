none	none	 The Science Community
3994_11512_000006_000000	train-clean-360	 This part is related by Peter Hagstrom Ph D 
3994_11512_000007_000000	train-clean-360	 The ability to communicate ideas from one individual to another said a professor of sociology to his class is the principal distinction between human beings and their brute forbears 
3994_11512_000007_000001	train-clean-360	The increase and refinement of this ability to communicate is an index of the degree of civilization of a people 
none	none	The more civilized a people the more perfect their ability to communicate especially under difficulties and in emergencies Sidenote The delivery of his country into the clutches of a merciless ultra modern religion can be prevented only by doctor Hagstrom s deciphering an extraordinary code 
3994_11512_000009_000000	train-clean-360	As usual the observation burst harmlessly over the heads of most of the students in the class who were preoccupied with more immediate things with the evening s movies and the week end s dance 
4110_11533_000015_000001	train-clean-360	But 
3994_11512_000009_000001	train-clean-360	But upon two young men in the class it made a powerful impression 
3994_11512_000009_000002	train-clean-360	It crystallized within them certain vague conceptions and brought them to a conscious focus enabling the young men to turn formless dreams into concrete acts 
3994_11512_000009_000003	train-clean-360	That is why I take the position that the above enthusiastic words of this sociology professor whose very name I have forgotten were the prime moving influence which many years later succeeded in saving Occidental civilization from a catastrophe which would have been worse than death and destruction 
4110_11533_000016_000001	train-clean-360	why 
none	none	I take the position that the above enthusiastic words of this sociology professor whose very name I have forgotten were the prime moving influence which many years later succeeded in saving Occidental civilization from a catastrophe which would have been worse than death and destruction 
3994_11512_000010_000000	train-clean-360	One of these young men was myself and the other was my lifelong friend and chum Carl Benda who saved his country by solving a tremendously difficult scientific puzzle in a simple way by sheer reasoning power and without apparatus 
3994_11512_000010_000001	train-clean-360	The sociology professor struck a responsive chord in us for since our earliest years we had wigwagged to each other as Boy Scouts learned the finger alphabet of the deaf and dumb so that we might maintain communication during school hours strung a telegraph wire between our two homes admired Poe s Gold Bug together and devised boyish cipher codes in which to send each other postcards when chance separated us 
4110_11533_000016_000002	train-clean-360	when 
none	none	chance separated us 
3994_11512_000010_000002	train-clean-360	But we had always felt a little foolish about what we considered our childish hobbies until the professor s words suddenly roused us to the realization that we were a highly civilized pair of youngsters 
3994_11512_000011_000000	train-clean-360	Not only did we then and there cease feeling guilty about our secret ciphers and our dots and dashes but the determination was born within us to make of communication our life s work 
3994_11512_000011_000001	train-clean-360	It turned out that both of us actually did devote our lives to the cause of communication but the passing years saw us engaged in widely and curiously divergent phases of the work 
3994_11512_000011_000002	train-clean-360	Thirty years later I was Professor of the Psychology of Language at Columbia University and Benda was Maintenance Engineer of the Bell Telephone Company of New York City and on his knowledge and skill depended the continuity and stability of that stupendously complex traffic the telephone communication of Greater New York 
none	none	Since our ambitious cravings were satisfied in our everyday work and since now ordinarily available methods of communication sufficed our needs we no longer felt impelled to signal across the house tops with semaphores nor to devise ciphers that would defy solution 
3994_11512_000012_000001	train-clean-360	But we still kept up our intimate friendship and our intense interest in our beloved subject 
3994_11512_000012_000002	train-clean-360	We were just as close chums at the age of fifty as we had been at ten and just as thrilled at new advances in communication at television at the international language at the supposed signals from Mars 
3994_11512_000013_000000	train-clean-360	That was the state of affairs between us up to a year ago 
3994_11512_000013_000001	train-clean-360	At about that time Benda resigned his position with the New York Bell Telephone Company to accept a place as the Director of Communication in the Science Community 
3994_11512_000013_000002	train-clean-360	This for many reasons was a most amazing piece of news to myself and to anyone who knew Benda 
3994_11512_000014_000000	train-clean-360	Of course it was commonly known that Benda was being sought by Universities and corporations I know personally of several tempting offers he had received 
3994_11512_000014_000001	train-clean-360	But the New York Bell is a wealthy corporation and had thus far managed to hold Benda both by the munificence of its salary and by the attractiveness of the work it offered him 
3994_11512_000014_000002	train-clean-360	That the Science Community would want Benda was easy to understand but that it could outbid the New York Bell was to say the least a surprise 
3994_11512_000015_000000	train-clean-360	Furthermore that a man like Benda would want to have anything at all to do with the Science Community seemed strange enough in itself 
3994_11512_000015_000001	train-clean-360	He had the most practical common sense well balanced habits of thinking and living supported by an intellect so clear and so keen that I knew of none to excel it 
3994_11512_000015_000002	train-clean-360	What the Science Community was no one knew exactly but that there was something abnormal fanatical about it no one doubted 
3994_11512_000016_000000	train-clean-360	The Science Community situated in Virginia in the foothills of the Blue Ridge had first been heard of many years ago when it was already a going concern 
3994_11512_000016_000001	train-clean-360	At the time of which I now speak the novelty had worn off and no one paid any more attention to it than they do to Zion City or the Dunkards 
none	none	By this time the Science Community was a city of a million inhabitants with a vast outlying area of farms and gardens 
3994_11512_000016_000003	train-clean-360	It was modern to the highest degree in construction and operation there was very little manual labor there no poverty every person had all the benefits of modern developments in power transportation and communication and of all other resources provided by scientific progress 
3994_11512_000017_000000	train-clean-360	So much visitors and reporters were able to say 
3994_11512_000018_000000	train-clean-360	The rumors that it was a vast socialistic organization without private property with equal sharing of all privileges were never confirmed 
none	none	It is a curious observation that it was possible in this country of ours for a city to exist about which we knew so little However it seemed evident from the vast number and elaboration of public buildings the perfection of community utilities such as transportation streets lighting and communication from the absence of individual homes and the housing of people in huge dormitories that some different less individualistic type of social organization than ours was involved 
3994_11512_000018_000003	train-clean-360	It was obvious that as an organization the Science Community must also be wealthy 
3994_11512_000018_000004	train-clean-360	If any of its individual citizens were wealthy no one knew it 
3994_11512_000019_000000	train-clean-360	I knew Benda as well as I knew myself and if I was sure of anything in my life it was that he was not the type of man to leave a fifty thousand dollar job and join a communist city on an equal footing with the clerks in the stores 
3994_11512_000019_000001	train-clean-360	As it happens I was also intimately acquainted with John Edgewater Smith recently Power Commissioner of New York City and the most capable power engineer in North America who following Benda by two or three months resigned his position and accepted what his letter termed the place of Director of Power in the Science Community 
3994_11512_000019_000002	train-clean-360	I was personally in a position to state that neither of these men could be lightly persuaded into such a step and that neither of them would work for a small salary 
3994_11512_000020_000000	train-clean-360	Benda s first letter to me stated that he was at the Science Community on a visit 
3994_11512_000020_000001	train-clean-360	He had heard of the place and while at Washington on business had taken advantage of the opportunity to drive out and see it Fascinated by the equipment he saw there he had decided to stay a few days and study it 
3994_11512_000020_000002	train-clean-360	The next letter announced his acceptance of the position 
3994_11512_000020_000003	train-clean-360	I would give a month s salary to get a look at those letters now but I neglected to preserve them 
4110_11533_000031_000001	train-clean-360	 look 
none	none	at those letters now but I neglected to preserve them 
3994_11512_000020_000004	train-clean-360	I should like to see them because I am curious as to whether they exhibit the characteristics of the subsequent letters some of which I now have 
3994_11512_000021_000000	train-clean-360	As I have stated Benda and I had been on the most intimate terms for forty years 
3994_11512_000021_000001	train-clean-360	His letters had always been crisp and direct and thoroughly familiar and confidential 
3994_11512_000021_000002	train-clean-360	I do not know just how many letters I received from him from the Science Community before I noted the difference but I have one from the third month of his stay there he wrote every two or three weeks characterized by a verbosity that sounded strange for him 
4110_11533_000016_000000	train-clean-360	how 
none	none	many letters I received from him from the Science Community before I noted the difference but I have one from the third month of his stay there he wrote every two or three weeks characterized by a verbosity that sounded strange for him 
3994_11512_000021_000003	train-clean-360	He seemed to be writing merely to cover the sheet trifles such as he had never previously considered worth writing letters about 
3994_11512_000021_000004	train-clean-360	Four pages of letter conveyed not a single idea 
3994_11512_000021_000005	train-clean-360	Yet Benda was if anything a man of ideas 
3994_11512_000022_000000	train-clean-360	There followed several months of letters like that a lot of words evasion of coming to the point about anything just conventional letters 
none	none	Benda was the last man to write a conventional letter Yet it was Benda writing them gruff little expressions of his clear ways of looking at even the veriest trifles little allusion to our common past these things could neither have been written by anyone else nor written under compulsion from without 
3994_11512_000022_000003	train-clean-360	Something had changed Benda 
3994_11512_000023_000000	train-clean-360	I pondered on it a good deal and could think of no hypothesis to account for it 
3994_11512_000023_000001	train-clean-360	In the meanwhile New York City lost a third technical man to the Science Community 
3994_11512_000023_000002	train-clean-360	Donald Francisco Commissioner of the Water Supply a sanitary engineer of international standing accepted a position in the Science Community as Water Director 
3994_11512_000023_000003	train-clean-360	I did not know whether to laugh and compare it to the National Baseball League s trafficking in big names or to hunt for some sinister danger sign in it 
none	none	But as a result of my ponderings I decided to visit Benda at The Science Community I wrote him to that effect and almost decided to change my mind about the visit because of the cold evasiveness of the reply I received from him My first impulse on reading his indifferent lackadaisical comment on my proposed visit was to feel offended and determine to let him alone and never see him again 
3994_11512_000024_000002	train-clean-360	The average man would have done that but my long years of training in psychological interpretation told me that a character and a friendship built during forty years does not change in six months and that there must be some other explanation for this 
3994_11512_000024_000003	train-clean-360	I wrote him that I was coming 
none	none	I found that the best way to reach the Science Community was to take a bus out from Washington 
3994_11512_000024_000005	train-clean-360	It involved a drive of about fifty miles northwest through a picturesque section of the country 
none	none	The latter part of the drive took me past settlements that looked as though they might be in about the same stage of progress as 
4110_11528_000060_000000	train-clean-360	they had 
none	none	been during the American Revolution 
3994_11512_000024_000007	train-clean-360	The city of my destination was back in the hills and very much isolated 
3994_11512_000024_000008	train-clean-360	During the last ten miles we met no traffic at all and I was the only passenger left in the bus Suddenly the vehicle stopped 
3994_11512_000025_000000	train-clean-360	 Far as we go the driver shouted 
3994_11512_000026_000000	train-clean-360	I looked about in consternation 
3994_11512_000026_000001	train-clean-360	All around were low wild looking hills 
3994_11512_000026_000002	train-clean-360	The road went on ahead through a narrow pass 
none	none	They ll pick you up in a little bit the driver said as he turned around and drove off leaving me standing there with my bag very much astonished at it all 
3994_11512_000028_000000	train-clean-360	He was right 
3994_11512_000028_000001	train-clean-360	A small neat looking bus drove through the pass and stopped for me 
none	none	As I got in the driver mechanically turned around and drove into the hills again They took up my ticket on the other bus I said to the driver
3994_11512_000029_000001	train-clean-360	 What do I owe you 
3994_11512_000030_000000	train-clean-360	 Nothing he said curtly 
3994_11512_000030_000001	train-clean-360	 Fill that out He handed me a card 
3994_11512_000031_000000	train-clean-360	An impertinent thing that card was 
3994_11512_000031_000001	train-clean-360	Besides asking for my name address nationality vocation and position it requested that I state whom I was visiting in the Science Community the purpose of my visit the nature of my business how long I intended to stay did I have a place to stay arranged for and if so where and through whom 
3994_11512_000031_000002	train-clean-360	It looked for all the world as though they had something to conceal Czarist Russia couldn t beat that for keeping track of people and prying into their business 
3994_11512_000031_000003	train-clean-360	Sign here the card said 
none	none	It annoyed me but I filled it out and by the time I was through the bus was out of the hills traveling up the valley of a small river I am not familiar enough with northern Virginia to say which river it was There was much machinery and a few people in the broad fields In the distance ahead was a mass of chimneys and the cupolas of iron works but no smoke There were power line towers with high tension insulators and far ahead the masses of huge elevators and big square buildings Soon I came in sight of a veritable forest of huge windmills In a few moments the huge buildings loomed up over me the bus entered a street of the city abruptly from the country One moment on a country road the next moment among towering buildings We sped along swiftly through a busy metropolis bright airy efficient looking The traffic was dense but quiet and I was confident that most of the vehicles were electric for there was no noise nor gasoline odor Nor was there any smoke Things looked airy comfortable efficient but rather monotonous dull There was a total lack of architectural interest The buildings were just square blocks like neat rows of neat boxes But it all moved smoothly quietly with wonderful efficiency My first thought was to look closely at the people who swarmed the streets of this strange city Their faces were solemn and their clothes were solemn All seemed intently busy going somewhere or doing something there was no standing about no idle sauntering And look whichever way I might everywhere there was the same blue serge on men and women alike in all directions as far as I could see The bus stopped before a neat square building of rather smaller size and the next thing I knew Benda was running down the steps to meet me He was his old gruff enthusiastic self Glad to see you Hagstrom old socks he shouted and gripped my hand with two of his I ve arranged for a room for you and we ll have a good old visit and I ll show you around this town I looked at him closely He looked healthy and well cared for all except for a couple of new lines of worry on his face Undoubtedly that worn look meant some sort of trouble PART II The New Religion This part is interpolated by the author into doctor Hagstrom s narrative Every great religion has as its psychological reason for existence the mission of compensating for some crying unsatisfied human need Christianity spread and grew among people who were at the time persecuted subjects or slaves of Rome and it flourished through the Middle Ages at a time when life held for the individual chiefly pain uncertainty and bereavement Christianity kept the common man consoled and mentally balanced by minimizing the importance of life on earth and offering compensation afterwards and elsewhere A feeble nation of idle dreamers torn by a chaos of intertribal feuds within menaced by powerful conquest lusting nations from without Arabia was enabled by Islam the religion of her prophet Mohammed to unite all her sons into an intense loyalty to one cause and to turn her dream stuff into reality by carrying her national pride and honor beyond her boundaries and spreading it over half the known world The ancient Greeks in despair over the frailties of human emotion and the unbecomingness of worldly conduct which their brilliant minds enabled them to recognize clearly but which they found themselves powerless to subdue endowed the gods whom they worshipped with all of their own passions and weaknesses and thus the foolish behavior of the gods consoled them for their own obvious shortcomings So it goes throughout all of the world s religions In the middle of the twentieth century there were in the civilized world millions of people in whose lives Christianity had ceased to play any part Yet psychically remember psyche means soul they were just as sick and unbalanced just as much in need of some compensation as were the subjects of the early Roman empire or the Arabs in the Middle Ages They were forced to work at the strained and monotonous pace of machines they were the slaves body and soul of machines they lived with machines and lived like machines they were expected to be machines A mechanized mode of life set a relentless pace for them while just as in all the past ages life and love the breezes and the blue sky called to them but they could not respond They had to drive machines so that machines could serve them Minds were cramped and emotions were starved but hands must go on guiding levers and keeping machines in operation Lives were reduced to such a mechanical routine that men wondered how long human minds and human bodies could stand the restraint There is a good deal in the writings of the times to show that life was becoming almost unbearable for three fourths of humanity It is only natural therefore that Rohan the prophet of the new religion found followers more rapidly than he could organize them About ten years before the visit of doctor Hagstrom to his friend Benda Rohan and his new religion had been much in the newspapers Rohan was a Slovak apparently well educated in Europe When he first attracted attention to himself he was foreman in a steel plant at Birmingham Alabama He was popular as an orator and drew unheard of crowds to his lectures He preached of Science as God an all pervading inexorably systematic Being the true Center and Motive Power of the Universe a Being who saw men and pitied them because they could not help committing inaccuracies The Science God was helping man become more perfect Even now men were much more accurate and systematic than they had been a hundred years ago men s lives were ordered and rhythmic like natural laws not like the chaotic emotions of beasts and savages Somehow he soon dropped out of the attention of the great mass of the public Of course he did so intentionally when his ideas began to crystallize and his plans for his future organization began to form At first he had a sort of church in Birmingham called The Church of the Scientific God There never was anything cheap nor blatant about him When he moved his church from Birmingham to the Lovett Branch Valley in northern Virginia he was hardly noticed But with him went seven thousand people to form the nucleus of the Science Community Since then some feature writer for a metropolitan Sunday paper has occasionally written up the Science Community both from its physical and its human aspects From these reports the outstanding bit of evidence is that Rohan believes intensely in his own religion and that his followers are all loyal worshippers of the Science God They conceive the earth to be a workshop in which men serve Science their God serving a sort of apprenticeship during which He perfects them to the state of ideal machines To be a perfect machine always accurate with no distracting emotions no getting off the track that was the ideal which the Great God Science required of his worshippers To be a perfect machine or a perfect cog in a machine to get rid of all individuality all disturbing sentiment that was their idea of supreme happiness Despite the obvious narrowness it involved there was something sublime in the conception of this religion It certainly had nothing in common with the Christian Science that was in vogue during the early years of the twentieth Century it towered with a noble grandeur above that feeble little sham The Science Community was organized like a machine and all men played their parts in government in labor in administration in production like perfect cogs and accurate wheels and the machine functioned perfectly The devotees were described as fanatical but happy They certainly were well trained and efficient The Science Community grew In ten years it had a million people and was a worldwide wonder of civic planning and organization it contained so many astonishing developments in mechanical service to human welfare and comfort that it was considered as a sort of model of the future city The common man there was provided with science produced luxuries in his daily life that were in the rest of the world the privilege of the wealthy few but he used his increased energy and leisure in serving the more devotedly his God Science who had made machines There was a great temple in the city the shape of a huge dynamo generator whose interior was worked out in a scheme of mechanical devices and with music lights and odors to help in the worship What the world knew the least about was that this religion was becoming militant Its followers spoke of the heathen without and were horrified at the prevalence of the sin of individualism They were inspired with the mission that the message of God scientific perfection must be carried to the whole world But knowing that vested interests governments invested capital and established religions would oppose them and render any real progress impossible they waited They studied the question looking for some opportunity to spread the gospel of their beliefs prepared to do so by force finding their justification in their belief that millions of sufferers needed the comforts that their religion had given them Meanwhile their numbers grew Rohan was Chief Engineer which position was equal in honor and dignity to that of Prophet or High Priest He was a busy hard worked man black haired and gaunt small of stature and fiery eyed he looked rather like an overworked department store manager rather than like a prophet He was finding his hands more full every day both because of the extraordinary fertility of his own plans and ideas and because the Science Community was growing so rapidly Among this heterogenous mass of proselyte strangers that poured into the city and was efficiently absorbed into the machine it was yet difficult to find executives leaders men to put in charge of big things And he needed constantly more and more of such men That was why Rohan went to Benda and subsequently to others like Benda Rohan had a deep knowledge of human nature He did not approach Benda with the offer of a magnanimous salary but came into Benda s office asking for a consultation on some of the puzzling communication problems of the Science Community Benda became interested and on his own initiative offered to visit the Science Community saying that he had to be in Washington anyway in a few days When he saw what the conditions were in the Science Community he became fascinated by its advantages over New York a new system to plan from the ground up no obsolete installation to wrestle with an absolutely free hand for the engineer in charge no politics to play no concessions to antiquated city construction nor to feeble minded city administration just a dream of an opportunity He almost asked for the job himself but Rohan was tactful enough to offer it and the salary though princely was hardly given a thought For many weeks Benda was absorbed in his job to the exclusion of all else He sent his money to his New York bank and had his family move in and live with him He was happy in his communication problems Give me a problem in communication and you make me happy he wrote to Hagstrom in one of his early letters He had completed a certain division of his work on the Science Community s communication system and it occurred to him that a few days relaxation would do him good A

Am I a prisoner he demanded with his characteristic directness An embarassing situation the suave Rohan admitted very calmly and at his ease You see I m nothing like a dictator here I have no arbitrary power Everything runs by system and you re a sort of exception No one knows exactly how to classify you Neither do I But I can t break a rule That is sin What rule I want to go to New York Only those of the Faith who have reached the third degree can come and go No one can get that in less than three years Then you got me in here by fraud Benda asked bluntly Rohan side stepped gracefully You know our innermost secrets now he explained Do you suppose there is any hope of your embracing the Faith Benda whirled on his heel and walked out I ll think about it he said his voice snapping with sarcasm Benda went back to his work in order to get his mind off the matter He was a well balanced man if he was anything and he knew that nothing could be accomplished by rash words or incautious moves against Rohan and his organization And on that day he met John Edgewater Smith You here Benda gasped He lost his equilibrium for a moment in consternation at the sight of his fellow engineer Smith was too elated to notice Benda s mood I ve been here a week This is certainly an ideal opportunity in my line of work Even in Heaven I never expected to find such a chance By this time Benda had regained control of himself He decided to say nothing to Smith for the time being They did not meet again for several weeks In the meantime Benda discovered that his mail was being censored At first he did not know that his letters always typewritten were copied and objectionable matter omitted and his signature reproduced by the photo engraving process separately each time But before long several letters came back to him rubber stamped Not passable Please revise It took Benda two days to cool down and rewrite the first letter But outwardly no one would have ever known that there was anything amiss with him However he took to leaving his work for an hour or two a day and walking in the park to think out the matter He didn t like it This was about the time that it began to be a real issue as to who was the bigger man of the two Rohan or Benda But no signs of the issue appeared externally for many months John Edgewater Smith realized sooner than Benda that he couldn t get out because not sticking to work so closely he had made the attempt sooner He looked very much worried when Benda next saw him What s this Do you know about it he shouted as soon as he had come within hearing distance of Benda What s the difference Benda replied casually Aren t you satisfied Smith s face went blank Benda came close to him linked arms and led him to a broad vacant lawn in the park Listen he said softly in Smith s ear Don t you suppose these people who lock us in and censor our mail aren t smart enough to spy on what we say to each other Our only hope Benda continued is to learn all we can of what is going on here Keep your eyes and ears open and meet me here in a week And now come on we ve been whispering here long enough Oddly enough the first clue to the puzzle they were trying to solve was supplied by Francisco New York s former Water Commissioner Why were they being kept prisoners in the city There must be more reason for holding them there than the fear that information would be carried out for none of the three engineers knew anything about the Science Community that could be of any possible consequence to outsiders They had all stuck rigidly to their own jobs They met Francisco very blue and dejected walking in the park a couple of months later They had been having weekly meetings feeling that more frequent rendezvous might excite suspicion Francisco was overjoyed to see them Been trying to figure out why they want us he said There is something deeper than the excuse they have made that rot about a perfect system and no breaking of rules may be true but it has nothing to do with us Now here are three of us widely admitted as having good heads on us We ve got to solve this The first fact to work on he continued is that there is no real job for me here This city has no water problem that cannot be worked out by an engineer s office clerk Why are they holding me here paying me a profligate salary for a job that is a joke for a grown up man There s something behind it that is not apparent on the surface The weekly meetings of the three engineers became an established institution Mindful that their conversation was doubtless the object of attention on the part of the ruling powers of the city through spies and concealed microphones they were careful to discuss trivial matters most of the time and mentioned their problem only when alone in the open spaces of the park After weeks of effort had produced no results they arrived at the conclusion that they would have to do some spying themselves The great temple shaped like a dynamo generator attracted their attention as the first possibility for obtaining information Benda during his work with telephone and television installation found that the office of some sort of ruling council or board of directors were located there Later he found that it was called the Science Staff He managed to slip in several concealed microphone detectors and wire them to a private receiver on his desk doing all the work with his own hands under the pretense of hunting for a cleverly contrived short circuit that his subordinates had failed to find They open their meeting he said reporting several days of listening to his comrades with a lot of religious stuff They really believe they are chosen by God to perfect the earth Their fanaticism has the Mohammedans beat forty ways As I get it from listening in this city is just a preliminary base from which to carry forcibly the gospel of Scientific Efficiency to the whole world They have been divinely appointed to organize the earth The first thing on the program is the seizure of New York City And it won t be long I ve heard the details of a cut and dried plan When they have New York the rest of America can be easily captured for cities aren t as independent of each other as they used to be Getting the rest of the world into their hands will then be merely a matter of routine just a little time and it will be done Mohammed s wars weren t in it with this Francisco and Smith stared at him aghast These dull faced blue sergeclad people did not look capable of it unless possibly one noted the fiery glint in their eyes A worldwide Crusade on a scientific basis The idea left them weak and trembling Got to learn more details before we can do anything Benda said Come on we ve been whispering here long enough they ll get suspicious Benda s brain was now definitely pitted against this marvelous organisation I ve got it Benda reported at a later meeting I pieced it together from a few hours listening Devilish scheme Can you imagine what would happen in New York in case of a break down in water supply electric power and communication In an hour there would be a panic in a day the city would be a hideous shambles of suffering starvation disease and trampling maniacs Dante s Inferno would be a lovely little pleasure resort in comparison Also have you ever stopped to think how few people there are in the world who understand the handling of these vital elements of our modern civilized organization sufficiently to keep them in operation There you have the scheme Because they do not want to destroy the city but merely to threaten it they are holding the three of us A little skilful management will eliminate all other possible men who could operate the city s machinery except ourselves We three will be placed in charge A threat perhaps a demonstration in some limited section of what horrors are possible The city is at their mercy and promptly surrenders An alternative plan was discussed just a little quiet violence could eliminate those who are now in charge of the city s works and the panic and horrors would commence But within an hour of the city s capitulation the three of us could have things running smoothly again And there would be no New York in its place would be Science Community Number Two From it they could step on to the next city The other two stared at him There was only one comment They seem to be sure that they could depend on us Smith said They may be correct Benda replied Would you stand by and see people perish if a turn of your hand could save them You would for the moment forget the issue between the old order and the new religion They separated horrified by the ghastly simplicity of the plan Just following this Benda received the telegram announcing the prospective visit of his lifelong friend doctor Hagstrom He took it at once to Rohan Will my friend be permitted to depart again if he once gets in here he demanded with his customary directness It depends on you Rohan replied blandly We want your friend to see our Community and to go away and carry with him the nicest possible reports and descriptions of it to the world I wonder do I make myself clear That means I ve got to feed him taffy while he s here Benda asked gruffly You choose to put it indelicately He is to see and hear only such things about the Science Community as well please the world and impress it favorably I am sure you will understand that under no other circumstances will he be permitted to leave here Benda turned around abruptly and walked out without a word Just a moment Rohan called after him I am sure you appreciate the fact that every precaution will be taken to hear the least word that you say to him during his stay here You are watched only perfunctorily now While he is here you will be kept track of carefully and there will be three methods of checking everything you do or say I am sure you do not underestimate our caution in this matter Benda spent the days intervening between then and the arrival of his friend Hagstrom closed up in his office in intense study He figured things on pieces of paper committed them to memory and scrupulously burned the paper Then he wandered about the park and plucked at leaves and twigs PART III The Cipher Message Related by Peter Hagstrom Ph D Benda conducted me personally to a room very much like an ordinary hotel room He was glad to see me I could tell that from his grip of welcome from his pleased face from the warmth in his voice from the eager way in which he hovered around me I sat down on a bed and he on a chair Now tell me all about it I said The room was very still and in its privacy following Benda s demonstrative welcome I expected some confidential revelations Therefore I was astonished There isn t much to tell he said gaily My work is congenial fascinating and there s enough of it to keep me out of mischief The pay is good and the life pleasant and easy I didn t know what to say for a moment I had come there with my mind made up that there was something suspicious afoot But he seemed thoroughly happy and satisfied I ll admit that I treated you a little shabbily in this matter of letters he continued I suppose it is because I ve had a lot of new and interesting problems on my mind and it s been hard to get my mind down to writing letters But I ve got a good start on my job and I ll promise to reform I was at a loss to pursue that subject any further Have you seen Smith and Francisco I asked He nodded How do they like it Both are enthusiastic about the wonderful opportunities in their respective fields It s a fact no engineer has ever before had such resources to work with on such a vast scale and with such a free hand We re laying the framework for a city of ten millions all thoroughly systematized and efficient There is no city in the world like it it s an engineer s dream of Utopia I was almost convinced There was only the tiniest of lurking suspicions that all was not well but it was not powerful enough to stimulate me to say anything But I did determine to keep my eyes open I might as well admit in advance that from that moment to the time when I left the Science Community four days later I saw nothing to confirm my suspicions I met Smith and Francisco at dinner and the four of us occupied a table to ourselves in a vast dining hall and no one paid for the meal nor for subsequent ones They also seemed content and talked enthusiastically of their work I was shown over the city through its neat efficient streets through its comfortable dormitories each housing hundreds of families as luxuriously as any modern hotel through its marvelous factories where production had passed the stage of labor and had assumed the condition of a devoted act of worship These factory workers were not toiling they were worshipping their God of Whom each machine was a part Touching their machine was touching their God This machinery while involving no new principles was developed and coordinated to a degree that exceeded anything I had ever seen anywhere else I saw the famous Science Temple in the shape of a huge dynamo generator with its interior decorations paintings carvings frescoes and pillars all worked out on the motive of machinery with its constant streams of worshippers in blue serge performing their conventional rites and saying their prayer formulas at altars in the forms of lathes microscopes motors and electron tubes You haven t become a Science Communist yourself I bantered Benda There was a metallic ring in the laugh he gave They d like to have me was all he said I was rather surprised at the emptiness of the large and well kept park to which Benda took me It was beautifully landscaped but only a few scattering people were there lost in its vast reaches These people seem to have no need of recreation Benda said They do not come here much But I confess that I need air and relaxation even if only for short snatches I ve been too busy to get away for long at a time but this park has helped me keep my balance I m here every day for at least a few minutes Beautiful place I remarked A lot of strange trees and plants I never saw before Oh mostly tropical forms common enough in their own habitats They have steam pipes under the ground to grow them I ve been trying to learn something about them Fancy me studying natural history I ve never cared for it but here where there is no such thing as recreation I have become intensely interested in it as a hobby I find it very much of a rest to study these plants and bugs Why don t you run up to New York for a few days Oh the time will come for that In the meanwhile I ve got an idea all of a sudden Speaking of New York will you do me a little service Even though you might think it silly I ll do anything I can I began eager to be of help to him It has been somewhat of a torture to me Benda continued to find so many of these forms which I am unable to identify I like to be scientific even in my play and reference books on plants and insects are scarce here Now if you would carry back a few specimens for me and ask some of the botany and zoology people to send me their names Fine I exclaimed I ve got a good sized pocket notebook I can carry them in Well then please put them in the order in which I hand them to you and send me the names by number I am pretty thoroughly familiar with them and if you will keep them in order there is no need for me to keep a list The first is a blade of this queer grass I filed the grass blade between the first two pages of my book The next is this unusual looking pinnate leaf He tore off a dry leaflet and handed me a stem with three leaflets irregularly disposed of it Now leave a blank page in your book That will help me remember the order in which they come Next came a flat insect which strangely enough had two legs missing on one side However Benda was moving so fast that I had to put it away without comment He kept darting about and handing me twigs of leaves little sticks pieces of bark insects not seeming to care much whether they were complete or not grass blades several dagger shaped locust thorns cross sections of curious fruits moving so rapidly that in a few moments my notebook bulged widely and I had to warn him that its hundred leaves were almost filled Well that ought to be enough he said with a sigh after his lively exertion You don t know how I ll appreciate your indulging my foolish little whim Say I exclaimed Ask something of me This it nothing I ll take it right over to the Botany Department and in a few days you ought to have a list of names fit for a Bolshevik One important caution he said If you disturb their order in the book or even the position on the page the names you send me will mean nothing to me Not that it will be any great loss he added whimsically I suppose I ve become a sort of fan on this like the business men who claim that their office work interferes with their golf We walked leisurely back toward the big dormitory It was while we were crossing a street that Benda stumbled and to dodge a passing truck had to catch my arm and fell against me I heard his soft voice whisper in my ear Get out of this town as soon as you can I looked at him in startled amazement but he was walking along shaking himself from his stumble and looking up and down the street for passing trucks As I was saying he said in a matter of fact voice we expect to reach the one and one quarter million mark this month I never saw a place grow so fast I felt a great leap of sudden understanding For a moment my muscles tightened but I took my cue Remarkable place I said calmly one reads a lot of half truths about it Too bad I can t stay any longer Sorry you have to leave he said in exactly the right tone of voice But you can come again How thankful I was for the forty years of playing and working together that had accustomed us to that sort of team work Unconsciously we responded to one another s cues Once our ability to play together had saved my life It was when we were in college and were out on a cross country hike together Benda suddenly caught my hand and swung it upward I recognized the gesture we were cheerleaders and worked together at football games and we had one stunt in which we swung our hands over our heads jumped about three feet and let out a whoop This was the stunt that he started out there in the country where we were by ourselves Automatically without thinking I swung my arms and leaped with him and yelled Only later did I notice the rattlesnake over which I had jumped I had not seen that I was about to walk right into it and he had noticed it too late to explain A flash of genius suggested the cheering stunt to him Communication is a science he had said and that was all the comment there was on the incident So now I followed my cue without knowing why nor what it was all about but confident that I should soon find out By noon I was on the bus on my way through the pass to meet the vehicle from Washington As the bus swung along a number of things kept jumbling through my mind Benda s effusive glee at seeing me and his sudden turning and bundling me off in a nervous hurry without a word of explanation his lined and worried face and yet his insistence on the joys of his work in The Science Community his obvious desire to be hospitable and play the good host and yet his evasiveness and unwillingness to chat intimately and discuss important thing as he used to Finally that notebook full of odd specimens bulging in my pocket And the memory of his words as he shook hands with me when I was stepping into the bus Long live the science of communication he had said Otherwise he was rather glum and silent I took out the book of specimens and looked at it His caution not to disturb the order and position of things rang in my ears The Science of Communication Two and two were beginning to make four in my mind All the way on the train from Washington to New York I could hardly keep my hands off the book I had definitely abandoned the idea of hunting up botanists and zoologists at Columbia Benda was not interested in the names of these things That book meant something else Some message The Science of Communication That suddenly explained all the contradictions in his behavior He was being closely watched Any attempt to tell me the things he wanted to say would be promptly recognized He had succeeded brilliantly in getting a message to me Now my part was to read it I felt a sudden sinking within me That book full of leaves bugs and sticks How could I make anything out of it There s the Secret Service I thought They are skilled in reading hidden messages It must be an important one worthy of the efforts of the Secret Service or he would not have been at such pains to get it to me But no The Secret Service is skilled at reading hidden messages but not as skilled as I am in reading my friend s mind Knowing Benda his clear intellect his logical methods will be of more service in solving this than all the experts of the Secret Service I barely stopped to eat dinner when I reached home I hurried to the laboratory building and laid out the specimens on white sheets of paper meticulously preserving order position and spacing To be on the safe side I had them photographed asking the photographer to vary the scale of his pictures so that all of the final figures would be approximately the same size Plate I shows what I had I was all a tremble when the mounted photographs were handed to me The first thing I did was to number the specimens giving each blank space also its consecutive number Certainly no one could imagine a more meaningless jumble of twigs leaves berries and bugs How could I read any message out of that Yet I had no doubt that the message concerned something of far more importance than Benda s own safety He had moved in this matter with astonishing skill and breathless caution yet I knew him to be reckless to the extreme where only his own skill was concerned I couldn t even imagine his going to this elaborate risk merely on account of Smith and Francisco Something bigger must be involved I stared at the rows of specimens Communication is a science Benda had said and it came back to me as I studied the bent worms and the beetles with two legs missing I was confident that the solution would be simple Once the key idea occurred to me I knew I should find the whole thing astonishingly direct and systematic For a moment I tried to attach some sort of heiroglyphic significance to the specimen forms in the writing of the American Indians a wavy line meant water an inverted V meant a wigwam But I discarded that idea in a moment Benda s mind did not work along the paths of symbolism It would have to be something mathematical rigidly logical leaving no room for guess work No sooner had the key idea occurred to me than the basic conception underlying all these rows of twigs and bugs suddenly flashed into clear meaning before me The simplicity of it took my breath away I knew it I said aloud though I was alone Very simple I was prepared for the fact that each one of the specimens represented a letter of the alphabet If nothing else their number indicated that Now I could see so clearly that the photographs shouted at me that each specimen consisted of an upright stem and from this middle stem projected side arms to the right and to the left and in various vertical locations on each side The middle upright stem contained these side arms in various numbers and combinations In five minutes I had a copy of the message translated into its fundamental characters as shown on Plate II Illustration Plate I The first grass blade was the simple upright stem the second three leaflets on their stem represented the upright portion with two arms to the left at the top and middle and one arm to the right at the top and so on That brought the message down to the simple and straightforward matter of a substitution cipher I was confident that Benda had no object in introducing any complications that could possibly be avoided as his sole purpose was to get to me the most readable message without getting caught at it I recollected now how cautious he had been to hand me no paper and how openly and obviously he had dropped each specimen into my book because he knew someone was watching him and expecting him to slip in a message He had as I could see now in the retrospect been conspicuously careful that nothing suspicious should pass from his hands to mine Illustration Plate II Substitution ciphers are easy to solve especially for those having some experience The method can be found in Edgar Allen Poe s Gold Bug and in a host of its imitators A Secret Service cipher man could have read it in an hour But I knew my friend s mind well enough to find a short cut I knew just how he would go about devising such a cipher in fact how ninety nine persons out of a hundred with a scientific education would do it If we begin adding horizontal arms to the middle stem from top to bottom and from left to right the possible characters can be worked out by the system shown on Plate III Illustration Plate III It is most logical to suppose that Benda would begin with the first sign and substitute the letters of the alphabet in order That would give us the cipher code shown on Plate IV It was all very quick work just as I had anticipated once the key idea had occurred to me The ease and speed of my method far exceeded that of Poe s method but of course was applicable only to this particular case Substituting letters for signs out of my diagram I got the following message AM PRISONER R PLANS CAPTURE OF N Y BY SEIZING POWER WATER AND PHONES THEN WORLD CONQUEST S O S Illustration Plate IV PART IV L Envoi By Peter Hagstrom M D My solution of the message practically ends the story Events followed each other from then on like bullets from a machine gun A wild drive in a taxicab brought me to the door of Mayor Anderson at ten o clock that night I told him the story and showed him my photographs Following that I spent many hours telling my story to and consulting with officers in the War Department Next afternoon photographic maps of the Science Community and its environs brought by airplanes during the forenoon were spread on desks before us A colonel of marines and a colonel of aviation sketched plans in notebooks After dark I sat in a transport plane with muffled exhaust and propellers slipping through the air as silently as a hawk About us were a dozen bombing planes and about fifty transports carrying a battalion of marines I am not an adventure loving man Though a cordon of husky marines about me was a protection against any possible danger yet stealing along through that wild valley in the Virginia mountains toward the dark masses of that fanatic city the silent progress of the long dark line through the night their mysterious disappearance one by one as we neared the city the creepy hair raising journey through the dark streets I shall never forget for the rest of my life the sinking feeling in my abdomen and the throbbing in my head But I wanted to be there for Benda was my lifelong friend I guided them to Rohan s rooms and saw a dozen dark forms slip in one by one Then we went on to the dormitory where Benda lived Benda answered our hammering at his door in his pajamas He took in the Captain s automatic and the bayonets behind me at a glance Good boy Hagstrom he said I knew you d do it There wasn t much time left I got my instructions about handling the New York telephone system to day As we came out into the street I saw Rohan handcuffed to two big marines and rows of bayonets gleaming in the darkness down the streets Every few moments a bright flare shot out from the planes in the sky until a squad located the power house and turned on all the lights they could find Illustration

none	none	 Have you ever stood on the seashore with the breakers rolling at your feet and imagined what the scene would be like if the ocean water were gone I have had a vision of that many times Standing on the Atlantic Coast gazing out toward Spain I can envisage myself not down at the sea level but upon the brink of a height Spain and the coast of Europe off there upon another height Sidenote Fantastic and sinister are the Lowlands into which Philip Grant descends on his dangerous assignment And the depths between Unreal landscape Mysterious realm which now we call the bottom of the sea 
4085-11515-0001	train-other-500	Worn and rounded crags bloated mud plains noisome reaches of ooze which once

4085-11515-0002	train-other-500	as Mount Everest towers above it Aeroplanes would fly down into them And I can imagine the settlement of these vast new realms

none	none	 let us enlarge the picture Let us create the Lowlands twenty thousand feet below the zero height the setting for a tale of adventure The romance of the mist shrouded deeps And the romance of little Jetta CHAPTER I The Secret Mission 
4085-11515-0009	train-other-500	I was twenty five years of age that May evening of twenty twenty when they sent me south into the Lowlands I had been in the National Detective Service Bureau and then was transferred to the Customs Department Atlantic Lowlands Branch I went alone it was best my commander thought
4085-11515-0010	train-other-500	An assignment needing diplomacy rather than a show of force It was nine P M when I catapulted from the little stage of Long Island airport A fair moonlit evening a moon just beyond the full rising to pale the eastern stars
4085-11515-0011	train-other-500	I climbed about a thousand feet swung over the headlands of the Hook and keeping in the thousand foot local lane took my course My destination lay some thirteen hundred miles southeast of Great New York I could do a good normal three ninety in this fleet little Wasp
none	none	 especially if I kept in the rarer air pressures over the zero height 
4085-11515-0012	train-other-500	The thousand foot lane had a southward drift this night I was making now well over four hundred I would reach Nareda soon after midnight The Continental Shelf slid beneath me dropping away as my course took me further from the Highland borders
4085-11515-0013	train-other-500	The Lowlands lay patched with inky shadows and splashes of moonlight Domes with upstanding rounded heads plateaus of naked black rock ten thousand feet below the zero height trenches like valleys ridged and pitted naked in places
4085-11515-0014	train-other-500	like a pockmarked lunar landscape Or again
none	none	 a pall of black mist would shroud it all 
4085-11515-0015	train-other-500	dark curtain of sluggish cloud with moonlight tinging its edges pallid green To my left eastward toward the great basin of the mid Atlantic Lowlands there was always a steady downward slope
none	none	 To the right it came up over the continental shelf to the Highlands of the United States There was often water to be seen in these Lowlands A spring fed lake far down in a caldron pit 
4085-11515-0016	train-other-500	spilling into a trench low lying land locked little seas canyons some of them dry
none	none	 others filled with tumultuous flowing water Or great gashes with water sluggishly flowing or standing with a heavy slime and a pall of uprising vapor in the heat of the night At thirty seven deg N and seventy deg W I passed over the newly named Atlas Sea A lake of water here more than a hundred miles in extent 
4085-11515-0017	train-other-500	Its surface lay fifteen thousand feet below the zero height its depth in places was a full three thousand It was clear of mist to night The moonlight shimmered on its rippled surface
none	none	 like pictures my father had often shown me of the former oceans I passed a little later well to the westward of the verdured mountain top of the Bermudas 
4085-11515-0018	train-other-500	There was nothing of this flight novel to me I had frequently flown over the Lowlands
none	none	 I had descended into them many times 
4085-11515-0019	train-other-500	But never upon such a mission as was taking me there now I was headed for Nareda capital village of the tiny Lowland Republic of Nareda which only five years ago
none	none	 came into national being as a protectorate of the United States Its territory lies just north of the mountain Highlands of Haiti 
4085-11515-0020	train-other-500	Santo Domingo and Porto Rico A few hundred miles of tumbled Lowlands embracing the turgid Nares Sea whose bottom is the lowest point of all the Western Hemisphere some thirty thousand feet below the zero height
4085-11515-0021	train-other-500	The village of Nareda is far down indeed I had never been there
none	none	 My charts showed it on the southern border of the Nares Sea 
4085-11515-0022	train-other-500	at minus twenty thousand feet with the Mona Valley behind it like a gash in the steep upward slopes to the Highlands of Porto Rico and Haiti Nareda has a mixed population of typical Lowland adventures among which the hardy Dutch predominate
none	none	 and Holland and the United States have combined their influence in the World Court 
4085-11515-0023	train-other-500	to give it national identity And out of this had arisen my mission now Mercury the quicksilver of commerce so recently come to tremendous value through its universal use in the new antiseptics
4085-11515-0024	train-other-500	which bid fair to check all human disease was being produced in Nareda The import duty into the United States was being paid openly enough But nevertheless Hanley s agents believed that smuggling was taking place
4085-11515-0025	train-other-500	It was to investigate this condition that Hanley was sending me I had introduction to the Nareda government officials I was to consult with Hanley by ether phone in seeking the hidden source of the contraband quicksilver but in the main
4085-11515-0026	train-other-500	to use my own judgment A mission of diplomacy I had no mind to pry openly among the people of these Lowland depths looking for smugglers I might indeed find them too unexpectedly
4085-11515-0027	train-other-500	Over curious strangers are not welcomed by the Lowlanders Many have gone into the depths and have never returned I was above the Nares Sea by midnight
none	none	 I was still flying a thousand feet over the zero height 
4085-11515-0028	train-other-500	Twenty one thousand feet below me lay the black expanse of water The moon had climbed well toward the zenith now Its silver shafts penetrated the hanging mist stratas The surface of the Nares Sea was visible dark and sullen looking
4085-11515-0029	train-other-500	I shifted the angles of incidence of the wings re set my propeller angles and made the necessary carburetor adjustments switching on the supercharger which would supply air at normal zero height pressure to the carburetors throughout my descent I swung over Nareda
4085-11515-0030	train-other-500	The lights of the little village far down dwarfed by distance showed like bleary winking eyes through the mists The jagged recesses of the Mona valley were dark with shadow The Nares Sea lay like some black monster asleep
4085-11515-0031	train-other-500	and slowly heavily panting Moonlight was over me with stars and fleecy white clouds Calm placid atmospheric night was up here But beneath it all seemed so mysterious fantastic sinister
none	none	 My heart was pounding as I put the Wasp into a spiral and forced my way down CHAPTER II The Face at the Window 
4085-11516-0000	train-other-500	With heavy sluggish engines I panted down and came to rest in the dull yellow glow of the field lights A new world here The field was flat caked ooze
none	none	 cracked and hardened It sloped upward from the shore toward where a quarter of a mile away 
4085-11516-0001	train-other-500	I could see the dull lights of the settlement blurred by the gathered night vapors The field operator shut off his permission signal and came forward He was a squat heavy set fellow in wide trousers
none	none	 and soiled white shirt flung open at his thick throat 
4085-11516-0002	train-other-500	The sweat streamed from his forehead This oppressive heat
none	none	 I had discarded my flying garb in the descent I wore a shirt knee length pants with hose and wide soled shoes 
4085-11516-0003	train-other-500	of the newly fashioned Lowland design What few weapons I dared carry were carefully concealed No alien could enter Nareda bearing anything resembling a lethal weapon My wide thick soled shoes did not look suspicious for one who planned much walking
4085-11516-0004	train-other-500	on the caked Lowland ooze But those fat soles were cleverly fashioned to hide a long keen knife blade like a dirk I could lift a foot and get the knife out of its hidden compartment with fair speed This I had in one shoe In the other
none	none	 was the small mechanism of a radio safety recorder and image finder 
4085-11516-0005	train-other-500	with its attendant individual audiophone transmitter and receiver A miracle of smallness these tiny contrivances With batteries wires
none	none	 and grids the whole device could lay in the palm of one s hand 
4085-11516-0006	train-other-500	Once past this field inspection I would rig it for use under my shirt strapped around my chest And I had some colored magnesium flares The field operator came panting Who are you Philip Grant From Great New York
none	none	 I showed him my name etched on my forearm He and his fellows searched me 
4085-11516-0007	train-other-500	but I got by You have no documents
none	none	 No My letter to the President of Nareda was written with invisible ink upon the fabric of my shirt If he had heated it to a temperature of one hundred eighty deg F or so and blown the fumes of hydrochloric acid upon it the writing would have come out plain enough I said You ll house and care for my machine 
4085-11516-0008	train-other-500	They would care for it They told me the price swindlingly exorbitant for the unwary traveller who might wander down here All correct I said cheerfully And half that much more for you and your men if you give me good service
4085-11516-0009	train-other-500	Where can I have a room and meals Spawn said the operator He is the best Fat bellied from his own good cooking Take him there Hugo I had a gold coin instantly ready and with a few additional directions regarding my flyer
4085-11516-0010	train-other-500	I started off It had been hot and oppressive standing in the field it was infinitely worse climbing the mud slope into the village
none	none	 but my carrier trudging in advance of me along the dark winding path up the slope 
4085-11516-0011	train-other-500	shouldered my bag and seemed not to notice the effort We passed occasional tube lights strung on poles They illumined the heavy rounded crags A tumbled region this slope which once was the ocean floor twenty thousand feet below the surface
4085-11516-0012	train-other-500	Rifts were here like gulleys
none	none	 little buttes reared their rounded dome heads 
4085-11516-0013	train-other-500	And there were caves and crevices in which deep sea fish once had lurked For ten minutes or so we climbed It was past the midnight hour the village was asleep We entered its outposts The houses were small structures of clay In the gloom
4085-11516-0014	train-other-500	they looked like drab little beehives set in unplanned groups with paths for streets wandering between them Then we came to a more prosperous neighborhood The street widened and straightened The clay houses still with rounded dome like tops stood back from the road
none	none	 with wooden front fences and gardens and shrubbery 
4085-11516-0015	train-other-500	The windows and doors were like round finger holes plugged in the clay by a giant hand Occasionally the windows dimly lighted stared like sleeping giant eyes There were flowers in all the more pretentious private gardens
4085-11516-0016	train-other-500	Their perfume hanging in the heavy night air lay on the village making one forget the over curtain of stenching mist Down by the shore of the Nares Sea
none	none	 this world of the depths had seemed darkly sinister But in the village now I felt it less ominous The scent of the flowers 
4085-11516-0017	train-other-500	the street lined in one place by arching giant fronds drowsing and nodding overhead
none	none	 there seemed a strange exotic romance to it The sultry air might almost have been sensuous 
4085-11516-0018	train-other-500	Much further Hugo No We are here He turned abruptly into a gateway
none	none	 led me through a garden and to the doorway of a large rambling one story building 
4085-11516-0019	train-other-500	The news of my coming had preceded me A front room was lighted my host was waiting
none	none	 Hugo set down my bag accepted another gold coin and with a queer sidelong smile the incentive for which I had not the slightest idea 
4085-11516-0020	train-other-500	he vanished I fronted my host this Jacob Spawn Strange fate that should have led me to Spawn And to little Jetta Spawn was a fat bellied Dutchman as the field attendant had said
4085-11516-0021	train-other-500	A fellow of perhaps fifty five with sparse gray hair and a heavy jowled smooth shaved face from which his small eyes peered stolidly at me He laid aside a huge old fashioned calabash pipe and offered a pudgy hand
4085-11516-0022	train-other-500	Welcome young man to Nareda Seldom do we see strangers The meal which he presently cooked and served me himself was lavishly done He spoke good English but slowly heavily with the guttural intonation of his race
4085-11516-0023	train-other-500	He sat across the table from me puffing his pipe while I ate What brings you here young lad A week you say Or more I don t know I m looking for oil There should be petroleum beneath these rocks For an hour I avoided his prying questions
none	none	 His little eyes roved me and I knew he was no fool this Dutchman for all his heavy stolid look We remained in his kitchen Save for its mud walls its concave dome roof 
4085-11516-0024	train-other-500	it might have been a cookery of the Highlands There was a table with its tube light the chairs his electron stove
none	none	 his orderly rows of pots and pans and dishes on a broad shelf 
4085-11516-0025	train-other-500	I recall that it seemed to me a woman s hand must be here But I saw no woman
none	none	 No one indeed beside Spawn himself seemed to live here He was reticent of his own business however much he wanted to pry into mine I had felt convinced that we were alone But suddenly I realized it was not so 
4085-11516-0026	train-other-500	The kitchen adjoined an interior back garden I could see it through the opened door oval a dim space of flowers a little path to a pergola an adobe fountain
4085-11516-0027	train-other-500	It was a sort of Spanish patio out there partially enclosed by the wings of the house Moonlight was struggling into it And as I gazed idly I thought I saw a figure lurking Someone watching us
none	none	 Was it a boy observing us from the shadowed moonlit garden 
4085-11516-0028	train-other-500	I thought so A slight half grown boy
none	none	 I saw his figure in short ragged trousers and a shirt blouse 
4085-11516-0029	train-other-500	made visible in a patch of moonlight as he moved away and entered the dark opposite wing of the house I did not see the boy s figure again and
none	none	 presently I suggested that I retire Spawn had already shown me my bedroom 
4085-11516-0030	train-other-500	It was in another wing of the house It had a window facing the front and a window and door back to this same patio
none	none	 And a door to the house corridor 
4085-11516-0031	train-other-500	Sleep well Meester Grant My bag was here on the table under an electrolier Shall I call you Yes I said Early He lingered a moment I was opening my bag I flung it wide under his gaze Well
4085-11516-0032	train-other-500	good night I shall be very comfortable thanks Good night he said He went out the patio door I watched his figure cross the moonlit path and enter the kitchen The noise of his puttering there sounded for a time
4085-11516-0033	train-other-500	Then the light went out and the house and garden fell into silence I closed my doors They sealed on the inside and I fastened them securely Then I fastened the transparent window panes I did not undress but lay on the bed in the dark I was tired
4085-11516-0034	train-other-500	I realized it now But sleep would not come I am no believer in occultism but there are premonitions which one cannot deny It seemed now as I lay there in the dark that I had every reason to be perturbed yet I could not think why
none	none	 Perhaps it was because I had been lying to this innkeeper stoutly for an hour past and whether he believed me or not for the life of me I could not now determine I sat up on the bed presently 
4085-11516-0035	train-other-500	and adjusted the wires and diaphragms of the ether wave mechanism When in place it was all concealed under my shirt As I switched it on the electrodes against my flesh tingled a little But it was absolutely soundless and one gets used to the tingle
none	none	 I decided to call Hanley The New York wave sorter handled me promptly but Hanley s office was dead As I sat there in the darkness annoyed at this 
4085-11516-0036	train-other-500	a slight noise forced itself on me A scratching a tap something outside my window Spawn come back to peer in at me I slipped noiselessly from the bed The sound had come from the window which faced the patio
4085-11516-0037	train-other-500	The room over by the bed was wholly dark The moonlight outside showed the patio window as a dimly illumined oval For a moment I crouched on the floor by the bed No sound The silence of the Lowlands is as heavy and oppressive as its air
4085-11516-0038	train-other-500	I felt as though my heart were audible I lifted my foot extracted my dirk It opened into a very businesslike steel blade of a good twelve inch length I bared the blade
4085-11516-0039	train-other-500	The click of it leaving the flat hollow handle sounded loud in the stillness of the room A moment
none	none	 Then it seemed that outside my window a shadow had moved I crept along the floor Rose up suddenly at the window And stared at a face peering in at me A small face framed by short clustering dark curls A girl CHAPTER III In a Moonlit Garden She drew back from the window like a startled fawn timorous yet curious too 
4085-11517-0000	train-other-500	for she ran only a few steps then turned and stood peering The moonlight slanted over the western roof of the building and fell on her A slight boyish figure in short tattered trousers and a boy s shirt open at her slim rounded throat
4085-11517-0001	train-other-500	The moonlight gleamed on the white shirt fabric to show it torn and ragged Her arms were upraised her head with clustering flying dark curls was tilted as though listening for a sound from me A shy wild creature
4085-11517-0002	train-other-500	Drawn to my window tapping to awaken me then frightened at what she had done I opened the garden door She did not move
none	none	 I thought she would run but she did not 
4085-11517-0003	train-other-500	The moonlight was on me as I stood there I was conscious of its etching me with its silver sheen And twenty feet from me this girl stood and gazed with startled eyes and parted lips and white limbs trembling like a frightened animal
4085-11517-0004	train-other-500	The patio was very silent The heavy arching fronds stirred slightly with a vague night breeze the moonlight threw a lacy dark pattern of them on the gray stone path The fountain bowl gleamed white in the moonlight behind the girl
none	none	 and in the silence I could hear the low splashing of the water 
4085-11517-0005	train-other-500	A magic moment Unforgettable It comes to some of us just once but to all of us it comes I stood with its spell upon me Then I heard my voice tense but softly raised
4085-11517-0006	train-other-500	Who are you It frightened her
none	none	 She retreated until the fountain was between us And as I took a step forward she retreated further noiseless with her bare feet treading the smooth stones the path 
4085-11517-0007	train-other-500	I ran and caught her at the doorway of the flowered pergola She stood trembling as I seized her arms But the timorous smile remained and her eyes upraised to mine glowed with misty starlight Who are you
4085-11517-0008	train-other-500	This time she answered me I am called Jetta It seemed that from her white forearm within my grasp a magic current swept from her to me and back again We humans for all our clamoring boasting intellectuality
4085-11517-0009	train-other-500	are no more than puppets in Nature s hands Are you Spawn s daughter Yes I saw you a while ago when I was having my meal Yes I was watching you
none	none	 I thought you were a boy Yes My father told me to keep away I wanted to meet you so I came to wake you up 
4085-11517-0010	train-other-500	He may be watching us now No He is sleeping
none	none	 Listen you can hear him snore 
4085-11517-0011	train-other-500	I could indeed The silence of the garden was broken now by a distant choking snore We both laughed She sat on the little mossy seat in the pergola doorway And on the side away from the snore I had the wit to be sure of that
none	none	 I wanted to meet you she repeated Was it too bold 
4085-11517-0012	train-other-500	I think that what we said sitting there with the slanting moonlight on us could not have amounted to much Yet for us it was so important Vital Building memories which I knew
none	none	 and I think that she knew even then 
4085-11517-0013	train-other-500	we would never forget I will be here a week Jetta I want I want very much to know you
none	none	 I want you to tell me about the world of the Highlands I have a few books I can t read very well but 
4085-11517-0014	train-other-500	I can look at the pictures Oh I see A traveler gave them to me I ve got them hidden But he was an old man all men seem to be old except those in the pictures and you Philip I laughed
4085-11517-0015	train-other-500	Well that s too bad I m mighty glad I m young Ah in that moment with blessed youth surging in my veins I was glad indeed Young I don t remember ever seeing anyone like you The man I am to marry is not like you He is old like father
4085-11517-0016	train-other-500	I drew back from her startled Marry Yes When I am seventeen The law of Nareda
none	none	 your Highland law too father says will not let a girl be married until she is that age 
4085-11517-0017	train-other-500	In a month I am seventeen
none	none	 Oh And I stammered But why are you going to marry Because father tells me to And then I shall have fine clothes it is promised me And go to live in the Highlands perhaps And see things and be a woman 
4085-11517-0018	train-other-500	not a ragged boy forbidden to show myself and I was barely touching her It seemed as though something some vision of happiness which had been given me were fading were being snatched away I was conscious of my hand moving to touch hers
none	none	 Why do you marry unless you re in love Are you Her gaze like a child came up to meet mine I never thought much about that 
4085-11517-0019	train-other-500	I have tried not to It frightened me until to night She pushed me gently away Don t Let s not talk of him I d rather not But why are you dressed as a boy I gazed at her slim but rounded figure in tattered boy s garb
4085-11517-0020	train-other-500	but the woman s lines were unmistakable And her face with clustering curls Gentle girlhood A face of dark wild beauty My father hates women He says they are all bad
4085-11517-0021	train-other-500	It is a sin to wear woman s finery or it breeds sin in women Let s not talk of that Philip tell me
none	none	 oh if you could only realize all the things I want to know In Great New York there are theatres and music 
4085-11517-0022	train-other-500	Yes I said And began telling her about them The witching of this moonlit garden But the moon had presently sunk and to the east the stars were fading Philip Look Why it s dawn already I ve got to leave you I held her just a moment by the hand
none	none	 May I meet you here to morrow night I asked Yes she said simply Good night Jetta Good night You you ve made me very happy 
4085-11517-0023	train-other-500	She was gone into a doorway of the opposite wing The silent empty garden sounded with the distant reassuring snores of the still sleeping Spawn I went back to my room and lay on my bed
4085-11517-0024	train-other-500	And drifted off on a sea of magic memories The world my world before this night now seemed to have been so drab Empty Lifeless But now there was pulsing living magic in it for me I drifted into sleep
none	none	 thinking of it CHAPTER IV The Mine in the Cauldron Depths I was awakened by the tinkling buzzing call of the radio diaphragm beneath my shirt I had left the call open It was Hanley I lay down eyeing my window which now was illumined by the flat light of dawn Hanley s microscopic voice Phil I ve just raised President Markes there in Nareda I ve been a bit worried about you I m all right Chief Well you d better see President Markes this morning That was my intention Tell him frankly what you re after This smuggling of quicksilver from Nareda has got to stop But take it easy Phil don t be reckless Remember one little knife thrust and I ve lost a good man I laughed at his anxious tone That was always Hanley s way A devil himself when he was on a trail but always worried for fear one of his men would come to harm Right enough Chief I ll be careful He cut off presently I did not see Jetta that morning I told Spawn I was hoping to see President Markes on my petroleum proposition And at the proper hour I took myself to the government house This Lowland village by daylight seemed even more fantastic than shrouded in the shadows of night The morning sun had dissipated the overhead mists It was hot in the rocky streets under the weird overhanging vegetation The settlement was quietly busy with its tropical activities There were a few local shops vehicles with the Highland domestic animals horses and oxen panting in the heat an occasional electro automatic car But there were not many evidences of modernity here The street and house tube lights A few radio image finders on the house tops An automatic escalator bringing ore from a nearby mine past the government checkers to an aero stage for northern transportation Cultivated fields in the village outskirts operated with modern machinery But beyond that it seemed primitive Two hundred years back Street vendors People in primitive ragged tropical garb Half naked children I was stared at curiously An augmenting group of children followed me as I went down the street The President admitted me at once In his airy office with safeguards against eavesdropping I found him at his desk with a bank of modern instruments before him Sit down Grant He was a heavy set flabby man of sixty odd this Lowland President White hair and an old fashioned rolling white mustache of the sort lately come into South American fashion He sat with a
4110_11528_000021_000001	train-clean-360	 glass 
none	none	of iced drink at his side His uniform was stiffly white and ornate with heavy gold braid but his neckpiece was wilted with perspiration Damnable heat Grant Yes Sir President Have a drink He swung a tinkling glass before me Now then tell me what is your trouble Smuggling here in Nareda I don t believe it His eyes incongruously alert with all the rest of him so fat and lazy twinkled at me We of the Nareda Government watch our quicksilver production very closely The government fee is a third I might say that the Nareda government collected a third on all the mineral and agricultural products of the country in exchange for the necessary government concessions Markes exported this share openly to the world markets paying the duty exactly like a private corporation He added You think Hanley thinks the smuggling is on too large a scale to be any illicit producer I nodded Then he said it must be one of our recognized mines Hanley thinks it is a recognized mine falsifying its production record I explained If that is so I will discover it he said He spoke with enthusiasm and vigor For you I shall treat as what you are the representative of our most friendly government The figures of our quicksilver production I shall lay before you in just a few days Let me fill up your glass Grant The lazy tropics I really did not doubt his sincerity But I did doubt his ability to cope with any clever criminal His enthusiasm for action would wilt like his neckpiece in Nareda s heat Unless perhaps the knowledge that the smuggler was cheating him as well as the United States that might spur him He added and now I got a shock wholly unexpected If we think that some recognized producer of quicksilver here is cheating us it should not be difficult to check up on it Nareda has only one large cinnabar lode being worked A private individual that fellow Jacob Spawn Spawn I exclaimed involuntarily Why yes Did not he mention it His mine is no more than ten kilometers from here back on the southern slope He didn t mention it I said So That is strange but he is a secretive Dutchman by nature He specializes in prying into the other fellow s affairs Hm m He fell into a reverie while I stared at him Spawn the big the only big quicksilver producer here The President interrupted my startled thoughts I hope you did not intimate your real purpose No We both turned at the sound of an opening door Markes called Ah come in Perona Are you alone Good Close that slide Here is Chief Hanley s representative He introduced us all in a breath This is interesting Perona Damnably interesting We re being cheated what It looks that way Sit down Perona This was Greko Perona Nareda s Minister of Internal Affairs Spawn had mentioned him to me A South American A man in his fifties Thin and darkly saturnine with iron gray hair carefully plastered to cover his half bald head He sat listening to the President s harangue twirling the upturned waxen ends of his artificially black mustache A wave of perfume enveloped him A ladies courtier this Perona by the look of him His white uniform was immaculate carefully tailored and carefully worn to set off at its best his still trim and erect figure Well he said when at last the President paused of a surety something must be done Perona seemed not excited rather more carefully watchful of his own words and of me His small dark eyes roved me What is it you would plan to do about it Senorito An irony was in that Latin diminutive He spread his pale hands Your United States officials perhaps exaggerate I am very doubtful if we have smugglers here in Nareda Unless it is Spawn the President interjected Perona frowned slightly But his suave manner remained Spawn Why Spawn You need not take offense Perona Markes retorted We are discussing this before an envoy of the United States sent here to consult with us We have nothing to hide Markes turned to me And his next words were like a bomb exploding at my feet Perona is offended Grant But I promise you his natural personal prejudice will not affect my investigation Of course he is prejudiced since he is to marry Spawn s daughter the little Jetta I started involuntarily This pomaded old dotard This perfumed ancient dandy For all the importance of my mission in Nareda my thoughts had been subconsciously more upon Jetta far more than upon smugglers of quicksilver This palsied popinjay This the reality of the specter which had been between Jetta and me during all that magic time in the moonlit garden This suave old rake Betrothed to that woodland pixie whose hand I had held and to whom I had sung love songs in the magic flower scented moonlight only a few hours ago And whom I had promised to meet there again to night This then was my rival Nothing of importance transpired during the remainder of that interview Markes reiterated his intention of making a complete governmental investigation at once To which Perona suavely assented Por Dios Senorito he said to me we would not have your great government annoyed at Nareda If there are smugglers we will capture them of a certainty From the Government House it now being almost time for the midday meal I returned to Spawn s The rambling mud walls of the Inn stood baking in the noonday heat when I arrived The outer garden drowsed there seemed no one about I went through the main door oval into the front public room where first I had met Spawn He was not here now nor was Jetta A sudden furtiveness fell upon me With noiseless steps I went the length of the dim padded interior corridor to my own room My belongings seemed undisturbed a vague idea that Spawn might have seized this opportunity to ransack them had come to me But it seemed not though if he had he would have found nothing I stood for a moment listening at my patio window I could see the kitchen from here there was no one in it I started back for the living room That furtive instinct was still on me I made no noise And abruptly I heard Spawn s voice floating out softly in the hushed silence of the house So Perona A brief silence in which it seemed that I could hear a tiny aerial answer Then Spawn again A startled oath De duvel You say I stood frozen listening She is here Yes I will keep her close I am no fool Perona Spawn s laugh was like a growl Later to day yes Fear not I am no fool I will be careful of it Spawn talking by private audiphone to Perona The colloquy came to an abrupt end Might eavesdrop By hell you are right I heard the click as Spawn and Perona broke connection Spawn came from his room But he was not quick enough I slipped away before he saw me In the living room I had time to be calmly seated with a lighted cigarette His approaching heavy footsteps sounded He came in Oh Grant Good noon friend Spawn I m hungry I grinned at him I understand my bargain with you included a noonday meal Does it He eyed me suspiciously Have you been waiting here long No I just came in He led me to the kitchen He apologized for the informality of his hotel service visitors were so infrequent But the good quality of his food would make up for it Right I agreed Your food is marvelous friend Spawn There was a difference in Spawn s manner toward me now He seemed far more wary Outwardly he was in a high good humor He asked nothing concerning my morning at the Government House He puttered over his electron stove making me help him he cursed the heat he said one could not eat in such heat as this but the meal he cooked and the way he sat down opposite me and attacked it belied him He was acting but so was I And perhaps I deceived him as little as he deceived me We avoided the things which were uppermost in the thoughts of us both But when we had very nearly finished the meal I decided to try him out I said suddenly out of a silence Spawn why didn t you tell me you were a producer of quicksilver I shot him a sharp glance You are aren t you It took him by surprise but he recovered himself instantly Yes Are you interested I tried another shot What surprised me was that a wealthy mine owner you are aren t you should bother to keep an unprofitable hotel Why bother with it Spawn I thought I knew the answer he wanted Nareda s visitors under his eyes That is a pleasure There was irony in his tone I am a lonesome man I like interesting companionship such as yours young Grant It was on my tongue to hint at his daughter But I thought better of it I am going to the mine now he said abruptly Would you like to come Yes I smiled Thanks I wanted to see his mine But that he should be eager to show it surprised me I wondered what purpose he could have in that I had a hint of it later for when we took his little autocar and slid up the winding road into the bloated crags towering on the slope behind Nareda he told me calmly I shall have to put you in charge of my mine commander I am busy elsewhere this afternoon You will see the mine just as well without me He added I must go to the Government House President Markes wants a report on my recent production So that was what Perona had told him over the audiphone just before our noonday meal It was an inferno of shadows and glaring lights this underground cavern As modern mining activities go it was small and primitive No more than a dozen men were here beside the sweating pudgy mine commander who was my guide A voluble fellow of what original nationality I could not determine We stood watching the line of carts dumping the ore onto the endless lifting belt It went a hundred feet or so up and out of the cavern s ascending shaft to fall with a clatter into the bins above the smelter Rich ore I said Isn t it The cinnabar ran like thick blood red veins in the rock Rich said the mine commander That it is Rich But who does it make rich Only Spawn not me He waved his arms airing his grievance with which for an hour past he had regaled me Only Spawn For me a dole each week The smelter was in a stone building one of a small group of mine houses which stood in a cauldron depression above excavations Rounded domes of rock towered above them The sun even at this tri noon hour was gone behind the heights above us The murky shadows of night were gathering the mists of the Lowlands settling The tube lights of the mine strung between small metal poles winked on like bleary eyes Of a day soon I will fling this job to hell I was paying scant attention to the fellow s tirade Could there be smuggling going on from this mine It all seemed to be conducted openly enough If the production record were being falsified I felt that this dissatisfied mine commander was not aware of it He showed me the smelter where the quicksilver condensed in the coils and ran with its small luminous silver streams into the vats He was called away momentarily by one of his men leaving me standing there I was alone no one seemed in sight or within hearing In the shadow of the condensers I drew out my transmitter and called Hanley I got him within a minute Chief Yes Phil I hoped you d call me Didn t want to chance it raising you when you might not be alone I told him swiftly what I had done where I was now And Hanley said with equal briskness I ve an important fact Just had Markes on secret wave length He tells me that Spawn has been saving up his quicksilver for six months past He s got several hundred thousand dollar standards worth of it in ingots there right now Here at the mine Yes Got them all radiuminized ready for the highest priced markets Markes says he is scheduled to turn them over to the government checkers to morrow The Nareda government takes its share to morrow then Spawn exports the rest I heard a footstep Off Chief I ll call you later I clicked off summarily The little grid was under my shirt when the mine commander rejoined me For another half hour or to I hovered about the smelter house A treasure of quicksilver ingots here I mentioned it casually to my companion He shot me a sharp glance Spawn has told you that I heard it His business We do not talk of that Never can I tell what Spawn will choose to take offense at We rambled upon other subjects Later he said We work not at night But Spawn he is here often at night with his friend the Senor Perona That caught my attention I met Perona this morning I said

none	none	Is he a partner of Spawn s If he is so I never was told it But much he is here at night Why at night The fellow really knew nothing Or if he did he was diplomatic enough not to jeopardize his post by babbling of it to me He said Perona is Spawn s friend Why not His daughter to marry that will make him a son in law He laughed An old fool but not such a fool either Spawn is rich His daughter Has he a daughter The little Jetta You haven t seen her Well that is not strange Spawn keeps her very hidden A mystery about it all Nareda talks but no one knows and Spawn does not like questions Spawn abruptly joined us He came from the black shadows of the lurid smelter room Had he heard us discussing Jetta I wondered CHAPTER V Mysterious Meeting Ah Grant have you enjoyed yourself He dismissed his subordinate I was detained Sorry He was smoothly imperturbable Have you seen everything Quite a little plant I have here We shut down early to day I will make ready to close I followed him about while he arranged for the termination of the day s activities The clatter of the smelter house was presently still the men departing Spawn and I were the last to leave save for the eight men who were the mine s night guards They were stalwart silent fellows armed with electronic needle projectors The lights of the mine went low until they were mere pencil points of blue illumination in the gloom The eery look of the place was intensified by the darkness and silence of the abnormally early nightfall The fantastic crags stood dark with formless shadow Spawn stopped to speak to one of the guards The men wore a gold trimmed but now dirty white linen uniform wilted by the heat the uniform of Nareda s police I remarked it to him The government lent me the men Spawn explained Of an ordinary time I have only one guard But this then is not an ordinary time I hinted He looked at me sharply And upon sudden impulse I added President Markes said something about you having a treasure here Radiumized quicksilver It was evidently Spawn s desire to appear thoroughly frank with me He laughed Well then if Markes has told you then might I not as well admit it The treasure is here indeed yes Will you like to see it He led me into a little strong room adjoining the smelter coil rectifiers He flashed his hand searchlight On the floor piled crosswise were small moulded bars of refined quicksilver dull darkened silver ingots of this world s most precious metal Quite a treasure Grant here to night See it is radiumized He snapped off his torch In the darkness the little bars glowed irridescent To morrow I will divide with our Nareda government One third for them And my own share I will export to Great New York this shipment Already I have the order for it He added calmly The duty is high Grant Too bad your big New York market is protected by so large a duty With my cost of production these accursed Lowland workmen who demand so much for their labor and a third of all I produce taken by Nareda there is not much in it for me He had re lighted the room I could feel his eyes on me but I said nothing It was obvious to me now that he knew I was a government customs agent I said This certainly interests me friend Spawn I ll tell you why some other time We exchanged significant glances both of us smiling Well can I guess it young Grant So here is my treasure Without the duty I would soon be wealthy Chut Why should I roll in a pity for myself There is a duty and I am an honest man so I pay it I said Aren t you afraid to leave this stored here I knew that this pile of ingots the quicksilver in its radiumized form was worth four or five hundred thousand dollars in American gold coin at the very least Spawn shrugged Who would attack it But of course I will be glad to be rid of it It is a great responsibility even though it carries international insurance to protect my and the Nareda Government share He was sealing up the heavy barred portals of the little strong room There was an alarm detector connected with the office of Nareda s police commander Spawn set the alarm carefully I have every safeguard Grant There is really no danger He added as though with sudden thought Except possibly one a depth bandit named De Boer Ever you have heard of him Yes I have We climbed into Spawn s small automatic vehicle The lights of the mine faded behind us as we coasted the winding road down to the village De Boer said Spawn A fellow who lives by his wits in the depths Near here perhaps who knows They say he has many followers fifty a hundred perhaps outlaws a cut belly band it must be Didn t he once take a hand in Nareda s politics I suggested Spawn guffawed That is so He was once what they called a patriot here He thought he might be made President But Markes ran him out Now he is a bandit I have believe that American mail ship which sank last year in the cauldron north of the Nares Sea you remember how it was attacked by bandits I have always believe that was De Boer s band We rolled back to Nareda Spawn s manner had again changed He seemed even more friendly than before More at his ease with me We had supper and smoked together in his living room for half an hour afterward But my thoughts were more on Jetta than on her father There was still no evidence of her about the premises Ah if I only had known what had taken place there at Spawn s that afternoon while I was at the mine Soon after supper Spawn yawned I think I shall go to bed His glance was inquiring What are you going to do I stood up I ll go to bed too Markes wants to see me early in the morning You ll be there Spawn Yes We will go together It was still no more than eight o clock in the evening Spawn followed me to my bedroom and left me at its door Sleep well I will call you in time Thanks Spawn I wondered if there were irony in his voice as he said good night No one could have told I did not go to bed I sat listening to the silence of my room and the garden and Spawn s retreating footsteps He had said he was sleepy but nevertheless I presently heard him across the patio He was apparently in the kitchen cleaning away our meal to judge by the rattling of his pans It was as yet not much after hour eight of the evening The hours before my tryst with Jetta seemed an interminable time to wait She might not come though I was afraid until midnight At all events I felt that I had some hours yet And it occurred to me that the evening was not yet too far advanced for me to call upon Perona He lived not far from here I had learned I wanted to see this beribboned old Minister of Nareda s Internal Affairs I would use as my excuse a desire to discuss further the possibility of smuggler being here in Nareda I put on my hat and a light jacket verified that my dirk was readily accessible and sealed up my room Spawn apparently was still in the kitchen I got out of the house I felt sure without him being aware of it The Nareda streets were quiet There was a few pedestrians and none of them paid much attention to me It was no more than ten minutes walk to Perona s home His house was set back from the road surrounded by luxurious vegetation There was a gate in front of the garden and another a hundred feet or to along a small alleyway which bordered the ground to my left I was about to enter the front gate when sight of a figure passing under the garden foliage checked me It was a man evidently coming from the house and headed toward the side gate He went through a shaft of light that slanted from one of the lower windows of the house Perona I was sure it was he His slight figure with a gay tri cornered hat A short tasseled cloak hanging from his shoulders He was alone walking fast He evidently had not seen me I crouched outside the high front wall and through its lattice bars I saw him reach the side gate open it swiftly pass through and close it after him There was something furtive about his manner for all he was undisguised I decided to follow him The front street fortunately was deserted at the moment I waited long enough for him to appear But he did not and when I ran to the alley corner chancing bumping squarely into him I saw him far down its dim narrow length where it opened into the back street which bordered his grounds to the rear He turned to the left and shot a swift glance up the alley which I anticipated provided for by drawing back When I looked again he was gone I have had some experience at playing the shadow But it was not easy here along the almost deserted and fairly bright Nareda streets Perona was walking swiftly down the slope toward the outskirts of the village where it bordered upon the Nares Sea For a time I thought he was headed for the landing field but at a cross path he turned sharply to the right away from the field whose sheen of lights I could now see down the rocky defile ahead of me There was nothing but broken precipitous rocky country ahead of him into which this path he had taken was winding What could Perona a Minister be engaged in wandering off alone into this black deserted region It was black indeed by now The village was soon far behind us A storm was in the night air a wind off the sea solid black clouds overhead blotted out the moon and stars The crags and buttes and gullies of this tumbled area loomed barely visible about me There were times when only my feel of the path under my feet kept me from straying to fall into a ravine or crevice I prowled perhaps two hundred yards behind Perona He was using a tiny hand flash now it bobbed and winked in the darkness ahead vanishing sometimes when a curve in the path hid him or when he plunged down into a gully and up again I had no search beam Nor would I have dared use one Perona could too obviously have seen that someone was following him There was half a mile of this I think though it seemed interminable I could hear the sea rising with the wind pounding against the rocks to my left Then a distance ahead I saw lights moving Perona s and others Three or four of them Their combined glow made a radiance which illumined the path and rocks I could see the figures of several men whom Perona had joined They stood a moment and then moved off To the right a ragged cliff wall towered the path The spots of light bobbed toward it I caught the vague outline of a huge broken opening like a cave mouth in the cliff The lights were swallowed by it I crept cautiously forward CHAPTER VI Ether wave Eavesdropping I had thought it was a cavern mouth into which the men had disappeared but it was not I reached it without any encounter It loomed above me a great archway in the cliff an opening fifty feet high and equally as broad And behind it was a roofless cave a sort of irregularly circular bowl five hundred feet across its broken bowlder strewn caked ooze floor I crouched in the blackness under the archway The moon had risen and its light filtered with occasional shafts through the swift flying black clouds overhead The scene was brighter It was dark in the archway but a glow of moonlight in the bowl beyond showed me its tumbled floor and the precipitous eroded walls like a crater rim which encircled it The men whom Perona had met were across the bowl near its opposite side I could see the group of them five hundred feet from me by a little moonlight that was on them also by the sheen from the spots of their hand lights Four or five men and Perona I thought I distinguished the aged Minister sitting on a rock and before him a huge giant man s figure striding up and down Perona seemed talking vehemently the men were listening the giant paused occasionally in his pacing to fling a question All this I saw with my first swift glance My attention was drawn from the men to an object near them The nose of a flyer showed between two upstanding crags on the floor of the valley Only its forward horizontal propellers and the tip of its cabin and landing gear were visible but I could guess that it was a fair sized ship The men were too far away for me to hear them Could I get across the floor of the bowl without discovery It did not seem so The accursed moonlight became stronger every moment Then I saw a guard a dark figure of a man showing just inside the archway some seventy feet from me He was leaning against a rock facing my way In his hands was a thick barreled electronic projector I could not advance that was obvious The moonlight lay in a clear clean patch beyond the archway The guard stood at its edge A minute or two had passed Perona was still talking vehemently I was losing it not a word was audible Yet I felt that if I could hear Perona now much that Hanley and I wanted to learn would be made clear to us My little microphone receiver could be adjusted for audible air vibrations I crouched and held it cautiously above my head with its face like a listening ear turned toward the distant men My single vacuum amplification brought up the sound until their voices sounded like whispers murmured in my ear grids De Boer listen to me Perona s voice They must have been chance words spoken loudly It was all I could hear save tantalizing unintelligible murmurs So this was De Boer the bandit The big fellow pacing before Perona I wanted infinitely more now to hear what was being said I thought of Hanley There might be a way of handling this I had to murmur very softly I was hidden in these shadows from the guard s sight but he was close enough to hear my normal voice I chanced it A wind was sucking through the archway with an audible whine the guard might not hear me X two AY The sorter s desk He came in I murmured Hanley s rating Rush Danger Special It went swiftly through Hanley thank Heaven was at his desk I plugged in my little image finder held it over my head turned it slowly I whispered Look around Chief See where I am Near Nareda couple of miles out Followed Perona he met these men The big one is De Boer the depth bandit I can t hear what they re saying but I can send you their voice murmurs Amplify them all you can Relay them up Hanley ordered I caught Perona s murmurs again I swung them through my tiny transformers and off my transmitter points into the ether Hear them Chief Yes I ll try further amplification It was what I had intended Hanley s greater power might be able to amplify those murmurs into audible strength I m getting them Phil He swung them back to me Grotesquely distorted blurred with tube hum and interference crackle they roared in my ear grids so loudly that I saw the nearby guard turn his head as though startled Listening But evidently he concluded it was nothing I cut down the volume Hanley switched in By God Phil This Off Chief Let me hear too He cut away Those distorted voices They came from Perona and the bandits to me across this five hundred foot moonlit bowl from me thirteen hundred miles up to Hanley s instruments and back to me once more But the words most of them now were distinguishable Perona s voice I tell it to you De Boer and a good chance for you to make the money But will they pay Of course they will pay Big A ransom princely And why Perona Why princely Who is this fellow so important He is with rich business men I tell to you A private citizen And a private citizen of a surety Fool Have you come to be a coward De Boer Pah Well then I tell you it is a lifetime chance All of it I have arranged If he was a government agent that would be very different for they are very keen this administration of the American government to protect their agents But their private citizens it is a scandal Do you not ever pick the newscasters reports De Boer Has it not been a scandal that this administration does very little for its citizens abroad And you want to get rid of this fellow Why Perona That is not your concern The ransom is to be all yours Make away with him in the depths somewhere Demand your ransom Fifty thousand gold standards Demand it of me Of Nareda And you will pay it I promise it Nareda will pay it and Nareda will collect the ransom from the American capitalists Very easy His voice fell lower Between us you will get the ransom money from Nareda and then kill your prisoner if you like Call it an accident what matter And dead men are silent men De Boer I will see that no real pursuit is made after you They were talking about me It was obvious Questions rushed at me Perona planning with this bandit to abduct me Hold me for ransom Or kill me But Perona knew that I was not a private citizen He was lying to De Boer to persuade him Why this attack upon me Was Spawn in on it Why were they so anxious to get rid of me Because of Jetta Or because I was dangerous prying into their smuggling activities Or both De Boer Get up with my men through the streets to Spawn s house You have it fixed Yes Over the route from here as I told you there are no police to night I have ordered them off In the garden Dios You offer so many objections I tell you all is fixed In an hour half an hour even now perhaps the Americano is in the garden The girl has promised to meet him there He will be there fear not Will you go Yes Hah That is the De Boer I have always admired I could see them in the moonlight across the pit Perona now standing up the giant figure of the bandit towering over him Hanley s microscopic voice cut in Getting it Phil To seize you for ransom Yes I hear it This girl Who Wait Chief Off De Boer I will do it Fifty thousand Perona An hour now Spawn will be at his home asleep And you will go to the mine Yes Now from here You seize this fellow Grant and then attack the mine Our regular plan De Boer This does not change it Attack Spawn s mine Half a million of treasure was there to night Perona was chuckling You give Spawn s guards the signal They are all my men in my pay They will run away when you appear Hanley cut in again By the gods they re after that treasure Phil listen to me you must His voice faded Chief I can t hear you Hanley came again And I will notify Porto Rico The local patrol will be about ready to leave Or notify Nareda headquarters I suggested If you can get President Markes he can send some police to the mine And find all Nareda s police bribed by Perona I ll get Porto Rico We have an hour or two the patrol can reach you in an hour The bandits were preparing to leave here Two or three of them had gone to the flyer Perona and De Boer were parting Well that is all De Boer Right Senor Perona I will start shortly On foot by the street route to Spawn s Hanley s hurried voice came back I ve sent the call to Porto Rico The guard had moved again He was no more than forty feet away from me now standing up gazing directly toward where I was crouching over my tiny instruments in the shadows of the rocky arch A footstep sounded behind me on the path outside the arch Someone approaching A tiny light bobbing Then a voice calling Perona De Boer The guard took a step forward stopped with levelled weapon Then the voice again it was so loud it went through my opened relay flashed up to New York and blew out half a dozen of Hanley s attuned vacuums Perona Spawn s voice He was coming toward me I lay prone my little grids switched off I held my breath Spawn s figure went past within ten feet of me But he did not see me He met the guard Hello Gutierrez The damned American Perona and De Boer came hastening Spawn joined them in the moonlight just beyond the archway close enough for me to hear them plainly Spawn was out of breath panting from his swift walk He greeted them with a roar The American he is gone Dios Gone where Spawn The hell how do I know Perona He is gone from his room from the house Maybe he followed you here Did he CHAPTER VII Behind the Sealed Door There was a moment when I think I might have escaped unseen from that archway But I was too amazed at Spawn s appearance to think of my own situation I had believed that Perona was plotting against Spawn meeting these bandits in this secret place I had just heard them planning to attack Spawn s mine to rob it of the treasure doubtless which I knew was stored there But I realized now it was not a plot against Spawn He had come here swiftly to join Perona and tell him that I their intended victim was missing He had greeted the bandit guard by name He seemed indeed as well known to these bandits as Perona himself They stood now in a group some thirty feet away from me I could hear their excited voices perfectly clearly My instruments were off but I recall that as I listened to Spawn I was also aware of the tingle of the electrode band on my chest Hanley vigorously calling me back to find out why I had so summarily disconnected I took him to his room Spawn was explaining excitedly De duvel why should I have sealed him in How could I He is no child De Boer laughed caustically And so he has walked away from you I think I am a fool to mix myself with you two Perona retorted I have made you rich De Boer Think what you like to night is the end of our partnership Only you do what I have told you to night Hah How can I Your American has flown his trap This guard this Gutierrez as Spawn had called him was listening with interest De Boer s several other men were gathered there I felt myself safe where I was for the moment at least I cut Hanley in Chief they re closer Spawn has come They ve missed me I ll relay what they re saying but you step it down there s too much volume You re all right Phil Thank Heaven for that Something blew my vacuums Chief listen here they are Perona But he will be back In the garden now no doubt with Jetta De Boer Ah the little Jetta So she is there Spawn Not in years have you spoken of your daughter A young lady now I suppose Is it so Spawn cursed We leave her out of this You follow the Senor s plan Come to your house You think the bird will be there for me to seize Yes Perona put in You go there in an hour Then to the mine Spawn undoubtedly was in this plot to attack his mine He said At the mine we have arranged everything Damn this American But for Perona I would not bother with him But you will bother Perona interjected De Boer laughed again I would be witless could I not figure this He is a young man and so handsome he has frightened you with the little Jetta Is that it Perona Jealous eh I had been holding the image finder so that Hanley might see them Hanley s voice rattled my ear grid Phil Get away from there Look De Boer is searching De Boer had a moment before spoken quietly aside to Gutierrez And now three or four of the men were spreading out poking about with small hand flashes Searching for me The possibility that I might be here eavesdropping Hanley repeated vehemently Phil they ll find you Get out of there the way is still open Gutierrez was approaching the archway But I lingered a moment longer Chief you heard about that girl Jetta Spawn s daughter I stopped Perona was saying Spawn was Jetta still in her room You did not untie her No And gagged Suppose the Americano was back there now She might call to him and he would release her De Boer How do you know he is not around here Listening With the assumption that I might be within hearing De Boer tried to trap me Gutierrez at a signal now suddenly dashed through the archway and planted himself on the path outside The other searchers spread their rays the rocks all about me were lighted But my niche was still untouched De Boer If he is around here Perona He could not have followed me I was too careful I was murmuring Chief they ve got that girl Phil you get away Go to Markes Stay with him But Chief that Jetta I Keep out of this You re only one you can t help any I ve sent for the Porto Rican patrol ship to handle this Chief I m going back to Spawn s No I cut off abruptly In another moment I would have been discovered The searchers were headed directly for me I moved crouching back along the inner wall of the archway The moon was momentarily behind a cloud It was black under the arch and out front it was so dim I could only see the faint blob of Gutierrez s standing figure and the spot of his flashlight Perona He is not around here De Boer That is foolish Spawn He could have gone anywhere Maybe a walk around the village Perona Go back home Spawn De Boer will come Their voices faded as I moved away A searching bandit behind me poked with his light into the crevice where a moment before I had been crouching I moved faster Only Gutierrez now was in front of me He was at the far end of the arch I could slip past and still be fifty feet from him if I could avoid his swinging little light beam I was running now chancing that he would hear me I was on the path I could see it vaguely From behind me came a sizzling flash and the ting of the flying needle as it missed me by a foot The Americano He goes there Another shot The shouts of the bandits in the archway A turmoil back there But it was all behind me I leaped sidewise off the path as Gutierrez small light beam swept it I ran stumbling through a stubble of boulders around an upstanding rock spire back to the path again There were other shots Then De Boer s voice faint by distance Stop Fools We will alarm the village The landing field can see our shots from here Take it easy You can t get him The turmoil quieted I went around a bend in the path running swiftly Pursuit was behind me I could hear them coming It was a run of no more than ten minutes to the junction where down the slope I could see the lights of the landing field The glow of the village was ahead of me Then I was in its outskirts Occasional dark houses Deserted streets I slowed to a fast walk I was breathless panting in the heat I heard no pursuit now But Spawn and the rest of them doubtless were after me Would they head back for Spawn s inn I thought they would But I could beat them back there I was sure there was no shorter route than this I was taking Would they use their flyer That would not gain them any time what with launching it and landing for so short a flight And a bandit flyer could not very well land unseen or unnoticed even in somnolent Nareda I reached the main section of the village There were occasional lights and pedestrians My haste was noticeable but I was not accosted There seemed no police about I recalled Perona s remark that he had attended to that My electrode was tingling I had been running again I slowed down Chief Phil His voice carried relief You got away Yes I m in the village Go to President Markes No I m headed for Spawn s They re all behind me I can get there a few minutes ahead of them I panted an exclamation incoherently but frankly about Jetta I m going to get her out of there Phil what in hell I told him So you ve fallen in love with a girl Entangled Chief Go after her Phil Got her bound and gagged have they Going to marry her to this Perona Like the Middle Ages I had never seen this side of Hanley Get her if you want her Get her out of there Take her to Markes No I wouldn t trust anybody in Nareda Take her into the uplands behind the village But keep away from that mine Have you got flash fuses Yes I was within sight of Spawn s house The street was dim and deserted I was running again I panted I m almost at Spawn s Good When it s over whatever happens up there at the mine then signal the patrol Yes I reached Spawn s front gate The house and front garden were dark Use your fuses Phil What colors I have red and blue I ll talk to the patrol ship again Tell them to watch for you Red and blue Two short red flashes a long blue Right Chief I m here at Spawn s cutting off Come back on when you can His voice went anxious again I ll wait here All right I cut silent I ran through the front doorway of Spawn s inn The living room was dim and empty Which way was Jetta s room I could only guess I had a few minutes perhaps before my pursuers would arrive I reached the inner patio garden The moon was well out from under the clouds now The patio shimmered a silent deserted fairyland Jetta I called it softly Then louder Jetta Spawn s house was fairly large and rambling There were so many rooms Jetta was gagged how could she answer me But I had no time to search for her Jetta And then came her voice Philip Jetta Which way Where are you Here This way in my room A window and a door near the pergola Jetta Yes I am in here They tied me up Not so loud Phil father will hear you He s gone out I reached her garden door Turned its handle Rattled the door Shoved frantically with my shoulder The metal door was firmly sealed To be continued Illustration One of the men rolled free and came lurching toward us The Terrible Tentacles of L four hundred seventy two By Sewell Peaslee Wright It was a big mistake I should not have done it By birth by instinct by training by habit I am a man of action Or I was It is queer that an old man cannot remember that he is no longer young Sidenote Commander John Hanson of the Special Patrol Service records another of his thrilling interplanetary assignments But it was a mistake for me to mention that I had recorded for the archives of the Council the history of a certain activity of the Special Patrol a bit of secret history one which may not be mentioned here Now they insist by they I refer to the Chiefs of the Special Patrol Service that I write of other achievements of the Service other adventures worthy of note Footnote one Editors Note The Forgotten Planet July nineteen thirty issue of Astounding Stories Perhaps that is the penalty of becoming old From commander of the Budi one of the greatest of the Special Patrol ships to the duties of recording ancient history for younger men to read and dream about That is a shrewd blow to one s pride But if I can in some small way add luster to the record of my service it will be a fitting task for a man grown old and gray in that service work for hands too weak and palsied for sterner duties But I shall tell my stories in my own way after all they are my stories And I shall tell the stories that appeal to me most The universe has had enough and too much of dry history these shall be adventurous tales to make the blood of a young man who reads them run a trifle faster and perhaps the blood of the old man who writes them This the first shall be the story of the star L four hundred seventy two You know it to day as Ibit port o call for interplanetary ships and source of ocrite for the universe but to me it will always be L four hundred seventy two the world of terrible tentacles My story begins nearly a hundred years ago reckoned in terms of Earth time which is proper since I am a native of Earth when I was a young man I was sub commander at the time of the Kalid one of the early ships of the Special Patrol We had been called to Zenia on special orders and Commander Jamison after an absence of some two hours returned to the Kalid with his face shining one of his rare smiles telling me in advance that he had news and good news He hurried me up to the deserted navigating room and waved me to a seat Hanson he said I m glad to be the first to congratulate you You are now Commander John Hanson of the Special Patrol Ship Kalid Sir I gasped do you mean His smile broadened From the breast pocket of the trim blue and silver uniform of our Service he drew a long crackling paper Your commission he said I m taking over the Borelis It was my turn to extend congratulations then the Borelis was the newest and greatest ship of the Service We shook hands that ancient gesture of good fellowship on Earth But as our hands unclasped Jamison s face grew suddenly grave I have more than this news for you however he said slowly You are to have a chance to earn your comet hardly I smiled broadly at the mention of the comet the silver insignia worn over the heart that would mark my future rank as commander replacing the four rayed star of a sub commander which I wore now on my tunic Tell me more sir I said confidently You have heard of the Special Patrol Ship Filanus asked my late commander gravely Reported lost in space I replied promptly And the Dorlos Why yes she was at Base here at our last call I said searching his face anxiously Peter Wilson was Second Officer on her one of my best friends Why do you ask about her sir The Dorlos is missing also said Commander Jamison solemnly Both of these ships were sent upon a particular mission Neither of them has returned It is concluded that some common fate has overtaken them The Kalid under your command is commissioned to investigate these disappearances You are not charged with the mission of these other ships your orders are to investigate their disappearance The course together with the official patrol orders I shall hand you presently but with them go verbal orders You are to lay and keep the course designated which will take you well out of the beaten path to a small world which has not been explored but which has been circumnavigated a number of times by various ships remaining just outside the atmospheric envelope and found to be without evidence of intelligent habitation In other words without cities roads canals or other evidence of human handiwork or civilization I believe your instructions give you some of this information but not all of it This world unnamed because of its uninhabited condition is charted only as L four hundred seventy two Your larger charts will show it I am sure The atmosphere is reported to be breatheable by inhabitants of Earth and other beings having the same general requirements Vegetation is reported as dense covering the five continents of the world to the edges of the northern and southern polar caps which are small Topographically the country is rugged in the extreme with many peaks apparently volcanic but now inactive or extinct on all of its five large continents And am I to land there sir I asked eagerly Your orders are very specific upon that point said Commander Jamison You are not to land until you have carefully and thoroughly reconnoitered from above at low altitude You will exercise every possible precaution Your specific purpose is simply this to determine if possible the fate of the other two ships and report your findings at once The Chiefs of the Service will then consider the matter and take whatever action may seem advisable to them Jamison rose to his feet and thrust out his hand in Earth s fine old salute of farewell I must be going Hanson he said I wish this patrol were mine instead of yours You are a young man for such a responsibility But I replied with the glowing confidence of youth I have the advantage of having served under Commander Jamison He smiled as we shook again and shook his head Discretion can be learned only by experience he said But I wish you success Hanson on this undertaking and on many others Supplies are on their way now the crew will return from leave within the hour A young Zenian name of Dival I believe is detailed to accompany you as scientific observer purely unofficial capacity of course He has been ordered to report to you at once You are to depart as soon as feasible you know what that means I believe that s all Oh yes I had almost forgotten Here in this envelope are your orders and your course as well as all available data on L four hundred seventy two In this little casket is your comet Hanson I know you will wear it with honor Thank you sir I said a bit huskily I saluted and Commander Jamison acknowledged the gesture with stiff precision Commander Jamison always had the reputation of being something of a martinet When he had left I picked up the thin blue envelope he had left Across the face of the envelope in the to my mind jagged and unbeautiful Universal script was my name followed by the proud title Commander Special Patrol Ship Kalid My first orders There was a small oval box of blue leather with the silver crest of the Service in bas relief on the lid I opened the case and gazed with shining eyes at the gleaming silver comet that nestled there Then slowly I unfastened the four rayed star on my left breast and placed in its stead the insignia of my commandership Worn smooth and shiny now it is still my most precious possession Kincaide my second officer turned and smiled as I entered the navigating room L four hundred seventy two now registers maximum attraction sir he reported Dead ahead and coming up nicely My last figures completed about five minutes ago indicate that we should reach the gaseous envelope in about ten hours Kincaide was a native of Earth and we commonly used Earth time measurements in our conversation As is still the case ships of the Special Patrol Service were commanded without exception by natives of Earth and the entire officer personnel hailed largely from the same planet although I have had several Zenian officers of rare ability and courage I nodded and thanked him for the report Maximum attraction eh That considering the small size of our objective meant we were much closer to L four hundred seventy two than to any other regular body Mechanically I studied the various dials about the room The attraction meter as Kincaide had said registered several degrees of attraction and the red slide on the rim of the dial was squarely at the top showing that the attraction was coming from the world at which our nose was pointed The surface temperature gauge was at normal Internal pressure normal Internal moisture content a little high Kincaide watching me spoke up I have already given orders to dry out sir he said Very good mister Kincaide It s a long trip and I want the crew in good condition I studied the two charts one showing our surroundings laterally the other vertically all bodies about us represented as glowing spots of green light of varying sizes the ship itself as a tiny scarlet spark Everything shipshape perhaps a degree or two of elevation when we were a little closer May I come in sir broke in a gentle high pitched voice Certainly mister Dival I replied answering in the Universal language in which the request had been made You are always very welcome Dival was a typical Zenian of the finest type slim very dark and with the amazingly intelligent eyes of his kind His voice was very soft and gentle and like the voice of all his people clear and high pitched Thank you he said I guess I m over eager but there s something about this mission of ours that worries me I seem to feel He broke off abruptly and began pacing back and forth across the room I studied him frowning The Zenians have a strange way of being right about such things their high strung sensitive natures seem capable of responding to those delicate vagrant forces which even now are only incompletely understood and classified You re not used to work of this sort I replied as bluffly and heartily as possible There s nothing to worry about The commanders of the two ships that disappeared probably felt the same way sir said Dival I should have thought the Chiefs of the Special Patrol Service would have sent several ships on a mission such as this Easy to say I laughed bitterly If the Council would pass the appropriations we need we might have ships enough so that we could send a fleet of ships when we wished Instead of that the Council in its infinite wisdom builds greater laboratories and schools of higher learning and lets the Patrol get along as best it can It was from the laboratories and the schools of higher learning that all these things sprang replied Dival quietly glancing around at the array of instruments which made navigation in space possible True I admitted rather shortly We must work together And as for what we shall find upon the little world ahead we shall be there in nine or ten hours You may wish to make some preparations Nine or ten hours That s Earth time isn t it Let s see about two and a half enaros Correct I smiled The Universal method of reckoning time had never appealed to me For those of my readers who may only be familiar with Earth time measurements an enar is about eighteen Earth days an enaren a little less than two Earth days and an enaro nearly four and a half hours The Universal system has the advantage I admit of a decimal division but I have found it clumsy always I may be stubborn and old fashioned but a clock face with only ten numerals and one hand still strikes me as being unbeautiful and inefficient Two and a half enaros repeated Dival thoughtfully I believe I shall see if I can get a little sleep now I should not have brought my books with me I m afraid I read when I should sleep Will you call me should there be any developments of interest I assured him that he would be called as he requested and he left Decent sort of a chap sir observed Kincaide glancing at the door through which Dival had just departed A student I nodded with the contempt of violent youth for the man of gentler pursuits than mine and turned my attentions to some calculations for entry in the log Busied with the intricate details of my task time passed rapidly The watch changed and I joined my officers in the tiny arched dining salon It was during the meal that I noticed for the first time a sort of tenseness every member of the mess was unusually quiet And though I would not have admitted it then I was not without a good deal of nervous restraint myself Gentlemen I remarked when the meal was finished I believe you understand our present mission Primarily our purpose is to ascertain if possible the fate of two ships that were sent here and have not returned We are now close enough for reasonable observation by means of the television disc I believe and I shall take over its operation myself There is no gainsaying the fact that whatever fate overtook the two other Patrol ships may lay in wait for us My orders are to observe every possible precaution and to return with a report I am going to ask that each of you proceed immediately to his post and make ready in so far as possible for any eventuality Warn the watch which has just gone off to be ready for instant duty The disintegrator ray generators should be started and be available for instant emergency use maximum power Have the bombing crews stand by for orders What do you anticipate sir asked Correy my new sub commander The other officers waited tensely for my reply I don t know mister Correy I admitted reluctantly We have no information upon which to base an assumption We do know that two ships have been sent here and neither of them have returned Something prevented that return We must endeavor to prevent that same fate from overtaking the Kalid and ourselves Hurrying back to the navigating room I posted myself beside the cumbersome old fashioned television instrument L four hundred seventy two was near enough now to occupy the entire field with the range hand at maximum One whole continent and parts of two others were visible Not many details could be made out I waited grimly while an hour two hours went by My field narrowed down to one continent to a part of one continent I glanced up at the surface temperature gauge and noted that the hand was registering a few degrees above normal Correy who had relieved Kincaide as navigating officer followed my gaze Shall we reduce speed sir he asked crisply To twice atmospheric speed I nodded When we enter the envelope proper reduce to normal atmospheric speed Alter your course upon entering the atmosphere proper and work back and forth along the emerging twilight zone from the north polar cap to the southern cap and so on Yes sir he replied and repeated the orders to the control room forward I pressed the attention signal to Dival s cubicle and informed him that we were entering the outer atmospheric fringe Thank you sir he said eagerly I shall be with you immediately In rapid succession I called various officers and gave terse orders Double crews on duty in the generator compartment the ray projectors the atomic bomb magazines and release tubes Observers at all observation posts operators at the two smaller television instruments to comb the terrain and report instantly any object of interest With the three of us searching it seemed incredible that anything could escape us At atmospheric altitudes even the two smaller television instruments would be able to pick out a body the size of one of the missing ships Dival entered the room as I finished giving my orders A strange world Dival I commented glancing towards the television instrument Covered with trees even the mountains and what I presume to be volcanic peaks They crowd right down to the edge of the water He adjusted the focusing lever slightly his face lighting up with the interest of a scientist gazing at a strange specimen whether it be a microbe or a new world Strange strange he muttered A universal vegetation no variation of type from equator to polar cap apparently And the water did you notice its color sir Purple I nodded It varies on the different worlds you know I ve seen pink red white and black seas as well as the green and blue of Earth And no small islands he went on as though he had not ever heard me Not in the visible portion at any rate I was about to reply when I felt the peculiar surge of the Kalid as she reduced speed I glanced at the indicator watching the hand drop slowly to atmospheric speed Keep a close watch Dival I ordered We shall change our course now to comb the country for traces of two ships we are seeking If you see the least suspicious sign let me know immediately He nodded and for a time there was only a tense silence in the room broken at intervals by Correy as he spoke briefly into his microphone giving orders to the operating room Perhaps an hour went by I am not sure It seemed like a longer time than that Then Dival called out in sudden excitement his high thin voice stabbing the silence Here sir Look A little clearing artificial I judge and the ships Both of them Stop the ship mister Correy I snapped as I hurried to the instrument Dival take those reports I gestured towards the two attention signals that were glowing and softly humming and thrust my head into the shelter of the television instrument s big hood Dival had made no mistake Directly beneath me as I looked was a clearing a perfect square with rounded corners obviously blasted out of the solid forest by the delicate manipulation of sharply focused disintegrator rays And upon the naked pitted surface thus exposed side by side in orderly array were the missing ships I studied the strange scene with a heart that thumped excitedly against my ribs What should I do Return and report Descend and investigate There was no sign of life around the ships and no evidence of damage If I brought the Kalid down would she make a third to remain there to be marked lost in space on the records of the Service Reluctantly I drew my head from beneath the shielding hood What were the two reports Dival I asked and my voice was thick The other two television observers Yes sir They report that they cannot positively identify the ships with their instruments but feel certain that they are the two we seek Very good Tell them please to remain on watch searching space in every direction and to report instantly anything suspicious mister Correy we will descend until this small clearing becomes visible through the ports to the unaided eye I will give you the corrections to bring us directly over the clearing And I read the finder scales of the television instrument to him He rattled off the figures calculated an instant and gave his orders to the control room while I kept the television instrument bearing upon the odd clearing and the two motionless deserted ships As we settled I could make out the insignia of the ships could see the pitted stained earth of the clearing brown with the dust of disintegration I could see the surrounding trees very distinctly now they seemed very similar to our weeping willows on Earth which I perhaps should explain since it is impossible for the average individual to have a comprehensive knowledge of the flora and fauna of the entire known Universe is a tree of considerable size having long hanging branches arching from its crown and reaching nearly to the ground These leaves like typical willow leaves were long and slender of rusty green color The trunks and branches seemed to be black or dark brown and the trees grew so thickly that nowhere between their branches was the ground visible Five thousand feet sir said Correy Directly above the clearing Shall we descend further A thousand feet at a time mister Correy I replied after a moment s hesitation My orders are to exercise the utmost caution mister Dival please make a complete analysis of the atmosphere I believe you are familiar with the traps provided for the purpose Yes You propose to land sir I propose to determine the fate of those two ships and the men who brought them here I said with sudden determination Dival made no reply but as he turned to obey orders I saw that his presentiment of trouble had not left him Four thousand feet sir said Correy I nodded studying the scene below us The great hooded instrument brought it within apparently fifty feet of my eyes but the great detail revealed nothing of interest The two ships lay motionless huddled close together The great circular door of each was open as though opened that same day or a century before Three thousand feet sir said Correy Proceed at the same speed I replied Whatever fate had overtaken the men of the other ships had caused them to disappear entirely and without sign of a struggle 
4110_11535_000031_000001	train-clean-360	But what 
none	none	conceivable fate could that be Two thousand feet sir said Correy Good I said grimly Continue with the descent mister Correy Dival hurried into the room as I spoke His face was still clouded with foreboding I have tested the atmosphere sir he reported It is suitable for breathing by either men of Earth or Zenia No trace of noxious gases of any kind It is probably rather rarified such as one might find on Earth or Zenia at high altitudes One thousand feet sir said Correy I hesitated an instant Undoubtedly the atmosphere had been tested by the other ships before they landed In the case of the second ship at any rate those in command must have been on the alert against danger And yet both of those ships lay there motionless vacant deserted I could feel the eyes of the men on me My decision must be delayed no further We will land mister Correy I said grimly Near the two ships please Very well sir nodded Correy and spoke briefly into the microphone I might warn you sir said Dival quietly to govern your activities once outside free from the gravity pads of the ship on a body of such small size an ordinary step will probably cause a leap of considerable distance Thank you mister Dival That is a consideration I had overlooked I shall warn the men We must At that instant I felt the slight jar of landing I glanced up met Correy s grave glance squarely Grounded sir he said quietly Very good mister Correy Keep the ship ready for instant action please and call the landing crew to the forward exit You will accompany us mister Dival Certainly sir Good You understand your orders mister Correy Yes sir I returned his salute and led the way out of the room Dival close on my heels The landing crew was composed of all men not at regular stations nearly half of the Kalid s entire crew They were equipped with the small atomic power pistols as side arms and there were two three men disintegrator ray squads We all wore menores which were unnecessary in the ship but decidedly useful outside I might add that the menore of those days was not the delicate beautiful thing that it is to day it was comparatively crude and clumsy band of metal in which were imbedded the vital units and the tiny atomic energy generator and was worn upon the head like a crown But for all its clumsiness it conveyed and received thought and after all that was all we demanded of it I caught a confused jumble of questioning thoughts as I came up and took command of the situation promptly It will be understood of course that in those days men had not learned to blank their minds against the menore as they do to day It took generations of training to perfect that ability Open the exit I ordered Kincaide who was standing by the switch key in the lock Yes sir he thought promptly and unlocking the switch released the lever The great circular door revolved swiftly backing slowly on its fine threads gripped by the massive gimbals which as at last the ponderous plug of metal freed itself from its threads swung the circular door aside like the door of a vault Fresh clean air swept in and we breathed it gratefully Science can revitalize air take out impurities and replace used up constituents but if cannot give it the freshness of pure natural air Even the science of to day mister Kincaide you will stand by with five men Under no circumstances are you to leave your post until ordered to do so No rescue parties under any circumstances are to be sent out unless you have those orders directly from me Should any untoward thing happen to this party you will instantly reseal this exit reporting at the same time to mister Correy who has his orders You will not attempt to rescue us but will return to the Base and report in full with mister Correy in command Is that clear Perfectly came back his response instantly but I could sense the rebellion in his mind Kincaid and I were old friends as well as fellow officers I smiled at him reassuringly and directed my orders to the waiting men You are aware of the fate of the two ships of the Patrol that have already landed here I thought slowly to be sure they understood perfectly What fate overtook them I do not know That is what we are here to determine It is obvious that this is a dangerous mission I m ordering none of you to go Any man who wishes to be relieved from landing duty may remain inside the ship and may feel it no reproach Those who do go should be constantly on the alert and keep in formation the usual column of twos Be very careful when stepping out of the ship to adjust your stride to the lessened gravity of this small world Watch this point I turned to Dival motioned him to fall in at my side Without a backward glance we marched out of the ship treading very carefully to keep from leaping into the air with each step Twenty feet away I glanced back There were fourteen men behind me not a man of the landing crew had remained in the ship I am proud of you men I thought heartily and no emanation from any menore was ever more sincere Cautiously eyes roving ceaselessly we made our way towards the two silent ships It seemed a quiet peaceful world an unlikely place for tragedy The air was fresh and clean although as Dival had predicted rarefied like the air at an altitude The willow like trees that hemmed us in rustled gently their long frond like branches with their rusty green leaves swaying Do you notice sir came a gentle thought from Dival an emanation that could hardly have been perceptible to the men behind us that there is no wind and yet the trees yonder are swaying and rustling I glanced around startled I had not noticed the absence of a breeze I tried to make my response reassuring There is probably a breeze higher up that doesn t dip down into this little clearing I ventured At any rate it is not important These ships are what interest me What will we find there We shall soon know replied Dival Here is the Dorlos the second of the two was it not Yes I came to a halt beside the gaping door There was no sound within no evidence of life there no sign that men had ever crossed that threshold save that the whole fabric was the work of man s hands mister Dival and I will investigate the ship with two of you men I directed The rest of the detail will remain on guard and give the alarm at the least sign of any danger You first two men follow us The indicated men nodded and stepped forward Their Yes sirs came surging through my menore like a single thought Cautiously Dival at my side the two men at our backs we stepped over the high threshold into the interior of the Dorlos The ethon tubes overhead made everything as light as day and since the Dorlos was a sister ship of my own Kalid I had not the slightest difficulty in finding my way about There was no sign of a disturbance anywhere Everything was in perfect order From the evidence it would seem that the officers and men of the Dorlos had deserted the ship of their own accord and failed to return Nothing of value here I commented to Dival We may as well There was a sudden commotion from outside the ship Startled shouts rang through the hollow hull and a confused medley of excited thoughts came pouring in With one accord the four of us dashed to the exit Dival and I in the lead At the door we paused following the stricken gaze of the men grouped in a rigid knot just outside Some forty feet away was the edge of the forest that hemmed us in A forest that now was lashing and writhing as though in the grip of some terrible hurricane trunks bending and whipping long branches writhing curling lashing out Two of the men sir shouted a non commissioned officer of the landing crew as we appeared in the doorway In his excitement he forgot his menore and resorted to the infinitely slower but more natural speech Some sort of insect came buzzing down like an Earth bee but larger One of the men slapped it and jumped aside forgetting the low gravity here He shot into the air and another of the men made a grab for him They both went sailing and the trees look But I had already spotted the two men The trees had them in their grip long tentacles curled around them a dozen of the great willow like growths apparently fighting for possession of the prizes And all around far out of reach the trees of the forest were swaying restlessly their long pendulous branches like tentacles lashing out hungrily The rays sir snapped the thought from Dival like a flash of lightning Concentrate the beams strike at the trunks Right My orders emanated on the heels of the thought more quickly than one word could have been uttered The six men who operated the disintegrator rays were stung out of their startled immobility and the soft hum of the atomatic power generators deepened Strike at the trunks of the trees Beams narrowed to minimum Action at will The invisible rays swept long gashes into the forest as the trainers squatted behind their sights directing the long gleaming tubes Branches crashed to the ground suddenly motionless Thick brown dust dropped heavily A trunk shortened by six inches or so dropped into its stub and fell with a prolonged sound of rending wood The trees against which it had fallen tugged angrily at their trapped tentacles One of the men rolled free staggered to his feet and came lurching towards us Trunk after trunk dropped onto its severed stub and fell among the lashing branches of its fellows The other man was caught for a moment in a mass of dead and motionless wood but a cunningly directed ray dissolved the entangling branches around him and he lay there free but unable to arise The rays played on ruthlessly The brown heavy powder was falling like greasy soot Trunk after trunk crashed to the ground slashed into fragments Cease action I ordered and instantly the eager whine of the generators softened to a barely discernible hum Two of the men under orders raced out to the injured man the rest of us clustered around the first of the two to be freed from the terrible tentacles of the trees His menore was gone his tight fitting uniform was in shreds and blotched with blood There was a huge crimson welt across his face and blood dripped slowly from the tips of his fingers God he muttered unsteadily as kindly arms lifted him with eager tenderness They re alive Like snakes They they re hungry Take him to the ship I ordered He is to receive treatment immediately I turned to the detail that was bringing in the other victim The man was unconscious and moaning but suffering more from shock than anything else A few minutes under the helio emanations and he would be fit for light duty As the men hurried him to the ship I turned to Dival He was standing beside me rigid his face very pale his eyes fixed on space What do you make of it mister Dival I questioned him Of the trees He seemed startled as though I had aroused him from deepest thought They are not difficult to comprehend sir There are numerous growths that are primarily carnivorous We have the fintal vine on Zenia which coils instantly when touched and thus traps many small animals which it wraps about with its folds and digests through sucker like growths On your own Earth there are we learn hundreds of varieties of insectivorous plants the Venus fly trap known otherwise as the Dionaea Muscipula which has a leaf hinged in the median line with teeth like bristles The two portions of the leaf snap together with considerable force when an insect alights upon the surface and the soft portions of the catch are digested by the plant before the leaf opens again The pitcher plant is another native of Earth and several varieties of it are found on Zenia and at least two other planets It traps its game without movement but is nevertheless insectivorous You have another species on Earth that is or was very common the Mimosa Pudica Perhaps you know it as the sensitive plant It does not trap insects but it has a very distinct power of movement and is extremely irritable It is not at all difficult to understand a carniverous tree capable of violent and powerful motion This is undoubtedly what we have here a decidedly interesting phenomena but not difficult of comprehension It seems like a long explanation as I record it here but emanated as it was it took but an instant to complete it mister Dival went on without a pause I believe however that I have discovered something far more important How is your menore adjusted sir At minimum Turn it to maximum sir I glanced at him curiously but obeyed New streams of thought poured in upon me Kincaide the guard at the exit and something else I blanked out Kincaide and the men feeling Dival s eyes searching my face There was something else something I focused on the dim vague emanations that came to me from the circlet of my menore and gradually like an object seen through heavy mist I perceived the message Wait Wait We are coming Through the ground The trees disintegrate them all of them all you can reach But not the ground not the ground Peter I shouted turning to Dival That s Peter Wilson second officer of the Dorlos Dival nodded his dark face alight Let us see if we can answer him he suggested and we concentrated all our energy on a single thought We understand We understand The answer came back instantly Good Thank God Sweep them down Hanson every tree of them Kill them kill them kill them The emanation fairly shook with hate We are coming to the clearing wait and while you wait use your rays upon these accursed hungry trees Grimly and silently we hurried back to the ship Dival the savant snatching up specimens of earth and rock here and there as we went The disintegrator rays of the portable projectors were no more than toys compared with the mighty beams the Kalid was capable of projecting with her great generators to supply power Even with the beams narrowed to the minimum they cut a swath a yard or more in diameter and their range was tremendous although working rather less rapidly as the distance and power decreased they were effective over a range of many miles Before their blasting beams the forest shriveled and sank into tumbled chaos A haze of brownish dust hung low over the scene and I watched with a sort of awe It was the first time I had ever seen the rays at work on such wholesale destruction A startling thing became evident soon after we began our work This world that we had thought to be void of animal life proved to be teeming with it From out of the tangle of broken and harmless branches thousands of animals appeared The majority of them were quite large perhaps the size of full grown hogs which Earth animal they seemed to resemble save that they were a dirty yellow color and had strong heavily clawed feet These were the largest of the animals but there were myriads of smaller ones all of them pale or neutral in color and apparently unused to such strong light for they ran blindly wildly seeking shelter from the universal confusion Still the destructive beams kept about their work until the scene changed utterly Instead of resting in a clearing the Kalid was in the midst of a tangle of fallen wilting branches that stretched like a great still sea as far as the eye could see Cease action I ordered suddenly I had seen or thought I had seen a human figure moving in the tangle not far from the edge of the clearing Correy relayed the order and instantly the rays were cut off My menore free from the interference of the great atomic generators of the Kalid emanated the moment the generators ceased functioning Enough Hanson Cut the rays we re coming We have ceased action come on I hurried to the still open exit Kincaide and his guards were staring at what had been the forest they were so intent that they did not notice I had joined them and no wonder A file of men were scrambling over the debris gaunt men with dishevelled hair practically naked covered with dirt and the greasy brown dust of the disintegrator ray In the lead hardly recognizable his menore awry upon his tangled locks was Peter Wilson Wilson I shouted and in a single great leap I was at his side shaking his hand one arm about his scarred shoulders laughing and talking excitedly all in the same breath Wilson tell me in God s name what has happened He looked up at me with shining happy eyes deep in black sockets of hunger and suffering The part that counts he said hoarsely is that you re here and we re here with you My men need rest and food not too much food at first for we re starving I ll give you the story or as much of it as I know while we eat I sent my orders ahead for every man of that pitiful crew of survivors there were two eager men of the Kalid s crew to minister to him In the little dining salon of the officers mess Wilson gave us the story while he ate slowly and carefully keeping his ravenous hunger in check It s a weird sort of story he said I ll cut it as short as I can I m too weary for details The Dorlos as I suppose you know was ordered to L four hundred seventy two to determine the fate of the Filanus which had been sent here to determine the feasibility of establishing a supply base here for a new interplanetary ship line It took us nearly three days Earth time to locate this clearing and the Filanus and we grounded the Dorlos immediately Our commander you probably remember him Hanson David McClellan Big red faced chap I nodded and Wilson continued Commander McClellan was a choleric person as courageous a man as ever wore the blue and silver of the Service and very thoughtful of his men We had had a bad trip two swarms of meteorites that had worn our nerves thin and a faulty part in the air purifying apparatus had nearly done us in While the exit was being unsealed he gave the interior crew permission to go off duty to get some fresh air with orders however to remain close to the ship under my command Then with the usual landing crew he started for the Filanus He had forgotten under the stress of the moment that the force of gravity would be very small on a body no larger than this The result was that as soon as they hurried out of the ship away from the influence of our own gravity pads they hurtled into the air in all directions Wilson paused Several seconds passed before he could go on Well the trees I suppose you know something about them reached out and swept up three of them McClellan and the rest of the landing crew rushed to their rescue They were caught up God I can see them hear them even now I couldn t stand there and see that happen to them With the rest of the crew behind me we rushed out armed only with our atomic pistols We did not dare use the rays there were a dozen men caught up everywhere in those hellish tentacles I don t know what I thought we could do I knew only that I must do something Our leaps carried us over the tops of the trees that were fighting for the the bodies of McClellan and the rest of the landing crew I saw then when it was too late that there was nothing we could do The trees had done their work They they were feeding Perhaps that is why we escaped We came down in a tangle of whipping branches Several of my men were snatched up The rest of us saw how helpless our position was that there was nothing we could do We saw too that the ground was literally honeycombed and we dived down these burrows out of the reach of the trees There were nineteen of us that escaped I can t tell you how we lived I would not if I could The burrows had been dug by the pig like animals that the trees live upon and they led eventually to the shore where there was water horrible bitter stuff but not salty and apparently not poisonous We lived on these pig like animals and we learned something of their way of life The trees seem to sleep or become inactive at night Not unless they are touched do they lash about with their tentacles At night the animals feed largely upon the large soft fruit of these trees Of course large numbers of them make a fatal step each night but they are prolific and their ranks do not suffer Of course we tried to get back to the clearing and the Dorlos first by tunneling That was impossible we found because the rays used by the Filanus in clearing a landing place had acted somewhat upon the earth beneath and it was like powder Our burrows fell in upon us faster than we could dig them out Two of my men lost their lives that way Then we tried creeping back by night but we could not see as can the other animals here and we quickly found that it was suicide to attempt such tactics Two more of the men were lost in that fashion That left fourteen We decided then to wait We knew there would be another ship along sooner or later Luckily one of the men had somehow retained his menore We treasured that as we treasured our lives To day when deep in our runways beneath the surface we felt or heard the crashing of the trees we knew the Service had not forgotten us I put on the menore I but I think you know the rest gentlemen There were eleven of us left We are here all that is left of the Dorlos crew We found no trace of any survivor of the Filanus unaware of the possibility of danger they were undoubtedly all the victims of the trees Wilson s head dropped forward on his chest He straightened up with a start and an apologetic smile I believe Hanson he said slowly I d better get a little rest and he slumped forward on the table in the death like sleep of utter exhaustion There the interesting part of the story ends The rest is history and there is too much dry history in the Universe already Dival wrote three great volumes on L four hundred seventy two or Ibit as it is called now One of them tells in detail how the presence of constantly increasing quantities of volcanic ash robbed the soil of that little world of its vitality so that all forms of vegetation except the one became extinct and how through a process of development and evolution those trees became carniverous The second volume is a learned discussion of the tree itself it seems that a few specimens were spared for study isolated on a peninsula of one of the continents and turned over to Dival for observation and dissection All I can say for the book is that it is probably accurate Certainly it is neither interesting nor comprehensible And then of course there is his treatise on ocrite how he happened to find the ore the probable amount available on L four hundred seventy two or Ibit if you prefer and an explanation of his new method of refining it I saw him frantically gathering specimens while we were getting ready to leave but it wasn t until after we had departed that he mentioned what he had found I have a set of these volumes somewhere Dival autographed them and presented me with them They established his position I understand in his world of science and of course the discovery of this new source of ocrite was a tremendous find for the whole Universe interplanetary transportation wouldn t be where it is to day if it were not for this inexhaustible source of power Yes Dival became famous and very rich I received the handshakes and the gratitude of the eleven men we rescued and exactly nine words of commendation from the Chief of my squadron You are a credit to the Service Commander Hanson Perhaps to some who read this it will seem that Dival fared better than I But to men who have known the comradeship of the outer space the heart felt gratitude of eleven friends is a precious thing And to any man who has ever worn the blue and silver uniform of the Special Patrol Service those nine words from the Chief of Squadron will sound strong Chiefs of Squadrons in the Special Patrol Service at least in those days were scanty with praise It may be different in these days of soft living and political pull Illustration Marooned Under the Sea By Paul Ernst Editor s note This document written on a curious kind of parchment and tied to a piece of driftwood was reported to have been picked out of the sea near the Fiji Islands The first and last pages were so water soaked as to be indecipherable Yacht Rosa was due to leave the San Francisco harbor in two hours We were going on some mysterious cruise to the South Seas the details of which I did not know Sidenote Three men stick out a strange and desperate adventure among the incredible monsters of the dark sea floor Professor George Berry the famous zoologist and myself are going to do some exploring that is hazardous in the extreme Stanley had said For purely mechanical reasons we need a third You are young and have no family ties so I thought I d ask you to go with us I d rather not tell you what it s all about until we are on our way Illustration Look at the cable called Stanley That was all the explanation he had given It was sufficient I was fed up with life just then I had enough money to avoid work and was tired of playing I must warn you that you ll risk your life in this he had continued in answer to my acceptance of his invitation And I had replied that the hazard whatever it might be only made the trip appear more desirable So here I was on board the yacht about to sail for far places on some scientific mission which had so far been kept veiled in secrecy and which was represented as hazardous in the extreme It sounded attractive Stanley came aboard accompanied by a lean wiry man with iron gray hair and cool alert black eyes Hello Martin Stanley greeted me I want you to meet Professor Berry the real leader of this expedition Professor this young red head is Martin Grey a sort of nephew by adoption who knows more about night life than most cabaret proprietors and not much of anything else He has shaken the dangers of the gold diggers to face with us the dangers of the tropic seas The professor gripped my hand and his cool black eyes gazed into mine with a kind of friendly frostiness Don t pay any attention to him he advised me Twenty years ago when I first met him he was on his way to Africa to shoot elephants because some revue beauty had just thrown him over and he felt he ought to do something big and heroic about it It was shortly afterward that he decided to stay a bachelor all his life and became such a confirmed woman hater He smiled thinly at Stanley s prod in the ribs and the two went below talking and laughing with the intimacy of old friendship I stayed on deck and soon found myself watching with no little wonder an enormous truck and trailer arrangement that drew up on the dock heavily loaded with a single immense crate It was for us I speculated as to what it could possibly contain It was a twenty or twenty five foot cube solidly braced with strap iron and steel brackets It evidently contained something fragile The yacht s donkey engine lowered a hook for it and swung it over the side and into the hold as daintily as though it had been packed with explosives The last of the ship s stores followed it over the side the group of newspaper reporters who had been trying to pump the captain and first mate for a story were warned to leave and we were ready to go Precisely where and for what purpose I was to find out almost immediately Even as the yacht nosed superciliously away from the dock the steward approached me with the information that lunch was ready I went to the small compactly furnished dining salon where I was joined by Stanley and the professor There were only the three of us at the table Stanley Browne noted big game hunter and semi retired owner of the great Browne Glassworks at Altoona a man fifteen years my senior but tanned and fit looking Professor Berry well known in scientific circles and myself known in no branch of activity save the one Stanley had jested about the night life of my home city Chicago It s time you knew just what you re up against said Stanley to me after the consomme had been served Now that we ve actually sailed there s no longer any need for secrecy Indeed there never has been urgent need of it the Professor and myself merely thought we might provoke incredulity and comment if we stated the purpose of our trip publicly He buttered a roll We the Professor and you and I are going in for some deep sea diving And when I say deep I mean deep We are going to investigate conditions as they exist one mile down from the surface of the ocean A mile I exclaimed Why There I stopped I had only a layman s knowledge of such matters But I knew that the limit of man s submersion till then at any rate was a matter of a few hundred feet Sounds incredible doesn t it said Stanley with a smile But that s what we re going to do if the Professor s gadget works as he seems to think it will I don t think it I know it retorted the Professor And man man the things we may see down there New and unknown species a world no human has ever seen before perhaps the secret of all of life Dragons sea serpents and what not Stanley finished with a grin Or possibly nothing at all The Professor shrugged I mustn t let my scientific curiosity run away with me Perhaps we ll find no new thing down down Our deep sea dredging and classification may already embrace most of the forms of life in the greater depths If it does I want my money back said Stanley When you asked me to finance this expedition for you I agreed on condition that you would show me a thrill some real big game even if I would not be able to shoot it If we draw blank The mere descent should satisfy you my adventuring friend replied the Professor brusquely I think you ll find that thrilling enough But a mile under the surface I marveled feeling not entirely comfortable The pressure Enormous It can t be done That is I mean can it be done It had better be said Stanley with a humor that I did not entirely appreciate If it isn t the three of us are going to be pressed out like three sheets of tissue paper For we are assuredly going down that far in the Professor s gadget Was that the thing I saw hoisted aboard just before we left That was it We ll stroll around after lunch and look it over If I had taken this cruise in search of distraction I was surely going to be successful That was plain Just where are we going I asked You said something about the South Seas but you ve named no special part of them We re bound for Penguin Deep That s a delightful little dimple in the Kermadec Trough which Stanley explained is north northeast of New Zealand almost halfway up to the Fiji Islands Penguin Deep is ticketed at five thousand one hundred and fifty feet but it probably runs deeper in spots The rest of the meal was consumed in silence I hardly tasted what I ate I remember that Over five thousand feet down where no man had ever ventured before Could we make it I tried to recall my neglected physics lessons and compute the pressure that far down I couldn t But I knew it must be an appalling total of tons to the square inch What possible arrangement could they have brought in which to make that awful descent And if the descent were accomplished what in the world would we see when we got down there Gigantic hitherto unknown fishes Marine growths half animal and half vegetable Decidedly hot rolls and salad cutlets and baked potatoes good as they were could not distract attention from the crowding questions that assailed me And I could see that Stanley and the Professor were also far away in their thoughts probably already exploring Penguin Deep After lunch we went forward to look at the Professor s gadget as Stanley insisted on calling it It had been carefully unpacked by the crew while we ate and it shimmered in the electric lighted hold like a great bubble It was a giant glass sphere polished and flawless Inside it could be made out various objects a circular bench arrangement on a wooden flooring batteries that filled the cup between the floor and the bottom arc of the sphere tall metal cylinders a small searchlight set next to a mechanism that was indeterminate At three equidistant points on the sides there were glass handles as thick as a man s thigh cast integral with the walls On the top there was a smaller handle At first glance the sphere seemed all in one piece with the central objects cast inside like a toy ship in a sealed bottle Then a mathematically precise ring of prismatic reflections showed me that the top third of the ball was a separate piece fitting conically down like the tapered glass stopper of a monstrous perfume bottle The handle on the top was for the purpose of lifting this giant s teapot lid and allowing entrance into the sphere Isn t it a beauty murmured Stanley It ought to be he added It cost me eighty six thousand to make it in my own glass factory Eleven castings before this one came along that was reasonably free of flaws Twenty two feet six inches over all walls five feet thick new formula unbreakable glass four men working a month to grind the lid into place tolerance limits plus or minus zero He slapped the Professor s shoulders Let s go in and look over the apparatus To accommodate the huge ball a well had been constructed in the Rosa s hold This brought the deck we were standing on up to within six feet of the top ring above which was rigged a chain hoist for lifting the ponderous lid The hoist was revolved the conical top was swung free and we clambered into our unique diving shell The tall cylinders were revealed as great flasks of compressed air The indeterminate thing beside the searchlight turned out to be a hand pump geared to work against heavy pressure From the suction chamber of this three tubes extended We inhale the air of the chamber the Professor explained to me and exhale through the tubes into the pump cylinder Breathe in through the nose and out through the mouth The pump piston is forced down by this geared handle sending the used air out of the shell through this sixteenth inch hole A ball check valve keeps the water from squirting in when the exhaust pressure is released He pointed to a telegraphic key which completed a circuit from the batteries in the bottom of the ball to a thread of copper cast through the lid That s your plaything Martin You are to raise or lower us by pressing that key It controls the donkey engine electrically so that we guide our own destinies though we are a mile beneath our power plant Stanley works the pump I direct the searchlight write down notes and I sincerely hope take snapshots of deep sea life For a moment my part of the labor seemed so easy as to be unfair Merely to sit there and punch a little key at raising and lowering time But as I thought it over it began to appear more difficult The Rosa could not anchor of course in a mile of water We would drift helplessly If we approached an undersea cliff I must raise us at once to prevent us being smashed against it And if the cliff were too lofty to be cleared in time I mentioned this to the Professor That would be unfortunate he said with his frosty smile Stanley assures us this glass is unbreakable He means commercially unbreakable What would happen to it if it were submitted to the strain of being flung against a rock pile in addition to the enormous stress of the water pressure I don t know It s your job to see that we don t have to find out It had been planned to test the sphere empty first to see how it stood the strain We drifted to a full stop over the center of Penguin Deep where we were to gamble our lives in a game with Neptune Sea anchors were rigged to lessen our drift and the donkey engine was geared to the first cable drum There was an impressive row of these drums each holding an interminable length of three quarter inch cable The bulk of a mile of steel cable has to be seen to be believed The glass sphere was lifted from the hold delicately for all its enormous weight and swung over the rail preparatory to being lowered into the depths Not until that moment did I notice two things that there was no fastening of any kind to keep the thick lid in place and that the three quarter inch cable looked like a pack thread in comparison to the ponderous bulk it strained to support We couldn t use a heavier cable said the Professor because of the strain We re overloading the hoist as it is As for the lid being fastened down I think you ll find it will be pressed into place securely enough There was unanimous silence as the great globe slipped into the sea down and down until the last reflection of the morning sun ceased to shimmer from its surface Drum after drum was played out till the first mate held his hand up to check the engineer Five thousand feet sir he called to Stanley Haul it back up And let us hope Stanley added fervently that we ll find the gadget in one piece The engine began to snort rhythmically Dripping vibrating the coils of cable began to crawl back in place on the drums There was a glint under the surface again as the sunlight reflected on the nearing sphere The great ball flashed out of the water and a cheer burst from the throats of all of us It was absolutely unharmed Only there was a beading of fine moisture inside the thick globe What that could mean none of us could figure out Difference in temperature worried the Professor No it s as cold inside as out Molecules of water driven by sheer pressure through five feet of glass to unite in drops on the inside Possibly Well there s one way to find out Stanley Martin are you ready We nodded and prepared to visit the bottom a mile below the Rosa s keel The preparation consisted merely in donning heavy fleece lined jumpers to protect us from the cold of the sunless depths Soberly we entered the ball to undergo whatever ordeal awaited us on the distant ocean floor How comparative distance is A mile walk in the country it is nothing A mile ascent in an airplane a trifle But a mile descent into pitch black bone chilling depths of water that is an immense distance Copper wire on a separate drum was connected from the engine switch to the copper thread that curled through the glass wall to my telegraphic key We strapped the mouthpieces of the breathing tubes over our heads and Browne started the slow turning of the compression pump The Professor snapped the searchlight on and off several times to see that it was in working shape He raised his hand I pressed the key and the long descent began That plunge into the bottomless depths remains in my memory almost as clearly as the far more fantastic adventures that came to us later Smoothly rapidly the yellow green of the surface water dimmed to olive This in turn grew blacker and blacker Then we were slipping down into pitch darkness a big bubble lit by a meagre lamp and containing three fragile human beings that dared to trust the soft pulp of their bodies to the crushing weight of the deepest ocean The most impressive thing was the utter soundlessness of our descent At first there had been a pulsing throb of the donkey engine transmitted to us by the sustaining cable This died as we slid farther from the Rosa At length it was hushed entirely cushioned by the springy length of steel There was no stir no sound of any kind As far as our senses could tell us we were hanging motionless in the pressing awesome blackness The Professor switched off our light and turned on the searchlight which he trained downward through the wall at as steep an angle as the flooring would permit Even then the illusion of motionlessness was preserved There was nothing in the water to mark our progress We might have been floating in a back void of space Down and down we went for an interminable length of time till at length we reached the abysmal level where the sun never shone and the eyes of man had never gazed till now Words were made to describe familiar articles I find now when I am faced with the necessity of portraying events and objects beyond the range of normal human experience that I cannot conjure up words to fit I despair of trying to make you see what we saw and feel what we felt But try to picture yourself in the glass ball with us All is profound blackness save for a streak of white dying about fifty feet away which is the beam of our searchlight Twenty feet below is a bare floor of flinty lava and broken shell This is unrelieved by sea weed of any kind appearing like an imagined fragment of Martian or lunar landscape The ball sways idly to the push of some explicable submarine current It is like being in a captive balloon except that the connecting cable extends stiffly upward instead of downward There is a realization an instinctive feel of awful pressure around you Logic tells you how you are clamped about but deeper than logic is the intuition that the glass walls are pressing in on themselves at the point of collapse Your ears tingle with the feel of it your head rings with it You are breathing in through your nose thin unsatisfying gulps of air that cause your lungs to labor at their task and you are exhaling through your mouth with difficulty into the barrel of the powerful pump No bubbles arise from the tiny hole where the used air is forced into the water The pressure is too enormous for that Only a thin milky line marks its escape from the sphere In a ghostly way you see Stanley turning the pump handle With a handful of waste which he has borrowed from the Rosa s engine room the Professor wipes from the section of wall through which the searchlight plays the moisture that constantly collects there I sit with my hand near the key peering downward and ahead like an engineer in a locomotive cab ready to raise the shell or lower it as occasion warrants And always the suffocating awareness of pressure Strange and mystic journey as the tortured glass sphere floated over the bottom following the slow drift of the Rosa far above The finger of light played along the tilted side of a wrecked tramp steamer There was a crumpled gash in the bow From this ragged hole suddenly appeared a great serpentine form The Professor clutched at his camera pointed it and clenched his hands in a frenzy of disappointment The serpent shape had disappeared back into the hull A little later and we had drifted slowly past the wreck Damn it the Professor snatched away his mouthpiece to exclaim If we could only stop The bottom changed character shortly after we had passed the hulk We began to creep over low gently rounded mounds These were so regular in form that they were puzzling About fifty feet across and ten in altitude they looked artificial in their symmetry like great saucers set on the ocean floor bottom side up They took on a dirty black hue as our light struck them and glowed with a faint phosphorescence as they stretched away into the darkness A twelve foot monstrosity all toad like head and eyes swam into the light beam and bumped blindly against the glass ball For an instant it goggled crazily at us The Professor took its picture It blundered away As it reached the darkness beyond the beam it too showed phosphorescent A belt of blue white spots like the portholes of a liner extended down its ugly sides Along the bottom between the curious mounds writhed a wormlike thing But it was too huge to be described as truly wormlike it was eighteen or twenty feet long and a foot thick It was blood red almost blunt ended and patently without eyes I took my gaze off it for an instant When I looked again it had disappeared I blinked at this seeming miracle and then discovered a foot or so of its tail protruding from under the edge of one of the mounds It was threshing furiously about It was at this instant that I suddenly found increased difficulty and glanced at Stanley He had stopped pumping and was clutching at the Professor s arm with one hand while he pointed down with the other The Professor motioned him toward the pump and began to click pictures furiously with the camera pointed at the nearest mound Wondering at the urgency of Stanley s gesture and the frantic clicking of the camera shutter I looked more closely at the curious saucerlike hump Under closer inspection something remarkably like a huge mud colored eye was revealed And as we drifted along twenty feet away on the farther slope another appeared Paralyzed I stared at the edges of the thing They were waving almost imperceptibly up and down creeping The mounds were living creatures Acres and acres of them lying lethargically on the bottom waiting for something to crawl within range of their monstrous edges Involuntarily I pressed the key to raise us But we had gone only a few feet when the Professor called to me Down again Martin I don t think these things will bother us unless we scrape against them Anyway they can t hurt the shell I lowered the ball to our former twenty foot level and there we swung just over the monsters backs The Professor had said that the giant inverted saucers would probably not bother us if we did not come in contact with them It soon became apparent that in a measure he was right The creatures either could not or would not lift their enormous bulks from the sea floor A gigantic wriggling thing all grotesque fringe and tentacles drifted down into the range of our light Lower it floated until it hovered just above one of the larger mounds The Professor got its portrait At the same instant as though it had heard the click of the shutter and been frightened by it the thing dropped another foot and touched the sloping back With the speed of light the inverted saucer became a cup Like a clenching fist the cup closed over one of the straggling tentacles There followed a tug of war that was all the more ghastly for its soundlessness The hunted jerked spasmodically to get away from the hunter So wild were its efforts that several times it raised the monster clear of the bottom for a foot or so But the grim clutch could not be broken Closer and closer it was dragged Then after a supreme paroxysm the tentacle parted and the prey escaped The tentacle disappeared into the mass of the baffled hunter It made no attempt to follow the fleeing creature It slowly relaxed along the bottom and waited for its next meal The unearthly incident gave us fresh confidence convincing us that the monsters did not move unless they were directly touched Of course we could not foresee the fatal accident that was going to put us within reach of one of the giant saucers We thought for awhile that these great blobs of cold life were the largest creatures of the depths It was soon made clear to us how mistaken that notion was For a time we gazed spellbound at the nightmare assortment of grotesqueries that gradually assembled around us attracted no doubt by our light The things were mainly sightless and of indescribable shape Most of them were phosphorescent and they avoided collisions in a way that suggested that they had some buried sense of light perception As time passed the Professor emptied his camera refilled it several times and groaned that he had no more film Twice as we drifted along I raised us to keep us clear of a gradual upward slope of the smooth floor Stanley removed his mouthpiece long enough to suggest that we go back to the surface we had been submerged for nearly four hours now But before we could reply a violent movement was felt The ball rocked and twirled so that we were forced to cling to the circular bench to avoid being thrown to the floor It was as though a hurricane of wind had suddenly penetrated the unruffled depths Earthquake called Stanley Don t know answered the Professor He swung the searchlight in an arc and focussed it at length on something that appeared only as a field of blurred movement He wiped the moisture from the wall before the lens and there was revealed to us a sight that makes my heart pound even now when I recall it to memory Something vast and serpentine had ventured too near the bottom and had been caught by the death traps there The creature was a writhing mass of gigantic coils It was impossible even to guess at its length but its girth was such that the mound shaped monsters that had fastened to it could not entirely encircle it There it twined and knotted a mighty serpent of the deepest ocean snapping its awful length and threshing its powerful tail in an effort to dislodge the giant leeches that were flattened against it And every time it touched the bottom in its blind frenzy more of the teeming deathtraps attached themselves to it crawling over their fellows in an effort to find unoccupied areas Soon the sea serpent was a distorted creeping mass For one appalling instant its head came into our view It resembled the head of a crocodile only it was ten times larger and covered with scale like the armor plate of a destroyer The jaws wide open and slashing with enormous needle shaped teeth at the huge parasites were large enough to have held our glass sphere One eye appeared It was at least three feet across and of a shimmering amethyst color One of the deadly saucers wrapped itself around the great head The entire mass of attackers and attacked settled slowly to the bottom But before it completely succumbed the beaten monster gave one last convulsive flick of its tail Good God cried Stanley shrinking away from the pump and staring upward I followed his gaze with my own eyes In the faint reflected glow of the searchlight I could see row on row of large cups flattened against the top of the ball As I watched these flattened still more and the big sphere quivered perceptibly In its death struggle the mighty serpent had flicked one of the huge leeches against us It now clung there with blind tenacity covering nearly two thirds of our shell with the underside of its body I reached for the control key to send us to the surface Don t snapped the Professor The weight He needed to say no more My hand recoiled as though the key had been red hot The three quarter inch cable above us was now sustaining in addition to its own huge weight our massive glass ball and the appalling tonnage of this grim blanket of flesh that encircled us Could it further hold against the strain of lifting that combined tonnage through the press of the water Almost certainly it could not There was nothing we could do but hang there and discover at first hand exactly what happened to things that were clamped in those mighty living vises The Professor turned on the interior bulb The result was ghastly It showed every detail of the belly of the thing that gripped us Crowded over its entire under surface were gristly flattened suckers Now and then a convulsive ripple ran through its surface tissue and great ridges of flesh stood out With each squeeze the glass shell quivered ominously as though the extreme limit of its pressure resisting power were being reached and passed A nice fix remarked the Professor his calm dry voice acting like a tonic in that moment of fear If we try to go up the cable would probably break If we try to outlast the patience of this thing we might run out of air or actually be staved in He paused thoughtfully I suggest though that we follow the latter course for awhile at least It would be just too bad if that cable broke gentlemen Stanley shuddered and looked at the dirty white belly that pressed against the glass walls on all sides I vote we stay here for a time And I was my addition I relieved Stanley at the pump He and the Professor sat down on the bench Casting frequent glances at the constricted blanket of flesh that covered us we prepared to wait as composedly as we might for the thing to give up its effort to smash our shell The hour that followed was longer than any full day I have ever lived through Had I not confirmed the passage of time by looking at my watch I would have sworn that at least twenty hours had passed Every half minute I gazed at that weaving pattern of cup shaped suckers only five feet away trying to see if they were relaxing in their pressure I attempted to persuade myself that they were But I knew I was only imagining it Actually they were pressed as flat as ever and the sphere still quivered at regular intervals as the heavy body squeezed in on itself There was no sign that its blind mindless patience was becoming exhausted There was little conversation during that interminable hour Stanley grinned wryly once and commented on the creature s disappointment if it actually succeeded in getting at us We d be scattered all over the surrounding half mile by the pressure of the water he said There d be nothing left for our pet to feed on but five foot chunks of broken glass Not a very satisfying meal We might try to reason with the thing point out how foolish it is to waste its time on us I suggested trying to appear as nonchalant as he was The Professor said nothing He was coolly writing in his notebook describing minutely the appearance of our abysmal captor Finally I chanced to look down through a section of wall not covered by our stubborn enemy I wiped the moisture from the glass before the searchlight so that I could see more clearly The bottom seemed to be heaving up and down I blinked my eyes and looked again It was not an illusion With a regular dip and rise we were approaching to within a few feet of the rocky floor and moving back up again Also we were floating faster than at anytime previous The bottom was bare again we had left the crowding ominous mounds I waved to the Professor He snapped his notebook shut and stared at the uneasy ocean bottom I ve been hoping I was wrong he said simply I thought I felt a wavy motion fifteen minutes ago and it seemed to me to increase steadily The three of us stared at each other You mean began Stanley with a shudder I mean that the Rosa one mile above us is having difficulties A storm Judging from our movement it must be a hurricane the length of cable would cushion us from any average wave and we are rising and falling at least fifteen feet My God groaned Stanley The Rosa is already heeled with the weight of us She could never weather a hurricane The plight of the crew above our heads was as clear to us as though we had been aboard with them Should they cut the cable figuring that the lives of the three of us were certainly not to be set against the thirty on the yacht Should they disconnect the electric control and try to haul us up regardless Or should they try to ride out the storm in spite of being crippled by the drag of us I think if I were up there I d cut us adrift said Stanley grimly Both the Professor and myself nodded Though he added hopefully my captain is a good gambler The cable quivered like a live thing under the terrific strain At each downward swoop before the upswing began there was a sickening sag We no longer have a decision to make said the Professor Press the key Martin and God grant we can rise with all this dead weight And at that instant the crew of the Rosa were also relieved of the necessity for making a decision At the bottom of one of those long sickening falls there was a jerk and we continued on down to the ocean floor The sphere rolled over jumbling the equipment in a tangled mess with the three of us in the center bruised and cut The light snapped off as the battery connections were torn loose There we lay at the bottom of Penguin Deep in an inert sphere that was dead and dark in the surrounding blackness a coffin of glass to hold us through the centuries Martin I heard the Professor s voice after a time Stanley can either of you move I m caught I m caught too came Stanley s gasping answer Something on my leg feels like it s broken A heavy object was pressing across my body With an effort I freed myself and fumbled in the pitch darkness for the other two Lights first commanded the Professor The pump you know I did know Frantically I scrambled in the dark till I located the batteries They were right side up and still wired together The air grew rapidly foul with no one at the pump Panting for breath I blundered at the task of connecting the light After what seemed an eternity I accomplished it The light revealed Stanley with an air tank lying across his leg The mouthpiece of his breathing tube had been forced back over his head gashing his face in its journey His face was white with pain The Professor was caught under the heavy bench I freed him and together we attended to Stanley finding that his leg wasn t broken but only badly bruised The mound shaped monster dislodged possibly by the fall was nowhere to be seen I resumed work at the pump the connections of which were so strongly contrived that they had withstood the shock of the upset For a moment we were content to rest while the air grew purer Then we were forced squarely to face our fate The Professor summed up the facts in a few concise words We re certainly doomed Here at the bottom of Penguin Deep we re as out of reach of help as though we were stranded on the moon We re as good as dead right now If we have nothing left to hope for whispered Stanley after a time we might as well close the air valves and get it over with at once No use torturing ourselves The Professor moistened his lips It might be wise He turned to me What s your opinion Martin But I I confess I had not the stark courage of these two No No I cried out Let s keep on living as long as the air holds out Something might happen I avoided their eyes as I said it utterly ashamed of my cowardly quibbling with death What in the name of God could possibly happen to help us The Professor shrugged dully and nodded I feel with Stanley that we ought to get it over in one short stab But we have no right to force you His voice trailed off We readjusted our mouthpieces I turned automatically at the pump and we silently awaited the last suffocating moment of our final doom As before attracted by the light a strange assortment of deep sea life wriggled and darted about us swimming lazily among the looped coils and twists of our cable which had settled down around us Among these were certain fish that resembled great porcupines Spines a foot and a half long like living knife blades protected them from the attacks of other species They were the only things we saw that were not constantly writhing away from the jaws of some hostile monster the only things that seemed able to swim about their own affairs without even deigning to watch for danger Fascinated I watched the six foot creatures Here were we reasoning humans supposed lords of creation slowly but surely perishing while only a few feet away one of the lowest forms of life could exist in perfect safety and tranquility Then as I watched them I seemed to see a difference in some of them The majority of them had two fins just behind the gill slits typical fish tails and blunt sloping heads But now and then I saw a spined monster that was queerly unlike its fellows Instead of two front fins these unique ones had two vacant round holes The head looked as though it had forgotten to grow its place was taken by an eyeless projecting shield shaped cap And there was no tail Glad to find something to distract my half crazed thoughts I studied the nearest of these They moved slower than their tailed and finned brothers I noticed I wondered how they could move at all lacking in any kind of motive power as they seemed to be Next instant the secret of their movement was made clear Out of the empty fin holes of the creature I was studying crept two long powerful looking tentacles But these were not true tentacles There were no vacuum discs on them and they moved as though supported by jointed bones like arms The arms ended in flat paddles that resembled hands These threshed the water in a sort of breast stroke propelling the body forward Shortly after the arms had appeared the spiny head cap was cautiously extended a few inches forward from the main shell Further it was extended as the head of a turtle might slowly appear from the protection of its bony case And under it Professor I screamed wildly My God Look Both the Professor and Stanley merely stared dully at me I babbled of what I had seen A man A human looking thing anyway Arms and a head A man inside a fish s spined hide like armor They looked pityingly at me The Professor laid his hand on my shoulder Now now he soothed don t go to pieces I tell you I saw it I shouted Then shrinking from the hysterical loudness of my own voice I lowered my tone Something that looks human has occupied some of those prickly six foot shells I saw arms and a man s head I swear it
4110_11528_000015_000000	train-clean-360	 Nonsense 
none	none	How could a human being stand the cold the pressure Here I happened to glance at the wall of the shell through which the searchlight shone Look See for yourself Squarely in the rays of the light showed a head projecting from one of the shells and capped with a wide flat helmet of horned bone There were eyes and nose and mouth placed on one side of that head a face There were even tabs of flesh or bony protuberances that resembled ears Curious muttered the Professor staring It certainly looks human enough to talk But it s only a fish nevertheless See in the throat are gill slits But the eyes Look at them They re not the eyes of a fish And they were not There was in them a light of reason of intelligence Those eyes were roaming brightly over us observing the light the equipment seeming to note our amazement as we crowded to look at it The sphere rocked slightly Behind the staring manlike visitor there was a glimpse of enormous crocodile jaws and huge amethyst eyes Instantly the head and arms receded leaving an empty seeming lifeless shell An impregnable fortress of spines the thing drifted slowly away through the twisted loops of cable It certainly looked like began Stanley shakily The creature was just a fish said the Professor shaking his head at the light in Stanley s eyes Some sort of giant parasite that inhabits the shells of other fish He opened the valve of the last air cylinder and seated himself resignedly on the bench We have another half hour or so All of us suddenly put out our hands to brace ourselves The sphere had moved Look at the cable called Stanley We did so It was moving writhing away from us over the bottom as though abruptly given life of its own Coil after coil disappeared into the further gloom At length the cable was straight The ball moved again was dragged a few feet along the rocky floor Something possessed of incredibly vast power had seized the end of the steel cable and was reeling us in as a fisherman reels in a trout Slowly unsteadily we slid along the ocean floor Ahead of us appeared a jagged black wall a cliff There was a gloomy hole at its base Toward this we were being dragged by whatever it was that had caught the end of the cable Helpless we watched ourselves engulfed by the murky den In the beam of the searchlight we saw that the submarine cavern extended on and on for an unguessable depth The cable taut with the strain stretched ahead out of sight Time had been lost track of during that mysterious ominous journey It was recalled to us by the state of the air we were breathing The Professor removed his mouthpiece and cast the tube aside You might as well stop pumping Martin he said quietly We re done There s no more air in the flask We stared at each other Then we shook hands solemnly tremulously taking leave of each other before we departed on that longest of all journeys The air in that small space was rapidly exhausted We lay on the floor laboring for breath and closed our eyes The Professor the oldest of the three of us succumbed first I heard his breath whistle stertorously and glancing at him saw that he was in a coma In a moment Stanley had joined him in blessed unconsciousness I could feel myself drifting off Hammers beat at my ears Daggers pierced my heaving lungs Hazily I could see scores of the bristly manlike fish when I opened my eyes and glanced through the walls It was not one monster then but many that had brought us to their lair Abruptly as though a signal had been given they all streamed back toward the mouth of the cavern My eyesight dimmed The hammers pulsed louder A veil descended over my senses and I knew no more A soft sustained roar came to my ears Through my closed eyelids I could sense light A dank fishy smell came to my nostrils I groaned and moved feebly finding that I was resting on something soft and pleasant Dazedly I opened my eyes and sat up An exclamation burst from me as I suddenly remembered what had gone before and realized that somehow incredibly I was still living Feeling like a man who has waked from a nightmarish sleep to find himself in his tomb I gazed about I was in a long lofty rock chamber the uneven floor of which was covered with shallow pools of water The further end was of smooth grained stone that resembled cement The near end was rough like the walls but in it there was a small symmetrical arch the mouth of a passage leading away to some other point in the bowels of the earth The place was flooded with clear light that had a rosy tinge From my position on the floor I could not see what made the light It streamed from a crevice that extended clear around the cave parallel with the floor and about twelve feet above it From this groove along with the light came the soft roaring hiss Beside me was the glass ball the cover off and lying a few feet away from the opening in the top There was no trace of Stanley or the Professor I rose from my couch a thick mattresslike affair of soft pliant hide and walked feebly toward the small arch in the near end of the cave Even as I approached it I heard footsteps and voices resounded in some slurring musical language Half a dozen figures suddenly came into view They were men as human as myself Indeed as I gazed at them I felt inclined to think they were even more human They were magnificent specimens The smallest could not have been less than six feet three and all of them were muscular and finely proportioned Their faces were arresting in their expression of calm strength and kindliness They looked like gods arrayed in soft thick beautifully tanned hides in this rosy tinted hole a mile below the ocean s top They stared at me for an instant then advanced toward me My face must have reflected alarm for the tallest of them held up his hand palm outward in a peaceful gesture The leader spoke to me Of course the slurred melodious syllable meant nothing to me He smiled and indicated that I was to follow him I did so hardly aware of what I was doing my brain reeling in an attempt to grasp the situation How marvelous how utterly incredible to find human beings here How many were there Where had they come from How had they salvaged us from Penguin Deep I gave it up striding along with my towering guards like a man walking in his sleep At length the low passageway ended and I exclaimed aloud at what I saw I was looking down a long avenue of buildings all three stories in height There were large door and window apertures but no doors nor window panes In front of each house was a small square with wonder of wonders a lawn of whitish yellow vegetation that resembled grass In some of the lawns were set artistic fountains of carved rock I might have been looking down any prosperous earthly subdivision save for the fact that the roofs of the houses were the earth itself which the building walls in addition to functioning as partitions served to support Also earthly subdivisions aren t usually illuminated with rosy light that comes softly roaring from jets set in the walls We were walking toward a more brightly lighted area that showed ahead of us On the way we passed intersections where other similar streets branched geometrically away to right and left These were smaller than the one we were on indicating that ours was Main Street in this bizarre submarine city Faces appeared at door and window openings to peer at me as we passed And even in that jumbled moment I had time to realize that these folk could restrain curiosity better than we can atop the earth There was no hub bub no running out to tag after the queerly dressed foreigner and shout humorous remarks at him We approached the bright spot I had noticed from afar It was an open square about a city block in area in the center of which was a royal looking building covered with blazing fragments of crystal and so brilliantly resplendent with light that it seemed to glow at the heart of a pink fire I was led toward this and in through a wide doorway As courteously as though I were a visiting king I was conducted up a great staircase down a corridor set with more of the sparkling crystals and into a huge low room There my escort bowed and left me Still feeling that I could not possibly be awake and seeing actual things I glanced around In a corner was another of the mattresslike couches made of the thick soft hide that seemed to be the principal fabric of the place A few feet away was a table set with dishes of food in barbaric profusion None of the viands looked familiar but all appealed to the appetite The floor was strewn with soft skins and comfortable carved benches were scattered about I walked to the window and looked out Underneath was a plot of the cream colored grass through which ran a tiny stream This widened at intervals into clear pools beside which were set stone benches A hundred yards away was the edge of the square where the regular three storied houses began While I was staring at this unearthly vista still unable to think with any coherence I heard my name called I turned to face Stanley and the Professor Both were pale in the rose light and Stanley limped with the pain of his bruised leg but both had recovered from their partial suffocation as completely as had I We thought perhaps you d decided to swim back up to the Rosa and leave us to our fates said Stanley after we had stopped pumping each other s arms and had seated ourselves And I thought well I didn t think much of anything I replied I was too busy straining my eyesight over the wonders of this city Did you ever see anything like it We haven t seen it at all save for a view from the windows said Stanley All we know of the place is that a while ago we woke up in a room like this only much smaller and less lavish I wonder why you rate this distinction I described the streets as I had seen them It is impossible for me to think of them as anything but streets it would seem as though the rock roof over all would give the appearance of a series of tunnels but I had always the impression of airiness and openness Light and heat are furnished by natural gas said the Professor when I remarked on the perfection of these two necessities That s what makes the low roaring noise the thousands of burning jets But the presence of gas here isn t as unusual as the presence of air Where does that come from Through wandering underground mazes from some cave mouth in the Fiji Islands to the north That would indicate that all the earth around here is honeycombed like a gigantic section of sponge I wonder Have you any idea how we were rescued I interrupted a little impatient of his abstract scientific ponderings We have said Stanley A woman told us We woke up to find her nursing us gorgeous looking thing finest woman I ve ever seen and I ve seen a good many She didn t exactly tell us remarked the Professor with his thin smile Women were only interesting to him as biological studies She drew a diagram that explained it That tunnel Martin was like the outer diving chamber of a submarine We were hauled in on a big windlass driven by gas turbines I think Once we were inside a twenty yard counterbalanced wall of rock was lowered across the entrance Then the water was drained out through a well and into a subterranean body of water that extends under the entire city And here we are We fell silent Here we were But what was going to happen to us among these friendly seeming people and how if ever we were going to get back to the earth s surface were questions we could not even try to answer We ate of the appetizing food laid out on the long table Shortly afterward we heard steps in the corridor outside the room A woman entered She was ravishingly beautiful tall slender but symmetrically rounded A soft leather robe slanted upward across her breast to a single shoulder fastening and ended just above her knees in a skirt arrangement Around her head was a regal circlet of silvery gray metal with a flashing bit of crystal set in the center above her broad low forehead She smiled at Stanley who looked dazzled and smiled eagerly back She pointed toward the door signifying that we were to go with her We did so and were led down the great staircase and to a huge room that took up half the ground floor of the building And here we met the nobility of the little kingdom the upper class that governed the immaculate little city They were standing along the walls leaving a lane down the center of the room tall finely modelled men and women dressed in the single garments of soft leather There were people there with gray hair and wisdom wrinkled faces but all were alike in being erect of body firm of bearing and in splendid health They stopped talking as we entered the big room Our gaze strayed ahead down the lane toward the further wall Here was a raised dais On it was a gleaming crystal encrusted throne And occupying it was the most queenly exquisitely beautiful woman I had ever dreamed about Woman She was just a girl in years in spite of her grave and royal air Her eyes were deep violet Her hair was black as ebony and gleaming with sudden glints of light Her skin But she cannot be described Only a great painter could give a hint of her glory Too I might truthfully be described as prejudiced about her perfections The Queen for patently she was that bowed graciously at us It seemed to me though I told myself that I was an imaginative fool that her eyes rested longest on me and had in them an expression not granted to the Professor or Stanley She spoke to us a melodious sentence or two and waved her beautiful hand in which was a short ivory wand evidently a scepter She s probably giving us the keys to the city whispered Stanley He edged nearer the fair one who had conducted us I sincerely hope there s room here for us The open lane closed in on us Men and women crowded about us speaking to us and smiling ruefully as they realized we could not understand I noticed that for some curious reason they seemed fascinated by the color of my hair Red haired men were evidently scarce there At length the beauty who had so captured Stanley s fancy and who seemed to have been appointed a sort of mentor for us suggested in sign language that we might want to return to our quarters It was a welcome suggestion We were done in by the experiences and emotions that had gripped us since leaving the Rosa such an incredibly few hours ago We went back to the second floor I to my luxurious big apartment and Stanley and the Professor to their smaller but equally comfortable rooms A pleasant period slid by every waking hour of which was filled with new experiences The city s name we found was Zyobor It was a perfect little community There were artisans and thinkers artists and laborers all alike in being physically perfect beyond belief and cultured as no race on top the ground is cultured As we began to learn the language more exact details of the practical methods of existence were revealed to us The surrounding earth furnished them with building materials metals and unlimited gas The sea so near us and yet so securely walled away gave them food Which warrants a more detailed description We were informed that the manlike two armed fishes were the servants of these people domesticated animals in a sense only of an extremely high order of intelligence They were directed by mental telepathy Every man woman and child in Zyobor was skilled at thought projection They conversed constantly from end to end of the city by mental telepathy Protected in their spined shells which they captured from the schools of porcupine fish that swarmed in Penguin Deep they gathered sea vegetation from the higher levels and trapped sea creatures These were brought into the subterranean chamber where our glass ball now reposed Then the chamber was emptied of water and the food was borne to the city The vast army of mound fish provided the bulk of the population s food and also furnished the thick pliant skin they used for clothing and drapes They were cultivated as we cultivate cattle an ominous herd to be handled with care and approached by the fish servants with due caution Thus with all reasonable wants satisfied with talent and brains to design beautiful surroundings lighted and warmed by inexhaustible natural gas these fortunate beings lived their sheltered lives in their rosy underground world At least I thought their lives were sheltered then It was only later when talking to the beautiful young Queen that I learned of the dread menace that had begun to draw near to them just a short time before we were rescued My first impression when we had entered the throne room that first day that the Queen had regarded me more intently than she had Stanley or the Professor had been right It pleased her to treat me as an equal and to give me more of her time than was granted to any other person in the city Every day for a growing number of hours we were together in her apartment She personally instructed me in the language and such was my desire to talk to this radiant being that I made an apt pupil Soon I had progressed enough to converse with her in a stilted incorrect way on all but the most abstract of subjects It was a fine language I liked it as I liked everything else about Zyobor The upper earth seemed far away and well forgotten Her name I found was Aga A beautiful name How did your kingdom begin I asked her one day while we were sitting beside one of the small pools in the gardens We were close together Now and then my shoulder touched hers and she did not draw away I know not she replied It is older than any of our ancient records can say I am the three hundred and eleventh of the present reigning line And we are the first to enter thy realm from the upper world Thou art the first There is no other entrance but the sea way into which we were drawn There is no other entrance I was silent trying to realize the finality of my residence here At the moment I didn t care much if I never got home In the monarchies we know above I said finally avoiding her violet eyes it is not the custom for the queen or king to reign alone A consort is chosen Is it not so here Has thou not among thy nobles some one thou hast destined I stopped feeling that if she dismissed me in anger and never spoke to me again the punishment would be just But she wasn t angry A lovely tide of color stained her cheeks Her lips parted and she turned her head For a long time she said nothing Then she faced me with a light in her eyes that sent the blood racing in my veins I have not yet chosen she murmured Mayhap soon I shall tell thee why She rose and hurried back toward the palace But at the door she paused and smiled at me in a way that had nothing whatever to do with queenship As the time sped by the three of us settled into the routine of the city as though we had never known of anything else The Professor spent most of his time down by the sea chamber where the food was dragged in by the intelligent servant fish He was in a zoologist s paradise Not a creature that came in there had ever been catalogued before He wrote reams of notes on the parchment paper used by the citizens in recording their transactions Particularly was he interested in the vast lowly mound fish One time when I happened to be with him the receding waters of the chamber disclosed the body of one of the odd herdsmen of these deep sea flocks Then the Professor s elation knew no bounds We hurried forward to look at it It is a typical fish puzzled the Professor when we had cut the body out of its usurped armor Cold blooded adapted to the chill and pressure of the deeps There are the gills I observed before yet it looks very human It surely did There were the jointed arms and the rudimentary hands Its forehead was domed and the brain when dissected proved much larger than the brain of a true fish Also its bones were not those of a mammal but the cartilagenous bones of a fish It was not quite six feet long just fitted the horny shell But its intelligence fretted the Professor glorying in his inability to classify this marvelous specimen No fish could ever attain such mental development Evolution working backward from human to reptile and then fish or a new freak of evolution whereby a fish on a short cut toward becoming human He sighed and gave it up But more reams of notes were written Why do you take them I asked No one but yourself will ever see them He looked at me with professorial absent mindedness I take them for the fun of it principally But perhaps sometime we may figure out a way of getting them up My God Wouldn t my learned brother scientists be set in an uproar He bent to his observations and dissections again cursing now and then at the distortion suffered by the specimens when they were released from the deep sea pressure and swelled and burst in the atmospheric pressure in the cave Stanley was engrossed in a different way Since the moment he laid eyes on her he had belonged to the stately woman who had first nursed him back to consciousness Mayis was her name From shepherding the three of us around Zyobor and explaining its marvels to us she had taken to exclusive tutorship of Stanley And Stanley fairly ate it up You the notorious woman hater I taunted him one time the wary bachelor to fall at last And for a woman of another world almost of another planet I m amazed I don t know why you should be amazed said he stiffly You ve been telling me ever since I was a kid that women were all useless all alike I find I was mistaken he interrupted They aren t all alike There s only one Mayis She is different What do you talk about all the time You re with her constantly I m not with her any more than you re with the Queen he shot back at me What do you find to talk about That shut me up He went to look for Mayis and I wandered to the royal apartments in search of Aga In the first days of our friendship I had several times surprised in Aga s eyes a curious expression one that seemed compounded of despair horror and resignation I had seen that same expression in the eyes of the nobles of late and in the faces of all the people I encountered in the streets who I mustn t forget to add here never failed to treat me with a deference that was as intoxicating as it was inexplicable It was as though some terrible fate hovered over the populace some dreadful doom about which nothing could be done No one put into words any fears that might confirm that impression but continually I got the idea that everybody there went about in a state of attempting to live normally and happily while life was still left before some awful wholesale death descended on them At last from Aga I learned the fateful reason But first a confession that was hastened by the knowledge of the fate of the city I learned from her something that changed all of life for me We were surrounded by the luxury of her private apartment We sat on a low divan side by side I wanted more than anything I had ever wanted before to put my arms around her But I dared not One does not make love easily to a queen the three hundred and eleventh of a proud line And then as maids have done often in all countries and perhaps on all planets she took the initiative herself We have a curious custom in Zyobor of which I have not yet told thee she murmured It concerns the kings of Zyobor The color of their hair She glanced up at my own carrot top and then averted her gaze For all of our history our kings have had red hair On the few occasions when the line has been reduced to a lone queen as in my case the red haired men of the kingdom have striven together in public combat to determine which was most powerful and brave The winner became the Queen s consort And in this case I asked my heart beginning to pound madly In my case my lord there is to be no no striving When I was a child our only two red haired males died one by accident one by sickness Now there are none others but infants none of eligible age But by a miracle thou She stopped then gazed up at me from under long gold flecked lashes I was afraid I was doomed to die alone It was after I had replied impetuously to this that she told me of the terror that was about to engulf all life in the beautiful undersea city Thou hast wonder perhaps why I should be forward enough to tell thee this instead of waiting for thine own confession first she faltered Know then the reason is the shortness of the time we are fated to spend together We shall belong each to the other only a little while Then shall we belong to death And I when I knew the time was to be so brief And I listened with growing horror to her account of the enemy that was advancing toward us with every passing moment About twenty miles away in the lowest depression of Penguin Deep lived a race of monsters which the people of Aga s city called Quabos The Quabos were grim beings that were more intelligent than Aga s fish servants even she thought more intelligent than humans themselves They had existed in their dark hole as far as the Zyobites knew from the beginning of time Through the countless centuries they had constructed for themselves a vast series of dens in the rock There they had hidden away from the deep sea dangers They too preyed on the mound fish but as there was plenty of food for all the Zyobites had never paid much attention to them But just before we had appeared there had come about a subterranean quake that changed the entire complexion of matters in Penguin Deep The earthquake wiped out the elaborately burrowed sea tunnels of the Quabos killing half of them at a blow and driving the rest out into the unfriendly openness of the deep Now this was fatal to them They were not used to physical self defense During the thousands of years of residence in their sheltered burrows they had become utterly unable to exist when exposed to the primeval dangers of the sea It was as though the civilization softened citizens of New York should suddenly be set down in a howling wilderness with nothing but their bare hands with which to contrive all the necessities of a living Such was the situation at the time Stanley the Professor and myself arrived in Zyobor The Quabos must find an immediate haven or perish On the ocean bottom they were threatened by the mound fish In the higher levels they were in danger from almost everything that swam few things were so defenceless as themselves after their long inertia Their answer was Zyobor There in perfect security only to be reached by the diving chamber that could be sealed at will by the twenty yard counterbalanced lock the Quabos would be even more protected than in their former runways So they were working day and night to invade Aga s city But Aga I interrupted impulsively at this point If these monsters are fishes how could they live here in air I stopped as my objection answered itself before she could reply They would not have to live in air to inhabit Zyobor They would inundate the city flood that peaceful beautiful place with the awful pressure of the lowest depths That thought in turn suggested to me that every building in Zyobor would be swept flat if subjected suddenly to the rush of the sea The great low cavern without the support of the myriad walls would probably collapse trapping the invading Quabos and leaving the rest without a home once more But Aga answered this before I could voice it The Quabos had foreseen that point They were tunneling slowly but surely toward the city from a point about half a mile from the diving chamber And as they advanced they blocked up the passageway behind them at intervals drilled down to the great underground sea that lay beneath all this section and drained a little of the water away In this manner they lightened bit by bit the enormous weight of the ocean depths When the city was finally reached not only would it be ensured against sudden destruction but the Quabos themselves would have become accustomed to the difference in pressure Had they gone immediately from the accustomed press of Penguin Deep into the atmosphere of Zyobor they would have burst into bits As it was they would be able to flood the city slowly without injury to themselves Now thou knowest our fate concluded Aga with a shudder Zyobor will be a part of the great waters We ourselves shall be food for these monsters She faltered and stopped But this cannot be I exclaimed clenching my fists impotently There must be something we can do some way There is nothing to be done Our wisest men have set themselves sleeplessly to the task of defence There is no defence possible We can t simply sit here and wait Your people are wonderful but this is no time for resignation Send for my two friends Aga We will have a council of war we four and see if we can find a way She shrugged despairfully started to speak then sent in quest of Stanley and the Professor They as well as myself had had no idea of the menace that crept nearer us with each passing hour They were dumbfounded horrified to learn of the peril We sat awhile in silence realizing our situation to the full Then the Professor spoke If only we could see what these things look like It might help in planning to defeat them That can be done with ease said Aga Come We went with her to the gardens and approached the nearest pool My fish men are watching the Quabos constantly They report to me by telepathy whenever I send my thoughts their way I will let you see on the pool the things they are now seeing She stared intently at the sheet of water And gradually as we watched a picture appeared a picture that will never fade from my memory in any smallest detail The Quabos had huddled for protection into a large cave at the foot of the cliff outside Zyobor There were a great many Quabos and the cave was relatively confining Now we saw through the eyes of the spine protected outpost of the Queen these monstrous refugees crowded together like sheep The watery cavern was a creeping mass of viscous tentacles enormous staring eyes and globular heads The cave was paved three deep with the horrible things and they were attached to the it walls and roof in solid blocks My God whispered Stanley There are thousands of them There were And that they were in distress was evident The layers on the floor were weaving and shifting constantly as the bottom creatures struggled feebly to rise to the top of the mass and be relieved of the weight of their brothers Also they were famished One of the blood red gigantic worms floated near the cave entrance Like lightning the nearest Quabos darted after it In a moment the prey was torn to bits by the ravenous monsters The other side of the story was immediately portrayed to us With the emerging of the reckless Quabos a sea serpent appeared from above and snapped up three of their number Evidently the huge serpent considered them succulent tidbits and made it its business to wait near the cave and avail itself of just such rash chance taking as this While we watched the nightmare scene a Quabo disengaged itself from the parent mass and floated upward into the clear giving us a chance to see more distinctly what the creatures looked like There was a black shiny head as large as a sugar barrel In this were eyes the size of dinner plates and gleaming with a cold hellish intelligence Four long twining tentacles were attached directly to the head Dotted along these were rudimentary sucker discs that had evidently become atrophied by the soft living of thousands of the creature s ancestors As though emerging from the pool into which we were gazing the monster darted viciously at us At once it disappeared the fish servant through whose eyes we were seeing all this had evidently retreated from the approach although protected by its spines it could not have been in actual danger How dost thou know of the tunneling I asked Aga Thy fish men cannot be present there in the rear of the tunnel to report My artisans have knowledge of each forward move she answered I will show thee We walked back to the palace and descended to a smooth lined vault There we saw a great stone shaft sunk down into the rock of the floor On this was a delicate vibration recording instrument of some sort with a needle that quivered rhythmically over several degrees of an arc This tells of each move of the Quabos said Aga It also tells us where they will break through the city wall How near to us are they Kilor she asked an attendant who was studying the dial and who had bowed respectfully to Aga and myself as we approached They will break into the city in four rixas at the present rate of advance Your Majesty Four rixas In a little over sixteen days as we count time the city of Zyobor would be delivered into the hands or rather tentacles of the slimy starving demons that huddled in the cavern outside Somberly we followed Aga back to her apartment As thou seest she murmured there is nothing to be done We can only resign ourselves to the fate that nears us and enjoy as much as may be the few remaining rixas She glanced at me The Professor s dry cool voice cut across our wordless engrossed communion I don t think we ll give up quite as easily as all that We can at least try to outwit our enemies If it does nothing else for us the effort can serve to distract our minds He drew from his pocket a sheet of parchment and the stub of his last remaining pencil His fingers busied themselves apparently idly in the tracing of geometric lines Looking ahead to the exact details of our destruction he mused coolly we see that our most direct and ominous enemy is the sea itself When the city is flooded we drown and later the Quabos can enter at will He drew a few more lines and marked a cross at a point in the outer rim of the diagram What will happen The Quabos force through the last shell of the city wall The water from their tunnel floods into Zyobor But and mark me well only the water from the tunnel The outer end remember is blocked off in their pressure reducing process The vast body of the sea itself cannot immediately be let in here because the Quabos must take as long a time to re accustom themselves to its pressure as they did to work out of it He spread the parchment sheet before us Is this a roughly accurate plan of the city he asked Aga She inclined her lovely head And this indicating the cross is the spot where the Quabos will break in Again she nodded shuddering Then tell me what you think of this said the Professor And he proceeded to sketch out a plan so simple and yet so seemingly efficient that the rest of us gazed at him with wordless admiration My friend my friend whispered Aga at last thou hast saved us Thou art the guardian hero of Zyobor Not too fast Your Highness interrupted the Professor with his frosty smile I shall be much surprised if this little scheme actually saves the city We may find the rock so thick there that our task is hopeless though I imagine the Quabos picked a thin section for help in their own plans A vague look came into his eyes I must certainly get my hands on one of these monsters superhumanly intelligent fish marvelous akin to the octopus perhaps He wandered off changed from the resourceful schemer to the dreamy man of scientific abstractions The Queen gazed after him with wonder in her eyes A great man she murmured but is he a little mad No only a little absent minded I replied Then Come on Stanley We ll round up every able bodied citizen in Zyobor and get to work I suppose they have some kind of rock drilling machinery here They had And they strangely resembled our own rock drills revolving metal shafts driven by gas turbines tipped with fragments of the same crystal that glittered so profusely in the palace walls Another proof that practically every basic badly needed tool had been invented again and again in all lands and times as the necessity for it arose With hundreds of the powerful men of Zyobor working as closely together as they could without cramping each others movements and with the whole city resounding to the roar of the machinery we labored at the defence that might possibly check the advance of the hideous Quabos And with every breath we drew waking or sleeping we realized that the cold blooded inhuman invaders had crept a fraction of an inch closer in their tunneling The Quabos against the Zyobites Fish against man Two diametrically opposed species of life in a struggle to the death Which of us would survive The hour of the struggle approached Every soul in Zyobor moved in a daze with strained face and fear haunted eyes Their proficiency in mental telepathy was a curse to them now every one carried constantly transmitted from the brains of the servant fish outposts a thought picture of that outer cavern in the murky depths of which writhed the thousands of crowding Quabos Each mind in Zyobor was in continual torment Spared that trouble at least Stanley and the Professor and I walked down to the fortification we had so hastily contrived It was finished And none too soon the vibration indicator in the palace vault told us that only two feet of rock separated us from the burrowing monsters The Professor s scheme had been to cut a long slot down through the rock floor of the city to the roof of the vast mysterious body of water below This slot was placed directly in front of the spot in the city wall where the Quabos were about to emerge As they forced through the last shell of rock the deluge of water instead of drowning the city was supposed to drain down the oblong vent Any Quabos that were too near the tunnel entrance would be swept down too In silence we approached the edge of the great trough and stared down There was a stratum of black granite fortunately only about thirty feet thick at this point and then the depths A low roar reached our ears from far far beneath us A steady blast of ice cold air fanned up against us The Professor threw down a large fragment of rock Seconds elapsed and we heard no splash The unseen surface was too far below for the noise of the rock s fall to carry on up to us The mystery of this ball of earth on which we live murmured the Professor Here is this enormous underground body of water We are far below sea level Where then is it flowing What does it empty into Can it be that our planet is honeycombed with such hollows as this we are in And is each inhabited by some form of life He sighed and shook his head The thought is too big For if that were true wouldn t the seas be drained from the surface of the earth should an accidental passage be formed from the ocean bed down to such a giant river as this beneath us How little we know The wild clamor of an alarm bell interrupted his musing From all the city houses poured masses of people to form in solid lines behind the large well In addition to men there were many women in those lines tall and strong ready to stand by their mates as long as life was left them There were children too scarcely in their teens prepared to fight for the existence of the race Every able bodied Zyobite was mustered against the cold blooded Things that pressed so near The arms of these desperate fighters were pitiful compared to our own war weapons With no need in the city for fighting engines none had ever been developed Now the best that could be had was a sort of ax used for dissecting the mound fish and various knives fashioned for peaceful purposes Again the bell clamored forth a warning this time twice repeated Every hand grasped its weapon Every eye went hopefully to the hole in the floor on which our immediate fate depended then valiantly to the section of wall above it This quivered perceptibly A heavy pointed instrument broke through was withdrawn and a hissing stream of water spurted out The Quabos were about to break in upon us With a crash that made the solid rock tremble a section of the wall collapsed It was the top half of the end of the Quabos tunnel They had so wrought that the lower half stayed in place a thing we did not have time to recognize as significant until later A solid wall of water in which writhed dozens of tentacled monsters was upon us and we had time for nothing but action The ditch had of necessity been placed directly under the Quabos entrance The first rush of water carried half over it With it were borne scores of the cold blooded invaders In an instant we were standing knee deep in a torrent that tore at our footing while we hacked frantically with knives and axes at the slimy tentacles that reached up to drag us under A soft horrible mass swept against my legs I was overthrown A tentacle slithered around my neck and constricted viciously like a length of rotten cable I sawed at it with the long notched blade I carried Choking for air I felt the pressure relax and scrambled to my knees Two more tentacles went around me one winding about my legs and the other crushing my waist Two huge eyes glared fiendishly at me I plunged the knife again and again into the barrel shaped head It did not bleed a few drops of thin yellowish liquid oozed from the wounds but aside from this my slashing seemed to make no impression In a frenzy I defended myself against the nightmare head that was winding surely toward me Meanwhile I devoted every energy to keeping on my feet If I ever went under again It seemed to me that the creature was weakening With redoubled fury I hacked at the spidery shape And gradually when it seemed as though I could not withstand its weight and crushing tentacles another second it slipped away and floated off on the shallow roaring rapids For a moment I stood there catching my breath and regaining my strength Shifting terrible scenes flashed before my eyes A tall Zyobite and an almost equally stalwart woman were both caught by one gigantic Quabo which had a tentacle around the throat of each The man and woman were chopping at the viscous gruesome head One of the Thing s eyes was gashed across giving it a fearsome blind appearance It heaved convulsively and the three struggling figures toppled into the water and were swirled away The Professor was almost buried by a Quabo that had all four of its tentacles wound about him As methodically as though he were in a laboratory dissecting room he was cutting the slippery lengths away one by one till the fourth parted and left him free A giant Zyobite was struggling with two of the monsters He had an ax in each hand and was whirling them with such strength and rapidity that they formed flashing circles of light over his head But he was torn down at last and borne off by the almost undiminished flood that gushed from the tunnel And now without warning a heavy soft body flung against my back and the accident most to be dreaded in that melee occurred I was knocked off my feet My head was pressed under the water On my chest was a mass that was yielding but immovable soft but terribly strong Animated firm jelly I had no chance to use my knife My arms were held powerless against my sides Water filled my nose and mouth I strangled for breath heaving at the implacable weight that pinned me helpless Bright spots swirled before my eyes There was a roaring in my ears My lungs felt as though filled with molten lead I was drowning Vaguely I felt the pressure loosen at last An arm with good solid flesh and bone in it slipped under my shoulders and dragged me up into the air Don t you know can t drown a fish holding it under water panted a voice I opened my eyes and saw Stanley his face pale with the thrill of battle his chin jutting forward in a berserk line his eyes snapping with eager wary fires I grinned up at him and he slapped me on the back almost completing the choking process started by the salt water I d inhaled That s better Now at it again I don t remember the rest of the tumult The air seemed filled with loathsome tentacles and bright metal blades It was a confused eternity until the decreased volume of water in the tunnel gave us a respite As the tunnel slowly emptied the pressure dropped and the incoming flood poured squarely into the trough instead of half over it From that moment there was very little more for us to do Our little army with about a fourth of its number gone had only to guard the ditch and see that none of the Quabos caught the edges as they hurtled out of their passage For perhaps ten minutes longer the water poured from the break in the wall with now and then a doomed Quabo that goggled horribly at us as it was dashed down the hole in the floor to whatever awesome depths were beneath Then the flow ceased The last oleaginous corpse was pushed over the edge And the city save for an ankle deep sheet of water that was rapidly draining out the vents in the streets presented its former appearance The Zyobites leaned wearily against convenient walls and began telling themselves how fortunate they were to have been spared what seemed certain destruction The Professor didn t share in the general feeling of triumph Don t be so childishly optimistic he snapped as I began to congratulate him on the victory his ditch had given us Our troubles aren t over yet But we ve proved that we can stand up to them in a hand to tentacle fight His thin frosty smile appeared One of those devils normally is stronger than any three men The only reason all of us weren t destroyed at once is that they were slowly suffocating as they fought The foot and a half of water we were in wasn t enough to let their gills function properly Now if they were able to stand right up to us and not be handicapped by lack of water to breathe I wonder Is that part of their plan Is there any way they could manage But Professor I argued it s all over isn t it The tunnel is emptied and all the Quabos are The tunnel isn t emptied It s only half emptied I ll show you He called Stanley and the three of us went to the break See the Professor pointed out to us as we approached the jagged hole the Quabos only drilled through the top half of their tunnel ending That means that the tunnel still has about four feet of water in it enough to accommodate a great many of the monsters There may be four or five hundred of them left in there possibly more We can expect renewed hostilities at any time But won t it be just a repetition of the first battle remonstrated Stanley In the end they ll be killed or will drown for lack of water as these first ones did The Professor shook his head They re too clever to do that twice The very fact that they kept half their number in reserve shows that they have some new trick to try Otherwise they d all have come at once in one supreme effort He paced back and forth They re ingenious intelligent They re fighting for their very existence They must have figured out some way of breathing in air some way of attacking us on a more even basis in case that first rush went wrong What can it be I think you re borrowing trouble before it is necessary I began smiling at his elaborate scientific pessimism But I was interrupted by a startled shout from Stanley Professor Martin he cried pointing to the tunnel mouth Look Like twin snakes crawling up to sun themselves two tentacles had appeared over the rock rim They hooked over the edge and leisurely with grim surety of invulnerability the barrel like head of a Quabo balanced itself on the ledge and glared at us For a moment we stared paralyzed at the Thing And during that moment it squatted there as undistressed as though the air were its natural element its gills flapping slowly up and down supplying it with oxygen The thing that held us rooted to the spot with fearful amazement was the fantastic device that permitted it to be almost as much at home in air as in water Over the great globular head was set an oval glass shell This was filled with water A flexible metal tube hung down from the rear Evidently it carried a constant stream of fresh water As we gazed we saw intermittent trickles emerging from the bottom of the crystalline case Point for point the creature s equipment was the same as diving equipment used by men only it was exactly opposite in function A helmet that enabled a fish to breathe in air instead of a helmet to allow a man to breathe in water Stanley was the first of us to recover from the shock of this spectacle He faced about and raised his voice in shouts of warning to the resting Zyobites For other glass encased monsters had appeared beside the first now One by one in single file like a line of enormous marching insects they crawled down the wall and humped along on their tentacles around the ditch and toward us The deadly infallibility of that second attack The Quabos advanced on us like armored tanks bearing down on defenceless savages Their glass helmets in addition to containing water for their breathing protected them from our knives and axes We were utterly helpless against them They marched in ranks about twenty yards apart each rank helping the one in front to carry the cumbersome water hoses which trailed back to the central water supply in the tunnel Their movements were slow weighted down as they were by the great glass helmets but they were appallingly sure We could not even retard their advance let alone stop it Here were no suffocating faltering creatures Here were beings possessed of their full vigor each one equal to three of us even as the Professor had conjectured Their only weak points were their tentacles which trailed outside the glass cases But these they kept coiled close so that to reach them and hack at them we had to step within range of their terrific clutches The Zyobites fought with the valor of despair added to their inherent noble bravery Man after man closed with the monstrous armored Things only to be seized and crushed by the weaving tentacles Occasionally a terrific blow with an ax would crack one of the glass helmets Then the denuded Quabo would flounder convulsively in the air till it drowned But there were all too few of these individual victories The main body of the Quabos rank on rank dragging their water hose behind them came on with the steadiness of a machine Slowly we were driven back down the broad street and toward the palace As we retreated old people and children came from the houses and went with us leaving their dwellings to the mercy of the monsters 
4110_11528_000001_000000	train-clean-360	A block from the palace we bunched together and by sheer mass and ferocity actually stopped the machinelike advance for a few moments Miscellaneous weapons had been brought from the houses sledges stone benches anything that might break the Quabos helmets and handed to us in silence by the noncombatants 
4110_11528_000002_000000	train-clean-360	Somebody tugged at my sleeve 
4110_11528_000002_000001	train-clean-360	Looking down I saw a little girl 
none	none	She had dragged a heavy metal bar out to the fray and was trying to get some fighter s attention and give it to him I seized the formidable weapon and jumped at the nearest Quabo a ten foot giant whose eyes were glinting gigantically at me through the distorting curve of the glass 
4110_11528_000004_000000	train-clean-360	Disregarding the clutching tentacles entirely I swung the bar against the helmet 
4110_11528_000004_000001	train-clean-360	It cracked 
4110_11528_000004_000002	train-clean-360	I swung again and it fell in fragments spilling the gallons of water it had contained 
none	none	The tentacles wound vengefully around me but in a few seconds they relaxed as the thing gasped out its life in the air I turned to repeat the process on another if I could and found myself facing the Queen Her head was held bravely high though the violet of her eyes had gone almost black with fear and repulsion of the terrible things we fought Aga I cried
4110_11528_000007_000001	train-clean-360	 Why art thou here 
4110_11528_000007_000002	train-clean-360	Go back to the palace at once 
4110_11528_000008_000000	train-clean-360	 I came to fight beside thee she answered composedly though her delicate lips quivered 
none	none	All is lost it seems So shall I die beside thee I started to reply to urge her again to seek the safety of the palace But by now the deadly advance of the tentacled demons had begun once more 
4110_11528_000010_000000	train-clean-360	Fighting vainly the population of Zyobor was swept into the palace grounds then into the building itself 
none	none	Men women and children huddled shoulder to shoulder in the cramping quarters 
4110_11528_000011_000001	train-clean-360	An ironic picture came to me of the crowding masses of Quabos stuffed into the protection of the outer cave waiting the outcome of the fight being waged by their warriors 
none	none	Here were we in a similar circumstance waiting for the battle to be decided 
4110_11528_000011_000003	train-clean-360	Though there was little doubt in the minds of any of us as to what the outcome would be 
none	none	Guards the strongest men of the city were stationed with sledges at the doors and windows 
4110_11528_000012_000001	train-clean-360	The Quabos able only to enter one at a time halted a moment and there was a badly needed breathing spell 
4110_11528_000013_000000	train-clean-360	 We ve got to find some drastic means of defence said the Professor or we won t last another three hours 
4110_11528_000014_000000	train-clean-360	 If you asked me I d say we couldn t last another three hours anyway replied Stanley with a shrug 
4110_11528_000014_000001	train-clean-360	 These fish have out thought us 
none	none	Nonsense There may still be a way
4110_11528_000016_000000	train-clean-360	 A brace of machine guns I murmured hopefully 
4110_11528_000017_000000	train-clean-360	 You might as well wish for a dozen light cannon snapped the Professor 
4110_11528_000017_000001	train-clean-360	 Please try to concentrate and see if any effective weapon suggests itself to you something more available at the moment than machine guns 
none	none	In silence the three of us racked our brains for a means of defence Aga leaving for a time the task of soothing her more hysterical subjects came quietly over to us and sat on the bench beside me 
4110_11528_000019_000000	train-clean-360	Frankly I could think of nothing 
none	none	To my mind we were surely doomed What arms could possibly be contrived at such short notice 
4110_11528_000019_000003	train-clean-360	What weapon could be called forth to be effective against the thick glass helmets 
none	none	But as I glanced at Stanley I saw his face set in a new expression as his thoughts took a turn that suggested possible salvation Glass he muttered Glass 
4110_11528_000021_000002	train-clean-360	What destroys it 
none	none	Sharp blows certain acids variation in temperature heat and cold That s it That s it 
4110_11528_000022_000000	train-clean-360	He turned excitedly to the Queen 
4110_11528_000023_000000	train-clean-360	 I think we have it 
4110_11528_000023_000001	train-clean-360	At least it s worth trying 
none	none	If there is any tubing around He stopped as he realized he was talking in English and resumed stiltedly in Aga s own language
4110_11528_000024_000000	train-clean-360	 Hast thou in the palace any lengths of pipe like to that which the Quabos drag behind them 
none	none	No Aga began her eyes round and wondering 
4110_11528_000025_000001	train-clean-360	Then she interrupted herself 
4110_11528_000025_000002	train-clean-360	 Ah yes 
none	none	There is In a vault near that of Kilor s there is a great spool of it He had it fashioned to carry air for one of his experiments Come along cried Stanley I ll explain what I have in mind while we dig up this coil of hose A score of Zyobite workmen were gathered at once 
4110_11528_000027_000001	train-clean-360	The length of hose made of some linen like fabric of tough shredded sea weed and covered with a flexible metal sheath was cut into three pieces each about fifty yards long 
4110_11528_000027_000002	train-clean-360	These were connected to three of the largest gas vents of the palace 
4110_11528_000028_000000	train-clean-360	Stanley the Professor and I each took an end 
4110_11528_000028_000001	train-clean-360	And we prepared to fight with fire the creatures of water 
4110_11528_000029_000000	train-clean-360	 It ought to work Stanley repeated several times as though trying to reassure himself as well as us 
none	none	It s simple enough the water in those helmets is ice cold if fire is suddenly squirted against them they ll crack with the uneven expansion
4110_11528_000030_000000	train-clean-360	 Unless retorted the Professor their glass has some special heat and cold resisting quality 
4110_11528_000031_000000	train-clean-360	Stanley shrugged 
none	none	It may well have some such properties 
4110_11528_000032_000001	train-clean-360	How such creatures can make glass at all is beyond me 
4110_11528_000033_000000	train-clean-360	Dragging our hose to the big front entrance of the palace and warning the crowded people to keep their feet clear of it we prepared to test out the efficiency of this our last resource against the enemy 
4110_11528_000034_000000	train-clean-360	For an instant we paused just inside the doorway looking out at the ugly glassed in Things that were massing to attack us again 
4110_11528_000035_000000	train-clean-360	The ranks of Quabos had closed in now till they extended down the street for several hundred yards in close formation a forest of great pulpy heads with huge eyes that glared unblinkingly at the glittering pink building that was their objective 
4110_11528_000036_000000	train-clean-360	 Light up ordered Stanley setting an example by touching his hose nozzle to the nearest wall jet 
4110_11528_000036_000001	train-clean-360	A spurt of fire belched from his hose streaming out for four or five feet in a solid red cone 
4110_11528_000036_000002	train-clean-360	The Professor and I touched off our torches and we moved slowly out the door toward the ranks of Quabos 
none	none	Don t try to save yourselves from their tentacles advised Stanley Walk right up to them direct the fire against their helmets and damn the consequences If they grip too hard you can always play the torch on their tentacles till they think better of it The Quabos front line humped grimly toward us unblinking eyes glaring tentacles writhing warily little spurts of used water trickling from their helmets Keep together warned Stanley so that if any one of us loses his light he can get it from the hose of one of the other two And Here they come There was no more time for commands 
4110_11528_000040_000001	train-clean-360	The Quabos in front supplied with slack in their hoses by those behind leaped at us with incredible agility 
4110_11528_000040_000002	train-clean-360	We fell back a step so that none should get at our backs 
4110_11528_000041_000000	train-clean-360	The last stand was begun 
4110_11528_000042_000000	train-clean-360	It was not a battle so much as a series of fierce duels 
none	none	The Quabos realized their new danger instantly and devoted all their efforts to extinguishing our torches 
4110_11528_000042_000002	train-clean-360	We parried and thrust with the flaming hoses in an equally desperate effort to prevent it 
none	none	One of them scuttled toward me like a great crab A tentacle darted toward my right arm Another was pressed against the nozzle 
4110_11528_000043_000003	train-clean-360	There was a sickening smell and the tentacle was jerked spasmodically away 
4110_11528_000044_000000	train-clean-360	I caught the hose in my left hand and turned the fiery jet against the water filled helmet 
4110_11528_000045_000000	train-clean-360	A shout of savage exultation broke from my lips 
none	none	Hardly had the flame touched the glass before it cracked There was a report like a pistol shot and a miniature Niagara of water and splintered glass poured at my feet 
4110_11528_000046_000000	train-clean-360	The tentacle around my arm tightened then relaxed 
none	none	The monster shuddered in a convulsive heap on the ground 
4110_11528_000047_000000	train-clean-360	I went toward the next one swinging the flaring hose in a slow arc as I advanced 
4110_11528_000047_000001	train-clean-360	The creature lunged at me and threshed at the burning jet with all four of its feelers 
none	none	But it had been exposed to the air for a long time now The ghastly tentacles were dry withered and soft A touch of the fire seared them unmercifully 
4110_11528_000048_000000	train-clean-360	Nevertheless with a swift move it slapped a tentacle squarely down over the hose nozzle 
4110_11528_000048_000001	train-clean-360	The flame was extinguished as the flame of a candle is pinched out between thumb and forefinger 
4110_11528_000048_000002	train-clean-360	I retreated 
4110_11528_000049_000000	train-clean-360	 Catch came a voice behind me 
4110_11528_000050_000000	train-clean-360	The Professor swung his four foot jet my way 
none	none	I held my hose to it and the flame burst out again A touch at my grisly antagonist s helmet a sharp crack the welcome rush of water over the cream colored grass and another monster was writhing in the death throes Keeping close together the three of us faced the massed Quabos in the palace grounds Again and again the fiery weapon of one or the other of us was dashed out to be re lighted from the nearest hose Again and again loud detonations heralded the collapse of more of the invaders But it seemed as though their flailing tentacles were as myriad as the stars they had never seen It seemed as though their numbers would never appreciably diminish We thrust and parried till our arms grew numb 
4110_11528_000052_000003	train-clean-360	And still there appeared to be hundreds of the Quabos left 
4110_11528_000053_000000	train-clean-360	By order of the Queen three stout Zyobites stepped up to us and relieved us of our exhausting labor 
none	none	Gladly we handed the hoses to them and went to the palace for a much needed rest Two more shifts of fighters took the flaming jets before the monsters began the retreat slowly back toward their tunnel 
4110_11528_000054_000001	train-clean-360	And here the Professor took command again 
none	none	We mustn t let them get away to try some new scheme he snapped Martin take fifty men and beat them back to the break in the wall Go around a side street 
4110_11528_000055_000002	train-clean-360	They move so slowly that you can easily cut off their retreat 
none	none	There isn t any more hose began Stanley
4110_11528_000057_000000	train-clean-360	 There s plenty of it 
4110_11528_000057_000001	train-clean-360	The Quabos brought it with them The Professor turned to me again 
4110_11528_000057_000002	train-clean-360	 Take metal saws with you 
none	none	Cut sections of the Quabos water hose and connect them to the nearest wall jets Run I ran with fifty of the men of Zyobor close behind me We dodged out the side of the palace grounds least guarded by the Quabos ducking between their ranks like infantry men threading through an opposition of powerful but slow moving tanks 
4110_11528_000058_000002	train-clean-360	Four of our number were caught but the rest got through unscathed 
4110_11528_000059_000000	train-clean-360	Down a side street we raced and along a parallel avenue toward the tunnel 
4110_11528_000059_000001	train-clean-360	As we went I prayed that all the Quabos had centered their attention on the palace and left their vulnerable water hoses unguarded 
none	none	They had 
4110_11528_000060_000001	train-clean-360	When we stole up the last block toward the break we found the nearest Quabo was a hundred yards down the street and working further away with every move 
4110_11528_000061_000000	train-clean-360	At once we set to work on the scores of hoses that quivered over the floor with each move of the distant monsters 
none	none	A Zyobite with the muscles of a Hercules swung his ax mightily down on a hose 
4110_11528_000062_000001	train-clean-360	The metal was soft enough to be sheered through by the stroke 
4110_11528_000062_000002	train-clean-360	The cut ends were smashed so that they could not be crammed down over the tapering jets but we could use our metal saws for cleaner severances at the other ends 
4110_11528_000063_000000	train-clean-360	The giant with the ax stepped from hose to hose 
none	none	Lengths were completed with the saws A man was placed at each jet to hold the connections in position Before the Quabos had reached us we had rigged six fire hoses and had cut through forty or fifty more water lines 
4110_11528_000064_000000	train-clean-360	The end was certain and not long in coming 
4110_11528_000065_000000	train-clean-360	We sprayed the monsters with fire as workmen spray fruit trees with insect poison 
4110_11528_000065_000001	train-clean-360	Stanley the Professor and a Zyobite came up in the rear with their three hoses 
4110_11528_000066_000000	train-clean-360	Caught between the two forces the beaten fish milled in hopeless confusion and indecision 
4110_11528_000067_000000	train-clean-360	In half an hour they were all reduced to huddles of slimy wet flesh that dotted the pavement from the break back to the palace grounds 
none	none	The invaders were completely annihilated and the city of Zyobor was saved
4110_11528_000068_000000	train-clean-360	 Now said the Professor triumphantly we have only to knock out the bottom half of the tunnel wall empty the tunnel and make sure there are no more Quabos lurking there 
4110_11528_000068_000001	train-clean-360	After that we can fill it in with solid cement 
4110_11528_000068_000002	train-clean-360	The Queen can order her fish servants to guard the outer cave and see that no food gets in to the starving monsters there 
none	none	The war is over gentlemen 
4110_11528_000068_000004	train-clean-360	The Quabos are as good as exterminated at this moment And I can get back to my zoological work 
none	none	Stanley and I looked at each other 
4110_11528_000069_000001	train-clean-360	We knew each others thoughts well enough 
none	none	He could resume his companionship with the beautiful Mayis And I I had Aga 
4110_11528_000071_000000	train-clean-360	With the menace of the Quabos banished forever the city of Zyobor resumed its normal way 
none	none	The citizens lowered their dead into the great well we had cut with appropriate rites performed by the Queen 
4110_11528_000072_000001	train-clean-360	The daily tasks and pleasures were picked up where they had been dropped 
none	none	The haunting fear died from the eyes of the people Shortly afterward with great ceremony and celebration I was made King of Zyobor to rule by Aga s side Stanley took Mayis for his wife 
4110_11528_000073_000002	train-clean-360	He is second to me in power 
4110_11528_000073_000003	train-clean-360	The Professor is the official wise man of the city 
none	none	Life flows smoothly for us in this pink lighted community 
4110_11528_000074_000001	train-clean-360	We are more than content with our lot here 
none	none	Our only concern has been the grief that must have been occasioned our relatives and friends when the Rosa sailed home without us 
4110_11528_000075_000000	train-clean-360	Now we have thought of a way in which with luck we may communicate with the upper world 
none	none	By relays of my Queen s fish servants we believe we can send up the Professor s invaluable notes A and this informal account of what has happened since we left San Francisco that Editor s note There was no trace of any notes The yacht Rosa was reported lost with all hands in a hurricane off New Zealand 
4110_11528_000076_000001	train-clean-360	Aboard her were a Professor George Berry and the owner Stanley Browne 
none	none	There is no record however of any passenger by the name of Martin Grey To date no one has taken this document seriously enough to consider financing an expedition of investigation to Penguin Deep Illustration When I am finished Dale I shall probably kill you The Murder Machine By Hugh B Cave Sidenote Four lives lay helpless before the murder machine the uncanny device by which hypnotic thought waves are filtered through men s minds to mold them into murdering tools It was dusk on the evening of December seven nineteen oh six when I first encountered Sir John Harmon At the moment of his entrance I was standing over the table in my study a lighted match in my cupped hands and a pipe between my teeth The pipe was never lit I heard the lower door slam shut with a violent clatter The stairs resounded to a series of unsteady footbeats and the door of my study was flung back In the opening staring at me with quiet dignity stood a young careless fellow about five feet ten in height and decidedly dark of complexion The swagger of his entrance branded him as an adventurer The ghastly pallor of his face which was almost colorless branded him as a man who has found something more than mere adventure Doctor Dale he demanded I am Doctor Dale He closed the door of the room deliberately advancing toward me with slow steps My name is John Harmon Sir John Harmon It is unusual I suppose he said quietly with a slight shrug coming at this late hour I won t keep you long He faced me silently A single glance at those strained features convinced me of the reason for his coming Only one thing can bring such a furtive restless stare to a man s eyes Only one thing fear I ve come to you Dale because Sir John s fingers closed heavily over the edge of the table because I am on the verge of going mad From fear From fear yes I suppose it is easy to discover A single look at me A single look at you I said simply would convince any man that you are deadly afraid of something Do you mind telling me just what it is He shook his head slowly The swagger of the poise was gone he stood upright now with a positive effort as if the realization of his position had suddenly surged over him I do not know he said quietly It is a childish fear fear of the dark you may call it The cause does not matter but if something does not take this unholy terror away the effect will be madness I watched him in silence for a moment studying the shrunken outline of his face and the unsteady gleam of his narrowed eyes I had seen this man before All London had seen him His face was constantly appearing in the sporting pages a swaggering member of the upper set a man who had been engaged to nearly every beautiful woman in the country who sought adventure in sport and in night life merely for the sake of living at top speed And here he stood before me whitened by fear the very thing he had so deliberately laughed at Dale he said slowly for the past week I have been thinking things that I do not want to think and doing things completely against my will Some outside power God knows what it is is controlling my very existence He stared at me and leaned closer across the table Last night some time before midnight he told me I was sitting alone in my den Alone mind you not a soul was in the house with me I was reading a novel and suddenly as if a living presence had stood in the room and commanded me I was forced to put the book down I fought against it fought to remain in that room and go on reading And I failed Failed My reply was a single word of wonder I left my home because I could not help myself Have you ever been under hypnotism Dale Yes Well the thing that gripped me was something similar except that no living person came near me in order to work his hypnotic spell I went alone the whole way Through back streets alleys filthy dooryards never once striking a main thoroughfare until I had crossed the entire city and reached the west side of the square And there before a big gray town house I was allowed to stop my mad wandering The power whatever it was broke I well I went home Sir John got to his feet with an effort and stood over me Dale he whispered hoarsely what was it You were conscious of every detail I asked Conscious of the time of the locality you went to You are sure it was not some fantastic dream Dream Is it a dream to have some damnable force move me about like a mechanical robot But You can think of no explanation I was a bit skeptical of his story He turned on me savagely I have no explanation Doctor he said curtly I came to you for the explanation And while you are thinking over my case during the next few hours perhaps you can explain this when I stood before that gray mansion on After Street alone in the dark there was murder in my heart I should have killed the man who lived in that house had I not been suddenly released from the force that was driving me forward Sir John turned from me in bitterness Without offering any word of departure he pulled open the door and stepped across the sill The door closed and I was alone That was my introduction to Sir John Harmon I offer it in detail because it was the first of a startling series of events that led to the most terrible case of my career In my records I have labeled the entire case The Affair of the Death Machine Twelve hours after Sir John s departure which will bring the time to the morning of December eight the headlines of the Daily Mail stared up at me from the table They were black and heavy those headlines and horribly significant They were FRANKLIN WHITE junior FOUND MURDERED Midnight Marauder Strangles Young Society Man in West End Mansion I turned the paper hurriedly and read Between the hours of one and two o clock this morning an unknown murderer entered the home of Franklin White junior well known West End sportsman and escaped leaving behind his strangled victim Young White who is a favorite in London upper circles was discovered in his bed this morning where he had evidently lain dead for many hours Police are seeking a motive for the crime which may have its origin in the fact that White only recently announced his engagement to Margot Vernee young and exceedingly pretty French debutante Police say that the murderer was evidently an amateur and that he made no attempt to cover his crime Inspector Thomas Drake of Scotland Yard has the case There was more much more Young White had evidently been a decided favorite and the murder had been so unexpected so deliberate that the Mail reporter had made the most of his opportunity for a story But aside from what I have reprinted there was only a single short paragraph which claimed my attention It was this The White home is not a difficult one to enter It is a huge gray town house situated just off the square in After Street The murderer entered by a low French window leaving it open I have copied the words exactly as they were printed The item does not call for any comment But I had hardly dropped the paper before she stood before me I say she it was Margot Vernee of course because for some peculiar reason I had expected her She stood quietly before me her cameo face set in the black of mourning staring straight into mine You know why I have come she said quickly I glanced at the paper on the table before me and nodded Her eyes followed my glance That is only part of it Doctor she said I was in love with Franklin very much but I have come to you for something more Because you are a famous psychologist and can help me She sat down quietly leaning forward so that her arms rested on the table Her face was white almost as white as the face of that young adventurer who had come to me on the previous evening And when she spoke her voice was hardly more than a whisper Doctor for many days now I have been under some strange power Something frightful that compels me to think and act against my will She glanced at me suddenly as if to note the effect of her words Then I was engaged to Franklin for more than a month Doctor yet for a week now I have been commanded commanded by some awful force to return to to a man who knew me more than two years ago I can t explain it I did not love this man I hated him bitterly Now comes this mad desire this hungering to go to him And last night Margot Vernee hesitated suddenly She stared at me searchingly Then with renewed courage she continued Last night Doctor I was alone I had retired for the night and it was late nearly three o clock And then I was strangely commanded by this awful power that has suddenly taken possession of my soul to go out I tried to restrain myself and in the end I found myself walking through the square I went straight to Franklin White s home When I reached there it was half past three I could hear Big Ben I went in through the wide French window at the side of the house I went straight to Franklin s room because I could not prevent myself from going A sob came from Margot s lips She had half risen from her chair and was holding herself together with a brave effort I went to her side and stood over her And she with a half crazed laugh stared up at me He was dead when I saw him she cried Dead Murdered That infernal force what ever it was had made me go straight to my lover s side to see him lying there with those cruel finger marks on his throat dead I tell you I oh it is horrible She turned suddenly When I saw him she said bitterly the sight of him and the sight of those marks broke the spell that held me I crept from the house as if I had killed him They they will probably find out that I was there and they will accuse me of the murder It does not matter But this power this awful thing that has been controlling me is there no way to fight it I nodded heavily The memory of that unfortunate fellow who had come to me with the same complaint was still holding me I was prepared to wash my hands of the whole horrible affair It was clearly not a medical case clearly out of my realm There is a way to fight it I said quietly I am a doctor not a master of hypnotism or a man who can discover the reasons behind that hypnotism But London has its Scotland Yard and Scotland Yard has a man who is one of my greatest comrades She nodded her surrender As I stepped to the telephone I heard her murmur in a weary troubled voice Hypnotism It is not that God knows what it is But it has always happened when I have been alone One cannot hypnotise through distance And so with Margot Vernee s consent I sought the aid of Inspector Thomas Drake of Scotland Yard In half an hour Drake stood beside me in the quiet of my study When he had heard Margot s story he asked a single significant question It was this You say you have a desire to go back to a man who was once intimate with you Who is he Margot looked at him dully It is Michael Strange she said slowly Michael Strange of Paris A student of science Drake nodded Without further questioning he dismissed my patient and when she had gone he turned to me She did not murder her sweetheart Dale he said That is evident Have you any idea who did And so I told him of that other young man Sir John Harmon who had come to me the night before When I had finished Drake stared at me stared through me and suddenly turned on his heel I shall be back Dale he said curtly Wait for me Wait for him Well that was Drake s peculiar way of going about things Impetuous sudden until he faced some crisis Then in the face of danger he became a cold indifferent officer of Scotland Yard And so I waited During the twenty four hours that elapsed before Drake returned to my study I did my best to diagnose the case before me First Sir John Harmon his visit to the home of Franklin White Then the deliberate murder And finally young Margot Vernee and her confession It was like the revolving whirl of a pinwheel this series of events continuous and mystifying but without beginning or end Surely somewhere in the procession of horrors there would be a loose end to cling to Some loose end that would eventually unravel the pinwheel It was plainly not a medical affair or at least only remotely so The thing was in proper hands then with Drake following it through And I had only to wait for his return He came at last and closed the door of the room behind him He stood over me with something of a swagger Dale I have been looking into the records of this Michael Strange he said quietly They are interesting those records They go back some ten years when this fellow Strange was beginning his study of science And now Michael Strange is one of the greatest authorities in Paris on the subject of mental telegraphy He has gone into the study of human thought with the same thoroughness that other scientists go into the subject of radio telegraphy He has written several books on the subject Drake pulled a tiny black volume from the pocket of his coat and dropped it on the table before me With one hand he opened it to a place which he had previously marked in pencil Read it he said significantly I looked at him in wonder and then did as he ordered What I read was this Mental telegraphy is a science not a myth It is a very real fact a very real power which can be developed only by careful research To most people it is merely a curiosity They sit for instance in a crowded room at some uninteresting lecture and stare continually at the back of some unsuspecting companion until that companion by the power of suggestion turns suddenly around Or they think heavily of a certain person nearby perhaps commanding him mentally to hum a certain popular tune until the victim by the power of their will suddenly fulfills the order To such persons the science of mental telegraphy is merely an amusement And so it will be until science has brought it to such a perfection that these waves of thought can be broadcast that they can be transmitted through the ether precisely as radio waves are transmitted In other words mental telegraphy is at present merely a mild form of hypnotism Until it has been developed so that those hypnotic powers can be directed through space and directed accurately to those individuals to whom they are intended this science will have no significance It remains for scientists of to day to bring about that development I closed the book When I looked up Drake was watching me intently as if expecting me to say something Drake I said slowly more to myself than to him the pinwheel is beginning to unravel We have found the beginning thread Perhaps if we follow that thread Drake smiled If you ll pick up your hat and coat Dale he interrupted I think we have an appointment This Michael Strange whose book you have just enjoyed so immensely is now residing on a certain quiet little side street about three miles from the square in London I followed Drake in silence until we had left Cheney Lane in the gloom behind us At the entrance to the square my companion called a cab and from there on we rode slowly through a heavy darkness which was blanketed by a wet penetrating fog The cabby evidently one who knew my companion by sight and what London cabby does not know his Scotland Yard men chose a route that twisted through gloomy uninhabited side streets seldom winding into the main route of traffic As for Drake he sank back in the uncomfortable seat and made no attempt at conversation For the entire first part of our journey he said nothing Not until we had reached a black unlighted section of the city did he turn to me Dale he said at length have you ever hunted tiger I looked at him and laughed Why I replied Do you expect this hunt of ours will be something of a blind chase It will be a blind chase no doubt of it he said And when we have followed the trail to its end I imagine we shall find something very like a tiger to deal with I have looked rather deeply into Michael Strange s life and unearthed a bit of the man s character He has twice been accused of murder murder by hypnotism and has twice cleared himself by throwing scientific explanations at the police That is the nature of his entire history for the past ten years I nodded without replying As Drake turned away from me again our cab poked its laboring nose into a narrowing gloomy street I had a glimpse of a single unsteady street lamp on the corner and a dim sign Mate Lane And then we were dragging along the curb The cab stopped with a groan I had stepped down and was standing by the cab door when suddenly from the darkness in front of me a strange figure advanced to my side He glanced at me intently then seeing that I was evidently not the man he sought he turned to Drake I heard a whispered greeting and an undertone of conversation Then quietly Drake stepped toward me Dale he said I thought it best that I should not show myself here to night No there is no time for explanation now you will understand later Perhaps significantly sooner than you anticipate Inspector Hartnett will go through the rest of this pantomime with you I shook hands with Drake s man still rather bewildered at the sudden substitution Then before I was aware of it Drake had vanished and the cab was gone We were alone Hartnett and I in Mate Lane The home of Michael Strange number seven was hardly inviting No light was in evidence The big house stood like a huge unadorned vault set back from the street some distance from its adjoining buildings The heavy steps echoed to our footbeats as we mounted them in the darkness and the sound of the bell as Hartnett pressed it came sharply to us from the silence of the interior We stood there waiting In the short interval before the door opened Hartnett glanced at his watch it was nearly ten o clock and said to me I imagine Doctor we shall meet a blank wall Let me do the talking please That was all In another moment the big door was pulled slowly open from the inside and in the entrance glaring out at us stood the man we had come to see It is not hard to remember that first impression of Michael Strange He was a huge man gaunt and haggard moulded with the hunched shoulders and heavy arms of a gorilla His face seemed to be unconsciously twisted into a snarl His greeting which came only after he had stared at us intently for nearly a minute was curt and rasping Well gentlemen What is it I should like a word with doctor Michael Strange said my companion quietly I am Michael Strange And I replied Hartnett with a suggestion of a smile am Raoul Hartnett from Scotland Yard I did not see any sign of emotion on Strange s face He stepped back in silence to allow us to enter Then closing the big door after us he led the way along a carpeted hall to a small ill lighted room just beyond Here he motioned us to be seated he himself standing upright beside the table facing us From Scotland Yard he said and the tone was heavy with dull sarcasm I am at your service mister Hartnett And now for the first time I wondered just why Drake had insisted on my coming here to this gloomy house in Mate Lane Why he had so deliberately arranged a substitute so that Michael Strange should not come face to face with him directly Evidently Hartnett had been carefully instructed as to his course of action but why this seemingly unnecessary caution on Drake s part And now after we had gained admission what excuse would Hartnett offer for the intrusion Surely he would not follow the bull headed role of a common policeman There was no anger no attempt at dramatics in Hartnett s voice He looked quietly up at our host doctor Strange he said at length I have come to you for your assistance Last night some time after midnight Franklin White was strangled to death He was murdered according to substantial evidence by the girl he was going to marry Margot Vernee I come to you because you know this girl rather well and can perhaps help Scotland Yard in finding her motive for killing White Michael Strange said nothing He stood there scowling down at my companion in silence And I too I must admit turned upon Hartnett with a stare of bewilderment His accusation of Margot had brought a sense of horror to me I had expected almost anything from him even to a mad accusation of Strange himself But I had hardly foreseen this cold blooded declaration You understand Doctor Hartnett went on in that same ironical drawl that we do not believe Margot Vernee did this thing herself She had a companion undoubtedly one who accompanied her to the house on After Street and assisted her in the crime Who that companion was we are not sure but there is decidedly a case of suspicion against a certain young London sportsman This fellow is known to have prowled about the White mansion both on the night of the murder and the night before Hartnett glanced up casually Strange s face was a total mask When he nodded the nod was the most even and mechanical thing I have ever seen Certainly this man could control his emotions Naturally Doctor Hartnett said we have gone rather deeply into the past life of the lady in question Your name appears of course in a rather unimportant interval when Margot Vernee resided in Paris And so we come to you in the hope that you can perhaps give us some slight bit of information something that seems insignificant perhaps to you but which may put us on the right track It was a careful speech Even as Hartnett spoke it I could have sworn that the words were Drake s and had been memorized But Michael Strange merely stepped back to the table and faced us without a word He was probably during that brief interlude attempting to realize his position and to discover just how much Raoul Hartnett actually knew And then after his interim of silence he came forward sullenly and stood over my comrade I will tell you this much mister Hartnett of Scotland Yard he said bitterly My relations with Margot Vernee are not an open book to be passed through the clumsy fingers of ignorant police officers As to this murder I know nothing At the time of it I was seated in this room in company with a distinguished group of scientific friends I will tell you on authority that Margot did not murder her lover Why Because she loved him The last words were heavy with bitterness Before they had died into silence Michael Strange had opened the door of his study If you please gentlemen he said quietly Hartnett got to his feet For an instant he stood facing the gorilla like form of our host then he stepped over the sill without a word We passed down the unlighted corridor in silence while Strange stood in the door of his study watching us I could not help but feel as we left that gloomy house that Strange had suddenly focused his entire attention upon me and had ignored my companion I could feel those eyes upon me and feel the force of the will behind them A decided feeling of uneasiness crept over me and I shuddered A moment later the big outer door had closed shut after us and we were alone in Mate Lane Alone that is until a third figure joined us in the shadows and Drake s hand closed over my arm Capital Dale he said triumphantly For half an hour you entertained him you and Hartnett And for half an hour I ve had the unlimited freedom of his inner rooms with the aid of an unlocked window on the lower floor Those inner rooms gentlemen are significant very As we walked the length of Mate Lane the gaunt sinister home of Michael Strange became an indistinct outline in the pitch behind us Drake said nothing more on the return trip until we had nearly reached my rooms Then he turned to me with a smile We are one up on our friend Dale he said He does not know just now which is the bigger fool you or Hartnett here However I imagine Hartnett will be the victim of some very unusual events before many hours have passed That was all At least all of significance I left the two Scotland Yard men at the opening of Cheney Lane and continued alone to my rooms I opened the door and let myself in quietly And there some few hours later began the last and most horrible phase of the case of the murder machine It begin or to be more accurate I began to react to it at three o clock in the morning I was alone and the rooms were dark For hours I had sat quietly by the table considering the significant events of the past few days Sleep was impossible with so many unanswered questions staring into me and so I sat there wondering Did Drake actually believe that Margot Vernee s simple story had been a ruse that she had in truth killed her lover on that midnight intrusion of his home Did he believe that Michael Strange knew of that intrusion that he had possibly planned it himself and aided her in order that Margot might be free to return to him Did Strange know of that other intrusion and of the uncanny power which had driven Sir John Harmon and supposedly driven Margot to that house on After Street Those were the questions that still remained without answers and it was over those questions that I pondered while my surroundings became darker and more silent as the hour became more advanced I heard the clock strike three and heard the answering drone of Big Ben from the square And then it began At first it was little more than a sense of nervousness Before I had been content to sit in my chair and doze Now in spite of myself I found myself pacing the floor back and forth like a caged animal I could have sworn at the time that some sinister presence had found entrance to my room Yet the room was empty And I could have sworn too that some silent power of will was commanding me with undeniable force to go out out into the darkness of Cheney Lane I fought it bitterly I laughed at it yet even through my laugh came the memory of Sir John Harmon and Margot and what they had told me And then unable to resist that unspoken demand I seized my hat and coat and went out Cheney Lane was deserted utterly still At the end of it the street lamp glowed dully throwing a patch of ghastly light over the side of the adjoining building I hurried through the shadows and as I walked a single idea had possession of me I must hurry I thought with all possible speed to that grim house in Mate Lane number seven Where that deliberate desire came from I did not know I did not stop to reason Something had commanded me to go at once to Michael Strange s home And though I stopped more than once deliberately turning in my tracks inevitably I was forced to retrace my steps and continue I remember passing through the square and prowling through the unlightened side streets that lay beyond Three miles separated Cheney Lane from Mate Lane and I had been over the route only once before in a cab Yet I followed that route without a single false turn followed it instinctively At every intersecting street I was dragged in a certain direction and not once was I allowed to hesitate It was as though some unseen demon perched on my shoulders as the demon of the sea rode Sinbad and pointed out the way Only one disturbing thing occurred on that night journey through London I had turned into a narrow street hardly more than a quarter mile from my destination and before me in the shadows I made out the form of a shuffling old man And here as I watched him I was conscious of a new mad desire I crept upon him stealthily without a sound My hands were outstretched clutching for his throat At that moment I should have killed him I cannot explain it During that brief interval I was a murderer at heart I wanted to kill And now that I remember it the desire had been pregnant in me ever since the lights of Cheney Lane had died behind me All the time that I prowled through those black streets murder lurked in my heart I should have killed the first man who crossed my path But I did not kill him Thank God as my fingers twisted toward the back of his throat that mad desire suddenly left me I stood still while the old fellow still unsuspecting shuffled away into the darkness Then dropping my hands with a sob of helplessness I went forward again And so I reached Mate Lane and the huge gray house that awaited me This time as I mounted the stone steps the old house seemed even more repulsive and horrible I dreaded to see that door open but I could not retreat I dropped the knocker heavily A moment passed and then precisely as before the huge door swung inward Michael Strange stood before me He did not speak Perhaps if he had spoken that fiendish spell would have been broken and I should have returned even then to my own peaceful little rooms in Cheney Lane No he merely held the door for me to enter and as I passed him he stood there watching me with a significant smile Straight to that familiar room at the end of the hall I went with Strange behind me When we had entered he closed the door cautiously For a moment he faced me without speaking You came very close to committing a murder on your way here did you not Dale I stared at him How in God s name could this man read my thoughts so completely You would have completed the murder he said softly had I wished it I did not wish it I did not answer There was no reply to such a mad declaration As for my companion he watched me for an instant and then laughed He was not mad I am doctor enough to know that But the laugh was not long in duration He stepped forward suddenly and took my arm in a steel grip dragging me toward the half hidden door at the farther end of the room I shall not keep you long Dale he said harshly I could have killed you could have made you kill yourself and in fact I intended to do so but after all you are merely a poor stumbling fool who has meddled in things too deep for you He pulled open the door and pushed me forward The room was dark and not until he had closed the door again and switched on a dim light could I see its contents Even then I saw nothing At least nothing of importance to an unscientific mind There was a low table against the wall with a profusion of tiny wires emanating from it I was aware that a cup shaped microphone or something very similar hung over the table about on a level with my eyes had I been sitting in the chair Beyond that I saw nothing until Strange had moved forward and drawn aside a curtain that hung beside the table I made you come here to night Dale he murmured because I was a bit afraid of you Your comrade Hartnett was an ignorant police officer He has not the intellect to connect the series of events of the past day or two and so I did not trouble myself with him But you are an educated man You have made no demonstrations of your ability in the field of science but He stopped speaking abruptly From the room behind us came the sound of a warning bell Strange turned quickly and went to the door You will wait here Doctor he said I have another caller to night Another one who came the same way as you He vanished For a short interlude I was alone with that peculiar radio like apparatus before me It was for all the world like a miniature control room in some small broadcasting station Except for the odd shape of the microphone if it was such I could detect no radical difference in equipment However I had little time for conjecture A patter of footsteps interrupted me from the next room and a frightened feminine voice broke the stillness of the outer study Even before the owner of that voice stepped in to my presence I knew her And when she came with white fearful face and trembling body I could not withhold a shudder of apprehension It was the young woman who had come to my office Margot Vernee Evidently at last she had yielded to the horrible impulse that had drawn her back to Michael Strange an impulse which I now understood had originated from the man himself He pressed her forward There was nothing tender in his touch it was cruel and triumphant So you have succeeded at last I said bitterly He turned to me with a sneer I have brought her here yes he replied And now that she has come she shall hear what I have to tell you It will perhaps give her a respect for me and this time she will not have the power to turn me away He pointed to the table to the apparatus that lay there I m telling you this Dale he said because it gives me pleasure to do so You are enough of a scientist to appreciate and understand it And if when I have finished I have told you too much there is a very easy way to keep your tongue silent You have heard of hypnotism Dale You have heard also of radio Have you ever thought of combining the two He faced me directly I made no effort to reply Radio he said quietly is broadcast by means of sound waves That much you know But hypnotism too can be transmitted through distance if an instrument delicate enough to transmit thought waves can be invented For twenty years I have worked on that instrument and for twenty years I have studied hypnotism You understand of course that this instrument is worthless unless it is operated by a master mind Thought waves are useless they will not control the actions of even a cat But hypnotic waves or concentrated thought waves will control the world There was no denying him He faced me with the savage triumph of a wild beast He was glorying in his power and in my amazement I wanted Franklin White to die he cried It was I who murdered him Why Because he was about to take the girl I desired Is that not reason enough for murder And so I killed him It was not Margot Vernee who strangled her lover it was a complete stranger a London sportsman who had no reason for committing the murder except that I wished him to He died on the night of December seventh murdered by Sir John Harmon the sportsman Why Because of all London Sir John would be the last man to be suspected I have a keen appreciation for the irony of fate White would have died the night before Dale except that I lacked the courage to kill him His murderer was standing under my power outside his very house and then I suddenly thought it best that I should have an alibi Your Scotland Yard is clever and it was best that I have protection And so on the following night I sent Sir John to the house once again This time while I sat here and controlled the actions of my puppet a group of men sat here with me They believed that I was experimenting with a new type of radio receiver Michael Strange laughed laughed harshly in utter triumph as a cat laughs at the antics of his mouse victims When that murder was done he said I sent Margot to the scene so that she might see her lover strangled dead I repeat Dale that I enjoy the irony of fate especially when I can control it And as for you I brought you here to night merely so that you would realize the intensity of the powers that control you When you leave here you will be unharmed but after the exhibition I shall give you I am sure that you will make no further attempt to interfere with things out of your realm of understanding I heard a sob from Margot She had retreated to the door and clung there For myself I did not move Strange s recital had revealed to me the horrible lust that gripped him and now I watched him in fascination He would not harm the girl that much I was sure of In his distorted fashion he loved her In his crazed murderous way he would attempt to win her love even though she had once scorned him I saw him step toward the table Saw him drop heavily into the chair and stare directly into that microphonic thing that hung before his eyes As he stared he spoke to me Science in its intricate forms is probably above the mind of a common medical man Dale he said It would be useless to explain to you how my thoughts and my will can be transmitted through space Perhaps you have sat in a theater and stared at a certain person until that person turned to face you You have Then you will perhaps understand how I can control the minds of any human creature within the radius of my power You see Dale this intricate little machine gives me the power to transform London into a city of stark murder I could bring about such a horrible wave of crime that Scotland Yard would be scorned from one end of the world to the other I could make every man murder his neighbor until the streets of the city were running with blood Strange turned quietly to look at me He spoke deliberately And now for the little exhibition of which I spoke Dale he murmured Your detective friend Hartnett has been under my power for the past three hours You see it was safer to control his movements and be sure of him And now to be doubly sure of him perhaps you would like to see him kill himself I stepped forward with a sudden cry Strange said nothing his eyes merely burned into mine Once again I felt that strange all powerful control forcing me back I retreated step by step until the wall stopped me Yet even as I retreated a childish hope filled me How could Strange working his terrible murder machine concentrate his power on any individual when the whole of London lay before him He answered my question He must have read it as it came over me Have you ever been in a crowd Dale and watched a certain individual intently until that particular individual turned to look at you The rest of the crowd pays no attention of course but that one man And now we shall make that one man murder himself Strange turned slowly I saw his fingers creep along the rim of the table touching certain wires that came together there I heard a dull droning hum fill the room and over it Strange s penetrating voice When I am finished Dale I shall probably kill you I brought you here merely to frighten you but I believe I have told you too much With that new horror upon me I saw my captor s lips move slowly And then from the shadows at the other end of the small room came a low unemotional voice Before you begin Strange Michael Strange whipped about in his chair like a tiger His hand dropped to his pocket so swiftly that my eyes did not follow it And as it dropped a single staccato shot split the darkness of the room The scientist slumped forward in his chair The dull whirring sound of that hellish machine had stopped abruptly cut short by the sudden weight of Strange s lunging body as he fell upon it I saw the livid fiery snake of white light twist suddenly upward through that coil of wires and in another moment the entire apparatus shattered by a blinding crash of flame After that I turned away Whether the bullet killed Strange or not I do not know but the sight of his charred face hanging over that table of destruction told its own story It was Inspector Drake who came across the room toward me and took my arm The smoking revolver still lay in his hand and as he led me into the adjoining room I saw that Margot had already found refuge there You see now Dale Drake said quietly why I let Hartnett go with you before If Strange had suspected me I should have been merely another victim As for Hartnett he has been under constant guard down at headquarters He s safe They ve kept him there at my instructions in spite of all his terrific efforts to leave them I was listening to my companion in admiration Even then I did not quite understand I was wrong in just one thing Dale I left you alone without protection I believed Strange would ignore you because after all you are not a Scotland Yard man Thank God I had the sense to follow Margot to trail her here and get here soon enough And so ended the horrible series of events that began with Sir John Harmon s chance visit to my study As for Harmon he was later cleared of all guilt upon the charred evidence in Michael Strange s house in Mate Lane The girl I believe has left London where she can be as far as possible from memories that are all too terrible As for me I am back once again in my quiet rooms in Cheney Lane where the routine of common medical practice has wiped out many of those vivid horrors In time I believe I shall forget unless Inspector Drake of Scotland Yard insists upon bringing the affair up again IN THE NEXT ISSUE THE INVISIBLE DEATH A Thrilling Novelet of an Invisible Empire Within the United States By Victor Rousseau STOLEN BRAINS Another Absorbing doctor Bird Story By captain S P Meek PRISONERS ON THE ELECTRON An Exciting Story of a Young Man Marooned on an Electron By Robert H Leitfred JETTA OF THE LOWLANDS Part Two of the Current Novel By Ray Cummings AND OTHERS Illustration We had been captured by a race of gigantic beetles The Attack from Space A SEQUEL TO BEYOND THE HEAVISIDE LAYER By Captain S P Meek No one knows what unrevealed horrors space holds and the world will never rest entirely easy until the slow process of time again heals the protective layer From Beyond the Heaviside Layer Over a year has passed since I wrote those lines When they were written the hole which Jim Carpenter had burned with his battery of infra red lamps through the heaviside layer that hollow sphere of invisible semi plastic organic matter which encloses the world as a nutshell does a kernel was gradually filling in as he had predicted it would every one thought that in another ten years the world would be safely enclosed again in its protective layer as it had been since the dawn of time There were some adventurous spirits who deplored this fact as it would effectually bar interplanetary travel for Hadley had proved with his life that no space flyer could force its way through the fifty miles of almost solid material which barred the road to space but they were in the minority Most of humanity felt that it would rather be protected against the denizens of space than to have a road open for them to travel to the moon if they felt inclined Sidenote From a far world came monstrous invaders who were all the more terrifying because invisible To be sure during the five years that the hole had been open nothing more dangerous to the peace and well being of the world had appeared from space than a few hundreds of the purple amoeba which we had found so numerous on the outer side of the layer when we had traveled in a Hadley space ship up through the hole into the outer realms of space and one lone specimen of the green dragons which we had also encountered The amoeba had been readily destroyed by the disintegrating rays of the guarding space ships which were stationed inside the layer at the edge of the hole and the lone dragon had fallen a ready victim to the machine gun bullets which had been poured into it At first the press had damned Jim Carpenter for opening the road for these horrors but once their harmlessness had been clearly established the row had died down and the appearance of an amoeba did not merit over a squib on the inside pages of the daily papers While the hole in the heaviside layer was no longer news for the daily press a bitter controversy still waged in the scientific journals as to the reason why no observer on earth even when using the most powerful telescopes could see the amoeba before they entered the hole and then only when their telescopes were set up directly under the hole When a telescope of even small power was mounted in the grounds back of Carpenter s laboratory the amoeba could be detected as soon as they entered the hole or when they passed above it through space but aside from that point of vantage they were entirely invisible Carpenter s theory of the absorptive powers of the material of which the heaviside layer was composed was laughed to scorn by most scientists who pointed out the fact that the sun moon and stars could be readily seen through it Carpenter replied that the rays of colored or visible light could only pass through the layer when superimposed upon a carrier wave of ultra violet or invisible light He stated dogmatically that the amoeba and the other denizens of space absorbed all the ultra violet light which fell on them and reflected only the visible rays which could not pass through the heaviside layer because of the lack of a synchronized carrier wave of shorter wave length Despetier replied at great length and showed by apparently unimpeachable mathematics that Carpenter was entirely wrong and that his statements showed an absolute lack of knowledge of the most elementary and fundamental laws of light transmission Carpenter replied briefly that he could prove by mathematics that two was equal to one and he challenged Despetier or anyone else to satisfactorily explain the observed facts in any other way While they vainly tried to do so Carpenter lapsed into silence in his Los Angeles laboratory and delved ever deeper into the problems of science Such was the situation when the attack came from space My first knowledge of the attack came when McQuarrie the city editor of the San Francisco Clarion sent for me When I entered his office he tossed a Los Angeles dispatch on the desk before me and with a growl ordered me to read it It told of the unexplained disappearance of an eleven year old boy the night before It looked like a common kidnapping Well I asked as I handed him back the dispatch With another growl he tossed down a second telegram I read it with astonishment for it told of a second disappearance which had happened about an hour after the first The similarity of the two cases was at once apparent Coincidence or connection I asked as I returned it Find out he replied If I knew which it was I wouldn t be wasting the paper s money by sending you to Los Angeles I don t doubt that I am wasting it anyway but as long as I am forced to keep you on as a reporter I might as well try to make you earn the money the owner wastes on paying you a salary even although I know it to be a hopeless task Go on down there and see what you can find out if anything I jotted down in my notebook the names and addresses of the missing children and turned to leave A boy entered and handed McQuarrie a yellow slip He glanced at it and called me back Wait a minute Bond he said as he handed me the dispatch I doubt but you d better fly down to Los Angeles Another case has just been reported I hastily copied down the dispatch he handed me which was almost a duplicate of the first two with the exception of the time and the name Three unexplained disappearances in one day was enough to warrant speed I drew some expense money and was on my way south in a chartered plane within an hour On my arrival I went to the Associated Press office and found a message waiting for me directing me to call McQuarrie on the telephone at once Hello Bond came his voice over the wire have you just arrived Well forget all about that disappearance case Prince is on his way to Los Angeles to cover it You hadn t been gone an hour before a wire came in from Jim Carpenter He says Send Bond to me at once by fastest conveyance Chance for a scoop on the biggest story of the century I don t know what it s about but Jim Carpenter is always front page news Get in touch with him at once and stay with him until you have the story Don t risk trying to telegraph it when you get it telephone Get moving I lost no time in getting Carpenter on the wire Hello First Mortgage he greeted me You made good time getting down here Where are you At the A P Office Grab a taxi and come out to the laboratory Bring your grip with you you may have to stay over night I ll be right out Jim What s the story His voice suddenly grew grave It s the biggest thing you ever handled he replied The fate of the whole world may hang on it I don t want to talk over the phone come on out and I ll give you the whole thing An hour later I shook hands with Tim the guard at the gate of the Carpenter laboratory and passed through the grounds to enter Jim s private office He greeted me warmly and for a few minutes we chatted of old times when I worked with him as an assistant in his atomic disintegration laboratory and of the stirring events we had passed through together when we had ventured outside the heaviside layer in his space ship Those were stirring times he said but I have an idea First Mortgage that they were merely a Sunday school picnic compared to what we are about to tackle I guessed that you had something pretty big up your sleeve from your message I replied What s up now Are we going to make a trip to the moon and interview the inhabitants We may interview them without going that far he said Have you seen a morning paper No Look at this He handed me a copy of the Gazette Streamer headlines told of the three disappearances which I had come to Los Angeles to cover but they had grown to five during the time I had been flying down I looked at Jim in surprise We got word of that in San Francisco I told him and I came down here to cover the story When I got here McQuarrie telephoned me your message and told me to come and see you instead Has your message anything to do with this It has everything to do with it First Mortgage in fact it is it Have you any preconceived ideas on the disappearance epidemic None at all All the better you ll be able to approach the matter with an unbiased viewpoint Don t read that hooey put out by an inspired reporter who blames the laxness of the city government I ll give you the facts without embellishment Nothing beyond the bare fact of the disappearance is known about the first case Robert Prosser aged eleven was sent to the grocery store by his mother about six thirty last night and failed to return That s all we know about it except that it happened in Eagle Rock The second case we have a little more data on William Hill aged twelve was playing in Glendale last night with some companions They were playing hide and go seek and William hid He could not be found by the boy who was searching and has not been found since His companions became frightened and reported it about eight o clock They saw nothing but mark this Four of them agree that they heard a sound in the air like a motor humming That proves nothing Taken alone it does not but in view of the third case it is quite significant The third case happened about nine thirty last night This time the victim was a girl aged ten She was returning home from a moving picture with some companions and she disappeared This time the other children saw her go They say she was suddenly taken straight up into the air and then disappeared from sight They also claim to have heard a sound like a big electric fan in the air at the time although they could see nothing Had they heard the details of the second disappearance They had not I can see what you are thinking that they were unconsciously influenced by the account given of the other case Consciously or unconsciously I doubt it for the fourth case was almost a duplicate of the third The fourth and fifth cases happened this morning In the fourth case the child for it was a nine year old girl this time was lifted into the air in broad daylight and disappeared This disappearance was witnessed not only by children but also by two adults and their testimony agrees completely with that of the children The fifth case is similar to the first a ten year old boy disappeared without trace The whole city is in a reign of terror The telephone at Carpenter s elbow rang and he answered it A short conversation took place and he turned to me with a grim face as he hung up the receiver Another case has just been reported to police headquarters from Beverly Hills he said Again the child was seen to be lifted into the air by some invisible means and disappeared The sound of a motor was plainly heard by five witnesses who all agree that it was just above their heads but that nothing could be seen Was it in broad daylight Less than an hour ago But Jim that s impossible Why is it impossible It would imply the invisibility of a tangible substance of a solid What of it Why there isn t any such substance Nothing of the sort exists Carpenter pointed to one of the windows of his laboratory Does that window frame contain glass or not he asked I strained my eyes Certainly nothing was visible Yes I said at a venture He rose and thrust his hand through the space where the glass should have been Has this frame glass in it he asked pointing to another No He struck the glass with his knuckle I ll give up I replied I am used to thinking of glass as being transparent but not invisible yet I can see that under certain light conditions it may be invisible Granted that such is the case do you believe that living organisms can be invisible Under the right conditions yes Has any observer been able to see any of the purple amoeba which we know are so numerous on the outer side of the heaviside layer Not until they have entered the hole through the layer And yet those amoeba are both solid and opaque as you know Why is it not possible that men or intelligences of some sort are in the air about us and yet are invisible to our eyes If they are why haven t we received evidence of it years ago Because there has only been a hole through the heaviside layer for six years Before that time they could not penetrate it any more than poor Hadley could with his space ship They have not entered the hole earlier because it is a very small one at present only some two hundred and fifty yards in diameter in a sphere of over eight thousand miles diameter The invaders have just found the entrance The invaders Do you think that the world has been invaded I do How else can you explain the very fact which you have just quoted that no evidence of the presence on these invisible entities has previously been recorded Where did they come from They may have come from anywhere in the solar system or even from outside it but I fancy that they are from Mars or Venus Why so Because they are the two planets nearest to the earth and are the ones where conditions are the most like they are on the earth Venus for example has an atmosphere and a gravity about eighty three of earthly gravity and life of a sort similar to that of the earth might well live there Further it seems more probable that the invaders have come from one of the nearby planets than from the realms of space beyond the solar system What about the moon We can dismiss that because of the lack of an atmosphere It sounds logical Jim but the idea of living organisms of sufficient size to lift a child into the air who are invisible seems a little absurd I never said they were invisible I don t think they are But they must be else why weren t they seen Use your head First Mortgage Those purple amoeba we encountered were quite visible to us yet they are invisible to observers on the earth Yes but that is because the heaviside layer is between them and the earth As soon as they come below it they can be seen Exactly Why is it not possible that the Venetians or Martians or whoever our invaders are have encased themselves and their space flyer in a layer of some substance similar to the heaviside layer a substance which is permeable to light rays only when a large proportion of ultra violet rays accompany the visible rays If they did this and then constructed the walls of their ship of some substance which absorbed all the ultra violet rays which fell on it not only would the ship itself be invisible but also everything contained in it and yet they could see the outside world easily That such is the case is proved by the disappearance of those children in mid air They were taken into a space ship behind an ultra violet absorbing wall and so became invisible If the walls absorbed all the ultra violet and were impermeable to light without ultra violet the ship would appear as a black opaque substance and could be seen That would be true except for one thing which you are forgetting The heaviside layer as I have repeatedly proved is a splendid conductor of ultra violet The rays falling on it are probably bent along the line of the covering layer so that they open up and bend around the ship in the same manner as flowing water will open up and flow around a stone and then come together again The light must flow around the solid ship and then join again in such a manner that the eye can detect no interruption Jim all that sounds reasonable but have you any proof of it No First Mortgage I haven t yet but if the Lord is good to us we ll have definite proof this afternoon and be in a position to successfully combat this new menace to the world Do you expect me to go on another one of your crack brained expeditions into the unknown with you Certainly I do but this time we won t go out of the known I have our old space flyer which we took beyond the heaviside layer six years ago ready for action and we re going to look for the invaders this afternoon How will we see them if they are invisible They are invisible to ordinary light but not to ultra violet light While most of the ultra violet is deflected and flows around the ship of else is absorbed I have an idea that if we bathe it in a sufficient concentration of ultra violet some would be reflected We are going to look for the reflected portion Ultra violet light is invisible It is to the eye but it can be detected You know that radium is activated and glows under ultra violet Yes Mounted on our flyer are six ultra violet searchlights By the side of each one is a wide angle telescopic concentrator which will focus any reflected ultra violet onto a radium coated screen and thus make it visible to us In effect the apparatus is a camera obscura with all lens made of rock crystal or fused quartz both of which allow free passage to ultra violet What will we do if we find them Mounted beneath the telescope is a one pounder gun with radite shells If we locate them we will use our best efforts to shoot them down Suppose they are armed too In that case I hope that you shoot faster and straighter than they do If you don t well old man it ll just be too damned bad I don t know that the Clarion hires me to go out and shoot at invisible invaders from another planet but if I don t go with you I expect you d just about call up the Echo or the Gazette and ask them for a gunner Just about In that case I may as well be sacrificed as anyone else When do we start You old faker cried Jim pounding me on the back You wouldn t miss the trip for anything If you re ready we ll start right now Everything is ready Including the sacrifice I replied rising All right Jim let s go and get it over with If we live I ll have to get back in time to telephone the story to McQuarrie for the first edition I followed Jim out of the laboratory and to a large open space behind the main building where the infra red generators with which he had pierced the hole through the heaviside layer had been located The reflectors were still in place but the bank of generators had been removed A gang of men were hard at work erecting a huge parabolic reflector in the center of the circle about the periphery of which the infra red reflectors were placed In an open space near the center stood a Hadley space ship toward which Jim led the way I wondered at the activity and meant to ask what it portended but in the excitement of boarding the flyer forgot it I followed Jim in he closed the door and started the air conditioner Here First Mortgage he said as he turned from the control board and faced me here are the fluoroscopic screens They are arranged in a bank so that you can keep an eye on all of them readily Beneath each telescope is an automatic one pounder gun with its mount geared to the telescope and the light so that the gun bears continually on the point in space represented by the center of the fluoroscopic screen which belongs to that light If we locate anything turn your beam until the object is in the exact center of the screen where these two cross hairs are When you have it lined up push this button and the gun will fire What about reloading The guns are self loading Each one has twenty shells in its magazine and will fire one shot each time the button is pushed until it is empty If you empty one magazine I can turn the ship so that another gun will bear This gives you a total of one hundred and twenty shots quickly available there are sixty extra pounds which we can break out and load into the magazines in a few seconds Do you understand everything I guess so Everything seems clear enough All right sit down and we ll start I took my seat and Jim pulled the starting lever I was glued to the seat and the heavy springs in the cushion were compressed almost to their limit by the sudden acceleration As soon as we were well clear of the ground Jim reduced his power and in a few moments we were floating motionless in the air a thousand feet up He left the control board and came to my side Start your ultra lights he said as he joined me We may be able to spot something from here I started the lights and we stared at the screens before us Nothing appeared on any of them except the one pointing directly down and only an image of the ground appeared on it Under Jim s tutelage I swung the beams in wide circles covering the space around us but nothing appeared Those beams won t project over five miles in this atmosphere he said and the ship we are looking for may be so small that we would have trouble locating it at any great distance I am going to move over near the scene of the last disappearance Keep your lights swinging and sing out if you see anything on the screens I could feel the ship start to move slowly under the force of a side discharge from the rocket motor and I swung the beams of the six lights around trying to cover the entire area about us Nothing appeared on the screens for an hour and my head began to ache from the strain of unremitting close observation of the glowing screens A buzz sounding over the hum of the rocket motor attracted my attention Jim pulled his levers to neutral with the exception of the one which maintained our elevation and stepped to an instrument on the wall of the flyer Hello he called What Where did it happen All right thanks we ll move over that way at once He turned from the radio telephone and spoke Another disappearance has just been reported he said It happened on the outskirts of Pasadena Keep your eyes open I m going to head in that direction A few minutes later we were floating over Pasadena Jim stopped the flyer and joined me at the screens We swung our beams in wide circles to cover the entire area around us but no image on the screens rewarded us Doggone it they must have left here in a hurry grumbled Jim Even as he spoke the flyer gave a lurch which nearly threw me off my seat and which sent Jim sprawling on the floor With a white face he leaped to the control board and pulled the lever controlling our one working stern motor to full power For a moment the ship moved upward and then came to a dead stop although the motor still roared at full speed Can t you see anything Pete cried Jim as he threw our second stern motor into gear Again the ship moved upward for a few feet and then stopped I swung the searchlights frantically in all directions but five of the screens remained blank and the sixth showed only the ground below us Not a thing I replied Something ought to show he muttered and suddenly shut off both motors The flyer gave a sickening lurch toward the ground but we fell only a hundred yards before our motion stopped We hung suspended in the air with no motors working Jim joined me at the screens and we swung the lights rapidly without success Look Pete Jim cried hoarsely My gaze followed his pointing finger and I saw the door of our flyer springing out as though some force from the outside were trying to wrench it open The pull ceased for an instant then came again the sturdy latches burst and the door was torn from its hinges Jim swung one of the searchlights until the beam was at right angles to the hull of the flyer and pressed the gun button A crash filled the confined space of the flyer as a one pounder radite shell tore out into space They re there but still invisible he exclaimed as he shifted the direction of the gun and fired again I am shooting by guess work but I might score a hit He changed the direction of the gun again but before he could press the button he was lifted into the air and drawn rapidly toward the open door Shoot Pete he shouted Shoot and keep on shooting it s your only chance I turned to the knobs controlling the guns and lights but before I could make a move something hard and cold grasped me about the middle and I was lifted into the air and drawn toward the open door after Jim I tore at the thing holding me with my hands but it was a smooth round thing like a two inch thick wire and I could get no grip on it to loosen it Out through the door I went and was drawn through the air a few feet behind Jim He moved ahead of me for fifteen or twenty feet and then vanished in mid air I dared not struggle in mid air and I was drawn through a door into a large space flyer which became visible as I entered it The flexible wire or rod which had held me uncoiled and I was free on the floor beside Jim Carpenter This much was clear and understandable but when I looked at the crew of that space ship I was sure that I had lost my mind or was seeing visions I had naturally expected men or at least something in semi human form but instead of anything of the sort before me stood a dozen gigantic beetles I rubbed my eyes and looked again There was no mistaking the fact that we had been captured by a race of gigantic beetles flying an invisible space ship When I had time later to examine them critically I could see marked differences between our captors and the beetles we were accustomed to see on the earth besides the mere matter of size To begin with their bodies were relatively much smaller the length of shell of the largest specimen not being over four feet while the head of the same insect exclusive of the horns or pinchers was a good eighteen inches in length The pinchers which by all beetle proportions should have been a couple of feet long at the least did not extend over the head a distance greater than eight inches although they were sturdy and powerful Instead of traveling with their shells horizontal as do earthly beetles these insects stood erect on their two lower pairs of legs which were of different lengths so that all four feet touched the ground when the shell was vertical The two upper pairs of legs were used as arms the topmost pair A being quite short and splitting out at the end into four flexible claws about five inches long which they used as fingers These upper arms which sprouted from a point near the top of the head were peculiar in that they apparently had no joints like the other three pairs but were flexible like an elephant s trunk The second pair of arms were armed with long vicious looking hooks The backplates concealed only very rudimentary wings not large enough to enable the insects to fly although Jim told me later that they could fly on their own planet where the lessened gravity made such extensive wing supports as would be needed on earth unnecessary Footnote A mister Bond has made a laughable error in his description Like all of the coleoptera the Mercurians were hexapoda six legged What mister Bond continually refers to in his narrative as upper arms were really the antenna of the insects which split at the end into four flexible appendages resembling fingers His mistake is a natural one for the Mercurians used their antenna as extra arms James S Carpenter The backplates were a brilliant green in color with six inch stripes of chrome yellow running lengthwise and crimson spots three inches in diameter arranged in rows between the stripes Their huge faceted eyes sparkled like crystal when the light fell on them and from time to time waves of various colors passed over them evidently reflecting the insect s emotions Although they gave the impression of great muscular power their movements were slow and sluggish and they seemed to have difficulty in getting around As my horrified gaze took in these monstrosities I turned with a shudder to Jim Carpenter Am I crazy Jim I asked or
4110_11535_000030_000001	train-clean-360	 do you see 
none	none	these things too I see them all right Pete he replied It isn t as surprising as it seems at first glance You expected to find human beings so did I but what reason had we for doing so It is highly improbable when you come to consider the matter that evolution should take the same course elsewhere as it did on earth Why not beetles or fish or horned toads for that matter No reason I guess I answered I just hadn t expected anything of the sort What do you suppose they mean to do with us I haven t any idea old man We ll just have to wait and see I ll try to talk to them although I don t expect much luck at it He turned to the nearest beetle and slowly and clearly spoke a few words The insect gave no signs of comprehension although it watched the movement of Jim s lips carefully It is my opinion and Jim agrees with me that the insects were both deaf and dumb for during the entire time we were associated with them we never heard them give forth a sound under any circumstances nor saw them react to any sound that we made Either they had some telepathic means of communication or else they made and heard sounds beyond the range of the human ear for it was evident from their actions that they frequently communicated with one another When Jim failed in his first attempt to communicate he looked around for another method He noticed my notebook which had fallen on the floor when I was set down he picked it up and drew a pencil from his pocket The insects watched his movements carefully and when he had made a sketch in the book the nearest one took it from him and examined it carefully and then passed it to another one who also examined it The sketch which Jim had drawn showed the outline of the Hadley space flyer from which he had been taken When the beetles had examined the sketch one of them stepped to an instrument board in the center of the ship and made an adjustment Then he pointed with one of his lower arms We looked in the direction in which he pointed to our astonishment the walls of the flyer seemed to dissolve or at least to become perfectly transparent The floor of the space ship was composed of some silvery metal and from it had risen walls of the same material but now the effect was as though we were suspended in mid air with nothing either around us or under us I gasped and grabbed at the instrument board for support Then I felt foolish as I realized that there was no change in the feel of the floor for all its transparency and that we were not falling A short distance away we could see our flyer suspended in the air held up by two long flexible rods or wires similar to those which had lifted us from our ship into our prison I saw a dozen more of these rods coiled up hanging in the air evidently but really on the floor near the edge of the flyer ready for use Jim suddenly grasped me by the arm Look behind you in a moment he said but don t start He took the notebook in his hand and started to draw a sketch I looked behind as he had told me to Hanging in the air in a position which told me that they must have been in a different compartment of the flyer were five children They were white as marble and lay perfectly motionless Are they dead Jim I asked in a low voice without looking at him I don t know he replied but we ll find out a little later I am relieved to find them here and I doubt if they are harmed The sketch which he was making was one of the solar system and when he had finished he marked the earth with a cross and handed the notebook to one of the beetles The insect took it and showed it to his companions so far as I was able to judge expressions they were amazed to find that we had knowledge of the heavenly bodies The beetle took Jim s pencil in one of its hands and after examining it carefully made a cross on the circle which Jim had drawn to represent the planet Mercury They come from Mercury exclaimed Jim in surprise as he showed me the sketch That accounts for a good many things why they are so lethargic for one thing Mercury is much smaller than the earth and the gravity is much less According to Mercurian standards they must weigh a ton each It is quite a tribute to their muscular development that they can move and support their weight against our gravity They can understand a drawing all right so we have a means of communicating with them although a pretty slow one and dependent entirely on my limited skill as a cartoonist I wonder if we are free to move about The only way to find out is to try I replied and stood erect The beetles offered no objection and Jim stood up beside me We walked or rather edged our way toward the side of the ship The insects watched us when we started to move and then evidently decided that we were harmless They turned from us to the working of the ship One of them manipulated some dials on the instrument board One of the rods which held our flyer released its grip came in toward the Mercurian ship and coiled itself up on the floor or the place where the floor should have been The insect touched another dial Jim threw caution to the winds raced across the floor and grasped the beetle by the arm The insect looked at him questioningly Jim produced the notebook and drew a sketch representing our flyer falling On the level be had used to represent the ground he made another sketch of it lying in ruins The beetle nodded comprehendingly and turned to another dial the ship sank slowly toward the ground We sank until we hung only a few feet from the ground when our flyer was gently lowered down When it rested on the ground the wire which had held it uncoiled came aboard and coiled itself up beside the others As the Mercurian ship rose I noticed idly that the door which had been torn from our ship and dropped lay within a few yards of the ship itself The Mercurian ship rose to an elevation of a hundred feet drifting gently over the city As we rose I determined to try the effect of my personality on the beetles I approached the one who seemed to be the leader and putting on the most woeful expression I could muster I looked at the floor He did not understand me and I pretended that I was falling and grasped at him This time he nodded and stepped to the instrument board In a moment the floor became visible I thanked him as best I could in pantomime and approached the walls They were so transparent that I felt an involuntary shrinking as I approached them I edged my way cautiously forward until my outstretched hand encountered a solid substance I looked out At the slow speed we were traveling the drone of our motors was hardly audible to us and I felt sure that it could not be heard on the ground Once their curiosity was satisfied our captors paid little or no attention to me and left me free to come and go as I wished I made my way cautiously toward the children but ran into a solid wall Remembering Jim s words I made my way back toward him without displaying any interest Jim could probably have wandered around as I did had he wished but he chose to occupy his time differently With his notebook and pencil he carried on an extensive conversation if that term can be applied to a crudely executed set of drawings with the leader of the beetles I was not especially familiar with the methods of control of space ships and I could make nothing of the maze of dials and switches on the instrument board For half an hour we drifted slowly along Presently one of the beetles approached seized my arm and turned me about With one of his arms he pointed ahead A mile away I could see another space flyer similar to the one we were on Here comes another one Jim I called Yes I saw it some time ago I don t know where the third one is Are there three of them Yes Three of them came here yesterday and are exploring the country round about here They are scouts sent out from the fleet of our brother planet to see if the road was clear and what the world was like They spotted the hole through the layer with their telescope and sent their fleet out to pay us a visit He tells me that the scouts have reported favorably and that the whole fleet several thousand ships as near as I can make out are expected here this evening Have you solved the secret of their invisibility Partly It is as I expected The walls of the ship are double the inner one of metal and the outer one of vitrolene or some similar perfectly transparent substance The space between the walls is filled with some substance which will bend both visible and ultra violet rays along a path around the ship and then lets them go in their original direction The reason why we can see through the walls and see the protective coating of that ship coming is that they are generating some sort of a ray here which acts as a carrier for the visible light rays I don t know what sort of a ray it is but when I get a good look at their generators I may be able to tell Are you beginning to itch and burn Yes I believe that I am although I hadn t noticed it until you spoke I have been noticing it for some time From its effects on the skin I am inclined to believe it to be a ray of very short wave length possibly something like our X ray or even shorter Have you found out what they intend to do with us I don t think they have decided yet Possibly they are going to take us up to the leader of their fleet and let him decide The cuss that is in command of this ship seems surprised to death to find out that I can comprehend the principles of his ship He seems to think that I am a sort of a rara avis a freak of nature He intimated that he would recommend that we be used for vivisection Good Lord It s not much more worse than the fate they design for the rest of their captives at that What is that It s a long story that I ll have to tell you later I want to watch this meeting The other ship had approached to within a few yards and floated stationary while some sort of communication was exchanged between the two I could not fathom the method used but the commander of our craft clamped what looked like a pair of headphones against his body and plugged the end of a wire leading from them into his instrument board From time to time various colored lights glowed on the board before him After a time he uncoupled his device from the board and one of the long rods shot out from our ship to the other It returned in a moment clamped around the body of a young girl As the came on board she was lowered onto the deck beside the other children Like them she was stiff and motionless I gave an exclamation and sprang forward Pete Jim s voice recalled me to myself and I watched the child laid with the others with as disinterested an expression as I could muster I had never made a mistake in following Jim Carpenter s lead and I knew that somewhere in his head a plan was maturing which might offer us some chance of escape Our ship moved ahead down a long slant gradually dropping nearer to the ground I watched the maneuver with interest while Jim with his friend the beetle commander went over the ship The insect was evidently amused at Jim and was determined to find out the limits of his intelligence for he pointed out various controls and motors of the ship and made elaborate sketches which Jim seemed to comprehend fairly well One of the beetles approached the control board and motioned me back I stepped away from the board evidently a port in the side of the vessel opened for I felt a breath of air and could hear the hum of the city I walked to the side and glanced down and found that we were floating about twenty feet off the ground over a street on the edge of the city On the street a short distance ahead of us two children evidently returning from school to judge by the books under their arms were walking unsuspectingly along A turn of the dial sped up our motors and as the hum rang out in a louder key the children looked upward Two of the long flexible wires shot out and wrapped themselves about the children screaming they were lifted into the space flyer The port through which they came in shut with a clang and the ship rose rapidly into the air The children were released from the wires which coiled themselves up on deck and the beetle who had operated them stepped forward and grasped the nearer of the children a boy of about eleven by the arm He raised the boy who was paralyzed with terror up toward his head and gazed steadily into his eyes Slowly the boy ceased struggling and became white and rigid The beetle laid him on the deck and turned to the girl Involuntarily I gave a shout and sprang forward but Jim grasped me by the arm Keep quiet you darned fool he cried We can do nothing now Wait for a chance We can t stand here and see murder done I protested It s not murder Pete those children aren t being hurt They are being hypnotized so that they can be transported to Mercury Why are they taking them to Mercury I demanded As nearly as I can make out there is a race of men up there who are subject to these beetles This ship is radium propelled and the men and women are the slaves who work in the radium mines Of course the workers soon become sexless but others are kept for breeding purposes to keep the race alive Through generations of in breeding the stock is about played out and are getting too weak to be of much value The Mercurians have been studying the whole universe to find a race which will serve their purpose and they have chosen us to be the victims When their fleet gets here they plan to capture thousands of selected children and carry them to Mercury in order to infuse their blood into the decadent race of slaves they have Those who are not suitable for breeding when they grow up will die as slaves in the radium mines Horrible I gasped Why are they taking children Jim Wouldn t adults suit their purpose better They are afraid to take adults On Mercury an earthman would have muscles of unheard of power and adults would constantly strive to rise against their masters By getting children they hope to raise them to know nothing else than a life of slavery and get the advantage of their strength without risk It is a clever scheme And are we to stand here and let them do it Not on your life but we had better hold easy for a while If I can get a few minutes more with that brute I ll know enough about running this ship that we can afford to do away with them You have a pistol haven t you No The devil I thought you had I have an automatic but it only carries eight shells There are eleven of these insects and unless we can get the jump on them they ll do us I saw what looks like a knife lying near the instrument board get over near it and get ready to grab it as soon as you hear my pistol These things are deaf and if I work it right I may be able to do several of them in before they know what s happening When you attack don t try to ram them in the back their backplates are an inch thick and will be proof against a knife thrust Aim at their eyes if you can blind them they ll be helpless Do you understand I ll do my best Jim I replied Since you have told me their plans I am itching to get at them I edged over toward the knife but as I did so I saw a better weapon On the floor lay a bar of silvery metal about thirty inches long and an inch in diameter I picked it up and toyed with it idly meanwhile edging around to get behind the insect which I had marked for my first attentions Jim was talking again by means of the notebook with his beetle friend They walked around the ship examining everything in it Are you ready Pete came Jim s voice at last All set I replied getting a firmer grasp on my bar and edging toward one of the insects Well don t start until I fire You notice the bug I am talking to Don t kill him unless you have to This ship is a little too complicated for me to fathom so I want this fellow taken prisoner We ll use him as our engineer when we take control I understand All right get ready I kept my eye on Jim He had drawn the beetle with whom he was talking to a position where they were behind the rest Jim pointed at something behind the insect s back and the beetle turned As it did so Jim whipped out his pistol and taking careful aim fired at one of the insects As the sound of the shot rang out I raised my bar and leaped forward I brought it down with crushing force on the head of the nearest beetle My victim fell forward and I heard Jim s pistol bark again but I had no time to watch him As the beetle I struck fell the others turned and I had two of them coming at me with outstretched arms ready to grasp me I swung my bar and the arm of one of them fell limp but the other seized me with both its hands and I felt the cruel hooks of its lower arms against the small of my back One of my arms was still free I swung my bar again and it struck my captor on the back of the head It was stunned by the blow and fell I seized the knife from the floor and threw myself down beside it and struck at its eyes trying to roll it over so as to protect me from the other who was trying to grasp me I felt hands clutch me from behind I was wrenched loose from the body of my victim and lifted into the air I was turned about and stared hard into the implacable crystalline eyes of one of the insects For a moment my senses reeled and then without volition I dropped my bar I remembered the children and realized that I was being hypnotized I fought against the feeling but my senses reeled and I almost went limp when the sound of a pistol shot almost in my ear roused me The spell of the beetle was momentarily broken I thrust the knife which I still grasped at the eyes before me My blow went home but the insect raised me and bent me toward him until my head lay on top of his and the huge horns which adorned his head began to close Another pistol shot sounded and I was suddenly dropped I grasped my bar as I fell and leaped up The flyer was a shambles Dead insects lay on all sides while Jim smoking pistol in hand was staring as though fascinated into the eyes of one of the surviving beetles I ran forward and brought my bar down on the insect s head but as I did so I was grasped from behind Jim help I cried as I was swung into the air The insect whirled me around and then threw me to the floor I had an impression of falling then everything dissolved in a flash of light I was unconscious only for a moment and I came to to find Jim Carpenter standing over me menacing my assailant with his gun Thanks Jim I said faintly If you re conscious again get up and get your bar he replied My pistol is empty and I don t know how long I can run a bluff on this fellow I scrambled to my feet and grasped the bar Jim stepped behind me and reloaded his pistol All right he said when he had finished I ll take charge of this fellow Go around and see if the rest are dead If they aren t when you find them see that they are when you leave them We re taking no prisoners I went the rounds of the prostrate insects None of them were beyond moving except two whose heads had been crushed by my bar but I obeyed Jim s orders When I rejoined him with my bloody bar the only beetle left alive was the commander whom Jim was covering with his pistol Take the gun he said when I reported my actions and give me the bar We exchanged weapons and Jim turned to the captive Now old fellow he said grimly either you run this ship as I want you to or you re a dead Indian Savvy He took his pencil and notebook from his pocket and drew a sketch of our Hadley space ship On the other end of the sheet he drew a picture of the Mercurian ship and then drew a line connecting the two The insect looked at the sketch but made no movement All right if that s the way you feel about it said Jim He raised the bar and brought it down with crushing force on one of the insect s lower arms The arm fell as though paralyzed and a blue light played across the beetle s eyes Jim extended the sketch again and raised the bar threateningly The beetle moved over to the control board Jim following closely and set the ship in motion Ten minutes later it rested on the ground beside the ship in which we had first taken the air Following Jim s pictured orders the beetle opened the door of the Mercurian ship and followed Jim into the Hadley As we emerged from the Mercurian ship I looked back It had vanished completely The children Jim I gasped I haven t forgotten them he replied but they are all right for the present If we turned them loose now we d have ninety reporters around us in ten minutes I want to get our generators modified first He pointed toward the spot where the Mercurian ship had stood and then toward our generators The beetle hesitated but Jim swung his bar against the insect s side in a vicious blow Again came the play of blue light over the eyes the beetle bent over our generaters and set to work Jim handed me the bar and bent over to help They were both mechanics of a high order and they worked well together in an hour the beetle started the generators and swung one of the searchlights toward his old ship It leaped into view on the radium coated screen Good business ejaculated Jim We ll repair this door then we ll be ready to release the children and start out We followed the beetle into the Mercurian ship which it seemed to be able to see It opened a door leading into another compartment of the flyer and before us lay the bodies of eight children The beetle lifted the first one a little girl up until his many faceted eyes looked full into the closed ones of the child There was a flicker of an eyelash a trace of returning color and then a scream of terror from the child The beetle set the girl down and Jim bent over her It s all right now little lady he said clumsily smoothing her hair You re safe now Run along to your mother First Mortgage take charge of her and take her outside It isn t well for children to see these things The child clung to my hand I led her out of the ship which promptly vanished as we left it One by one seven other children joined us the last one a miss of not over eight in Jim s arms The beetle followed behind him Do any of you know where you are asked Jim as he came out I do sir said one of the boys I live close to here All right take these youngsters to your house and tell your mother to telephone their parents to come and get them If anyone asks you what happened tell them to see Jim Carpenter to morrow Do you understand Yes sir All right run along then Now First Mortgage let s go hunting We wired our captive up so securely that I felt that there was no possible chance of his escape then with Jim at the controls and me at the guns we fared forth in search of the invaders Back and forth over the city we flew without sighting another spaceship in the air Jim gave an exclamation of impatience and swung on a wider circle which took us out over the water I kept the searchlights working Presently far ahead over the water a dark spot came into view I called to Jim and we approached it at top speed Don t shoot until we are within four hundred yards cautioned Jim I held my fire until we were within the specified distance The newcomer was another of the Mercurian space ships with a feeling of joy I swung my beam until the cross hairs of the screen rested full on the invader All ready I sung out If you are ready Gridley you may fire replied Jim I pressed the gun button The crash of the gun was followed by another report from outside as the radite shell burst against the Mercurian flyer The deadly explosive did its work and the shattered remains of the wreck fell to be engulfed in the sea below That s one cried Jim I m afraid we won t have time to hunt up the other right now This bug told me that the other Mercurians are due here to day and I think we had better form ourselves into a reception committee and go up to the hole to meet them He sent the ship at high speed over the city until we hovered over the laboratory We stopped for a moment and Jim stepped to the radio telephone Hello Williams he said how are things going That s fine In an hour you say Well speed it up as much as you can we may call for it soon He turned both stern motors to full power and we shot up like a rocket toward the hole in the protective layer through which the invaders had entered In ten minutes we were at the altitude of the guard ships and Jim asked if anything had been seen The report was negative Jim left them below the layer and sent our flyer up through the hole into space We reached the outer surface in another ten minutes and we were none too soon Hardly had we debouched from the hole than ahead of us we saw another Mercurian flyer It was a lone one and Jim bent over the captive and held a hastily made sketch before him The sketch showed three Mercurian flyers one on the ground one wrecked and the third one in the air He touched the drawing of the one in the air and pointed toward our port hole and looked questioningly at the beetle The insect inspected the flyer in space and nodded Good cried Jim That s the third of the trio who came ahead as scouts Get your gun ready First Mortgage we re going to pick him off Our ship approached the doomed Mercurian Again I waited until we were within four hundred yards then I pressed the button which hurled it a crumpled wreck onto the outer surface of the heaviside layer Two cried Jim as we backed away Here come plenty more I cried as I swung the searchlight Jim left his controls glanced at the screen and whistled softly Dropping toward us from space were hundreds of the Mercurian ships We got here just in time he said Break out your extra ammunition while I take to the hole We can t hope to do that bunch alone so we ll fight a rearguard action Since our bow gun would be the only one in action I hastily moved the spare boxes of ammunition nearer to it while Jim maneuvered the Hadley over the hole As the Mercurian fleet came nearer he started a slow retreat toward the earth The Mercurians overtook us rapidly Jim locked his controls at slow speed down and hurried to the bow gun Start shooting as soon as you can he said I ll keep the magazine filled I swung the gun until the cross hairs of the screen rested full on the leading ship and pressed the button My aim was true and the shattered fragments of the ship fell toward me The balance of the fleet slowed down for an instant I covered another one and pressed my button The ship at which I had aimed was in motion and I missed it but I had the satisfaction of seeing another one fall in fragments Jim was loading the magazine as fast as I fired I covered another ship and fired again A third one of our enemies fell in ruins The rest paused and drew off They re retreating Jim I cried Cease firing until they come on again he replied is he took the shells from the magazines of the other guns and piled them near the bow gun I held my fire for a few minutes The Mercurians retreated a short distance and then came on again with a rush Twenty times my gun went off as fast as I could align it and press the trigger and eighteen of the enemy ships were in ruins Again the Mercurians retreated I held my fire We were falling more rapidly now and far below we could see the black spots which were the guard ships I told Jim that they were in sight he stepped to the radio telephone and ordered them to keep well away from the hole Again the Mercurian ships came on with a rush this time with beams of orange light stabbing a way before them When I told Jim of this he jumped to the controls and shot our ship down at breakneck speed I don t know what sort of fighting apparatus they have but I don t care to face it he said to me Fire if they get close but I hope to get out of the hole before they are in range Fast as we fell the Mercurians were coming faster and they were not over eight hundred yards from us when he reached the level of the guard ships Jim checked our speed I managed to pick off three more of the invaders before we moved away from the hole Jim stopped the side motion and jumped to the radio telephone Hello Williams he shouted into the instrument Are you ready down there Thank God Full power at once please Watch what happens he said to me as he turned from the instrument Some fifty of the Mercurian flyers had reached our level and had started to move toward us before anything happened Then from below came a beam of intolerable light Upward it struck and the Mercurian ships on which it impinged disappeared in a flash of light A disintegrating ray explained Jim I suspected that it might be needed and I started Williams to rigging it up early this morning I hated to use it because it may easily undo the work that six years have done in healing the break in the layer but it was necessary That ends the invasion except for those ten or twelve ships ahead of us How is your marksmanship Can you pick off ten in ten shots Watch me I said grimly as the ship started to move Pride goeth ever before a fall it took me sixteen shots to demolish the eleven ships which had escaped destruction from the ray As the last one fell in ruins Jim ordered the ray shut off We fell toward the ground What are we going to do with our prisoner I asked Jim looked at the beetle meditatively He would make a fine museum piece if he were stuffed he said but on the whole I think we ll let him go He is an intelligent creature and will probably be happier on Mercury than anywhere else What do you say that we put him on his ship and turn him loose To lead another invasion I asked I think not He has seen what has happened to this one and is more likely to warn them to keep away In any event if we equip the guard ships with a ray that will show the Mercurian ships up and keep the disintegrating ray ready for action we needn t fear another invasion Let s let him go It suits me all right Jim but I hold out for one thing I will never dare to face McQuarrie again if I fail to get a picture of him I insist on taking his photograph before we turn him loose All right go ahead laughed Jim He ought to be able to stand that if you ll spare him an interview An hour later we watched the Mercurian flyer disappear into space I hope I ve seen the last of those bugs I said as the flyer faded from view I don t know said Jim thoughtfully If I have interpreted correctly the drawings that creature made there is a race of manlike bipeds on Mercury who are slaves to those beetles and who live and die in the horrible atmosphere of a radium mine Some of these days I may lead an expedition to our sister planet and look into that matter MECHANICAL VOICES FOR PHONE NUMBERS New developments whereby science goes still farther in its assumption of human attributes were described and demonstrated recently by Sergius P Grace Assistant Vice President of Bell Telephone Laboratories where the developments were conceived and worked out One development described and soon to be put into service in New York transforms a telephone number dialed by a subscriber into speech Although the subscriber says not a word the number dialed is spoken aloud to the operator The device is expected to simplify and speed the hooking together of automatic and voice hand operated telephone exchanges and also to speed long distance calls from automatic phones through rural exchanges The numbers which can thus be spoken are recorded on talkie films and those which are to go into use here have already been made all by an Irish girl said to have the best voice among the city s number please girls mister Grace demonstrated this device by carrying into the audience a telephone with a long cord connected with a loud speaker on the stand which represented central A member of the audience was requested to dial a number and choose five thousand five hundred fifty one T the letter T representing the exchange This number the spectator dialed on the phone mister Grace carried There was no sound but the clicking of the dial Then two seconds later the loudspeaker spoke up clearly in an almost human voice five thousand five hundred fifty one T As for the recording of the sound films there is a film for each of the ten Arabic numerals from zero to nine and these wound on revolving drums The dial on the telephone automatically sets in action the drum corresponding to the numeral moved on the dial Another development which sounds promising for bashful suitors and other timid souls enables a person to store within himself electrically a message he desires to deliver and then to deliver it without speaking simply by putting a finger to the ear of the person for whom the message is intended This mister Grace demonstrated He spoke into a telephone transmitter and his words were clearly heard by all in the audience by means of amplifiers At the same time a part of the electrical current from the amplifier representing the sentence he voiced was stored in a delay circuit another recent invention of the laboratories After being stored four and a half seconds this current was transformed to a high voltage and passed into mister Grace s body He then put his finger against the ear of a member of the audience who heard in his brain the same sentence The ear drum and surrounding tissues are made to act as one plate of a condenser receiver mister Grace explained with the vibrations of the drum interpreted by the brain A new magnetic metal perminvar and a new insulating material para gutta which make possible construction of a telephone cable across the Atlantic to supplement the radio systems were also described Actual construction of the cable is expected to be started in nineteen thirty mister Grace said Illustration The flight was hovering

4110_11533_000003_000000	train-clean-360	CHAPTER XIX
none	none	 Desolation 
4110_11533_000005_000000	train-clean-360	Stranger more thrilling even than had been the flight of the Earth after being forced out of its orbit was the flight of those dozen aircars of the Moon bearing the rebels of Dalis Gens back to Earth 
none	none	Sidenote Martian fire balls and the terrific Moon cubes wreak tremendous destruction on helpless Earth in the final death struggle of the warring worlds 
4110_11533_000007_000000	train-clean-360	For the light which glowed from the bodies of the rebels which had been given them by their passage through the white flames was transmitted to the cars themselves so that they glowed as with an inner radiance of their own like comets flashing across the night 
4110_11533_000008_000000	train-clean-360	Strange alchemy which Sarka wondered about and wondering looked ahead to the time when he should be able within his laboratory to analyze the force it embodied and thus gain new scientific knowledge of untold value to people of the Earth 
none	none	As the cars raced across outer darkness moving at top speed greater than ever attained before by man greater than even these mighty cars had traveled Sarka looked ahead and wondered about the fearful report his father had just given him 
4110_11533_000010_000000	train-clean-360	That there was an alliance between Mars and the Moon seemed almost unbelievable 
4110_11533_000010_000001	train-clean-360	How had they managed the first contact the first negotiations leading to the compact between two such alien peoples 
4110_11533_000010_000002	train-clean-360	Had there been any flights exchanged by the two worlds surely the scientists of Earth would have known about it 
4110_11533_000010_000003	train-clean-360	But there had not though there had been times and times when Sarka had peered closely enough at the surface of both the Moon and of Mars to see the activities or the results of the activities of the peoples of the two worlds 
4110_11533_000011_000000	train-clean-360	Somehow however communication if Sarka the Second had guessed correctly had been managed between Mars and the Moon and now that the Earth was a free flying orb the two were in alliance against it perhaps for the same reason that the Earth had gone a voyaging 
4110_11533_000012_000000	train-clean-360	Side by side sat Sarka and Jaska their eager eyes peering through the forward end of the flashing aircar toward the Earth growing minute by minute larger 
4110_11533_000012_000001	train-clean-360	They were able after some hours to make out the outlines of what had once been continents to see the shadows in valleys which had once held the oceans of Earth 
4110_11533_000013_000000	train-clean-360	And always as they stared and literally willed the cubes which piloted and were the motive power of the aircars to speed and more speed that marvelous display of interplanetary fireworks which had aroused the concern of Sarka the Second 
4110_11533_000014_000000	train-clean-360	What were those lights 
4110_11533_000014_000001	train-clean-360	Whence did they emanate 
4110_11533_000014_000002	train-clean-360	Sarka the Second had said that they came from Mars yet Mars was invisible to those in the speeding aircars which argued that it was hidden behind the Earth There was no way of knowing how close it was to the home of these rebels of Dalis Gens 
4110_11533_000015_000000	train-clean-360	And ever as they flashed forward Sarka was recalling that vague hint on the lips of Jaska to the effect that Luar for all her sovereignty of the Moon might be nonetheless a native of the Earth 
none	none	But How Why When 
4110_11533_000016_000003	train-clean-360	There were no answers to any of the questions yet 
4110_11533_000016_000004	train-clean-360	If she were a native of Earth how had she reached the Moon 
none	none	When had she been sent there 
4110_11533_000016_000006	train-clean-360	Who was she 
4110_11533_000016_000007	train-clean-360	Her name Luar was a strange one and Sarka studied it for many minutes rolling the odd syllables of it over his tongue wondering where on the Earth he had heard names or words similar to it 
4110_11533_000016_000008	train-clean-360	This produced no result until he tried substituting various letters then again adding various letters 
none	none	When he achieved a certain result at last he gasped and his brain was a whirl Luar by the addition of the letter n between the u and the a became Lunar meaning of the Moon Yet Lunar was unmistakably a word derived from the language of the Earth It was possible of course that this was mere coincidence but taken in connection with the suspicions of Jaska and the incontrovertible fact that Luar resembled people of the Earth Sarka did not believe in this particular whim of coincidence Who was Luar 
4110_11533_000019_000000	train-clean-360	His mind went back to the clucking sounds which among the Gnomes of the Moon passed for speech 
4110_11533_000019_000001	train-clean-360	He pondered anew 
none	none	He shaped his lips as nearly as possible to make the clucking sounds he had heard and discovered that it was very difficult to manage the letter n The conclusion was inescapable This woman Luar had once been Lunar the n down the centuries being dropped because difficult for the Gnomes to pronounce
4110_11533_000021_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes Jaska he said suddenly somewhere on Earth when we reach it we may discover the secret of Luar and know far more about Dalis than we have ever known before 
none	none	Jaska merely smiled her inscrutable smile and did not answer 
4110_11533_000022_000001	train-clean-360	By intuition she already knew 
4110_11533_000022_000002	train-clean-360	Let Sarka arrive at her conclusion by scientific methods if he desired and she would simply smile anew 
4110_11533_000023_000000	train-clean-360	Sarka thought of the manner in which Jaska and he had been transported to the Moon of how much Dalis seemed to know of the secrets of the laboratory of the Sarkas 
4110_11533_000023_000001	train-clean-360	Might he not have known two centuries ago of the Secret Exit Dome and somehow managed to make use of it in some ghastly experiment 
4110_11533_000023_000002	train-clean-360	And still the one question remained unanswered Who was Luar 
4110_11533_000024_000000	train-clean-360	The Earth was now so close that details were plainly seen 
4110_11533_000024_000001	train-clean-360	The Himalayas were out of sight over the Earth and by a mental command Sarka managed to change slightly the course of the dozen aircars 
none	none	By passing over the curve of the Earth at a high altitude he hoped also to see from above something of the result of the strange aerial bombardment of which his father had spoken 
4110_11533_000025_000000	train-clean-360	In their flight which had been to them a flight through the glories of a super heavenly Universe they had lost all count of time 
4110_11533_000025_000001	train-clean-360	Neither Sarka nor Jaska nor yet the people in those other aircars could have told how long they had been flying when coming over the curve of the Earth at an elevation of something like three miles they were able at last to see into the area which had once housed the Gens of Dalis 
none	none	A gasp of horror escaped the lips of Sarka and of Jaska 
4110_11533_000027_000000	train-clean-360	The Gens of Dalis had occupied all the territory northward to the Pole from a line drawn east and west through the southernmost of what had once been the Hawaiian Islands 
4110_11533_000027_000001	train-clean-360	Upon this area had struck the strange blue light from the deep Cone of the Moon 
4110_11533_000028_000000	train-clean-360	Here however the light was invisible and Sarka flew on in fear that somehow his aircars would blunder into it and be destroyed for that the blue light was an agent of ghastly destruction became instantly apparent 
4110_11533_000029_000000	train-clean-360	The dwellings of the Gens of Dalis were broken and smashed into chaotic ruins 
none	none	Over all the area and even into the area of the Gens southward of that which had been Dalis the blind gods of destruction had practically made a clean sweep Sarka had opportunity to thank God that at the time the blue column had struck the Earth it had struck at the spot which had been almost emptied of people and realized that blind chance had caused it 
4110_11533_000029_000003	train-clean-360	For in order for the Gens of Dalis to be in position to launch their attack against the Moon he had managed by manipulating the speed of the Beryls to bring that area into position directly opposite the Moon 
4110_11533_000030_000000	train-clean-360	Had it been otherwise the blue column might have struck anywhere and wiped out millions of lives 
4110_11533_000031_000000	train-clean-360	 God Jaska murmured Sarka 
none	none	Look 
4110_11533_000032_000000	train-clean-360	Think of a shoreline once lined with mighty buildings after the passage of a tidal wave greater than ever before known to man 
4110_11533_000032_000001	train-clean-360	The devastation would be indescribable 
4110_11533_000032_000002	train-clean-360	Multiply that shoreline by the vast area which had housed the Gens of Dalis and the mental picture is almost too big to grasp 
4110_11533_000032_000003	train-clean-360	Chaos catastrophe approaching an infinity of destruction 
none	none	The materials of which the vast buildings set close together had been made had been twisted into grotesque nightmarish shapes and the whole fused into a burned and gleaming mass which covered half of what had once been a mighty ocean as though a bomb larger and more devastating than ever imagined of man a bomb large enough to rock the Earth had landed in the midst of the area once occupied by the Gens of Dalis 
4110_11533_000034_000000	train-clean-360	Yet Sarka knew remembering the murmuring of the blue column as it came out of the cone all this devastation had been caused in almost absolute silence 
4110_11533_000034_000001	train-clean-360	People could have watched and seen these deserted buildings slowly fuse together run together as molten metal runs together like the lava from a volcano of long ago under the ponderous moving to and fro of some invisible juggernautlike agency 
4110_11533_000035_000000	train-clean-360	Sarka shuddered trying to picture in his mind the massing of the minions of Mars who thus saw a new country given into their hands if they could take it 
4110_11533_000035_000001	train-clean-360	Had the Earth been taken by surprise 
4110_11533_000035_000002	train-clean-360	Had Sarka the Second been able to prepare for the approaching catastrophe 
4110_11533_000036_000000	train-clean-360	 Father he sent his thoughts racing on ahead of him are those lights which are striking the Earth causing any damage 
4110_11533_000037_000000	train-clean-360	 Only came back the instant answer in that they destroy the courage of the people of the Earth 
4110_11533_000037_000001	train-clean-360	The people however now know that Sarka is returning and their courage rises again 
4110_11533_000037_000002	train-clean-360	The flames are merely a hint of what faces us but the people will rise and follow you wherever you lead 
4110_11533_000038_000000	train-clean-360	So as they raced across the area of devastation the face of Sarka became calm again 
4110_11533_000038_000001	train-clean-360	On a chance he sent a single sentence of strange meaning to his father 
4110_11533_000039_000000	train-clean-360	 The ruler of the Moon is a woman called Luar which seems a contraction of Lunar 
4110_11533_000040_000000	train-clean-360	For many minutes Sarka the Second made no answer 
none	none	When it came it startled Sarka to the depths of him despite the fact that he had expected to be startled There was a woman named Lunar CHAPTER XX Sarka Commands Again Ahead through the storms which still hung tenaciously to the roof of the world flashed those dozen aircars of the Moon Now Sarka could plainly see the dome of his laboratory and from the depths of him welled up that strange glow which Earthlings recognize as the joy of returning home than which there is none save the love for a woman greater Now he could see the effect of those flares or lights from Mars which impinged on the face of the Earth though he could see no purpose in them no reason for their being since they seemed to do no damage at all though the effect of them was weird in the extreme Outer darkness rent with ripping roaring storms flurries of ice snow and sleet shot through and through by balls of lambent flames in unguessable numbers Eery lights which struck the surface of the Earth bounded away and half a mile or so from the surface again burst into flaming pin wheels like sky
4110_11535_000007_000001	train-clean-360	rockets 
none	none	of ancient times Strange lights causing weird effects but producing no damage at all save to lessen to some extent the courage of Earthlings because they did not understand these things And always down the ages man had stood most in fear of the Unknown Sarka peered off across the heavens where a ball of flame now seemed to be rising over the horizon and was amazed at the size of this planet Mars was close to Earth so close that had they possessed aircars like those of the Moon people which remained to be seen they could easily have attacked the Earth Across the face of the Earth flashed those fiery will o the wisps from Mars without rhyme or reason yet Sarka knew positively that they possessed some meaning and that the Earth had been forced thus close to Mars for a purpose What that purpose was must yet be discovered Then under the aircars the laboratory of Sarka Down dropped the aircars to a landing near the laboratory and to the cubes in the forepeak of each Sarka sent the mental command Assure yourselves that the aircars will remain where they are Muster inside the laboratory keeping well away from the Master Beryl Then to the people who had returned clothed in strange radiance from the Moon with Sarka and with Jaska he spoke Leave the cars and enter my laboratory where further orders will be given you With Jaska still by his side Sarka entered the laboratory through the Exit Dome Inside clothing was swiftly brought for the rebels for Sarka and for Jaska But even when they were clothed these people who had come back seemed to glow with an inner radiance which transfigured them Sarka the Second his face drawn and pale came from the Observatory to meet his son and the two were clasped in each other s arms for a moment Sarka the Second who had looked no older than his son seemed to have aged a dozen centuries in the time Sarka had been gone But it was not of the threatened attack by Martians that Sarka the Second spoke He made no statement He merely asked a question Was Lunar very beautiful and just a bit unearthly in appearance Sarka started Yes Beautiful Wondrously fearfully beautiful but I had the feeling that she had no heart or soul no conscience that she was somehow well bestial A moan of anguish escaped Sarka the Second Dalis again he ejaculated But much of the fault was mine Before you were born we scientists of Earth had already several times realized the necessity of expansion for the children of Earth if they were to continue Dalis proposal to my father was discarded because it involved the wholesale taking of life But after the oceans had been obliterated and the human family still outgrew its bounds Dalis came to my father and me with still another proposal It involved a strange other worldly young woman whom he called Lunar Her family well nothing was known about her for her family could not be traced Wiped out I presume in some inter family quarrel leaving her alone Dalis found her took an interest in her and the very strangeness of her gave him his idea which he brought to my father and me His proposal was somewhat like that which you made when we sent the Earth out of its orbit into outer space save that Dalis scheme involved no such program His was simply a proposal to somehow communicate with the Moon by the use of an interplanetary rocket that should carry a human passenger He put the idea up to this girl Lunar and she did not seem to care one way or another Dalis was all wrapped up in his ideas and gave the girl the name of Lunar as being symbolical of his plans for her He coached and trained her against the consummation of his plan We knew something theoretically at least about the conditions on the Moon and everything possible was done for her to make it feasible for her to exist on the Moon My error was in ever permitting the experiment to be made since if I had negatived the idea Dalis would have gone no further But I too was curious and Lunar did not care Well the rocket was constructed and shot outward into space by a series of explosions No word was ever received from Lunar though it was known that she landed on the Moon I say no word was ever received yet what you have intimated proves that Dalis has either been in mental communication with her hoping to induce her to send a force against the Earth and assist him in mastering the Earth overthrowing we Sarkas or has been biding his time against something of the thing we have now accomplished This seemed to clear up many things for Sarka though it piled higher upon his shoulders the weight of his responsibilities The other worldliness of Lunar called now Luar explained her mastery of the Gnomes and through them the cubes and her knowledge of the omnipotent qualities of the white flames of the Moon s core which might have been it came to Sarka in a flash the source of all life on the Moon in the beginning But father went on Sarka I don t see any sense in this aerial bombardment by Mars I believe said Sarka the Second sadly that before another ten hours pass we shall know the worst there is to be known but now son instead of going into attack against the Moon we go into battle against the combined forces of Mars and of the Moon Sarka now took command of the forces of the Earth Swiftly he turned to the people of the Gens of Dalis who had come back with him You will be divided into eleven equal groups as nearly as possible Father will you please arrange the division Each group will be attached to the staff of one of the Spokesman of the Gens so that each Spokesman will have the benefit of your knowledge with reference to conditions on the Moon Each group will re enter its particular aircar retaining control of the cube in each case of course and will at once repair to his proper station Telepathy is the mode of communication with the cubes and you rule them by your will Each group when assembled by my father will choose a leader before quitting this laboratory and such leader will remain in command of his group under the overlordship of the Spokesman to whom he reports with his group You understand Your loyalty is unquestioned You will consecrate your lives to the welfare of the Gens to which you are going since you no longer have a Gens of your own Sarka turned to the cubes which had formed in a line just inside the Exit Dome and issued a mental command to the cube that had piloted his aircar from the Moon The cube faded out instantly appearing immediately afterward on the table of the vari colored lights Father said Sarka while I am issuing orders to the Spokesmen please see if you can discover the secret of these cubes how they are actuated the real extent of their intelligence The rest of you with your cubes depart immediately and report to your new Gens Within ten minutes the divisions had been made and the Radiant People had entered the aircars and outside the laboratory risen free of the Earth and turned each in its proper direction for the Gens of its assignment The Sarkas and Jaska watched them go There remained but one aircar standing outside on half a dozen of those grim tentacles with two tentacles swinging free undulating to and fro like serpents Harnessed electricity actuating the tentacles cars and tentacles subservient to the cubes The aircars safely on their way Sarka stepped to the Master Beryl tuned it down to normal speed and signalled the Spokesmen of the Gens The Moon and Mars are in alliance against us and Dalis has allied himself and his Gens with the ruler of the Moon I don t know yet what form the attack will take but know this that the safety of the world of all its people rests in your hands and that the war into which we are going is potentially more vast than expected when this venture began and more devastating than the fight with the aircars of the Moon Coming to you in aircars which we managed to take from the Moon people are such of the people of the Gens of Dalis as were able to return with me Question them gather all the information you can about them and through them keep control of the cubes which pilot the aircars for in the cubes I believe lies the secret of our possible victory in the fight to come Sarka scarcely knew why he had spoken the last sentence It was as though something deep within him had risen up commanded him to speak and deeper yet far back in his consciousness was a mental picture of the devastation he had witnessed on his flight above the area that had once housed the Gens of Dalis For in that ghastly area he believed was embodied an idea greater than mere wanton destruction just as there was an idea back of the fiery lights from Mars greater than mere display Somehow the two were allied and Sarka believed that between the blue column and the fiery lights from Mars the fate of the world rested He could he believed by manipulation of the Beryls that yet remained maneuver the world away from that blue column which on the Earth was invisible But to have done so would have thwarted the very purpose for which this mad voyage had been begun The world had been started on its mad journey into space for the purpose of attacking and colonizing the Moon and Mars The Moon had been colonized by the Gens of Dalis already in potential revolt against the Earth Mars was next and by forcing the Earth into close proximity to Mars the people of the Moon had played into the hands of Earth people if the people of Earth were capable of carrying out the program of expansion originally proposed by Sarka If they were not well Sarka thought somewhat grimly the resultant cataclysmic war would at least solve the problem of over population Inasmuch as the Earth was already committed to whatever might transpire Sarka believed he should take a philosophic view of the matter Sarka turned to an examination of the Master Beryl and even as he peered into the depths of it he thought gratefully how nice it was to be home again in his own laboratory upon the world of his nativity He even found it within his heart to feel somewhat sorry for Dalis and to feel ashamed that he had even in his heart mistreated him Then he thought with a tightening of his jaw muscles of the casual way in which Dalis had destroyed Sarka the First of his forcing his people to undergo the terrors of the lake of white flames without telling them the simple secret of his betrayal of the Earth in his swift alliance with Luar or Luar herself when as Lunar a strange waif of Earth Dalis had sent her out as the first human passenger aboard a rocket to the Moon All his pity vanished though he still believed he had done right in sparing Dalis life Suddenly there came an ominous humming in the Beryl and simultaneously signals from the vari colored lights on the table Sarka whirled to the lights noting their color and mentally repeating the names of the Spokesmen who signalled him Even before he gave the signal that placed him in position to converse with them he noted the strange coincidence The Spokesmen who desired speech with him were tutelary heads of Gens whose borders touched the devasted area where Dalis had but recently been overlord An icy chill caressed his spine as he signalled the Spokesmen to speak Yes Vardee Prull Klaser Cleric The report of each of them was substantially the same though couched in different words words freighted heavily with strange terror The devasted area has suddenly broken into movement Throughout that portion of it visible from my Gens area the fused mass of debris is bubbling fermenting walking into life An aura of unearthly menace seems to flow outward from this heaving mass and the whole is assuming a most peculiar radiance cold gleaming like distant starshine Wait replied Sarka swiftly Wait until the people I have sent you have arrived Report to me instantly if the movement of the mass is noticeably augmented and especially so if it seems to be breaking up or coagulating into any sort of form whatever Then he dimmed the lights indicating that for the moment there was nothing more to be said Just then his father face very gray and very old entered the room of the Master Beryl from the laboratory Son he said The crisis is almost upon us The Martians are coming

none	none	 Cubes of Chaos Sarka raced into the Observatory wondering as he ran how the attack of the Martians would manifest itself but scarcely prepared for the brilliant display which greeted his gaze 
4110_11535_000004_000001	train-clean-360	Compared to the oncoming flames from Mars the preceding display of lights had been as nothing The whole Heavens between the Earth and Mars seemed alight with an unearthly glare as though the very heart of the sun had burst and hurled part of its flaming mass outward into space 
4110_11535_000005_000000	train-clean-360	On it came with unbelievable speed 
4110_11535_000006_000000	train-clean-360	But there was no telling yet the form of the things which were coming 
4110_11535_000007_000000	train-clean-360	 What are they whispered Jaska standing fearlessly at Sarka s side Interplanetary cars 
none	none	Rockets 
4110_11535_000007_000002	train-clean-360	Balls of fire 
4110_11535_000007_000003	train-clean-360	Or beings of Mars 
4110_11535_000008_000000	train-clean-360	 I think said Sarka after studying the display for a few minutes that they are either rockets or fireballs perhaps both together 
4110_11535_000008_000001	train-clean-360	But the Martians cannot consolidate any position on the Earth without coming to handgrips 
4110_11535_000008_000002	train-clean-360	Since they must know this we can expect to see the people of Mars themselves when or soon after those balls of fire strike the Earth 
4110_11535_000009_000000	train-clean-360	Sarka raced back to the room of the Master Beryl as a strident humming came through to him 
4110_11535_000010_000000	train-clean-360	The Spokesmen of the Gens whose borders touched those of the devasted Dalis area were reporting again and their voices were high pitched with fear that threatened to break the bounds of sanity 
4110_11535_000011_000000	train-clean-360	 The ferment in the devasted area was the gist of their report is assuming myriads of shapes 
none	none	The fused mass has broken up into isolated masses and each mass of itself is assuming one of the many forms
4110_11535_000012_000000	train-clean-360	 What forms snapped Sarka 
none	none	Quickly Cubes Thousands and millions of cubes and the cubes themselves are forming into larger cubes some square some rectangular In the midst of these formations are others mostly columnar each column consisting of cubes which have coalesced into the larger form from the same small cubes 
4110_11535_000013_000003	train-clean-360	The columnar formations are topped by globes which emit an ethereal radiance 
4110_11535_000014_000000	train-clean-360	 Listen Sarka s voice was vibrant with excitement 
4110_11535_000014_000001	train-clean-360	 Spokesmen of the Gens make sure that every individual member of your Gens is fully equipped with flying clothing including belts and ovoids prepared for an indefinite stay outside on the roof of the world 
4110_11535_000014_000002	train-clean-360	Get your people out swiftly keeping them in formation 
none	none	Keep about you those people of Dalis whom I sent you and understand before you break contact with your Beryls that instructions received from these people come from me In turn after you have quitted the hives anything you wish to say to me you can repeat to any one of the glowing people of Dalis 
4110_11535_000015_000000	train-clean-360	The contacts were broken 
4110_11535_000015_000001	train-clean-360	Sarka stared into the Beryl glancing swiftly in all directions to see whether his orders were obeyed 
none	none	Out of the myriads of hives were flying the people of all the Gens of Earth their vast numbers already darkening the roof of the world 
4110_11535_000016_000001	train-clean-360	The advance fires from Mars seemed to have no effect on them which Sarka had expected since the fires seemed to consume nothing they had touched previously 
none	none	By millions the people came forth 
4110_11535_000017_000001	train-clean-360	People dressed in the clothing of this Gens or that wearing each the insignia of the house of his Spokesman 
4110_11535_000017_000002	train-clean-360	A brave show 
none	none	Sarka could see the faces of many now in light now in shadow as the advance fires of Mars lighted them for a moment in passing then left them in shadow as the bursting balls of fire faded and died 
4110_11535_000018_000000	train-clean-360	Strange too that the fireballs made no noise 
4110_11535_000018_000001	train-clean-360	Noiseless flame which rebounded from the surface of the Earth broke in silence deluging the heavens with shooting stars of great brilliance 
4110_11535_000018_000002	train-clean-360	Through its display flew the people of the Gens mustering in flight above flight each to his own level under command of the Spokesmen of the Gens 
4110_11535_000019_000000	train-clean-360	 How long father queried Sarka should it take to empty the Gens areas 
none	none	The people of Earth have been waiting for word to go into battle since we first sent the people of Dalis against the Moon men They still are ready The dwellings of our people all of them can be emptied within an hour
4110_11535_000021_000000	train-clean-360	 I wonder mused Sarka if that is soon enough 
4110_11535_000022_000000	train-clean-360	Perhaps yes perhaps no 
4110_11535_000022_000001	train-clean-360	It would be a race in any case 
none	none	Sarka divided his attention between the rapidly changing formations of the Moon cubes in that devasted area and the onrushing charge of the fire balls from Mars All were visible to him through the Master Beryl and from the Observatory though the Martian fire balls were now so close that the vanguard of them could even be seen in the Master Beryl adjusted to view only activities on the surface of the Earth 
4110_11535_000023_000000	train-clean-360	Even as the last flights of the Gens of Earth were slipping into the icy air from the roof of the world the Moon cubes began their terrifying appalling attack every detail of which could be seen by Sarka from the Master Beryl 
none	none	Those columns composed of cubes seemed to be the leaders of a vast cube army 
4110_11535_000024_000001	train-clean-360	The top of each of them was a gleaming globe whose eery light played over the country immediately surrounding each column their weird light reflected in the squares rectangles and globes that other cubes had formed 
4110_11535_000025_000000	train-clean-360	Sarka sought swiftly among the columns for the one which might conceivably be in supreme command but even as he sought the Moon cubes moved to the attack 
4110_11535_000025_000001	train-clean-360	The globes on the tops of the columns dimmed their lights and the squares rectangles and globes got instantly into terrible motion 
4110_11535_000026_000000	train-clean-360	Southward from the position in which they had formed they began to move the squares and rectangles apparently sliding along the surface of the scarred and broken soil the globes rolling 
none	none	Southward there was the vast wall of the Gens that bordered the devasted area in that direction and the cube army was instantly at full charge toward this in what Sarka realized was to be a war of demolition 
4110_11535_000028_000000	train-clean-360	Within a minute Sarka was conscious of a trembling of all the laboratory and the eyes of Jaska were wide with fear 
none	none	Swiftly the trembling grew until sound now was added to the vast awesome tremor a vast roaring crescendo of sound that mounted and mounted as the speed of the cube army increased The vanguard of the cube army struck the dwelling of the Gens southward of that of Dalis and a mighty rocketing roar sounded in the Master Beryl was audible inside the laboratory even without the aid of the Beryl at whose surface Sarka stared as a man fascinated hypnotized 
4110_11535_000029_000000	train-clean-360	The cube army struck the dwellings disappeared into them as though they had been composed of tissue paper and continued on 
none	none	Over the tops of the cube army toppled the roofs of the dwellings there in the midst of the cubes to be ground to powder with a sound as of a million avalanches grinding together in some awesome sun size valley Southward in the wake of the chaotic charge moved a mighty gigantic crevasse whose sides were the walls of the hives left standing And still the cube army moved in grinding everything it touched to dust trampling buildings into nothingness destroying utterly along a front hundreds of miles wide and as deep as the dwellings of men
4110_11535_000030_000000	train-clean-360	 God cried Sarka his voice so tense that both his father and Jaska heard it above the roaring which shook and rocked the world 
none	none	Do you see 
4110_11535_000030_000002	train-clean-360	The Moon cubes are destroying the dwelling of our people and the Martians are to destroy the people who have fled 
4110_11535_000031_000000	train-clean-360	 There must be a way said Sarka the Second quietly to circumvent the cubes 
none	none	But what 
4110_11535_000031_000002	train-clean-360	Your will still rules the cubes which piloted you from the Moon 
4110_11535_000032_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes replied Sarka tersely but there are only a dozen of the cubes What can they do against countless millions of them 
4110_11535_000032_000001	train-clean-360	Cubes which are Moon cubes brought to the Earth in the heart of that blue column here reformed to create an army which is invincible because it cannot be slain 
none	none	It means that the Moon people themselves thousands of miles out of our reach have but to sit in comfort and watch their cube slaves destroy us 
4110_11535_000032_000003	train-clean-360	When they have laid waste the Earth the Martians have but to finish the fight 
none	none	If beloved said Jaska your will commands those twelve cubes it can also command all the others for they must be essentially the same Call on the rebels of Dalis to help you
4110_11535_000034_000000	train-clean-360	 Then what of the Spokesmen of the Gens who will be out of contact with me 
4110_11535_000035_000000	train-clean-360	 They must stand on their own feet must fight their own battle 
4110_11535_000035_000001	train-clean-360	Call to you the people who have passed through the white flames and fight with the distant will of Luar and of Dalis for control of the cube army 
4110_11535_000036_000000	train-clean-360	Again that exaltation which convinced him he could move mountains with his two hands coursed through the being of Sarka 
4110_11535_000037_000000	train-clean-360	Quietly be answered Jaska 
4110_11535_000038_000000	train-clean-360	 I believe you are right he said softly 
4110_11535_000038_000001	train-clean-360	 Those of us who have passed through the flames which bore these Moon cubes will control the cubes even bend them to our will 
4110_11535_000038_000002	train-clean-360	The Spokesmen must vanquish the Martians or perish 
4110_11535_000039_000000	train-clean-360	Then he sent his mental commands to the Spokesmen 
4110_11535_000040_000000	train-clean-360	 Meet the Martians when they arrive and destroy or drive them back 
4110_11535_000040_000001	train-clean-360	You live only if you win 
4110_11535_000040_000002	train-clean-360	We speak no more until victory is ours 
none	none	People of the Gens of Dalis go to the areas being devasted by the cubes taking your cubes and aircars with you and I will join you there And Jaska with me Sarka had not himself mentally spoken the last four words 
4110_11535_000041_000001	train-clean-360	Jaska had thought spoken them before he could prevent 
4110_11535_000041_000002	train-clean-360	He turned upon her lips shaping a command that she remain behind 
4110_11535_000041_000003	train-clean-360	But she forestalled him 
4110_11535_000042_000000	train-clean-360	 I too have been through the white flames 
none	none	You may have need of all of us CHAPTER XXII The Struggle for Mastery The people of all the Gens of Earth were now between two fires The cube army ruled by the mistress of the Moon was laying waste the dwellings of the Gens destroying them with a speed and surety of which no earthquake whatever its proportions would have been capable The Gens were forced out upon the roof of the world where scarcely had they maneuvered into their prearranged formations than the Martians struck Those huge balls of fire larger even than the aircars of the Moon landed in vast and awe inspiring numbers on the roof of the world landed easily with no apparent effort or shock The light of them made all the world a place of vast radiance save only that portion which was being destroyed by the cube army and this area had a cold chill radiance of its own By groups and organisations the fire balls of Mars landed and rested quiescent on the surface of the globe Sarka pausing only long enough in his laboratory to study this strange attack and to discover how it would get under way was at the same time preparing to go forth to take his own strange part in the defensive action of Earthlings A vast confidence was in him We will lose millions of people father he said softly But it will end in our victory in the most glorious war ever fought on this Earth That is true my son replied the older man sadly For several minutes the vast fire balls which seemed to be monster glowing octagons rested where they had landed and even then the Gens of the people were closing on them bringing their ray directors and atom disintegrators into action Then when the Earthlings would have destroyed the first of the vast fire balls and Sarka was noting that the flames which bathed the balls seemed to have no effect whatever on Earthlings save to outline them in mantles of fire the fire balls wakened to new life They opened like the halves of peaches falling apart and out upon the roof of the world poured the first Martians Earth had ever seen They were more than twice the size on the average of Earth people and at first glance seemed to resemble them very much save that their eyes of which each Martian was possessed of two were set on the ends of long tentacles which could stretch forth to a length of two feet or more from the eye sockets and thus be turned in any direction Each eye was independent of its neighbor as one could look forward while the other looked backward or one could look right while the other looked left Each Martian possessed two arms on each side of a huge powerful torso and legs that were like the bolls of trees compared to the slender limbs of Earthlings All the Martians seemed to be dressed in the skins of strange vari colored beasts Each carried in his upper right hand a slender canelike thing some three feet in length from whose tip there flashed those spurts of flame which had puzzled the Earth people before the actual launching of the attack Beyond these weapons the Martians seemed to possess no weapons of offense at all nor of defense With our ray directors and atom disintegrators said Sarka moving into the Exit Dome with Jaska we can blast them from the face of the Earth But in a moment he realized that he had spoken too hastily The nearest fire ball was of course within the area of the Gens of Cleric and Sarka could here see with his naked eyes all that transpired The Martian passengers who moved swiftly away from their fire ball vehicles then a flight of the Gens of Cleric descended upon the fireball and its fleeing passengers with tiny ray directors and atom disintegrators held to the fore ready for action The Martians at some distance from their glowing vehicle paused and formed a ragged line facing the ball staring at the descending people of the Gens of Cleric their tentaclelike eyes waving to and fro oddly like the tentacles of those aircars of the Moon The flight was hovering above the first fireball In a second now at the command of an underling the ray directors would destroy fire ball and Martians as thoroughly as though they had never existed at all But then a strange thing happened At that exact moment timing their actions to fractions of seconds the Martians raised and pointed their canelike weapons of the spurting flames They pointed them however not at the Earthlings but at the fire ball which had brought them to Earth Instantly the fire ball exploded as with the roaring of a hundred mighty volcanoes and the descending flight of the Gens of Cleric was blasted into countless fragments Bits of them flew in all directions Many dropped the mangled infinitesmal remains of them down to the roof of Earth while many were hurled skyward through formations above them while those formations to a height of a full two miles were broken asunder Many flights above that first flight were smashed and broken their individual members hurled in all directions by that one single blast of a single fire ball Individuals who escaped destruction were hurled end over end upward through other flights higher above and the whole aggregation of flights which had been concentrated on that first fire ball was instantly demoralized while full fifty per cent of its individuals were instantly torn to bits Sarka groaned to the depths of him The leader of the Martians or the master who sent them here sent them here to win For if they do not win they cannot return to Mars as they will have destroyed their vehicles Their confidence is superhuman Have faith in the courage of Earthlings son said Sarka It was much to ask for if one single one of these fire balls could wreak such havoc with the people of Earth what would be the destruction by the countless other unexploded fireballs of the Martians Still the Spokesmen themselves must discover a way to hold their own to win against the Martians For Sarka there was greater work to do He must oppose the wills of Luar and of Dalis in a mighty mental conflict which would decide whether the homes of men would be saved or utterly destroyed by the Moon cubes But as he left through the Exit Dome with Jaska by his side he shuddered and was just a little sick inside as he saw the fearful result of that first explosion of a Martian fire ball Bits of human wreckage were scattered over the Earth for a great distance in all directions from where the fire ball had exploded And at that spot a gigantic crater had been torn in the roof of the world going down to none knew what depths Even the Martians here only to consolidate positions which had passed the demolition of the Moon cubes were capable of demolitions almost as ghastly and complete as those of the cubes The sound was incapable of being described for outside the laboratory the sound of the advance of the Moon cubes eating into the dwellings of men tumbling them down grinding them to powder was cataclysmic in its mighty volume A million express trains crashing head on into walls of galvanized iron at top speed simultaneously Ear drum crashing blows as fireballs exploded The screams and shrieks of maimed and dying Earthlings of Earthlings unwounded but possessed of abysmal fear Then resolutely Sarka turned his back on the conflict between the Martians and the people of Earth and hurtled across the devastated roof of the world toward that area which was feeling the destructive force of the vandal cube army As he flew Jaska keeping pace with him in silence his mind was busy Passage through the white flames of the Moon had given him the key Those white flames source of all life on the Moon rendered almost godlike those whom it bathed gave them unbelievable access of mental brilliance were the source of that blue column which had forced the Earth outward toward Mars were the source in some way of the cubes themselves as he and Jaska after passing through them owed their now near divinity to the same white flames Those flames had made Luar mistress of the Moon therefore of the Gnomes and of the cubes Therefore Sarka having been bathed in the flames should make himself master of the cubes if he could out will the combined determinations of Luar and of Dalis His confidence was supreme as he fled through outer darkness toward the eery light which came from the area of demolitions Looking ahead he could see tiny glows in the sky which he knew to be the rebels of Dalis Gens flying to keep their rendezvous with him Higher mounted his courage and his confidence as he approached the roaring crash perpetual and always mounting which showed him where the cube army was busiest The sound vibrated the very air causing the bodies of Sarka to tingle with it causing them to flutter and shake in their flight with its awesome power But they did not hold back flew onward through the gloom leaving behind them the brightly lighted areas where Gens of Earth battled with the fireballs of the Martians moving into the area of the eery glowing of the cubes Just as he approached the spot where mighty dwellings were tumbling before the march of the cube army he sent a single command toward the cube which had piloted him from the Moon Come to me on the edge of the crevasse nearest the place of most destruction Would the cube now be subservient to his will He wondered Everything depended upon that If not then he might as well try to stay the forces of a mighty avalanche with his breath as halt the cube army with his will But strangely enough the closer he came to the vast area of tumbling dwellings the calmer he became the more sure that he would win against the cubes For when he landed at the lip of the crevasse across which he could look for a hundred miles a single cube gleamed brightly almost at his feet awaiting his orders One by one by twos threes fours dozens came the glowing people who had been bathed in the white flames of the Moon s life source and as each dropped down beside him Sarka gave a command Drop down in the midst of the cubes Make your own cube the rallying point for this vast army of cubes force the cubes to desist in their mighty destruction be subservient to your will and do you each of you be subservient to my will Away dropped the rebels glowing points of white flame dropping down the sides of the crevasse a mighty awesome canyon into the very heart of the activity of the cubes and from the brain of Sarka aided by the will of Jaska went forth a simple command Cease your march of destruction O Moon cubes and harken to the will of Sarka your master Draw back from your labors and muster not as squares rectangles and columns but as individual cubes in the area already devastated by you Rally about the glowing people who have passed through the flames which were your Moon mother and wait for orders Take no further heed of commands from Dalis and Luar Instantly it seemed to Sarka that he had drawn into some invisible vortex which tore at his brain at his body at his soul Inside him a cold voice seemed to say Fool Sarka My will is greater than yours But though the force of the will of Luar whose thought he recognized tore at him almost shriveled the soul and brain of him with its might he continued to send his thought command out to the Moon cubes forcing it through the wall of Luar s will hurling it like invisible projectiles at the cube army below Exultation possessed him buoyed him up gave him greater courage and confidence as the moments passed for even as all his being concentrated on the will command to the cubes his senses told him that the mighty sound of destruction was dying away fading out Slower now the dwellings fell slower moved the Moon cubes and as they slowed in their mighty march through the dwellings of men so increased the confidence the power of will of Sarka and his people the rebels of the Gens of Dalis Then after an hour whose mighty mental conflict had bathed Sarka in the perspiration of superhuman effort the sound of destruction ceased all together and the dwellings ceased to fall A silent shout like an inborn paean of rejoicing surged through Sarka as he noted the retreat from the dwellings of men of the Moon cubes Back and back retreated the squares and the rectangles the columns and the globes breaking apart as they retreated Within fifteen minutes after the destruction had ceased millions of gleaming cubes winked upward from the bottom of the crevasse motionless quiescent Sarka sent forth another thought I am your master O cubes of the Moon No sound no movement answered him Luar and Dalis are no longer able to command you Still no sound or movement of the cubes Then taking a deep breath as of a swimmer preparing to dive into icy water Sarka gave a new command Dissolve Reform on the roof of the world in globes Roll over the face of the Earth destroy the fire balls of Mars and take prisoners inside the globes the attackers from Mars Instantly the gleaming cubes vanished and darkness as of a mighty pit possessed the crevasse of destruction Then at the lip of the great crevasse the cubes swept into form myriads of globes which gleamed with the cold blue brilliance of the Moon They had no sooner formed as globes than they were in action again rolling over the roof of the world as with a rising crescendo of thunder tumbling down the night black sky So mighty was their rush that the roof of the world trembled and shook Above their charge raced Sarka and Jaska and with them the rebels of the Gens of Dalis All were present when the cubes crashed into the fire balls from Mars swept the Martians within themselves as prisoners held them securely and continued on destroying the fire balls in myriads Here and there fire balls exploded on contact destroying the globes which immediately reformed again as though the explosions had not been felt at all Sarka had won the allegiance of the Moon cubes which had defeated and taken prisoners the Martians destroying the vehicles in which they might have returned to Mars And as realization came darkness settled over the roof of the world the last flare of Mars faded and died This done the cubes formed in mighty rows facing the laboratory of Sarka His heart beating madly with exultation Sarka studied them Then he stepped into the Observatory gazed away across the space which separated the Earth from the Moon sent a mental message winging outward Luar Dalis Faintly fearfully came the answer We hear O Sarka Shift the blue column away from the Earth Do not interfere as we return to our orbit about the sun Obey or I combine the total knowledge of Mars the Earth and the Moon in an attack against you and your Martian ally Inform your ally that their people will not return that the Earth has need of them but that two Gens of Earth will be received by Martians in perfect amity and these Gens allowed biding places on Mars Unless your ally obeys the Martians in my hands will be destroyed In an hour the answer came the snarling thought answer of Dalis We hear We obey But Dalis is never beaten while he lives His day will come Sarka found himself feeling even a little sorry for sorely beaten Dalis but his face was grim as he sent another command to the people of Dalis who had passed through the life source of the Moon Take command of the cubes and force them to repair the damage which has been done to the dwellings of men to repair them completely over all the face of the Earth As the glowing people hurried to obey Sarka softly asked his father But what shall we do with the Martians Sarka the Second smiled Release them and send them to the lowest level where guarded by the cubes they will be set to constructing fireballs like those in which they arrived for the use of Earth if Dalis or the Martians ever attack again And son Yes O my father said Sarka softly I have another suggestion for the employment of the cubes Let them build aircars to be used by the Gens of Prull and of Klaser as transportation to Mars whenever you are ready for them to go Sarka smiled boyishly happily Yes O my father and is there anything else Yes Take Jaska as your mate Do you not see that she is waiting for you to speak Sarka turned to Jaska whose face was glorious in her surrender and whose lips were parted in a loving smile which faded only when Sarka s lips caressed it away The end ASTOUNDING STORIES Appears on Newsstands THE FIRST THURSDAY IN EACH MONTH Illustration The Readers Corner A Meeting Place for Readers of Astounding Stories From Australia Dear Editor I am taking the privilege of writing to you in an endeavor to show my appreciation of your magazine Astounding Stories Although I am an inveterate reader I must say that I have never read any book or magazine to come up to the above and confess that though I am ignorant of the intricacies of science and lacked interest in same prior to my reading your first issue same is described so plainly that I have no trouble in fully understanding exactly what the author conveys I must thank you for this other interest in the monotony of life Have pleasure of informing you that through my enthusiasm have created several subscribers and on occasions when adopting the age old custom of placing my foot upon the rail and bending the elbow have entered into many a conversation and discussion re the different stories included in your magazine I assure you of my whole hearted support in the furthering of the popularity of your enjoyable and unique work in my country and wish you every success in your venture M B Johnston two hundred thirty seven Flinders Lane Melbourne Australia Mr Neal s Favorites Dear Editor The other day I saw Astounding Stories on one of the newsstands I purchased it and after reading Brigands of the Moon I eagerly finished the rest of the magazine I did not like Out of the Dreadful Depths In my opinion it should not be in a Science Fiction magazine The only thing the matter with your magazine is that it is too small I would like to read some stories in our magazine by Ed Earl Repp David H Keller M D Miles J Brewer M D and Stanton Coblentz Francis Neal R R four Box one hundred five Kokomo Ind No Ghost Stories Dear Editor I received your April issue and I think it is the best yet I have but one complaint to make and that is your magazine seems to print some good science stories but also has some stories which do not belong in a Science Fiction magazine They might come under the name of weird tales Is your magazine devoted to pure one hundred per cent Science Fiction If so I think you ought to leave out the ghost stories Louis Wentzler nineteen thirty three Woodbine saint Brooklyn N Y From the Other Sex Dear Editor You ll be surprised to hear from a girl as I notice only boys wrote to praise your new magazine I tried reading some of the Science Fiction magazines my brother buys every month but I d start reading a story only to leave it unfinished But your magazine is different When I picked it up to read it I thought I d soon throw it down and read something else but the moment I started to read one of the stories of your new magazine I read it to the finish I never read such vivid and exciting stories Even my brother who loves all kinds of Science Fiction magazines couldn t stop praising your new magazine He said Astounding Stories beats them all Some of our readers criticized your new magazine and I haven t anything but disagreement for them Yet who am I to judge persons who have read and know all about Science Fiction Will recommend your new magazine to all my friends Sue O Bara thirteen thousand four hundred forty Barley Ave Chicago Illinois January Issue Was First Dear Editor I have just finished reading the April issue of our magazine Can mere words describe my feelings I am classing the stories as follows A excellent B very good C good D passable E poor A Monsters of Moyen Vampires of Venus The Ray of Madness The Soul Snatcher B The Man Who Was Dead C None D None E None Brigands of the Moon is getting more and more interesting Can you please tell me which month s issue was the first one as I didn t procure the first two copies and should like to do so Eli Meltzer fourteen sixty six Coney Island Ave Brooklyn N Y Eclipses All Dear Editor Just as soon as your new magazine came out I espied it It eclipsed all the other magazines on the stand As a cub magazine I couldn t ask for more I am going to comment on your stories now because I know you want me too for I know you would like to know what sort of stories your readers like I have a lot to say about Ray Cummings He is the best writer I have ever seen His stories couldn t be beat Phantoms of Reality was a corking good story but I believe his new serial Brigands of the Moon is going to be better Captain S P Meek is a very good writer also I take immense joy in his doctor Bird stories And we must not forget that great writer Murray Leinster His stories are really good I congratulate you on your new magazine mister Editor Albert Philbrick one hundred seventeen N Spring saint Springfield Ohio A Unique Magazine Dear Editor I ve been trying to write your magazine for a long time so here goes I ve bought every copy from the first issue and sure think it is a good magazine In fact I should say a unique magazine there are but few magazines in its class among Science Fiction magazines The stories come up to the standards of good Science Fiction and some go far above it A few stories I did not like were The Man Who Was Dead The Soul Snatcher The Corpse on the Grating and The Stolen Mind The science in all these stories was very poor But your magazine became better in my eyes when you published Phantoms of Reality Tanks Old Crompton s Secret Brigands of the Moon Monsters of Moyen and all of Captain S P Meek s stories These were extraordinarily good stories Wesso s drawings are very good and I hope you keep him I have seen his drawings in another magazine for quite a time I don t like the illustrations of your other artist Could you by chance secure an artist by the name of Leo Morey or Hugh Mackay They both illustrate for other Science Fiction magazines and are about as good as Wesso Please keep the latter And why don t you have him to do all of your illustrating Sorry to seem such a grouch but I don t like your grade of paper either And why not enlarge the magazine to about eleven x nine by one two and charge twenty five cents for your thoroughly good magazine apart from the defects I have mentioned About your authors They are for the most part good But they are mostly amateurs at writing Science Fiction stories I am delighted to see such expert writers of Science Fiction as Harl Vincent Ray Cummings Victor Rousseau and Captain S P Meek writing for your magazine but couldn t you include in your staff of authors A Hyatt Verrill doctor Miles J Breuer doctor David H Keller R F Starzl and a few more such notable authors I hope to see these authors in your magazine soon Linus Hogenmiller five hundred two N Washington saint Farmington Mo The Star System Dear Editor One star means fairly good two stars good three stars excellent four extraordinary no stars just another story I give Brigands of the Moon by Ray Cummings three stars The Atom Smasher by Victor Rousseau three stars Murder Madness by Murray Leinster two stars Into the Ocean Depths by S P Wright two stars and The Jovian Jest by L Lorraine no stars It was short and sweet Wesso sure can draw I would like to see a full page illustration for each story by him My favorite type of stories are interplanetary and second favorite stories of future wars Will you have many of them in the future I like long stories like the novelette in the May issue of Astounding Stories Jack Darrow four thousand two hundred twenty five N Spaulding Ave Chicago Illinois We Expect Not To Dear Editor While going over your The Readers Corner of the April issue I noticed in your answer to one of the letters that you will avoid reprints Now many of your readers have not read the older classics of Science Fiction Would it not be a good idea to publish a reprint at least once a year One of the suggestions given was Merritt s Through the Dragon Glass Another very interesting story and one that I am sure almost all of your followers have not read is The Blind Spot by Homer Flint I like the idea of having three members to a volume as it will be much easier to bind Now starting with the April issue I think that the best story in there is Monsters of Moyen The Ray of Madness was up to the usual standard of captain S P Meek s stories The Man Who Was Dead was fairly good average I would say I did not like Vampires of Venus I say that the May issue was the best of the Astounding Stories I was satisfied with every story in it Into the Ocean Depths was the best story The Atom Smasher being a close second I like the way the story Into the Ocean Depths ended a slight trace of sadness and not at all like the and they lived happily ever after ending A real story I was disappointed in not finding any story concerning doctor Bird in the April issue Will any more be printed soon Before I close I would like a definite answer to this question Will you ever or in the near future reprint any of the genre of Science Fiction stories by the late master Garret P Serviss or from the pen of A Merritt and H G Wells Nathan Greenfeld three hundred thirteen E seventieth saint New York City Again Reprints Dear Editor Although I am a reader of six Science Fiction magazines I was more than glad to see the latest one out Astounding Stories Because the stories are all interesting I consider Astounding Stories superior to most of the Science Fiction periodicals on the newsstands to day My favorite stories are those of interplanetary voyages and other worlds My favorite authors are Ray Cummings A Merritt Victor Rousseau Murray Leinster Arthur J Burks and Harl Vincent I hope that you will soon have stories by Edmond Hamilton and David H Keller Now here is something I hope you will give some thought and consideration I noticed that many of the readers wrote in requesting reprints I am one of those who would like to see you publish some reprints especially stories by Edgar Rice Burroughs A Merritt and Ray Cummings These authors have written many masterpieces of Science Fiction It is very difficult if not impossible for a person to get these stories They could be made available easily if Astounding Stories would reprint them Most of the readers who object to reprints do so because they would hate to see a story by H G Wells or Jules Verne I myself do not like these authors as they are too dull But if you have only reprints by the three authors I mentioned and a few other popular writers I am sure all the readers would welcome them At least you could have a vote and see how they stand on reprints Michael Fogaris one hundred fifty seven Fourth saint Passaic N J Likes The Readers Corner Dear Editor Your The Readers Corner interests me very much It surely does show how your magazine pleases its readers You cannot get too much science in your stories to suit me Chemistry and physics more than anything else I surely enjoyed reading Mad Music and The Thief of Time I don t like long stories They are too interesting to have to wait a month for the next part I hope that your magazine continues to have as astounding stories as it has in the past Vern L Enrich R F D one Casey Illinois From Master Weiner Dear Editor One day coming home from school I saw your magazine That night I bought it and have since been an ardent reader But why not give us a change I prefer stories of the Sargasso Sea the Maelstrom and about invasions of the Earth Milton Weiner age twelve twenty four thirty Baker saint Baltimore Maryland High Praise Dear Editor Enclosed you will find twenty cents in stamps for the first copy of Astounding Stories I have just finished the May issue of Astounding Stories and the rating of the stories is one Brigands of the Moon Excellent two The Atom Smasher Marvelous three Murder Madness Perfect four Into the Ocean s Depths Good five The Jovian Jest Pretty Good The cover design by H Wesso is good Don t lose him I would like more stories by Victor Rousseau and Ray Cummings Where are some stories by H G Wells Stanton Coblens Gawain Edwards Francis Flagg Henrik Jarve and doctor Keller My favorite stories are interplanetary stories Here are some things that may improve your magazine though I must say that your magazine is about perfect as it is More pictures in long stories about two novelettes in each issue about two short stories in each issue more interplanetary novels and novelettes about one serial in one issue smoother paper Isidore Horowitz eleven sixty one Stratford Avenue New York City Fairly Good Satire Dear Editor I have read your two issues of Astounding Stories and I feel they will fill a very much needed place in literature I am especially interested in the stories like the Vampires of Venus and the Brigands of the Moon The Vampires of Venus can be classed as a fairly good satire on Earth beings I consider that story one with a moral It reminds one of Voltaire s Micromegas and it s taking us to another planet to show us our faults at home will stimulate interest in social improvement I have kept tab on Edgar Rice Burroughs writings because he teaches evolution in a way that makes it easy for the ordinary reader to grasp You have a great field if you can keep up the interplanetary stories and mix some evolutionary stories with them The true stories are playing a valuable part in stimulating people to take a deeper view of life and you have a field in Astounding Stories almost without a competitor J L Stark five hundred thirty Sutcliffe Ave Louisville Kentucky He is H W Wessolowski Dear Editor Since I have read every copy of Astounding Stories since it was inaugurated I feel well qualified to contribute a few bouquets and also some criticism The cover illustrations are wonderful but I cannot find the artist s name on it So good an artist should put his moniker on his productions I am glad to see that the words Super Science are on the top of the cover in bright red letters some other Science Fiction magazines seem desirous of disguising the contents of their magazines for some obscure and mysterious reason And now a brickbat It is my humble opinion that the science should be examined more carefully before the stories are printed in this excellent magazine The stories should be not only astounding but should contain some science information that will be remembered after the fiction is forgotten The Man Who Was Dead is an excellent ghost story or weird tale but is out of place in our magazine I take the liberty to call it our magazine since a department is given over to the readers and we express our choice of the kind of stories that are printed However taken all together our magazine is steadily improving each issue up to now has been distinctly better than the one before I have graded the stories in the April and May copies as follows Excellent Vampires of Venus The Ray of Madness Brigands of the Moon Murder Madness Into the Ocean s Depths and The Jovian Jest Good Monsters of Moyen The Atom Smasher and The Soul Searcher Poor The Man Who Was Dead My favorite authors are doctor David H Keller Harl Vincent Lillith Lorraine Anthony Pelcher captain S P Meek doctor Miles J Breuer and Ray Cummings I can hardly wait a month for my next copy Wayne D Bray Campbell Missouri Story Says Cro Magnons Fled to Europe Dear Editor Ever since I was first introduced to Astounding Stories by a cousin I have been a steady reader I have not missed a single issue so far I hope you will have stories by Hyatt Verril Edgar Rice Burroughs Edmond Hamilton Leslie Stone Stanton A Coblentz and Francis Flagg The stories I like best in each issue not counting serials are Phantoms of Reality Spawn of the Stars Vandals of the Stars Vampires of Venus and The Atom Smasher In The Atom Smasher it says that all Europeans descended from the Atlanteans Now when the hero killed them all with the disintegrating ray would he not have affected their birth Wesso is some artist I saw a mistake on the cover of the March issue The color of space is a deep black not blue because the blue color of the heavens when viewed from the earth is due to the reflection of light by the atmosphere George Brande one hundred
