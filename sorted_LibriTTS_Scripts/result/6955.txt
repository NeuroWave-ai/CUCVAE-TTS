none	none	where he is Which brings us back said Marvin to mysterious Mervo Let us reason inductively If you get to the place by taking a boat from Marseilles it can t be far from the French coast I should say at a venture that Mervo is an island in the Mediterranean And a small island for if it had been a big one we should have heard of it Marvin cried Elsa her face beaming with proud affection How clever you are A mere gift he said modestly I have been like that from a boy He got up from his chair Isn t there an encyclopaedia in the library Elsa Yes but it s an old edition It will probably touch on Mervo I ll go and fetch it As he crossed the terrace Elsa turned quickly to Betty Well she said Betty smiled at her He s a dear Are you very happy Elsa Elsa s eyes danced She drew in her breath softly Betty looked at her in silence for a moment The wistful expression was back on her face Elsa she said suddenly What is it like How does it feel knowing that there s someone who is fonder of you than anything Elsa closed her eyes It s like eating berries and cream in a new dress by moonlight on a summer night while somebody plays the violin far away in the distance so that you can just hear it she said Her eyes opened again And it s like coming along on a winter evening and seeing the windows lit up and knowing you ve reached home Betty was clenching her hands and breathing quickly And it s like Elsa don t I can t bear it Betty What s the matter Betty smiled again but painfully It s stupid of me I m just jealous that s all I haven t got a Marvin you see You have Well there are plenty who would like to be your Marvin Betty s face grew cold There are plenty who would like to be Benjamin Scobell s son in law she said Betty Elsa s voice was serious We ve been friends for a good long time so you ll let me say something won t you I think you re getting just the least bit hard Now turn and rend me she added good humoredly I m not going to rend you said Betty You re perfectly right I am getting hard How can I help it Do you know how many men have asked me to marry them since I saw you last Five Betty And not one of them cared the slightest bit about me But Betty dear that s just what I mean Why should you say that How can you know How do I know Well I do know Instinct I suppose The instinct of self preservation which nature gives hunted animals I can t think of a single man in the world except your Marvin of course who wouldn t do anything for money She stopped Well yes one Elsa leaned forward eagerly Who Betty You don t know him But what s his name Betty hesitated Well if I am on the witness stand Maude Maude I thought you said a man It s his name John Maude But Betty Why didn t you tell me before This is tremendously interesting Betty laughed shortly Not so very really I only met him two or three times and I haven t seen him for years and I don t suppose I shall ever see him again He was a friend of Alice Beecher s brother who was at Harvard Alice took me over to meet her brother and mister Maude was there That s all Elsa was plainly disappointed But how do you know then What makes you think that he Instinct again I suppose I do know And you ve never met him since Betty shook her head Elsa relapsed into silence She had a sense of pathos At the further end of the terrace Marvin Rossiter appeared carrying a large volume Here we are he said Scared it up at the first attempt Now then He sat down and opened the book You don t want to hear all about how Jason went there in search of the Golden Fleece and how Ulysses is supposed to have taken it in on his round trip You want something more modern Well it s an island in the Mediterranean as I said and I m surprised that you ve never heard of it Elsa because it s celebrated in its way It s the smallest independent state in the world Smaller than Monaco even Here are some facts Its population when this encyclopaedia was printed there may be more now was eleven thousand and sixteen It was ruled over up to eighteen eighty six by a prince But in that year the populace appear to have said to themselves When in the course of human events Anyway they fired the prince and the place is now a republic So that s where you re going Miss Silver I don t know if it s any consolation to you but the island according to this gentleman is celebrated for the unspoilt beauty of its scenery He also gives a list of the fish that can be caught there It takes up about three lines But what can my stepfather be doing there I last heard of him in London Well I suppose I shall have to go I suppose you will said Elsa mournfully But oh Betty what a shame CHAPTER II MERVO AND ITS OWNER By heck cried mister Benjamin Scobell He wheeled round from the window and transferred his gaze from the view to his sister Marion losing by the action for the view was a joy to the eye which his sister Marion was not Mervo was looking its best under the hot morning sun mister Scobell s villa stood near the summit of the only hill the island possessed and from the window of the morning room where he had just finished breakfast he had an uninterrupted view of valley town and harbor a two mile riot of green gold and white and beyond the white the blue satin of the Mediterranean mister Scobell did not read poetry except that which advertised certain breakfast foods in which he was interested or he might have been reminded of the Island of Flowers in Tennyson s Voyage of Maeldive Violets pinks crocuses yellow and purple mesembryanthemum lavender myrtle and rosemary his two mile view contained them all The hillside below him was all aglow with the yellow fire of the mimosa But his was not one of those emotional natures to which the meanest flower that blows can give thoughts that do often lie too deep for tears A primrose by the river s brim a simple primrose was to him or not so much a simple primrose perhaps as a basis for a possible Primrosina the Soap that Really Cleans You He was a nasty little man to hold despotic sway over such a Paradise a goblin in Fairyland Somewhat below the middle height he was lean of body and vulturine of face He had a greedy mouth a hooked nose liquid green eyes and a sallow complexion He was rarely seen without a half smoked cigar between his lips This at intervals he would relight only to allow it to go out again and when after numerous fresh starts it had dwindled beyond the limits of convenience he would substitute another from the reserve supply that protruded from his vest pocket How Benjamin Scobell had discovered the existence of Mervo is not known It lay well outside the sphere of the ordinary financier But mister Scobell took a pride in the versatility of his finance It distinguished him from the uninspired who were content to concentrate themselves on steel wheat and such like things It was mister Scobell s way to consider nothing as lying outside his sphere In a financial sense he might have taken Terence s Nihil humanum alienum as his motto He was interested in innumerable enterprises great and small He was the power behind a company which was endeavoring without much success to extract gold from the mountains of North Wales and another which was trying without any success at all to do the same by sea water He owned a model farm in Indiana and a weekly paper in New York He had financed patent medicines patent foods patent corks patent corkscrews patent devices of all kinds some profitable some the reverse Also outside the ordinary gains of finance he had expectations He was the only male relative of his aunt the celebrated missus Jane Oakley who lived in a cottage on Staten Island and was reputed to spend five hundred dollars a year some said less out of her snug income of eighteen million She was an unusual old lady in many ways and unfortunately unusually full of deep rooted prejudices The fear lest he might inadvertently fall foul of these rarely ceased to haunt mister Scobell This man of many projects had descended upon Mervo like a stone on the surface of some quiet pool bubbling over with modern enterprise in general and in particular with a scheme Before his arrival Mervo had been an island of dreams and slow movement and putting things off till to morrow The only really energetic thing it had ever done in its whole history had been to expel his late highness Prince Charles and change itself into a republic And even that had been done with the minimum of fuss The Prince was away at the time Indeed he had been away for nearly three years the pleasures of Paris London and Vienna appealing to him more keenly than life among his subjects Mervo having thought the matter over during these years decided that it had no further use for Prince Charles Quite quietly with none of that vulgar brawling which its neighbor France had found necessary in similar circumstances it had struck his name off the pay roll and declared itself a republic The royalist party headed by General Poineau had been distracted but impotent The army one hundred and fifteen strong had gone solid for the new regime and that had settled it Mervo had then gone to sleep again It was asleep when mister Scobell found it The financier s scheme was first revealed to M d Orby the President of the Republic a large stout statesman with even more than the average Mervian instinct for slumber He was asleep in a chair on the porch of his villa when mister Scobell paid his call and it was not until the financier s secretary who attended the seance in the capacity of interpreter had rocked him vigorously from side to side for quite a minute that he displayed any signs of animation beyond a snore like the growling of distant thunder When at length he opened his eyes he perceived the nightmare like form of mister Scobell standing before him talking The financier impatient of delay had begun to talk some moments before the great awakening Sir mister Scobell was saying I gotta proposition to which I d like you to give your complete attention Shake him some more Crump Sir there s big money in it for all of us if you and your crowd ll sit in Money Lar monnay No that means change What s money Crump Arjong There s arjong in it Squire Get that Oh shucks Hand it to him in French Crump mister Secretary Crump translated The President blinked and intimated that he would hear more mister Scobell relighted his cigar stump and proceeded Say you ve heard of Moosieer Blonk Ask the old skeesicks if he s ever heard of Mersyaw Blonk Crump the feller who started the gaming tables at Monte Carlo Filtered through mister Crump the question became intelligible to the President He said he had heard of M Blanc mister Crump caught the reply and sent it on to mister Scobell as the man on first base catches the ball and throws it to second mister Scobell relighted his cigar Well I m in that line I m going to put this island on the map just like old Doctor Blonk put Monte Carlo I ve been studying up all about the old man and I know just what he did and how he did it Monte Carlo was just such another jerkwater little place as this is before he hit it The government was down to its last bean and wondering where the Heck its next meal ticket was coming from when in blows mister Man tucks up his shirt sleeves and starts the tables And after that the place never looked back You and your crowd gotta get together and pass a vote to give me a gambling concession here same as they did him Scobell s my name Hand him that Crump mister Crump obliged once more A gleam of intelligence came into the President s dull eye He nodded once or twice He talked volubly in French to mister Crump who responded in the same tongue The idea seems to strike him sir said mister Crump It ought to if he isn t a clam replied mister Scobell He started to relight his cigar but after scorching the tip of his nose bowed to the inevitable and threw the relic away

none	none	he said having bitten the end off the next in order I ve thought this thing out from soup to nuts There s heaps of room for another Monte Carlo Monte s a dandy place but it s not perfect by a long way To start with it s hilly You have to take the elevator to get to the Casino and when you ve gotten to the end of your roll and want to soak your pearl pin where s the hock shop Half a mile away up the side of a mountain It ain t right In my Casino there s going to be a resident pawnbroker inside the building just off the main entrance That s only one of a heap of improvements Another is that my Casino s scheduled to be a home from home a place you can be real cosy in You ll look around you and the only thing you ll miss will be mother s face Yes sir there s no need for a gambling Casino to look and feel and smell like the reading room at the British Museum Comfort coziness and convenience That s the ticket I m running on Slip that to the old gink Crump A further outburst of the French language from mister Crump supplemented on the part of the old gink by gesticulations interrupted the proceedings What s he saying now asked mister Scobell He wants to know Don t tell Let me guess He wants to know what sort of a rake off he and the other somnambulists will get the darned old pirate Is that it mister Crump said that that was just it That ll be all right said mister Scobell Old man Blong s offer to the Prince of Monaco was five hundred thousand francs a year that s somewhere around a hundred thousand dollars in real money and half the profits made by the Casino That s my offer too See how that hits him Crump mister Crump investigated He says he accepts gladly on behalf of the Republic sir he announced M d Orby confirmed the statement by rising dodging the cigar and kissing mister Scobell on both cheeks Cut it out said the financier austerely breaking out of the clinch We ll take the Apache Dance as read Good by Squire Glad it s settled Now I can get busy He did Workmen poured into Mervo and in a very short time dominating the town and reducing to insignificance the palace of the late Prince once a passably imposing mansion there rose beside the harbor a mammoth Casino of shining stone Imposing as was the exterior it was on the interior that mister Scobell more particularly prided himself and not without reason Certainly a man with money to lose could lose it here under the most charming conditions It had been mister Scobell s object to avoid the cheerless grandeur of the rival institution down the coast Instead of one large hall sprinkled with tables each table had a room to itself separated from its neighbor by sound proof folding doors And as the building progressed mister Scobell s active mind had soared above the original idea of domestic coziness to far greater heights of ingenuity Each of the rooms was furnished and arranged in a different style The note of individuality extended even to the croupiers Thus a man with money at his command could wander from the Dutch room where in the picturesque surroundings of a Dutch kitchen croupiers in the costume of Holland ministered to his needs to the Japanese room where his coin would be raked in by quite passable imitations of the Samurai If he had any left at this point he was free to dispose of it under the auspices of near Hindoos in the Indian room of merry Swiss peasants in the Swiss room or in other appropriately furnished apartments of red shirted Bret Harte miners fur clad Esquimaux or languorous Spaniards He could then if a man of spirit who did not know when he was beaten collect the family jewels and proceed down the main hall accompanied by the strains of an excellent band to the office of a gentlemanly pawnbroker who spoke seven languages like a native and was prepared to advance money on reasonable security in all of them It was a colossal venture but it suffered from the defect from which most big things suffer it moved slowly That it also moved steadily was to some extent a consolation to mister Scobell Undoubtedly it would progress quicker and quicker as time went on until at length the Casino became a permanent gold mine But at present it was being conducted at a loss It was inevitable but it irked mister Scobell He paced the island and brooded His mind dwelt incessantly on the problem Ideas for promoting the prosperity of his nursling came to him at all hours at meals in the night watches when he was shaving walking washing reading brushing his hair And now one had come to him as he stood looking at the view from the window of his morning room listening absently to his sister Marion as she read stray items of interest from the columns of the New York Herald and had caused him to utter the exclamation recorded at the beginning of the chapter By Heck he said Read that again Marion I gottan idea Miss Scobell deep in her paper paid no attention Few people would have taken her for the sister of the financier She was his exact opposite in almost every way He was small jerky and aggressive she tall deliberate and negative She was one of those women whom nature seems to have produced with the object of attaching them to some man in a peculiar position of independent dependence and who defy the imagination to picture them in any other condition whatsoever One could not see Miss Scobell doing anything but pour out her brother s coffee darn his socks and sit placidly by while he talked Yet it would have been untrue to describe her as dependent upon him She had a detached mind Though her whole life had been devoted to his comfort and though she admired him intensely she never appeared to give his conversation any real attention She listened to him much as she would have listened to a barking Pomeranian Marion cried mister Scobell A five legged rabbit has been born in Carbondale Southern Illinois she announced mister Scobell cursed the five legged rabbit Never mind about your rabbits I want to hear that piece you read before The one about the Prince of Monaco Will you listen Marion The Prince of Monaco dear Yes He has caught another fish or something of that sort I think Yes A fish with telescope eyes the paper says And very convenient too I should imagine mister Scobell thumped the table I ve got it I ve found out what s the matter with this darned place I see why the Casino hasn t struck its gait I think it must be the croupiers dear I m sure I never heard of croupiers in fancy costume before It doesn t seem right I m sure people don t like those nasty Hindoos I am quite nervous myself when I go into the Indian room They look at me so oddly Nonsense That s the whole idea of the place that it should be different People are sick and tired of having their money gathered in by seedy looking Dagoes in second hand morning coats We give em variety It s not the Casino that s wrong it s the darned island What s the use of a republic to a place like this I m not saying that you don t want a republic for a live country that s got its way to make in the world but for a little runt of a sawn off hobo one night stand like this you gotta have something picturesque something that ll advertise the place something that ll give a jolt to folks curiosity and make em talk There s this Monaco gook He snoops around in his yacht digging up telescope eyed fish and people talk about it Another darned fish they say That s the steenth bite the Prince of Monaco has had this year It s like a soap advertisement It works by suggestion They get to thinking about the Prince and his pop eyed fishes and first thing they know they ve packed their grips and come along to Monaco to have a peek at him And when they re there it s a safe bet they aren t going back again without trying to get a mess of easy money from the Bank That s what this place wants Whoever heard of this blamed Republic doing anything except eat and sleep They used to have a prince here way back in eighty something Well I m going to have him working at the old stand again right away Miss Scobell looked up from her paper which she had been reading with absorbed interest throughout tins harangue Dear she said enquiringly I say I m going to have him back again said mister Scobell a little damped I wish you would listen I think you re quite right dear Who The Prince Do listen Marion The Prince of this island His Highness the Prince of Mervo I m going to send for him and put him on the throne again You can t dear He s dead I know he s dead You can t faze me on the history of this place He died in ninety one But before he died he married an American girl and there s a son who s in America now living with his uncle It s the son I m going to send for I got it all from General Poineau He s a royalist He ll be tickled to pieces when Johnny comes marching home again Old man Poineau told me all about it The Prince married a girl called Westley and then he was killed in an automobile accident and his widow went back to America with the kid to live with her brother Poineau says he could lay his hand on him any time he pleased I hope you won t do anything rash dear said his sister comfortably I m sure we don t want any horrid revolution here with people shooting and stabbing each other Revolution cried mister Scobell Revolution Well I should say nix Revolution nothing I m the man with the big stick in Mervo Pretty near every adult on this island is dependent on my Casino for his weekly envelope and what I say goes without argument I want a prince so I gotta have a prince and if any gazook makes a noise like a man with a grouch he ll find himself fired Miss Scobell turned to her paper again Very well dear she said Just as you please I m sure you know best Sure said her brother You re a good guesser I ll go and beat up old man Poineau right away CHAPTER III JOHN Ten days after mister Scobell s visit to General Poineau John Prince of Mervo ignorant of the greatness so soon to be thrust upon him was strolling thoughtfully along one of the main thoroughfares of that outpost of civilization Jersey City He was a big young man tall and large of limb His shoulders especially were of the massive type expressly designed by nature for driving wide gaps in the opposing line on the gridiron He looked like one of nature s center rushes and had indeed played in that position for Harvard during two strenuous seasons His face wore an expression of invincible good humor He had a wide good natured mouth and a pair of friendly gray eyes One felt that he liked his follow men and would be surprised and pained if they did not like him As he passed along the street he looked a little anxious Sherlock Holmes and possibly even Doctor Watson would have deduced that he had something on his conscience At the entrance to a large office building he paused and seemed to hesitate Then as if he had made up his mind to face an ordeal he went in and pressed the button of the elevator Leaving the elevator at the third floor he went down the passage and pushed open a door on which was inscribed the legend Westley Martin company A stout youth walking across the office with his hands full of papers stopped in astonishment Hello John Maude he cried The young man grinned Say where have you been The old man s been as mad as a hornet since he found you had quit without leave He was asking for you just now I guess I m up against it admitted John cheerfully Where did you go yesterday John put the thing to him candidly as man to man See here Spiller suppose you got up one day and found it was a perfectly bully morning and remembered that the Giants were playing the Athletics and looked at your mail and saw that someone had sent you a pass for the game Were you at the ball game You ve got the nerve Didn t you know there would be trouble Old man said John frankly I could no more have turned down that pass Oh well what s the use It was just great I suppose I d better tackle the boss now It s got to be done It was not a task to which many would have looked forward Most of those who came into contact with Andrew Westley were afraid of him He was a capable rather than a lovable man and too self controlled to be quite human There was no recoil in him no reaction after anger as there would have been in a hotter tempered man He thought before he acted but when he acted never yielded a step John in all the years of their connection had never been able to make anything of him At first he had been prepared to like him as he liked nearly everybody But mister Westley had discouraged all advances and as time went by his nephew had come to look on him as something apart from the rest of the world one of those things which no fellow could understand On mister Westley s side there was something to be said in extenuation of his attitude John reminded him of his father and he had hated the late Prince of Mervo with a cold hatred that had for a time been the ruling passion of his life He had loved his sister and her married life had been one long torture to him a torture rendered keener by the fact that he was powerless to protect either her happiness or her money Her money was her own to use as she pleased and the use which pleased her most was to give it to her husband who could always find a way of spending it As to her happiness that was equally out of his control It was bound up in her Prince who unfortunately was a bad custodian for it At last an automobile accident put an end to His Highness s hectic career and incidentally to that of a blonde lady from the Folies Bergeres and the Princess had returned to her brother s home where a year later she died leaving him in charge of her infant son mister Westley s desire from the first had been to eliminate as far as possible all memory of the late Prince He gave John his sister s name Maude and brought him up as an American in total ignorance of his father s identity During all the years they had spent together he had never mentioned the Prince s name He disliked John intensely He fed him clothed him sent him to college and gave him a place in his office but he never for a moment relaxed his bleakness of front toward him John was not unlike his father in appearance though built on a larger scale and as time went on little mannerisms too began to show themselves that reminded mister Westley of the dead man and killed any beginnings of affection John for his part had the philosophy which goes with perfect health He fitted his uncle into the scheme of things or rather set him outside them as an irreconcilable element and went on his way enjoying life in his own good humored fashion It was only lately since he had joined the firm that he had been conscious of any great strain College had given him a glimpse of a larger life and the office cramped him He felt vaguely that there were bigger things in the world which he might be doing His best friends of whom he now saw little were all men of adventure and enterprise who had tried their hand at many things men like Jimmy Pitt who had done nearly everything that could be done before coming into an unexpected half million men like Rupert Smith who had been at Harvard with him and was now a reporter on the News men like Baker Faraday Williams he could name half a dozen all men who were doing something who were out on the firing line He was not a man who worried He had not that temperament But sometimes he would wonder in rather a vague way whether he was not allowing life to slip by him a little too placidly An occasional yearning for something larger would attack him There seemed to be something in him that made for inaction His soul was sleepy If he had been told of the identity of his father it is possible that he might have understood The Princes of Mervo had never taken readily to action and enterprise For generations back if they had varied at all son from father it had been in the color of hair or eyes not in character a weak shiftless procession with nothing to distinguish them from the common run of men except good looks and a talent for wasting money John was the first of the line who had in him the seeds of better things The Westley blood and the bracing nature of his education had done much to counteract the Mervo strain He did not know it but the American in him was winning The desire for action was growing steadily every day It had been Mervo that had sent him to the polo grounds on the previous day That impulse had been purely Mervian No prince of that island had ever resisted a temptation But it was America that was sending him now to meet his uncle with a quiet unconcern as to the outcome of the interview The spirit of adventure was in him It was more than possible that mister Westley would sink the uncle in the employer and dismiss him as summarily as he would have dismissed any other clerk in similar circumstances If so he was prepared to welcome dismissal Other men fought an unsheltered fight with the world so why not he He moved towards the door of the inner office with a certain exhilaration As he approached it flew open disclosing mister Westley himself a tall thin man at the sight of whom Spiller shot into his seat like a rabbit John went to meet him Ah said mister Westley come in here I want to speak to you John followed him into the room Sit down said his uncle John waited while he dictated a letter Neither spoke till the stenographer had left the room John met the girl s eye as she passed There was a compassionate look in it John was popular with his fellow employes His absence had been the cause of discussion and speculation among them and the general verdict had been that there would be troublous times for him on the morrow When the door closed mister Westley leaned back in his chair and regarded his nephew steadily from under a pair of bushy gray eyebrows which lent a sort of hypnotic keenness to his gaze You were at the ball game yesterday he said The unexpectedness of the question startled John into a sharp laugh Yes he said recovering himself Without leave It didn t seem worth while asking for leave You mean that you relied so implicitly on our relationship to save you from the consequences No I meant Well we need not try and discover what you may have meant What claim do you put forward for special consideration Why should I treat you differently from any other member of the staff John had a feeling that the interview was being taken at too rapid a pace He felt confused I don t want you to treat me differently he said mister Westley did not reply John saw that he had taken a check book from its pigeonhole I think we understand each other said mister Westley There is no need for any discussion I am writing you a check for ten thousand dollars Ten thousand dollars It happens to be your own It was left to me in trust for you by your mother By a miracle your father did not happen to spend it John caught the bitter note which the other could not keep out of his voice and made one last attempt to probe this mystery As a boy he had tried more than once before he realized that this was a forbidden topic Who was my father he said mister Westley blotted the check carefully Quite the worst blackguard I ever had the misfortune to know he replied in an even tone Will you kindly give me a receipt for this Then I need not detain you You may return to the ball game without any further delay Possibly he went on you may wonder why you have not received this money before I persuaded your mother to let me use my discretion in choosing the time when it should be handed over to you I decided to wait until in my opinion you had sense enough to use it properly I do not think that time has arrived I do not think it will ever arrive But as we are parting company and shall I hope never meet again you had better have it now John signed the receipt in silence Thank you said mister Westley Good by At the door John hesitated He had looked forward to this moment as one of excitement and adventure but now that it had come it had left him in anything but an uplifted mood He was naturally warm hearted and his uncle s cold anger hurt him It was so different from anything sudden so essentially not of the moment He felt instinctively that it had been smoldering for a long time and realized with a shock that his uncle had not been merely indifferent to him all these years but had actually hated him It was as if he had caught a glimpse of something ugly He felt that this was the last scene of some long drawn out tragedy Something made him turn impulsively back towards the desk Uncle he cried He stopped The hopelessness of attempting any step towards a better understanding overwhelmed him mister Westley had begun to write He must have seen John s movement but he continued to write as if he were alone in the room John turned to the door again Good by he said mister Westley did not look up CHAPTER IV VIVE LE ROI When an hour later John landed in New York from the ferry his mood had changed The sun and the breeze had done their work He looked on life once more with a cheerful and optimistic eye His first act on landing was to proceed to the office of the News and enquire for Rupert Smith He felt that he had urgent need of a few minutes conversation with him Now that the painter had been definitely cut that bound him to the safe and conventional and he had set out on his own account to lead the life adventurous he was conscious of an absurd diffidence New York looked different to him It made him feel positively shy A pressing need for a friendly native in this strange land manifested itself Smith would have ideas and advice to bestow he was notoriously prolific of both and in this crisis both were highly necessary Smith however was not at the office He had gone out John was informed earlier in the morning to cover a threatened strike somewhere down on the East Side John did not go in search of him The chance of finding him in that maze of mean streets was remote He decided to go uptown select a hotel and lunch To the need for lunch he attributed a certain sinking sensation of which he was becoming more and more aware and which bore much too close a resemblance to dismay to be pleasant The poet s statement that the man who s square his chances always are best no circumstance can shoot a scare into the contents of his vest is only true within limits The squarest men deposited suddenly in New York and faced with the prospect of earning his living there is likely to quail for a moment New York is not like other cities London greets the stranger with a sleepy grunt Paris giggles New York howls A gladiator waiting in the center of the arena while the Colosseum officials fumbled with the bolts of the door behind which paced the noisy tiger he was to fight must have had some of the emotions which John experienced during his first hour as a masterless man in Gotham A surface car carried him up Broadway At Times Square the Astor Hotel loomed up on the left It looked a pretty good hotel to John He dismounted Half an hour later he decided that he was acclimated He had secured a base of operations in the shape of a room on the seventh floor his check was safely deposited in the hotel bank and he was half way through a lunch which had caused him already to look on New York not only as the finest city in the world but also on the whole as the one city of all others in which a young man might make a fortune with the maximum of speed and the minimum of effort After lunch having telegraphed his address to his uncle in case of mail he took the latter s excellent advice and went to the polo grounds Returning in time to dress he dined at the hotel after which he visited a near by theater and completed a pleasant and strenuous day at one of those friendly restaurants where the music is continuous and the waiters are apt to burst into song in the intervals of their other duties A second attempt to find Smith next morning failed as the first had done The staff of the News were out of bed and at work ridiculously early and when John called up the office between eleven and twelve o clock nature s breakfast hour Smith was again down East observing the movements of those who were about to strike or who had already struck It hardly seemed worth while starting to lay the bed plates of his fortune till he had consulted the expert What would Rockefeller have done He would John felt certain have gone to the ball game He imitated the great financier It was while he was smoking a cigar after dinner that night musing on the fortunes of the day s game and in particular on the almost criminal imbecility of the umpire that he was dreamily aware that he was being paged A small boy in uniform was meandering through the room chanting his name Gent wants five minutes wit you announced the boy intercepted Hasn t got no card Business he says This disposed of the idea that Rupert Smith had discovered his retreat John was puzzled He could not think of another person in New York who knew of his presence at the Astor But it was the unknown that he was in search of and he decided to see the mysterious stranger Send him along he said The boy disappeared and presently John observed him threading his way back among the tables followed by a young man of extraordinary gravity of countenance who was looking about him with an intent gaze through a pair of gold rimmed spectacles John got up to meet him My name is Maude he said Won t you sit down Have you had dinner Thank you yes said the spectacled young man You ll have a cigar and coffee then Thank you yes The young man remained silent until the waiter had filled his cup My name is Crump he said I am mister Benjamin Scobell s private secretary Yes said John Snug job The other seemed to miss something in his voice You have heard of mister Scobell he asked Not to my knowledge said John Ah you have lost touch very much with Mervo of course John stared Mervo It sounded like some patent medicine I have been instructed said mister Crump solemnly to inform Your Highness that the Republic has been dissolved and that your subjects offer you the throne of your ancestors John leaned back in his chair and looked at the speaker in dumb amazement The thought flashed across him that mister Crump had been perfectly correct in saying that he had dined His attitude appeared to astound mister Crump He goggled through his spectacles at John who was reminded of some rare fish You are John Maude You said you were I m John Maude right enough We re solid on that point And your mother was the only sister of mister Andrew Westley You re right there too Then there is no mistake I say the Republic He paused as if struck with an idea Don t you know he said Your father John became suddenly interested If you ve got anything to tell me about my father go right ahead You ll be the only man I ve ever met who has said a word about him Who the deuce was he anyway mister Crump s face cleared I understand I had not expected this You have been kept in ignorance Your father mister Maude was the late Prince Charles of Mervo It was not easy to astonish John but this announcement did so He dropped his cigar in a shower of gray ash on to his trousers and retrieved it almost mechanically his wide open eyes fixed on the other s face What he cried mister Crump nodded gravely You are Prince John of Mervo and I am here he got into his stride as he reached the familiar phrase to inform Your Highness that the Republic has been dissolved and that your subjects offer you the throne of your ancestors A horrid doubt seized John You re stringing me One of those Indians at the News Rupert Smith or someone has put you up to this mister Crump appeared wounded If Your Highness would glance at these documents This is a copy of the register of the church in which your mother and father were married John glanced at the document It was perfectly lucid Then then it s true he said Perfectly true Your Highness And I am here to inform But where the deuce is Mervo I never heard of the place It is an island principality in the Mediterranean Your High For goodness sake old man don t keep calling me Your Highness It may be fun to you but it makes me feel a perfect ass Let me get into the thing gradually mister Crump felt in his pocket mister Scobell he said producing a roll of bills entrusted me with money to defray any expenses More than any words this spectacle removed any lingering doubt which John might have had as to the possibility of this being some intricate practical joke Are these for me he said mister Crump passed them across to him There are a thousand dollars here he said I am also instructed to say that you are at liberty to draw further against mister Scobell s account at the Wall Street office of the European and Asiatic Bank The name Scobell had been recurring like a leit motif in mister Crump s conversation This suddenly came home to John Before we go any further he said let s get one thing clear Who is this mister Scobell How does he get mixed up in this He is the proprietor of the Casino at Mervo He seems to be one of those generous open handed fellows Nothing of the tight wad about him He is deeply interested in Your High in your return John laid the roll of bills beside his coffee cup and relighted his cigar That s mighty good of him he said It strikes me old man that I am not absolutely up to date as regards the internal affairs of this important little kingdom of mine How would it be if you were to put me next to one or two facts Start at the beginning and go right on When mister Crump had finished a condensed history of Mervo and Mervian politics John smoked in silence for some minutes Life Crump he said at last is certainly speeding up as far as I am concerned Up till now nothing in particular has ever happened to me A couple of days ago I lost my job was given ten thousand dollars that I didn t know existed and now you tell me I m a prince Well well These are stirring times When do we start for the old homestead mister Scobell was exceedingly anxious that we should return by Saturday s boat Saturday What to morrow Perhaps it is too soon You will not be able to settle your affairs I guess I can settle my affairs all right I ve only got to pack a grip and tip the bell hops And as Scobell seems to be financing this show perhaps it s up to me to step lively if he wants it But it s a pity I was just beginning to like this place There is generally something doing along the White Way after twilight Crump The gravity of mister Scobell s secretary broke up unexpectedly into a slow wide smile His eyes behind their glasses gleamed with a wistful light Gee he murmured John looked at him amazed Crump he cried Crump I believe you re a sport mister Crump seemed completely to have forgotten his responsible position as secretary to a millionaire and special messenger to a prince He smirked I d have liked a day or two in the old burg he said softly I haven t been to Rector s since Ponto was a pup John reached across the table and seized the secretary s hand Crump he said you are a sport This is no time for delay If we are to liven up this great city we must get busy right away Grab your hat and come along One doesn t become a prince every day The occasion wants celebrating Are you with me Crump old scout Sure thing said the envoy ecstatically At eight o clock on the following morning two young men hatless and a little rumpled but obviously cheerful entered the Astor Hotel demanding breakfast A bell boy who met them was addressed by the larger of the two and asked his name Desmond Ryan he replied The young man patted him on his shoulder I appoint you Desmond Ryan he said Grand Hereditary Bell Hop to the Court of Mervo Thus did Prince John formally enter into his kingdom CHAPTER V mister SCOBELL HAS ANOTHER IDEA Owing to collaboration between Fate and mister Scobell John s state entry into Mervo was an interesting blend between a pageant and a vaudeville sketch The pageant idea was mister Scobell s Fate supplied the vaudeville The reception at the quay when the little steamer that plied between Marseilles and the island principality gave up its precious freight was not on quite so impressive a scale as might have been given to the monarch of a more powerful kingdom but John was not disappointed During the voyage from New York in the intervals of seasickness for he was a poor sailor mister Crump had supplied him with certain facts about Mervo one of which was that its adult population numbered just under thirteen thousand and this had prepared him for any shortcomings in the way of popular demonstration As a matter of fact mister Scobell was exceedingly pleased with the scale of the reception which to his mind amounted practically to pomp The Palace Guard forty strong lined the quay Besides these there were four officers a band and sixteen mounted carbineers The rest of the army was dotted along the streets In addition to the military there was a gathering of a hundred and fifty civilians mainly drawn from fishing circles The majority of these remained stolidly silent throughout but three more emotional cheered vigorously as a young man was seen to step on to the gangway carrying a grip and make for the shore General Poineau a white haired warrior with a fierce mustache strode forward and saluted The Palace Guards presented arms The band struck up the Mervian national anthem General Poineau lowering his hand put on a pair of pince nez and began to unroll an address of welcome It was then seen that the young man was mister Crump General Poineau removed his glasses and gave an impatient twirl to his mustache mister Scobell who for possibly the first time in his career was not smoking though as was afterward made manifest he had the materials on his person bustled to the front Where s his nibs Crump he enquired The secretary s reply was swept away in a flood of melody To the band mister Crump s face was strange They had no reason to suppose that he was not Prince John and they acted accordingly With a rattle of drums they burst once more into their spirited rendering of the national anthem mister Scobell sawed the air with his arms but was powerless to dam the flood His Highness is shaving sir bawled mister Crump depositing his grip on the quay and making a trumpet of his hands Shaving Yes sir I told him he ought to come along but His Highness said he wasn t going to land looking like a tramp comedian By this time General Poineau had explained matters to the band and they checked the national anthem abruptly in the middle of a bar with the exception of the cornet player who continued gallantly by himself till a feeling of loneliness brought the truth home to him An awkward stage wait followed which lasted until John was seen crossing the deck when there were more cheers and General Poineau resuming his pince nez brought out the address of welcome again At this point mister Scobell made his presence felt Glad to meet you Prince he said coming forward Scobell s my name Shake hands with General Poineau No that s wrong I guess he kisses your hand don t he I ll swing on him if he does said John cheerfully mister Scobell eyed him doubtfully His Highness did not appear to him to be treating the inaugural ceremony with that reserved dignity which we like to see in princes on these occasions mister Scobell was a business man He wanted his money s worth His idea of a Prince of Mervo was something statuesquely aloof something he could not express it exactly on the lines of the illustrations in the Zenda stories in the magazines about eight feet high and shinily magnificent something that would give the place a tone That was what he had had in his mind when he sent for John He did not want a cheerful young man in a soft hat and a flannel suit who looked as if at any moment he might burst into a college yell General Poineau meanwhile had embarked on the address of welcome John regarded him thoughtfully I can see he said to mister Scobell that the gentleman is making a good speech but what is he saying That is what gets past me He is welcoming Your Highness said mister Crump the linguist in the name of the people of Mervo Who I notice have had the bully good sense to stay in bed I guess they knew that the Boy Orator would do all that was necessary He hasn t said anything about a bite of breakfast has he Has his address happened to work around to the subject of shredded wheat and shirred eggs yet That s the part that s going to make a hit with me There ll be breakfast at my villa Your Highness said mister Scobell My automobile is waiting along there The General reached his peroration worked his way through it and finished with a military clash of heels and a salute The band rattled off the national anthem once more Now what said John turning to mister Scobell Breakfast I guess you d better say a few words to them Your Highness they ll expect it But I can t speak the language and they can t understand English The thing ll be a stand off Crump will hand it to em Here Crump Sir Line up and shoot His Highness s remarks into em Yes sir It s all very well for you Crump said John You probably enjoy this sort of thing I don t I haven t felt such a fool since I sang The Maiden s Prayer on Tremont Street when I was joining the frat Are you ready No it s no good I don t know what to say Tell em you re tickled to death advised mister Scobell anxiously John smiled in a friendly manner at the populace Then he coughed Gentlemen he said and more particularly the sport on my left who has just spoken his piece whose name I can t remember I thank you for the warm welcome you have given me If it is any satisfaction to you to know that it has made me feel like thirty cents you may have that satisfaction Thirty is a liberal estimate His Highness is overwhelmed by your loyal welcome He thanks you warmly translated mister Crump tactfully I feel that we shall get along nicely together continued John If you are chumps enough to turn out of your comfortable beds at this time of the morning simply to see me you can t be very hard to please We shall hit it off fine Mr Crump His Highness hopes and believes that he will always continue to command the affection of his people I John paused That s the lot he said The flow of inspiration has ceased The magic fire has gone out Break it to em Crump For me breakfast During the early portion of the ride mister Scobell was silent and thoughtful John s speech had impressed him neither as oratory nor as an index to his frame of mind He had not interrupted him because he knew that none of those present could understand what was being said and that mister Crump was to be relied on as an editor But he had not enjoyed it He did not take the people of Mervo seriously himself but in the Prince such an attitude struck him as unbecoming Then he cheered up After all John had given evidence of having a certain amount of what he would have called get up in him For the purposes for which he needed him a tendency to make light of things was not amiss It was essentially as a performing prince that he had engaged John He wanted him to do unusual things which would make people talk aeroplaning was one that occurred to him Perhaps a prince who took a serious view of his position would try to raise the people s minds and start reforms and generally be a nuisance John could at any rate be relied upon not to do that His face cleared Have a good cigar Prince he said cordially inserting two fingers in his vest pocket Sure Mike said His Highness affably Breakfast over mister Scobell replaced the remains of his cigar between his lips and turned to business Eh Prince he said Yes I want you Prince said mister Scobell to help boom this place That s where you come in Sure said John As to ruling and all that continued mister Scobell there isn t any to do The place runs itself Some guy gave it a shove a thousand years ago and it s been rolling along ever since What I want you to do is the picturesque stunts Get a yacht and catch rare fishes Whoop it up Entertain swell guys when they come here Have a Court see what I mean same as over in England Go around in aeroplanes and that style of thing Don t worry about money That ll be all right You draw your steady hundred thousand a year and a good chunk more besides when we begin to get a move on so the dough proposition doesn t need to scare you any Do I by George said John It seems to me that I ve fallen into a pretty soft thing here There ll be a joker in the deck somewhere I guess There always is in these good things But I don t see it yet You can count me in all right Good boy said mister Scobell And now you ll be wanting to get to the Palace I ll have them bring the automobile round The council of state broke up Having seen John off in the car the financier proceeded to his sister s sitting room Miss Scobell had breakfasted apart that morning by request her brother giving her to understand that matters of state unsuited to the ear of a third party must be discussed at the meal She was reading her New York Herald Well said mister Scobell he s come Yes dear And just the sort I want Saw the idea of the thing right away and is ready to go the limit No nonsense about him Is he nice looking Bennie Sure All these Mervo princes have been good lookers I hear and this one must be near the top of the list You ll like him Marion All the girls will be crazy about him in a week Miss Scobell turned a page Is he married Her brother started Married I never thought of that But no I guess he s not He d have mentioned it He s not the sort to hush up a thing like that I He stopped short His green eyes gleamed excitedly Marion he cried Marion Well dear Listen Gee this thing is going to be the biggest ever I gotta new idea It just came to me Your saying that put it into my head Do you know what I m going to do I m going to cable over to Betty to come right along here and I m going to have her marry this prince guy Yes sir For once Miss Scobell showed signs that her brother s conversation really interested her She laid down her paper and stared at him Betty Sure Betty Why not She s a pretty girl Clever too The Prince ll be lucky to get such a wife for all his darned ancestors away back to the flood But suppose Betty does not like him Like him She s gotta like him Say can t you make your mind soar or won t you Can t you see that a thing like this has gotta be fixed different from a marriage between between a ribbon counter clerk and the girl who takes the money at a twenty five cent hash restaurant in Flatbush This is a royal alliance Do you suppose that when a European princess is introduced to the prince she s going to marry they let her say Nothing doing I don t like the shape of his nose He gave a spirited imitation of a European princess objecting to the shape of her selected husband s nose It isn t very romantic Bennie sighed Miss Scobell She was a confirmed reader of the more sentimental class of fiction and this business like treatment of love s young dream jarred upon her It s founding a dynasty Isn t that romantic enough for you You make me tired Marion Miss Scobell sighed again Very well dear I suppose you know best But perhaps the Prince won t like Betty mister Scobell gave a snort of disgust Marion he said you ve got a mind like a chunk of wet dough Can t you understand that the Prince is just as much in my employment as the man who scrubs the Casino steps I m hiring him to be Prince of Mervo and his first job as Prince of Mervo will be to marry Betty I d like to see him kick He began to pace the room By Heck it s going to make this place boom to beat the band It ll be the biggest kind of advertisement Restoration of Royalty at Mervo That ll make them take notice by itself Then biff right on top of that Royal Romance Prince Weds American Girl Love at First Sight Picturesque Wedding Gee we ll wipe Monte Carlo clean off the map We ll have em licked to a splinter We It s the greatest scheme on earth I have no doubt you are right Bennie said Miss Scobell but her voice became dreamy again it s not very romantic Oh shucks said the schemer impatiently Here where s a cable form CHAPTER VI YOUNG ADAM CUPID On a red sandstone rock at the edge of the water where the island curved sharply out into the sea Prince John of Mervo sat and brooded on first causes For nearly an hour and a half he had been engaged in an earnest attempt to trace to its source the acute fit of depression which had come apparently from nowhere to poison his existence that morning It was his seventh day on the island and he could remember every incident of his brief reign The only thing that eluded him was the recollection of the exact point when the shadow of discontent had begun to spread itself over his mind Looking back it seemed to him that he had done nothing during that week but enjoy each new aspect of his position as it was introduced to his notice Yet here he was sitting on a lonely rock consumed with an unquenchable restlessness a kind of trapped sensation Exactly when and exactly how Fate that king of gold brick men had cheated him he could not say but he knew with a certainty that defied argument that there had been sharp practise and that in an unguarded moment he had been induced to part with something of infinite value in exchange for a gilded fraud The mystery baffled him He sent his mind back to the first definite entry of Mervo into the foreground of his life He had come up from his stateroom on to the deck of the little steamer and there in the pearl gray of the morning was the island gradually taking definite shape as the pink mists shredded away before the rays of the rising sun As the ship rounded the point where the lighthouse still flashed a needless warning from its cluster of jagged rocks he had had his first view of the town nestling at the foot of the hill gleaming white against the green with the gold domed Casino towering in its midst In all Southern Europe there was no view to match it for quiet beauty For all his thews and sinews there was poetry in John and the sight had stirred him like wine It was not then that depression had begun nor was it during the reception at the quay The days that had followed had been peaceful and amusing He could not detect in any one of them a sign of the approaching shadow They had been lazy days His duties had been much more simple than he had anticipated He had not known before he tried it that it was possible to be a prince with so small an expenditure of mental energy As mister Scobell had hinted to all intents and purposes he was a mere ornament His work began at eleven in the morning and finished as a rule at about a quarter after At the hour named a report of the happenings of the previous day was brought to him When he had read it the state asked no more of him until the next morning The report was made up of such items as A fisherman named Lesieur called Carbineer Ferrier a fool in the market place at eleven minutes after two this afternoon he has not been arrested but is being watched and generally gave John a few minutes of mild enjoyment Certainly he could not recollect that it had ever depressed him No it had been something else that had worked the mischief and in another moment the thing stood revealed beyond all question of doubt What had unsettled him was that unexpected meeting with Betty Silver last night at the Casino He had been sitting at the Dutch table He generally visited the Casino after dinner The light and movement of the place interested him As a rule he merely strolled through the rooms watching the play but last night he had slipped into a vacant seat He had only just settled himself when he was aware of a girl standing beside him He got up Would you care he had begun and then he saw her face It had all happened in an instant Some chord in him numbed till then had begun to throb It was as if he had awakened from a dream or returned to consciousness after being stunned There was something in the sight of her standing there so cool and neat and composed so typically American a sort of goddess of America in the heat and stir of the Casino that struck him like a blow How long was it since he had seen her last Not more than a couple of years It seemed centuries It all came back to him It was during his last winter at Harvard that they had met A college friend of hers had been the sister of a college friend of his They had met several times but he could not recollect having taken any particular notice of her then beyond recognizing that she was certainly pretty The world had been full of pretty American girls then But now He looked at her And as he looked he heard America calling to him Mervo by the appeal of its novelty had caused him to forget But now quite suddenly he knew that he was homesick and it astonished him the readiness with which he had permitted mister Crump to lead him away into bondage It seemed incredible that he had not foreseen what must happen Love comes to some gently imperceptibly creeping in as the tide through unsuspected creeks and inlets creeps on a sleeping man until he wakes to find himself surrounded But to others it comes as a wave breaking on them beating them down whirling them away It was so with John In that instant when their eyes met the miracle must have happened It seemed to him as he recalled the scene now that he had loved her before he had had time to frame his first remark It amazed him that he could ever have been blind to the fact that he loved her she was so obviously the only girl in the world You you don t remember me he stammered She was flushing a little under his stare but her eyes were shining I remember you very well mister Maude she said with a smile I thought I knew your shoulders before you turned round What are you doing here I There was a hush The croupier had set the ball rolling A wizened little man and two ladies of determined aspect were looking up disapprovingly John realized that he was the only person in the room not silent It was impossible to tell her the story of the change in his fortunes in the middle of this crowd He stopped and the moment passed The ball dropped with a rattle The tension relaxed Won t you take this seat said John No thank you I m not playing I only just stopped to look on My aunt is in one of the rooms and I want to make her come home I m tired Have you He caught the eye of the wizened man and stopped again Have you been in Mervo long he said as the ball fell I only arrived this morning It seems lovely I must explore to morrow She was beginning to move off Er John coughed to remove what seemed to him a deposit of sawdust and unshelled nuts in his throat Er may I will you let me show you prolonged struggle with the nuts and sawdust then rapidly some of the places to morrow He had hardly spoken the words when it was borne in upon him that he was a vulgar pushing bounder presuming on a dead and buried acquaintanceship to force his company on a girl who naturally did not want it and who would now proceed to snub him as he deserved He quailed Though he had not had time to collect and examine and label his feelings he was sufficiently in touch with them to know that a snub from her would be the most terrible thing that could possibly happen to him She did not snub him Indeed if he had been in a state of mind coherent enough to allow him to observe he might have detected in her eyes and her voice signs of pleasure I should like it very much she said John made his big effort He attacked the nuts and sawdust which had come back and settled down again in company with a large lump of some unidentified material as if he were bucking center They broke before him as long ago the Yale line had done and his voice rang out as if through a megaphone to the unconcealed disgust of the neighboring gamesters If you go along the path at the foot of the hill he bellowed rapidly and follow it down to the sea you get a little bay full of red sandstone rocks you can t miss it and there s a fine view of the island from there I d like awfully well to show that to you It s great She nodded Then shall we meet there she said When John was in no mood to postpone the event As early as ever you like he roared At about ten then Good night mister Maude John had reached the bay at half past eight and had been on guard there ever since It was now past ten but still there were no signs of Betty His depression increased He told himself that she had forgotten Then that she had remembered but had changed her mind Then that she had never meant to come at all He could not decide which of the three theories was the most distressing His mood became morbidly introspective He was weighed down by a sense of his own unworthiness He submitted himself to a thorough examination and the conclusion to which he came was that as an aspirant to the regard of a girl like Betty he did not score a single point No wonder she had ignored the appointment A cold sweat broke out on him This was the snub She had not administered it in the Casino simply in order that by being delayed its force might be the more overwhelming He looked at his watch again and the world grew black It was twelve minutes after ten John in his time had thought and read a good deal about love Ever since he had grown up he had wanted to fall in love He had imagined love as a perpetual exhilaration something that flooded life with a golden glow as if by the pressing of a button or the pulling of a switch and automatically removed from it everything mean and hard and uncomfortable a something that made a man feel grand and god like looking down benevolently of course on his fellow men as from some lofty mountain That it should make him feel a worm like humility had not entered his calculations He was beginning to see something of the possibilities of love His tentative excursions into the unknown emotion while at college had never really deceived him even at the time a sort of second self had looked on and sneered at the poor imitation This was different This had nothing to do with moonlight and soft music It was raw and hard It hurt It was a thing sharp and jagged tearing at the roots of his soul He turned his head and looked up the path for the hundredth time and this time he sprang to his feet Between the pines on the hillside his eye had caught the flutter of a white dress CHAPTER VII mister SCOBELL IS FRANK Much may happen in these rapid times in the course of an hour and a half While John was keeping his vigil on the sandstone rock Betty was having an interview with mister Scobell which was to produce far reaching results and which incidentally was to leave her angrier and more at war with the whole of her world than she could remember to have been in the entire course of her life The interview began shortly after breakfast in a gentle and tactful manner with Aunt Marion at the helm But mister Scobell was not the man to stand by silently while persons were being tactful At the end of the second minute he had plunged through his sister s mild monologue like a rhinoceros through a cobweb and had stated definitely with an economy of words the exact part which Betty was to play in Mervian affairs You say you want to know why you were cabled for I ll tell you There s no use talking for half a day before you get to the point I guess you ve heard that there s a prince here instead of a republic now Well that s where you come in Do you mean she hesitated Yes I do said mister Scobell There was a touch of doggedness in his voice He was not going to stand any nonsense by Heck but there was no doubt that Betty s wide open eyes were not very easy to meet He went on rapidly Cut out any fool notions about romance Miss Scobell who was knitting a sock checked her needles for a moment in order to sigh Her brother eyed her morosely then resumed his remarks This is a matter of state That s it You gotta cut out fool notions and act for good of state You gotta look at it in the proper spirit Great honor see what I mean Princess and all that Chance of a lifetime dynasty you gotta look at it that way Miss Scobell heaved another sigh and dropped a stitch For the love of Mike said her brother irritably don t snort like that Marion Very well dear Betty had not taken her eyes off him from his first word An unbiased observer would have said that she made a pretty picture standing there in her white dress but in the matter of pictures still life was evidently what mister Scobell preferred for his gaze never wandered from the cigar stump which he had removed from his mouth in order to knock off the ash Betty continued to regard him steadfastly The shock of his words had to some extent numbed her At this moment she was merely thinking quite dispassionately what a singularly nasty little man he looked and wondering not for the first time what strange quality invisible to everybody else it had been in him that had made her mother his adoring slave during the whole of their married life Then her mind began to work actively once more She was a Western girl and an insistence on freedom was the first article in her creed A great rush of anger filled her that this man should set himself up to dictate to her Do you mean that you want me to marry this Prince she said That s right I won t do anything of the sort Pshaw Don t be foolish You make me tired Betty s eye shone mutinously Her cheeks were flushed and her slim boyish figure quivered Her chin always determined became a silent Declaration of Independence I won t she said Aunt Marion suspending operations on the sock went on with tact at the point where her brother s interruption had forced her to leave off I m sure he s a very nice young man I have not seen him but everybody says so You like him Bennie don t you Sure I like him He s a corker Wait till you see him Betty Nobody s asking you to marry him before lunch You ll have plenty of time to get acquainted It beats me what you re kicking at You give me a pain in the neck Be reasonable Betty sought for arguments to clinch her refusal It s ridiculous she said You talk as if you had just to wave your hand Why should your prince want to marry a girl he has never seen He will said mister Scobell confidently How do you know Because I know he s a sensible young skeesicks That s how See here Betty you ve gotten hold of wrong ideas about this place You don t understand the position of affairs Your aunt didn t till I put her wise He bit my head off my dear murmured Miss Scobell knitting placidly You re thinking that Mervo is an ordinary state and that the Prince is one of those independent all wool off with his darned head rulers like you read about in the best sellers Well you ve got another guess coming If you want to know who s the big noise here it s me me This Prince guy is my hired man See Who sent for him I did Who put him on the throne I did Who pays him his salary I do from the profits of the Casino Now do you understand He knows his job He knows which side his bread s buttered When I tell him about this marriage do you know what he ll say He ll say Thank you sir That s how things are in this island Betty shuddered Her face was white with humiliation She half raised her hands with an impulsive movement to hide it I won t I won t I won t she gasped mister Scobell was pacing the room in an ecstasy of triumphant rhetoric There s another thing he said swinging round suddenly and causing his sister to drop another stitch Maybe you think he s some kind of a Dago this guy Maybe that s what s biting you Let me tell you that he s an American pretty near as much an American as you are yourself Betty stared at him An American Don t believe it eh Well let me tell you that his mother was born and raised in Jersey and that he has lived all his life in the States He s no little runt of a Dago No sir He s a Harvard man six foot high and weighs two hundred pounds That s the sort of man he is I guess that s not American enough for you maybe No You do shout so Bennie murmured Miss Scobell I m sure there s no need Betty uttered a cry Something had told her who he was this Harvard man who had sold himself That species of sixth sense which lies undeveloped at the back of our minds during the ordinary happenings of life wakes sometimes in moments of keen emotion At its highest it is prophecy at its lowest a vague presentiment It woke in Betty now There was no particular reason why she should have connected her stepfather s words with John The term he had used was an elastic one Among the visitors to the island there were probably several Harvard men But somehow she knew Who is he she cried What was his name before he when he His name said mister Scobell John Maude Maude was his mother s name She was a Miss Westley Here where are you going Betty was walking slowly toward the door Something in her face checked mister Scobell I want to think she said quietly I m going out In days of old in the age of legend omens warned heroes of impending doom But to day the gods have grown weary and we rush unsuspecting on our fate No owl hooted no thunder rolled from the blue sky as John went up the path to meet the white dress that gleamed between the trees His heart was singing within him She had come She had not forgotten or changed her mind or willfully abandoned him His mood lightened swiftly Humility vanished He was not such an outcast after all He was someone He was the man Betty Silver had come to meet But with the sight of her face came reaction Her face was pale and cold and hard She did not speak or smile As she drew near she looked at him and there was that in her look which set a chill wind blowing through the world and cast a veil across the sun And in this bleak world they stood silent and motionless while eons rolled by Betty was the first to speak I m late she said John searched in his brain for words and came empty away He shook his head dumbly Shall we sit down said Betty John indicated silently the sandstone rock on which he had been communing with himself They sat down A sense of being preposterously and indecently big obsessed John There seemed no end to him Wherever he looked there were hands and feet and legs He was a vast blot on the face of the earth He glanced out of the corner of his eye at Betty She was gazing out to sea He dived into his brain again It was absurd There must be something to say And then he realized that a worse thing had befallen He had no voice It had gone He knew that try he never so hard to speak he would not be able to utter a word A nightmare feeling of unreality came upon him Had he ever spoken Had he ever done anything but sit dumbly on that rock looking at those sea gulls out in the water He shot another swift glance at Betty and a thrill went through him There were tears in her eyes The next moment the action was almost automatic his left hand was clasping her right and he was moving along the rock to her side She snatched her hand away His brain ransacked for the third time yielded a single word Betty She got up quickly In the confused state of his mind John found it necessary if he were to speak at all to say the essential thing in the shortest possible way Polished periods are not for the man who is feeling deeply He blurted out huskily I love you and finding that this was all that he could say was silent Even to himself the words as he spoke them sounded bald and meaningless To Betty shaken by her encounter with mister Scobell they sounded artificial as if he were forcing himself to repeat a lesson They jarred upon her Don t she said sharply Oh don t Her voice stabbed him It could not have stirred him more if she had uttered a cry of physical pain Don t I know I ve been told Been told She went on quickly I know all about it My stepfather has just told me He said he said you were his she choked his hired man that he paid you to stay here and advertise the Casino Oh it s too horrible That it should be you You who have been you can t understand what you have been to me ever since we met you couldn t understand I can t tell you a sort of help something something that I can t put it into words Only it used to help me just to think of you It was almost impersonal I didn t mind if I never saw you again I didn t expect ever to see you again It was just being able to think of you It helped you were something I could trust Something strong solid She laughed bitterly I suppose I made a hero of you Girls are fools But it helped me to feel that there was one man alive who who put his honor above money She broke off John stood motionless staring at the ground For the first time in his easy going life he knew shame Even now he had not grasped to the full the purport of her words The scales were falling from his eyes but as yet he saw but dimly She began to speak again in a low monotonous voice almost as if she were talking to herself She was looking past him at the gulls that swooped and skimmed above the glittering water I m so tired of money money money Everything s money Isn t there a man in the world who won t sell himself I thought that you I suppose I m stupid It s business I suppose One expects too much She looked at him wearily Good by she said I m going He did not move She turned and went slowly up the path Still he made no movement A spell seemed to be on him His eyes never left her as she passed into the shadow of the trees For a moment her white dress stood out clearly She had stopped With his whole soul he prayed that she would look back But she moved on once more and was gone And suddenly a strange weakness came upon John He trembled The hillside flickered before his eyes for an instant and he clutched at the sandstone rock to steady himself Then his brain cleared and he found himself thinking swiftly He could not let her go like this He must overtake her He must stop her He must speak to her He must say he did not know what it was that he would say anything so that he spoke to her again He raced up the path calling her name No answer came to his cries Above him lay the hillside dozing in the noonday sun below the Mediterranean sleek and blue without a ripple He stood alone in a land of silence and sleep CHAPTER VIII AN ULTIMATUM FROM THE THRONE At half past twelve that morning business took mister Benjamin Scobell to the royal Palace He was not a man who believed in letting the grass grow under his feet He prided himself on his briskness of attack Every now and then mister Crump searching the newspapers would discover and hand to him a paragraph alluding to his hustling methods When this happened he would preserve the clipping and carry it about in his vest pocket with his cigars till time and friction wore it away He liked to think of himself as swift and sudden the Human Thunderbolt In this matter of the royal alliance it was his intention to have at it and clear it up at once Having put his views clearly before Betty he now proposed to lay them with equal clarity before the Prince There was no sense in putting the thing off The sooner all parties concerned understood the position of affairs the sooner the business would be settled That Betty had not received his information with joy did not distress him He had a poor opinion of the feminine intelligence Girls got their minds full of nonsense from reading novels and seeing plays like Betty Betty objected to those who were wiser than herself providing a perfectly good prince for her to marry Some fool notion of romance of course Not that he was angry He did not blame her any more than the surgeon blames a patient for the possession of an unsuitable appendix There was no animus in the matter Her mind was suffering from foolish ideas and he was the surgeon whose task it was to operate upon it That was all One had to expect foolishness in women It was their nature The only thing to do was to tie a rope to them and let them run around till they were tired of it then pull them in He saw his way to managing Betty Nor did he anticipate trouble with John He had taken an estimate of John s character and it did not seem to him likely that it contained unsuspected depths He set John down as he had told Betty as a young man acute enough to know when he had a good job and sufficiently sensible to make concessions in order to retain it Betty after the manner of woman might make a fuss before yielding to the inevitable but from level headed John he looked for placid acquiescence His mood as the automobile whirred its way down the hill toward the town was sunny He looked on life benevolently and found it good The view appealed to him more than it had managed to do on other days As a rule he was the man of blood and iron who had no time for admiring scenery but to day he vouchsafed it a not unkindly glance It was certainly a dandy little place this island of his A vineyard on the right caught his eye He made a mental note to uproot it and run up a hotel in its place Further down the hill he selected a site for a villa where the mimosa blazed and another where at present there were a number of utterly useless violets A certain practical element was apt perhaps to color mister Scobell s half hours with nature The sight of the steamboat leaving the harbor on its journey to Marseilles gave him another idea Now that Mervo was a going concern a real live proposition it was high time that it should have an adequate service of boats The present system of one a day was absurd He made a note to look into the matter These people wanted waking up Arriving at the Palace he was informed that His Highness had gone out shortly after breakfast and had not returned The majordomo gave the information with a tinkle of disapproval in his voice Before taking up his duties at Mervo he had held a similar position in the household of a German prince where rigid ceremonial obtained and John s cheerful disregard of the formalities frankly shocked him To take the present case for instance When His Highness of Swartzheim had felt inclined to enjoy the air of a morning it had been a domestic event full of stir and pomp He had not merely crammed a soft hat over his eyes and strolled out with his hands in his pockets but without a word to his household staff as to where he was going or when he might be expected to return mister Scobell received the news equably and directed his chauffeur to return to the villa He could not have done better for on his arrival he was met with the information that His Highness had called to see him shortly after he had left and was now waiting in the morning room The sound of footsteps came to mister Scobell s ears as he approached the room His Highness appeared to be pacing the floor like a caged animal at the luncheon hour The resemblance was heightened by the expression in the royal eye as His Highness swung round at the opening of the door and faced the financier Why say Prince said mister Scobell this is lucky I been looking for you I just been to the Palace and the main guy there told me you had gone out I did And I met your stepdaughter mister Scobell was astonished Fate was certainly smoothing his way if it arranged meetings between Betty and the Prince before he had time to do it himself There might be no need for the iron hand after all You did he said Say how the Heck did you come to do that What did you know about Betty Miss Silver and I had met before in America when I was in college mister Scobell slapped his thigh joyously Gee it s all working out like a fiction story in the magazines Is it said John How And for the matter of that what mister Scobell answered question with question Say Prince you and Betty were pretty good friends in the old days I guess John looked at him coldly We won t discuss that if you don t mind he said His tone annoyed mister Scobell Off came the velvet glove and the iron hand displayed itself His green eyes glowed dully and the tip of his nose wriggled as was its habit in times of emotion Is that so he cried regarding John with disfavor Well I guess Won t discuss it You gotta discuss it Your Royal Texas League Highness You want making a head shorter my bucko You John s demeanor had become so dangerous that he broke off abruptly and with an unostentatious movement as of a man strolling carelessly about his private sanctum put himself within easy reach of the door handle He then became satirical Maybe Your Serene Imperial Two by Fourness would care to suggest a subject we can discuss John took a step forward Yes I will he said between his teeth You were talking to Miss Silver about me this morning She told me one or two of the things you said and they opened my eyes Until I heard them I had not quite understood my position I do now You said among other things that I was your hired man It wasn t intended for you to hear said mister Scobell slightly mollified and Betty shouldn t oughter have handed it to you I don t wonder you feel raw I wouldn t say that sort of thing to a guy s face Sure no Tact s my middle name But since you have heard it well Don t apologize You were quite right I was a fool not to see it before No description could have been fairer You might have said much more You might have added that I was nothing more than a steerer for a gambling hell Oh come Prince There was a knock at the door A footman entered bearing with a detached air as if he disclaimed all responsibility a letter on a silver tray mister Scobell slit the envelope and began to read As he did so his eyes grew round and his mouth slowly opened till his cigar stump after hanging for a moment from his lower lip dropped off like an exhausted bivalve and rolled along the carpet Prince he gasped she s gone Betty Gone What do you mean She s beaten it She s half way to Marseilles by now Gee and I saw the darned boat going out She s gone This is from her Listen what she says By the time you read this I shall be gone I am going back to America as quickly as I can I am giving this to a boy to take to you directly the boat has started Please do not try to bring me back I would sooner die than marry the Prince John started violently What he cried mister Scobell nodded sympathy That s what she says She sure has it in bad for you What does she mean Seeing you and she are old friends I don t understand Why does she say that to you Why should she think that you knew that I had asked her to marry me Eh cried mister Scobell You asked her to marry you And she turned you down Prince this beats the band Say you and I must get together and do something The girl s mad See here you aren t wise to what s been happening I been fixing this thing up I fetched you over here and then I fetched Betty and I was going to have you two marry I told Betty all about it this morning John cut through his explanations with a sudden sharp cry A blinding blaze of understanding had flashed upon him It was as if he had been groping his way in a dark cavern and had stumbled unexpectedly into brilliant sunlight He understood everything now Every word that Betty had spoken every gesture that she had made had become amazingly clear He saw now why she had shrunk back from him why her eyes had worn that look He dared not face the picture of himself as he must have appeared in those eyes the man whom mister Benjamin Scobell s Casino was paying to marry her the hired man earning his wages by speaking words of love A feeling of physical sickness came over him He held to the table for support as he had held to the sandstone rock And then came rage rage such as he had never felt before rage that he had not thought himself capable of feeling It swept over him in a wave pouring through his veins and blinding him and he clung to the table till his knuckles whitened under the strain for he knew that he was very near to murder A minute passed He walked to the window and stood there looking out Vaguely he heard mister Scobell s voice at his back talking on but the words had no meaning for him He had begun to think with a curious coolness His detachment surprised him It was one of those rare moments in a man s life when from the outside through a breach in that wall of excuses and self deception which he has been at such pains to build he looks at himself impartially The sight that John saw through the wall was not comforting It was not a heroic soul that stripped of its defenses shivered beneath the scrutiny In another mood he would have mended the breach excusing and extenuating but not now He looked at himself without pity and saw himself weak slothful devoid of all that was clean and fine and a bitter contempt filled him Outside the window a blaze of color Mervo smiled up at him and suddenly he found himself loathing its exotic beauty He felt stifled This was no place for a man A vision of clean winds and wide spaces came to him And just then at the foot of the hill the dome of the Casino caught the sun and flashed out in a blaze of gold He swung round and faced mister Scobell He had made up his mind The financier was still talking So that s how it stands Prince he was saying and it s up to us to get busy John looked at him I intend to he said Good boy said the financier To begin with I shall run you out of this place mister Scobell The other gasped There is going to be a cleaning up John went on I ve thought it out There will be no more gambling in Mervo You re crazy with the heat gasped mister Scobell Abolish gambling You can t I can That concession of yours isn t worth the paper it s written on The Republic gave it to you The Republic s finished If you want to conduct a Casino in Mervo there s only one man who can give you permission and that s myself The acts of the Republic are not binding on me For a week you have been gambling on this island without a concession and now it s going to stop Do you understand But Prince talk sense mister Scobell s voice was almost tearful It s you who don t understand Do for the love of Mike come down off the roof and talk sense Do you suppose that these guys here will stand for this Not on your life Not for a minute See here I m not blaming you I know you don t know what you re saying But listen here You must cut out this kind of thing You mustn t get these ideas in your head You stick to your job and don t butt in on other folks Do you know how long you d stay Prince of this joint if you started in to monkey with my Casino Just about long enough to let you pack a collar stud and a toothbrush into your grip And after that there wouldn t be any more Prince sonnie You stick to your job and I ll stick to mine You re a mighty good Prince for all that s required of you You re ornamental and you ve got get up in you You just keep right on being a good boy and don t start trying stunts off your own beat and you ll do fine Don t forget that I m the big noise here I m old Grayback from way back in Mervo See I ve only to twiddle my fingers and there ll be a revolution and you for the Down and Out Club Don t you forget it sonnie John shrugged his shoulders I ve said all I have to say You ve had your notice to quit After to night the Casino is closed But don t I tell you the people won t stand for it That s for them to decide They may have some self respect They ll fire you Very well That will prove that they have not Prince talk sense You can t mean that you ll throw away a hundred thousand dollars a year as if it was dirt It is dirt when it s made that way We needn t discuss it any more But Prince It s finished But say John had left the room He had been gone several minutes before the financier recovered full possession of his faculties When he did his remarks were brief and to the point Bug house he gasped Abso lutely bug house CHAPTER IX MERVO CHANGES ITS CONSTITUTION Humor if one looks into it is principally a matter of retrospect In after years John was wont to look back with amusement on the revolution which ejected him from the throne of his ancestors But at the time its mirthfulness did not appeal to him He was in a frenzy of restlessness He wanted Betty He wanted to see her and explain Explanations could not restore him to the place he had held in her mind but at least they would show her that he was not the thing he had appeared Mervo had become a prison He ached for America But before he could go this matter of the Casino must be settled It was obvious that it could only be settled in one way He did not credit his subjects with the high mindedness that puts ideals first and money after That military and civilians alike would rally to a man round mister Scobell and the Casino he was well aware But this did not affect his determination to remain till the last If he went now he would be like a boy who makes a runaway ring at the doorbell Until he should receive formal notice of dismissal he must stay although every day had forty eight hours and every hour twice its complement of weary minutes So he waited chafing while Mervo examined the situation turned it over in its mind discussed it slept upon it discussed it again and displayed generally that ponderous leisureliness which is the Mervian s birthright Indeed the earliest demonstration was not Mervian at all It came from the visitors to the island and consisted of a deputation of four headed by the wizened little man who had frowned at John in the Dutch room on the occasion of his meeting with Betty and a stolid individual with a bald forehead and a walrus mustache The tone of the deputation was from the first querulous The wizened man had constituted himself spokesman He introduced the party the walrus as Colonel Finch the others as Herr von Mandelbaum and mister Archer Cleeve His own name was Pugh and the whole party like the other visitors whom they represented had it seemed come to Mervo at great trouble and expense to patronize the tables only to find these suddenly without a word of warning withdrawn from their patronage And what the deputation wished to know was What did it all mean We were amazed sir Your Highness said mister Pugh We could not we cannot understand it The entire thing is a baffling mystery to us We asked the soldiers at the door They referred us to mister Scobell We asked mister Scobell He referred us to you And now we have come as the representatives of our fellow visitors to this island to ask Your Highness what it means Have a cigar said John extending the box mister Pugh waved aside the preferred gift impatiently Not so Herr von Mandelbaum who slid forward after the manner of one in quest of second base and retired with his prize to the rear of the little army once more mister Archer Cleeve a young man with carefully parted fair hair and the expression of a strayed sheep contributed a remark No but I say by Jove you know I mean really you know what That was mister Archer Cleeve upon the situation We have not come here for cigars said mister Pugh We have come here Your Highness for an explanation Of what said John mister Pugh made an impatient gesture Do you question my right to rule this massive country as I think best mister Pugh It is a high handed proceeding said the wizened little man The walrus spoke for the first time What say he murmured huskily I said repeated mister Pugh raising his voice that it was a high handed proceeding Colonel The walrus nodded heavily in assent with closed eyes Yah said Herr von Mandelbaum through the smoke John looked at the spokesman You are from England mister Pugh Yes sir I am a British citizen Suppose some enterprising person began to run a gambling hell in Piccadilly would the authorities look on and smile That is an entirely different matter sir You are quibbling In England gambling is forbidden by law So it is in Mervo mister Pugh Tchah What say said the walrus I said Tchah Colonel Why said the walrus Because His Highness quibbled The walrus nodded approvingly His Highness did nothing of the sort said John Gambling is forbidden in Mervo for the same reason that it is forbidden in England because it demoralizes the people This is absurd sir Gambling has been permitted in Mervo for nearly a year But not by me mister Pugh The Republic certainly granted mister Scobell a concession But when I came to the throne it became necessary for him to get a concession from me I refused it Hence the closed doors mister Archer Cleeve once more But He paused Forgotten what I was going to say he said to the room at large Herr von Mandelbaum made some remark at the back of his throat but was ignored John spoke again If you were a prince mister Pugh would you find it pleasant to be in the pay of a gambling hell That is neither here nor On the contrary it is very much I happen to have some self respect I ve only just found it out it s true but it s there all right I don t want to be a prince take it from me it s a much overrated profession but if I ve got to be one I ll specialize I won t combine it with being a bunco steerer on the side As long as I am on the throne this high toned crap shooting will continue a back number What say said the walrus I said that while I am on the throne here people who feel it necessary to chant Come little seven must do it elsewhere I don t understand you said mister Pugh Your remarks are absolutely unintelligible Never mind My actions speak for themselves It doesn t matter how I describe it what it comes to is that the Casino is closed You can follow that Mervo is no longer running wide open The lid is on Then let me tell you sir mister Pugh brought a bony fist down with a thump on the table that you are playing with fire Understand me sir we are not here to threaten We are a peaceful deputation of visitors But I have observed your people sir I have watched them narrowly And let me tell you that you are walking on a volcano Already there are signs of grave discontent Already cried John Already s good I guess they call it going some in this infernal country if they can keep awake long enough to take action within a year after a thing has happened I don t know if you have any influence with the populace mister Pugh you seem a pretty warm and important sort of person but if you have do please ask them as a favor to me to get a move on It s no good saying that I m walking on a volcano I m from Missouri I want to be shown Let s see this volcano Bring it out and make it trot around You may jest Who s jesting I m not It s a mighty serious thing for me I want to get away The only thing that s keeping me in this forsaken place is this delay These people are obviously going to fire me sooner or later Why on earth can t they do it at once What say said the walrus You may well ask Colonel said mister Pugh staring amazed at John His Highness appears completely to have lost his senses The walrus looked at John as if expecting some demonstration of practical insanity but finding him outwardly calm closed his eyes and nodded heavily again I must say don t you know said mister Archer Cleeve it beats me what The entire deputation seemed to consider that John s last speech needed footnotes John was in no mood to supply them His patience was exhausted I guess we ll call this conference finished he said You ve been told all you came to find out my reason for closing the Casino If it doesn t strike you as a satisfactory reason that s up to you Do what you like about it The one thing you may take as a solid fact and you can spread it around the town as much as ever you please is that it is closed and is not going to be reopened while I m ruler here The deputation then withdrew reluctantly On the following morning there came a note from mister Scobell It was brief Come on down before the shooting begins it ran John tore it up It was on the same evening that definite hostilities may be said to have begun Between the Palace and the market place there was a narrow street of flagged stone which was busy during the early part of the day but deserted after sundown Along this street at about seven o clock John was strolling with a cigarette when he was aware of a man crouching with his back toward him So absorbed was the man in something which he was writing on the stones that he did not hear John s approach and the latter coming up from behind was enabled to see over his shoulder In large letters of chalk he read the words Conspuez le Prince John s knowledge of French was not profound but he could understand this and it annoyed him As he looked the man squatting on his heels bent forward to touch up one of the letters If he had been deliberately posing he could not have assumed a more convenient attitude John had been a footballer before he was a prince The temptation was too much for him He drew back his foot There was a howl and a thud and John resumed his stroll The first gun from Fort Sumter had been fired Early next morning a window at the rear of the palace was broken by a stone and toward noon one of the soldiers on guard in front of the Casino was narrowly missed by an anonymous orange For Mervo this was practically equivalent to the attack on the Bastille and John when the report of the atrocities was brought to him became hopeful But the effort seemed temporarily to have exhausted the fury of the mob The rest of that day and the whole of the next passed without sensation After breakfast on the following morning mister Crump paid a visit to the Palace John was glad to see him The staff of the Palace were loyal but considered as cheery companions they were handicapped by the fact that they spoke no English while John spoke no French mister Crump was the bearer of another note from mister Scobell This time John tore it up unread and turning to the secretary invited him to sit down and make himself at home Sipping a cocktail and smoking one of John s cigars mister Crump became confidential This is a queer business he said Old Ben is chewing pieces out of the furniture up there He s mad clean through He s losing money all the while the people are making up their minds about this thing and it beats him why they re so slow It beats me too I don t believe these hook worm victims ever turned my father out Or if they did somebody must have injected radium into them first I ll give them another couple of days and if they haven t fixed it by then I ll go and leave them to do what they like about it Go Do you want to go Of course I want to go Do you think I like stringing along in this musical comedy island I m crazy to get back to America I don t blame you Crump because it was not your fault but by George if I had known what you were letting me in for when you carried me off here I d have called up the police reserves Hello What s this He rose to his feet as the sound of agitated voices came from the other side of the door The next moment it flew open revealing General Poineau and an assorted group of footmen and other domestics Excitement seemed to be in the air General Poineau rushed forward into the room and flung his arms above his head Then he dropped them to his side and shrugged his shoulders finishing in an attitude reminiscent of Plate six Despair in The Home Reciter Mon Prince he moaned A perfect avalanche of French burst from the group outside the door Crump cried John Stand by me Crump Get busy This is where you make your big play Never mind the chorus gentlemen in the passage Concentrate yourself on Poineau What s he talking about I believe he s come to tell me the people have wakened up Offer him a cocktail What s the French for corpse reviver Get busy Crump The general had begun to speak rapidly with a wealth of gestures It astonished John that mister Crump could follow the harangue as apparently he did Well said John mister Crump looked grave He says there is a large mob in the market place They are talking They would be of moving in force on the Palace The Palace Guards have gone over to the people General Poineau urges you to disguise yourself and escape while there is time You will be safe at his villa till the excitement subsides when you can be smuggled over to France during the night Not for mine said John shaking his head It s mighty good of you General and I appreciate it but I can t wait till night The boat leaves for Marseilles in another hour I ll catch that I can manage it comfortably I ll go up and pack my grip Crump entertain the General while I m gone will you I won t be a moment But as he left the room there came through the open window the mutter of a crowd He stopped General Poineau whipped out his sword and brought it to the salute John patted him on the shoulder You re a sport General he said but we sha n t want it Come along Crump Come and help me address the multitude The window of the room looked out on to a square There was a small balcony with a stone parapet As John stepped out a howl of rage burst from the mob John walked on to the balcony and stood looking down on them resting his arms on the parapet The howl was repeated and from somewhere at the back of the crowd came the sharp crack of a rifle and a shot the first and last of the campaign clipped a strip of flannel from the collar of his coat and splashed against the wall A broad smile spread over his face If he had studied for a year he could not have hit on a swifter or more effective method of quieting the mob There was something so engaging and friendly in his smile that the howling died away and fists that has been shaken unclenched themselves and fell There was an expectant silence in the square John beckoned to Crump who came on to the balcony with some reluctance being mistrustful of the unseen sportsman with the rifle Tell em it s all right Crump and that there s no call for any fuss From their manner I gather that I am no longer needed on this throne Ask them if that s right A small man who appeared to be in command of the crowd stepped forward as the secretary finished speaking and shouted some words which drew a murmur of approval from his followers He wants to know interpreted mister Crump if you will allow the Casino to open again Tell him no but add that I shall be tickled to death to abdicate if that s what they want Speed them up old man Tell them to make up their minds on the jump because I want to catch that boat Don t let them get to discussing it or they ll stand there talking till sunset Yes or no That s the idea There was a moment s surprised silence when mister Crump had spoken The Mervian mind was unused to being hustled in this way Then a voice shouted as it were tentatively Vive la Republique and at once the cry was taken up on all sides John beamed down on them That s right he said Bully I knew you could get a move on as quick as anyone else if you gave your minds to it This is what I call something like a revolution It s a model to every country in the world But I guess we must close down the entertainment now or I shall be missing the boat Will you tell them Crump that any citizen who cares for a drink and a cigar will find it in the Palace Tell the household staff to stand by to pull corks It s dry work revolutionizing And now I really must be going I ve run it mighty fine Slip one of these fellows down there half a dollar and send him to fetch a cab I must step lively Five minutes later the revolutionists obviously embarrassed and ill at ease were sheepishly gulping down their refreshment beneath the stony eye of the majordomo and his assistants while upstairs in the state bedroom the deposed Prince was whistling Dixie and packing the royal pajamas into a suitcase CHAPTER X missus OAKLEY Betty when she stepped on board the boat for Marseilles had had no definite plan of action She had been caught up and swept away by an over mastering desire for escape that left no room in her mind for thoughts of the morrow It was not till the train was roaring its way across southern France that she found herself sufficiently composed to review her position and make plans She would not go back She could not The words she had used in her letter to mister Scobell were no melodramatic rhetoric They were a plain and literal statement of the truth Death would be infinitely preferable to life at Mervo on her stepfather s conditions But that settled what then What was she to do The gods are businesslike They sell they do not give And for what they sell they demand a heavy price We may buy life of them in many ways with our honor our health our independence our happiness with our brains or with our hands But somehow or other in whatever currency we may choose to pay it the price must be paid Betty faced the problem What had she What could she give Her independence That certainly She saw now what a mockery that fancied independence had been She had come and gone as she pleased her path smoothed by her stepfather s money and she had been accustomed to consider herself free She had learned wisdom now and could understand that it was only by sacrificing such artificial independence that she could win through to freedom The world was a market and the only independent people in it were those who had a market value What was her market value What could she do She looked back at her life and saw that she had dabbled She had a little of most things enough of nothing She could sketch a little play a little sing a little write a little Also and as she remembered it she felt for the first time a tremor of hope she could use a typewriter reasonably well That one accomplishment stood out in the welter of her thoughts solid and comforting like a rock in a quicksand It was something definite something marketable something of value for which persons paid The tremor of hope did not comfort her long Her mood was critical and she saw that in this her one accomplishment she was as in everything else an amateur She could not compete against professionals She closed her eyes and had a momentary vision of those professionals keen of face leathern of finger rattling out myriads of words at a dizzy speed And at that all her courage suddenly broke she drooped forlornly and hiding her face on the cushioned arm rest she began to cry Tears are the Turkish bath of the soul Nature never intended woman to pass dry eyed through crises of emotion A casual stranger meeting Betty on her way to the boat might have thought that she looked a little worried nothing more The same stranger if he had happened to enter the compartment at this juncture would have set her down at sight as broken hearted beyond recovery Yet such is the magic of tears that it was at this very moment that Betty was beginning to be conscious of a distinct change for the better Her heart still ached and to think of John even for an instant was to feel the knife turning in the wound but her brain was clear the panic fear had gone and she faced the future resolutely once more For she had just remembered the existence of missus Oakley Only once in her life had Betty met her stepfather s celebrated aunt and the meeting had taken place nearly twelve years ago The figure that remained in her memory was of a pale eyed grenadier like old lady almost entirely surrounded by clocks It was these clocks that had impressed her most She was too young to be awed by the knowledge that the tall old woman who stared at her just like a sandy cat she had once possessed was one of the three richest women in the whole wide world She only remembered thinking that the finger which emerged from the plaid shawl and prodded her cheek was unpleasantly bony But the clocks had absorbed her It was as if all the clocks in the world had been gathered together into that one room There had been big clocks with almost human faces small perky clocks clocks of strange shape and one dingy medium sized clock in particular which had made her cry out with delight Her visit had chanced to begin shortly before eleven in the morning and she had not been in the room ten minutes before there was a whirring and the majority of the clocks began to announce the hour each after its own fashion some with a slow bloom some with a rapid bell like sound But the medium sized clock unexpectedly belying its appearance of being nothing of particular importance had performed its task in a way quite distinct from the others It had suddenly produced from its interior a shabby little gold man with a trumpet who had blown eleven little blasts before sliding backward into his house and shutting the door after him Betty had waited in rapt silence till he finished and had then shouted eagerly for more Just as the beginner at golf may effect a drive surpassing that of the expert so may a child unconsciously eclipse the practised courtier There was no soft side to missus Oakley s character as thousands of suave would be borrowers had discovered in their time but there was a soft spot To general praise of her collection of clocks she was impervious it was unique and she did not require you to tell her so but exhibit admiration for the clock with the little trumpeter and she melted It was the one oasis of sentiment in the Sahara of her mental outlook the grain of radium in the pitchblende Years ago it had stood in a little New England farmhouse and a child had clapped her hands and shouted even as Betty had done when the golden man slid from his hiding place Much water had flowed beneath the bridge since those days Many things had happened to the child But she still kept her old love for the trumpeter The world knew nothing of this The world if it had known would have been delighted to stand before the clock and admire it volubly by the day But it had no inkling of the trumpeter s importance and when it came to visit missus Oakley was apt to waste its time showering compliments on the obvious beauties of the queens of the collection But Betty ignoring these jumped up and down before the dingy clock demanding further trumpetings and turning to missus Oakley as one possessing influence she was aware of a curious intent look in the old lady s eyes Do you like that clock my dear said missus Oakley Yes Oh yes Perhaps you shall have it some day honey Betty was probably the only person who had been admitted to that room who would not on the strength of this remark have steered the conversation gently to the subject of a small loan Instead she ran to the old lady and kissed her And as to what had happened after that memory was vague There had been some talk she remembered of a dollar to buy candy but it had come to nothing and now that she had grown older and had read the frequent paragraphs and anecdotes that appeared in the papers about her stepfather s aunt she could understand why She knew now what everybody knew of missus Oakley her history her eccentricities and the miserliness of which the papers spoke with a satirical lightness that seemed somehow but a thin disguise for what was almost admiration missus Oakley was one of two children a son and a daughter of a Vermont farmer Of her early life no records remain Her public history begins when she was twenty two and came to New York After two years struggling she found a position in the firm of one Redgrave Those who knew her then speak of her as a tall handsome girl hard and intensely ambitious From contemporary accounts she seems to have out Nietzsched Nietzsche Nietzsche s vision stopped short at the superman Jane Scobell was a superwoman She had all the titanic selfishness and indifference to the comfort of others which marks the superman and in addition undeniable good looks and a knowledge of the weaknesses of men Poor mister Redgrave had not had a chance from the start She married him within a year Two years later catching the bulls in an unguarded moment mister Redgrave despoiled them of a trifle over three million dollars and died the same day of an apoplectic stroke caused by the excitement of victory His widow after a tour in Europe returned to the United States and visited Pittsburg Any sociologist will support the statement that it is difficult almost impossible for an attractive widow visiting Pittsburg not to marry a millionaire even if she is not particularly anxious to do so If such an act is the primary object of her visit the thing becomes a certainty Groping through the smoke Jane Redgrave seized and carried off no less a quarry than Alexander Baynes Oakley a widower whose income was one of the seven wonders of the world In the fullness of time he too died and Jane Oakley was left with the sole control of two vast fortunes She did not marry again though it was rumored that it took three secretaries working nine hours a day to cope with the written proposals and that butler after butler contracted clergyman s sore throat through denying admittance to amorous callers In the ten years after Alexander Baynes death every impecunious aristocrat in the civilized world must have made his dash for the matrimonial pole But her pale eyes looked them over and dismissed them During those early years she was tempted once or twice to speculation A failure in a cotton deal not only cured her of this taste but seems to have marked the point in her career when her thoughts began to turn to parsimony Until then she had lived in some state but now gradually at first then swiftly she began to cut down her expenses Now we find her in an apartment in West Central Park next in a Washington Square hotel then in a Harlem flat and finally her last fixed abiding place in a small cottage on Staten Island It was a curious life that she led this woman who could have bought kingdoms if she had willed it A Swedish maid of all work was her only companion By day she would walk in her little garden or dust arrange and wind up her clocks At night she would knit or read one of the frequent reports that arrived at the cottage from charity workers on the East Side Those were her two hobbies and her only extravagances clocks and charity Her charity had its limitations In actual money she expended little She was a theoretical philanthropist She lent her influence her time and her advice but seldom her bank balance Arrange an entertainment for the delectation of the poor and you would find her on the platform but her name would not be on the list of subscribers to the funds She would deliver a lecture on thrift to an audience of factory girls and she would give them a practical example of what she preached Yet with all its limitations her charity was partly genuine Her mind was like a country in the grip of civil war One half of her sincerely pitied the poor burned at any story of oppression and cried Give but the other cried Halt and held her back and between the two she fell It was to this somewhat unpromising haven of refuge that Betty s mind now turned in her trouble She did not expect great things She could not have said exactly what she did expect But at least the cottage on Staten Island offered a resting place on her journey even if it could not be the journey s end Her mad dash from Mervo ceased to be objectless It led somewhere CHAPTER XI A LETTER OF INTRODUCTION New York revisited had much the same effect on Betty as it had had on John during his first morning of independence As the liner came up the bay and the great buildings stood out against the clear blue of the sky she felt afraid and lonely That terror which is said to attack immigrants on their first sight of the New York sky line came to her as she leaned on the rail and with it a feeling of utter misery By a continual effort during the voyage she had kept her thoughts from turning to John but now he rose up insistently before her and she realized all that had gone out of her life She rebelled against the mad cruelty of the fate which had brought them together again It seemed to her now that she must always have loved him but it had been such a vague gentle thing this love before that last meeting hardly more than a pleasant accompaniment to her life something to think about in idle moments a help and a support when things were running crosswise She had been so satisfied with it so content to keep him a mere memory It seemed so needless and wanton to destroy her illusion Of love as a wild beast passion tearing and torturing quite ordinary persons like herself she had always been a little sceptical The great love poems of the world when she read them had always left her with the feeling that their authors were of different clay from herself and had no common meeting ground with her She had seen her friends fall in love as they called it and it had been very pretty and charming but as far removed from the frenzies of the poets as an amateur s snapshot of Niagara from the cataract itself Elsa Keith for instance was obviously very fond and proud of Marvin but she seemed perfectly placid about it She loved but she could still spare half an hour for the discussion of a new frock Her soul did not appear to have been revolutionized in any way Gradually Betty had come to the conclusion that love in the full sense of the word was one of the things that did not happen And now as if to punish her presumption it had leaped from hiding and seized her There was nothing exaggerated or unintelligible in the poets now They ceased to be inhabitants of another world swayed by curiously complex emotions They were her brothers ordinary men with ordinary feelings and a strange gift for expressing them She knew now that it was possible to hate the man you loved and to love the man you hated to ache for the sight of someone even while you fled from him It did not take her long to pass the Customs A small grip constituted her entire baggage Having left this in the keeping of the amiable proprietor of a near by delicatessen store she made her way to the ferry Her first enquiry brought her to the cottage missus Oakley was a celebrity on Staten Island At the door she paused for a moment then knocked The Swede servant she who had been there at her former visit twelve years ago received her stolidly missus Oakley was dusting her clocks Ask her if she can see me said Betty I m great step niece sounded too ridiculous I m her niece she said The handmaid went and returned stolid as ever Ay tal her vat yu say about niece and she say she not knowing any niece she announced Betty amended the description and presently the Swede returned once more and motioned her to enter Like so many scenes of childhood the room of the clocks was sharply stamped on Betty s memory and as she came into it now it seemed to her that nothing had changed There were the clocks all round the walls of every shape and size the big clocks with the human faces and the small perky clocks There was the dingy medium sized clock that held the trumpeter And there looking at her with just the old sandy cat expression in her pale eyes was missus Oakley Even the possession of an income of eighteen million dollars and a unique collection of clocks cannot place a woman above the making of the obvious remark How you have grown said missus Oakley The words seemed to melt the chill that had gathered around Betty s heart She had been prepared to enter into long explanations and the knowledge that these would not be required was very comforting Do you remember me she exclaimed You are the little girl who clapped her hands at the trumpeter but you are not little now I m not so very big said Betty smiling She felt curiously at home and pity for the loneliness of this strange old woman caused her to forget her own troubles You look pretty when you smile said missus Oakley thoughtfully She continued to look closely at her You are in trouble she said Betty met her eyes frankly Yes she said The old woman bent her head over a Sevres china clock and stroked it tenderly with her feather duster Why did you run away she asked without looking up Betty had a feeling that the ground was being cut from beneath her feet She had expected to have to explain who she was and why she had come and behold both were unnecessary It was uncanny And then the obvious explanation occurred to her Did my stepfather cable she asked missus Oakley laid down the feather duster and opening a drawer produced some sheets of paper to the initiated eye plainly one of mister Scobell s lengthy messages A wickedly extravagant cable she said frowning at it He could have expressed himself perfectly well at a quarter of the expense Betty began to read The dimple on her chin appeared for a moment as she did so The tone of the message was so obsequious There was no trace of the old peremptory note in it The words dearest aunt occurred no fewer than six times in the course of the essay its author being apparently reckless of the fact that it was costing him half a dollar a time missus Oakley had been quite right in her criticism The gist of the cable was Betty has run away to America dearest aunt ridiculous is sure to visit you please dearest aunt do not encourage her The rest was pure padding missus Oakley watched her with a glowering eye If Bennie Scobell she soliloquized imagines that he can dictate to me She ceased leaving an impressive hiatus Unhappy mister Scobell convicted of dictation even after three dollars worth of dearest aunt Betty handed back the cable Her chin emblem of war was tilted and advanced I ll tell you why I ran away Aunt she said missus Oakley listened to her story in silence Betty did not relate it at great length for with every word she spoke the thought of John stabbed her afresh She omitted much that has been told in this chronicle But she disclosed the essential fact that Napoleonic mister Scobell had tried to force her into a marriage with a man she did not she hesitated at the word did not respect she concluded missus Oakley regarded her inscrutably for a while before replying Respect she said at last I have never met a man in my life whom I could respect Harpies Every one of them Every one of them Every one of them She was muttering to herself It is possible that her thoughts were back with those persevering young aristocrats of her second widowhood Certainly if she had sometimes displayed a touch of the pirate in her dealings with man man it must be said in fairness had not always shown his best side to her Respect she muttered again Did you like him this Prince of yours Betty s eyes filled She made no reply Well never mind said missus Oakley Don t cry child I m not going to press you You must have hated him or else loved him very much or you would never have run away Dictate to me she broke off half aloud her mind evidently once more on mister Scobell s unfortunate cable Betty could bear it no longer I loved him she cried I loved him She was shaking with dry sobs She felt the old woman s eyes upon her but she could not stop A sudden whirr cut through the silence One of the large clocks near the door was beginning to strike the hour Instantly the rest began to do the same till the room was full of the noise And above the din there sounded sharp and clear the note of the little trumpet The noise died away with metallic echoings Honey It was a changed voice that spoke Betty looked up and saw that the eyes that met hers were very soft She moved quickly to the old woman s side Honey I m going to tell you something about myself that nobody dreams of Betty when I was your age I ran away from a man because I loved him It was just a little village tragedy my dear I think he was fond of me but father was poor and her folks were the great people of the place and he married her And I ran away like you and went to New York Betty pressed her hand It was trembling I m so sorry she whispered I went to New York because I wanted to kill my heart And I killed it There s only one way Work Work Work She was sitting bolt upright and the soft look had gone out of her eyes They were hard and fiery under the drawn brows Work Ah I worked I never rested For two years Two whole years It fought back at me It tore me to bits But I wouldn t stop I worked on I killed it She stopped quivering Betty was cold with a nameless dismay She felt as if she were standing in the dark on the brink of an abyss The old woman began to speak again Child it s the same with you Your heart s tearing you Don t let it It will get worse and worse if you are afraid of it Fight it Kill it Work She stopped again clenching and unclenching her fingers as if she were strangling some living thing There was silence for a long moment What can you do she asked suddenly Her voice was calm and unemotional again The abruptness of the transition from passion to the practical took Betty aback She could not speak There must be something continued missus Oakley When I was your age I had taught myself bookkeeping shorthand and typewriting What can you do Can you use a typewriter Blessed word Yes said Betty promptly Well Not very well H m Well I expect you will do it well enough for mister Renshaw on my recommendation I ll give you a letter to him He is the editor of a small weekly paper I don t know how much he will offer you but take it and work You ll find him pleasant I have met him at charity organization meetings on the East Side He s useful at the entertainments does conjuring tricks stupid but they seem to amuse people You ll find him pleasant There She had been writing the letter of introduction during the course of these remarks At the last word she blotted it and placed it in an envelope That s the address she said J Brabazon Renshaw Office of Peaceful Moments Take it to him now Good by It was as if she were ashamed of her late display of emotion She spoke abruptly and her pale eyes were expressionless Betty thanked her and turned to go Tell me how you get on said missus Oakley Yes said Betty And work Keep on working There was a momentary return of her former manner as she spoke the words and Betty wavered She longed to say something comforting something that would show that she understood missus Oakley had taken up the feather duster again Steena will show you out she said curtly And Betty was aware of the stolid Swede in the doorway The interview was plainly at an end Good by Aunt she said and thank you ever so much for everything CHAPTER XII PEACEFUL MOMENTS The man in the street did not appear to know it but a great crisis was imminent in New York journalism Everything seemed much as usual in the city The cars ran blithely on Broadway Newsboys shouted their mystic slogan Wuxtry with undiminished vim Society thronged Fifth Avenue without a furrow on its brow At a thousand street corners a thousand policemen preserved their air of massive superiority to the things of this world Of all the four million not one showed the least sign of perturbation Nevertheless the crisis was at hand mister J Brabazon Renshaw Editor in chief of Peaceful Moments was about to leave his post and start on a three months vacation Peaceful Moments as its name an inspiration of mister Renshaw s own was designed to imply was a journal of the home It was the sort of paper which the father of the family is expected to take back with him from the office and read aloud to the chicks before bedtime under the shade of the rubber plant Circumstances had left the development of the paper almost entirely to mister Renshaw Its contents were varied There was a Moments in the Nursery page conducted by Luella Granville Waterman and devoted mainly to anecdotes of the family canary by Jane aged six and similar works of the younger set There was a Moments of Meditation page conducted by the Reverend Edwin T Philpotts a Moments among the Masters page consisting of assorted chunks looted from the literature of the past when foreheads were bulged and thoughts profound by mister Renshaw himself one or two other special pages a short story answers to correspondents on domestic matters and a Moments of Mirth page conducted by one B Henderson Asher a very painful affair The proprietor of this admirable journal was that Napoleon of finance mister Benjamin Scobell That this should have been so is but one proof of the many sidedness of that great man mister Scobell had founded Peaceful Moments at an early stage in his career and it was only at very rare intervals nowadays that he recollected that he still owned it He had so many irons in the fire now that he had no time to waste his brain tissues thinking about a paper like Peaceful Moments It was one of his failures It certainly paid its way and brought him a small sum each year but to him it was a failure a bombshell that had fizzled He had intended to do big things with Peaceful Moments He had meant to start a new epoch in the literature of Manhattan I gottan idea he had said to Miss Scobell All this yellow journalism red blood and all that folks are tired of it They want something milder Wholesome see what I mean There s money in it Guys make a roll too big to lift by selling soft drinks don t they Well I m going to run a soft drink paper See The enterprise had started well To begin with he had found the ideal editor He had met mister Renshaw at a down East gathering presided over by missus Oakley and his Napoleonic eye had seen in J Brabazon the seeds of domestic greatness Before they parted he had come to terms with him Nor had the latter failed to justify his intuition He made an admirable editor It was not mister Renshaw s fault that the new paper had failed to electrify America It was the public on whom the responsibility for the failure must be laid They spoiled the whole thing Certain of the faithful subscribed it is true and continued to subscribe but the great heart of the public remained untouched The great heart of the public declined to be interested in the meditations of mister Philpotts and the humor of mister B Henderson Asher and continued to spend its money along the bad old channels The thing began to bore mister Scobell He left the conduct of the journal more and more to mister Renshaw until finally it was just after the idea for extracting gold from sea water had struck him he put the whole business definitely out of his mind His actual words were that he never wanted to see or hear of the darned thing again inasmuch as it gave him a pain in the neck mister Renshaw was given a free hand as to the editing and all matters of finance connected with the enterprise were placed in the hands of mister Scobell s solicitors who had instructions to sell the journal if as its owner crisply put it they could find any chump who was enough of a darned chump to give real money for it Up to the present the great army of chumps had fallen short of this ideal standard of darned chumphood Ever since this parting of the ways mister Renshaw had been in his element Under his guidance Peaceful Moments had reached a level of domesticity which made other so called domestic journals look like sporting supplements But at last the work had told upon him Whether it was the effort of digging into the literature of the past every week or the strain of reading B Henderson Asher s Moments of Mirth is uncertain At any rate his labors had ended in wrecking his health to such an extent that the doctor had ordered him three months complete rest in the woods or mountains whichever he preferred and being a farseeing man who went to the root of things had absolutely declined to consent to mister Renshaw s suggestion that he keep in touch with the paper during his vacation He was adamant He had seen copies of Peaceful Moments once or twice and refused to permit a man in mister Renshaw s state of health to come in contact with Luella Granville Waterman s Moments in the Nursery and B Henderson Asher s Moments of Mirth You must forget that such a paper exists he said You must dismiss the whole thing from your mind live in the open and develop some flesh and muscle mister Renshaw had bowed before the sentence howbeit gloomily and now on the morning of Betty s departure from missus Oakley s house with the letter of introduction was giving his final instructions to his temporary successor This temporary successor in the editorship was none other than John s friend Rupert Smith late of the News Smith on leaving Harvard had been attracted by newspaper work and had found his first billet on a Western journal of the type whose society column consists of such items as Jim Thompson was to town yesterday with a bunch of other cheap skates We take this opportunity of once more informing Jim that he is a liar and a skunk and whose editor works with a pistol on his desk and another in his hip pocket Graduating from this he had proceeded to a reporter s post on a daily paper in Kentucky where there were blood feuds and other Southern devices for preventing life from becoming dull All this was good but even while he enjoyed these experiences New York the magnet had been tugging at him and at last after two eventful years on the Kentucky paper he had come East and eventually won through to the staff of the News His presence in the office of Peaceful Moments was due to the uncomfortable habit of most of the New York daily papers of cutting down their staff of reporters during the summer The dismissed had to sustain them the knowledge that they would return like the swallows anon and be received back into their old places but in the meantime they suffered the inconvenience of having to support themselves as best they could Smith when in the company of half a dozen others he had had to leave the News had heard of the vacant post of assistant editor on Peaceful Moments and had applied for and received it Whereby he was more fortunate than some of his late colleagues though as the character of his new work unrolled itself before him he was frequently doubtful on that point For the atmosphere of Peaceful Moments however wholesome was certainly not exciting and his happened to be essentially a nature that needed the stimulus of excitement Even in Park Row the denizens of which street are rarely slaves to the conventional and safe he had a well established reputation in this matter Others of his acquaintances welcomed excitement when it came to them in the course of the day s work but it was Smith s practise to go in search of it He was a young man of spirit and resource His appearance to those who did not know him hardly suggested this He was very tall and thin with a dark solemn face He was a purist in the matter of clothes and even in times of storm and stress presented an immaculate appearance to the world In his left eye attached to a cord he wore a monocle Through this at the present moment he was gazing benevolently at mister Renshaw as the latter fussed about the office in the throes of departure To the editor s rapid fire of advice and warning he listened with the pleased and indulgent air of a father whose infant son frisks before him mister Renshaw interested him To Smith s mind mister Renshaw put him in any show you pleased would alone have been worth the price of admission Well chirruped the holiday maker he was a little man with a long neck and he always chirruped Well I think that is all mister Smith Oh ah yes The stenographer You will need a new stenographer The Peaceful Moments stenographer had resigned her position three days before in order to get married Unquestionably Comrade Renshaw said Smith A blonde mister Renshaw looked annoyed I have told you before mister Smith I object to your addressing me as Comrade It is not it is not er fitting Smith waved a deprecating hand Say no more he said I will correct the habit I have been studying the principles of Socialism somewhat deeply of late and I came to the conclusion that I must join the cause It looked good to me You work for the equal distribution of property and start in by swiping all you can and sitting on it A noble scheme Me for it But I am interrupting you mister Renshaw had to pause for a moment to reorganize his ideas I think ah yes I think it would be best perhaps to wait for a day or two in case missus Oakley should recommend someone I mentioned the vacancy in the office to her and she said she would give the matter her attention I should prefer if possible to give the place to her nominee She has eighteen million a year said Smith I understand Scatter seeds of kindness mister Renshaw looked at him sharply Smith s face was solemn and thoughtful Nothing of the kind the editor said after a pause I should prefer missus Oakley s nominee because missus Oakley is a shrewd practical woman who er who who in fact Just so said Smith eying him gravely through the monocle Entirely The scrutiny irritated mister Renshaw Do put that thing away mister Smith he said That thing Yes that ridiculous glass Put it away Instantly said Smith replacing the monocle in his vest pocket You object to it Well well many people do We all have these curious likes and dislikes It is these clashings of personal taste which constitute what we call life Yes You were saying mister Renshaw wrinkled his forehead I have forgotten what I intended to say he said querulously You have driven it out of my head Smith clicked his tongue sympathetically mister Renshaw looked at his watch Dear me he said I must be going I shall miss my train But I think I have covered the ground quite thoroughly You understand everything Absolutely said Smith I look on myself as some engineer controlling a machine with a light hand on the throttle Or like some faithful hound whose master Ah There is just one thing missus Julia Burdett Parslow is a little inclined to be unpunctual with her Moments with Budding Girlhood If this should happen while I am away just write her a letter quite a pleasant letter you understand pointing out the necessity of being in good time She must realize that we are a machine Exactly murmured Smith The machinery of the paper cannot run smoothly unless contributors are in good time with their copy Precisely said Smith They are the janitors of the literary world Let them turn off the steam heat and where are we If missus Julia Burdett Parslow is not up to time with the hot air how shall our Girlhood escape being nipped in the bud And there is just one other thing I wish you would correct a slight tendency I have noticed lately in mister Asher to be just a trifle well not precisely risky but perhaps a shade broad in his humor Young blood sighed Smith Young blood mister Asher is a very sensible man and he will understand Well that is all I think Now I really must be going Good by mister Smith Good by At the door mister Renshaw paused with the air of an exile bidding farewell to his native land sighed and trotted out Smith put his feet upon the table flicked a speck of dust from his coat sleeve and resumed his task of reading the proofs of Luella Granville Waterman s Moments in the Nursery He had not been working long when Pugsy Maloney the office boy entered Say said Pugsy Say on Comrade Maloney Dere s a loidy out dere wit a letter for mister Renshaw Have you acquainted her with the fact that mister Renshaw has passed to other climes Huh Have you in the course of your conversation with this lady mentioned that mister Renshaw has beaten it Sure I did And she says can she see you Smith removed his feet from the table Certainly he said Who am I that I should deny people these little treats Ask her to come in Comrade Maloney CHAPTER XIII BETTY MAKES A FRIEND Betty had appealed to Master Maloney s esthetic sense of beauty directly she appeared before him It was with regret therefore rather than with the usual calm triumph of the office boy that he informed her that the editor was not in Also seeing that she was evidently perturbed by the information he had gone out of his way to suggest that she lay her business whatever it might be before mister Renshaw s temporary successor Smith received her with Old World courtesy Will you sit down he said Not to wait for Comrade Renshaw of course He will not be back for another three months Perhaps I can help you I am acting editor The work is not light he added gratuitously Sometimes the cry goes round New York Can Smith get through it all Will his strength support his unquenchable spirit But I stagger on I do not repine What was it that you wished to see Comrade Renshaw about He swung his monocle lightly by its cord For the first time since she had entered the office Betty was rather glad that mister Renshaw was away Conscious of her defects as a stenographer she had been looking forward somewhat apprehensively to the interview with her prospective employer But this long solemn youth put her at her ease His manner suggested in some indefinable way that the whole thing was a sort of round game I came about the typewriting she said Smith looked at her with interest Are you the nominee I beg your pardon Do you come from missus Oakley Yes Then all is well The decks have been cleared against your coming Consider yourself engaged as our official typist By the way can you type Betty laughed This was certainly not the awkward interview she had been picturing in her mind Yes she said but I m afraid I m not very good at it Never mind said Smith I m not very good at editing Yet here I am I foresee that we shall make an ideal team Together we will toil early and late till we whoop up this domestic journal into a shining model of what a domestic journal should be What that is at present I do not exactly know Excursion trains will be run from the Middle West to see this domestic journal Visitors from Oshkosh will do it before going on to Grant s tomb What exactly is your name Betty hesitated Yes perhaps it would be better Brown she said Mine is Smith The smiling child in the outer office is Pugsy Maloney one of our most prominent citizens Homely in appearance perhaps but one of us You will get to like Comrade Maloney And now to touch on a painful subject work Would you care to start in now or have you any other engagements Perhaps you wish to see the sights of this beautiful little city before beginning You would prefer to start in now Excellent You could not have come at a more suitable time for I was on the very point of sallying out to purchase about twenty five cents worth of lunch We editors Comrade Brown find that our tissues need constant restoration such is the strenuous nature of our duties You will find one or two letters on that table Good by then for the present He picked up his hat smoothed it carefully and with a courtly inclination of his head left the room Betty sat down and began to think So she was really earning her own living It was a stimulating thought She felt a little bewildered She had imagined something so different missus Oakley had certainly said that Peaceful Moments was a small paper but despite that her imagination had conjured up visions of bustle and activity and a peremptory overdriven editor snapping out words of command Smith with his careful speech and general air of calm detachment from the noisy side of life created an atmosphere of restfulness If this was a sample of life in the office she thought the paper had been well named She felt soothed and almost happy Interesting and exciting things New York things began to happen at once To her meditating there entered Pugsy Maloney the guardian of the gate of this shrine of Peace a nonchalant youth of about fifteen with a freckled mask like face the expression of which never varied bearing in his arms a cat The cat was struggling violently but he appeared quite unconscious of it Its existence did not seem to occur to him Say said Pugsy Betty was fond of cats Oh don t hurt her she cried anxiously Master Maloney eyed the cat as if he were seeing it for the first time I wasn t hoitin her he said without emotion Dere was two fresh kids in the street sickin a dawg on to her And I comes up and says G wan What do youse t ink youse doin fussin de poor dumb animal An one of de guys he says G wan Who do youse t ink youse is An I says I m de guy what s goin to swat youse on de coco smarty if youse don t quit fussin de poor dumb animal So wit dat

none	none	myself Cats is foolishness And having finished this Homeric narrative Master Maloney fixed an expressionless eye on the ceiling and was silent How splendid of you Pugsy cried Betty She might have been killed poor thing She had it pretty fierce admitted Master Maloney gazing dispassionately at the rescued animal which had escaped from his clutch and taken up a strong position on an upper shelf of the bookcase Will you go out and get her some milk Pugsy She s probably starving Here s a quarter Will you keep the change Sure thing assented Master Maloney He strolled slowly out while Betty mounting a chair proceeded to chirrup and snap her fingers in the effort to establish the foundations of an entente cordiale with the cat By the time Pugsy returned carrying a five cent bottle of milk the animal had vacated the shelf and was sitting on the table polishing her face The milk having been poured into the lid of a tobacco tin in lieu of a saucer she suspended her operations and adjourned for refreshments Pugsy having no immediate duties on hand concentrated himself on the cat Say he said Well Dat kitty Pipe de leather collar she s wearin Betty had noticed earlier in the proceedings that a narrow leather collar encircled the animal s neck Guess I know where dat kitty belongs Dey all has dose collars I guess she s one of Bat Jarvis s kitties He s got twenty t ree of dem and dey all has dose collars Bat Jarvis Sure Who is he Pugsy looked at her incredulously Say Ain t youse never heard of Bat Jarvis He s he s Bat Jarvis Do you know him Sure I knows him Does he live near here Sure he lives near here Then I think the best thing for you to do is to run round and tell him that I am taking care of his cat and that he had better come and fetch it I must be getting on with my work or I shall never finish it She settled down to type the letters Smith had indicated She attacked her task cautiously She was one of those typists who are at their best when they do not have to hurry She was putting the finishing touches to the last of the batch when there was a shuffling of feet in the outer room followed by a knock on the door The next moment there entered a short burly young man around whom there hung like an aroma an indescribable air of toughness partly due perhaps to the fact that he wore his hair in a well oiled fringe almost down to his eyebrows thus presenting the appearance of having no forehead at all His eyes were small and set close together His mouth was wide his jaw prominent Not in short the sort of man you would have picked out on sight as a model citizen He blinked furtively as his eyes met Betty s and looked round the room His face lighted up as he saw the cat Say he said stepping forward and touching the cat s collar Ma am mine Are you mister Jarvis asked Betty The visitor nodded not without a touch of complacency as of a monarch abandoning his incognito For mister Jarvis was a celebrity By profession he was a dealer in animals birds and snakes He had a fancier s shop on Groome Street in the heart of the Bowery This was on the ground floor His living abode was in the upper story of that house and it was there that he kept the twenty three cats whose necks were adorned with leather collars But it was not the fact that he possessed twenty three cats with leather collars that had made mister Jarvis a celebrity A man may win a local reputation if only for eccentricity by such means mister Jarvis reputation was far from being purely local Broadway knew him and the Tenderloin Tammany Hall knew him Long Island City knew him For Bat Jarvis was the leader of the famous Groome Street Gang the largest and most influential of the four big gangs of the East Side To Betty so little does the world often know of its greatest men he was merely a decidedly repellent looking young man in unbecoming clothes But his evident affection for the cat gave her a feeling of fellowship toward him She beamed upon him and mister Jarvis who was wont to face the glare of rivals without flinching avoided her eye and shuffled with embarrassment I m so glad she s safe said Betty There were two boys teasing her in the street I ve been giving her some milk mister Jarvis nodded with his eyes on the floor There was a pause Then he looked up and fixing his gaze some three feet above her head spoke Say he said and paused again Betty waited expectantly He relaxed into silence again apparently thinking Say he said Ma am obliged Fond of de kit I am She s a dear said Betty tickling the cat under the ear Ma am went on mister Jarvis pursuing his theme obliged Sha n t fergit it Any time you re in bad glad to be of service Bat Jarvis Groome Street Anybody ll show youse where I live He paused and shuffled his feet then tucking the cat more firmly under his arm left the room Betty heard him shuffling downstairs He had hardly gone when the door opened again and Smith came in So you have had company while I was away he said Who was the grandee with the cat An old childhood s friend Was he trying to sell the animal to us That was mister Bat Jarvis said Betty Smith looked interested Bat What was he doing here Betty related the story of the cat 
5304_55856_000042_000000	train-clean-360	Smith nodded 
none	none	thoughtfully Well he said I don t know that Comrade Jarvis is precisely the sort of friend I would go out of my way to select Still you never know what might happen He might come in useful And now let us concentrate ourselves tensely on this very entertaining little journal of ours and see if we cannot stagger humanity with it CHAPTER XIV A CHANGE OF POLICY The feeling of tranquillity which had come to Betty on her first acquaintance with Peaceful Moments seemed to deepen as the days went by and with each day she found the sharp pain at her heart less vehement It was still there but it was dulled The novelty of her life and surroundings kept it in check New York is an egotist It will suffer no divided attention Look at me says the voice of the city imperiously and its children obey It snatches their thoughts from their inner griefs and concentrates them on the pageant that rolls unceasingly from one end of the island to the other One may despair in New York but it is difficult to brood on the past for New York is the City of the Present the City of Things that are Going On To Betty everything was new and strange Her previous acquaintance with the metropolis had not been extensive mister Scobell s home or rather the house which he owned in America was on the outskirts of Philadelphia and it was there that she had lived when she was not paying visits Occasionally during horse show week or at some other time of festivity she had spent a few days with friends who lived in Madison or upper Fifth Avenue but beyond that New York was a closed book to her It would have been a miracle in the circumstances if John and Mervo and the whole of the events since the arrival of the great cable had not to some extent become a little dream like When she was alone at night and had leisure to think the dream became a reality once more but in her hours of work or what passed for work in the office of Peaceful Moments and in the hours she spent walking about the streets and observing the ways of this new world of hers it faded Everything was so bright and busy Every moment had its fresh interest And above all there was the sense of adventure She was twenty four she had health and an imagination and almost unconsciously she was stimulated by the thrill of being for the first time in her life genuinely at large The child s love of hiding dies hard in us To Betty to walk abroad in New York in the midst of hurrying crowds just Betty Brown one of four million and no longer the beautiful Miss Silver of the society column was to taste the romance of disguise or invisibility During office hours she came near to complete contentment To an expert stenographer the amount of work to be done would have seemed ridiculously small but Betty who liked plenty of time for a task generally managed to make it last comfortably through the day This was partly owing to the fact that her editor when not actually at work himself was accustomed to engage her in conversation and to keep her so engaged until the entrance of Pugsy Maloney heralded the arrival of some caller Betty liked Smith His odd ways his conversation and his extreme solicitude for his clothes amused her She found his outlook on life refreshing Smith was an optimist Whatever cataclysm might occur he never doubted for a moment that he would be comfortably on the summit of the debris when all was over He amazed Betty with his stories of his reportorial adventures He told them for the most part as humorous stories at his own expense but the fact remained that in a considerable proportion of them he had only escaped a sudden and violent death by adroitness or pure good luck His conversation opened up a new world to Betty She began to see that in America and especially in New York anything may happen to anybody She looked on Smith with new eyes But surely all this she said one morning after he had come to the end of the story of a highly delicate piece of interviewing work in connection with some Cumberland Mountains feudists surely all this She looked round the room Domesticity suggested Smith Yes said Betty Surely it all seems rather tame to you Smith sighed Comrade Brown he said you have touched the spot with an unerring finger Since mister Renshaw s departure the flatness of life had come home to Smith with renewed emphasis Before there had always been the quiet entertainment of watching the editor at work but now he was feeling restless Like John at Mervo he was practically nothing but an ornament Peaceful Moments like Mervo had been set rolling and had continued to roll on almost automatically The staff of regular contributors sent in their various pages There was nothing for the man in charge to do mister Renshaw had been one of those men who have a genius for being as busy over nothing as if it were some colossal work but Smith had not that gift He liked something that he could grip and that gripped him He was becoming desperately bored He felt like a marooned sailor on a barren rock of domesticity A visitor who called at the office at this time did nothing to remove this sensation of being outside everything that made life worth living Betty returning to the office one afternoon found Smith in the doorway just parting from a thickset young man There was a rather gloomy expression on the thickset young man s face Smith too she noted when they were back in the inner office seemed to have something on his mind He was strangely silent Comrade Brown he said at last I wish this little journal of ours had a sporting page Betty laughed Less ribaldry protested Smith pained This is a sad affair You saw the man I was talking to That was Kid Brady I used to know him when I was out West He wants to fight anyone in the country at a hundred and thirty three pounds We all have our hobbies That is Comrade Brady s Is he a boxer He would like to be Out West nobody could touch him He s in the championship class But he has been pottering about New York for a month without being able to get a fight If we had a sporting page on Peaceful Moments we could do him some good but I don t see how we can write him up said Smith picking up a copy of the paper and regarding it gloomily in Moments in the Nursery or Moments with Budding Girlhood He put up his eyeglass and stared at the offending journal with the air of a vegetarian who has found a caterpillar in his salad Incredulity dismay and disgust fought for precedence in his expression B Henderson Asher he said severely ought to be in some sort of a home Cain killed Abel for telling him that story He turned to another page and scrutinized it with deepening gloom Is Luella Granville Waterman by any chance a friend of yours Comrade Brown No I am glad For it seems to me that for sheer concentrated piffle she is in a class by herself He read on for a few moments in silence then looked up and fixed Betty with his monocle There was righteous wrath in his eyes And people he said are paying money for this Money Even now they are sitting down and writing checks for a year s subscription It isn t right It s a skin game I am assisting in a carefully planned skin game But perhaps they like it suggested Betty 
5304_55856_000031_000001	train-clean-360	Smith shook his head 
none	none	It is kind of you to try and soothe my conscience but it is useless I see my position too clearly Think of it Comrade Brown Thousands of poor doddering half witted creatures in Brooklyn and Flatbush who ought not really to have control of their own money at all are getting buncoed out of whatever it is per annum in exchange for how shall I put it in a forcible yet refined and gentlemanly manner for cat s meat of this description Why selling gold bricks is honest compared with it And I am temporarily responsible for the black business He extended a lean hand with melodramatic suddenness toward Betty The unexpectedness of the movement caused her to start back in her chair with a little exclamation of surprise Smith nodded with a kind of mournful satisfaction Exactly he said As I expected You shrink from me You avoid my polluted hand How could it be otherwise A conscientious green goods man would do the same He rose from his seat Your attitude he said confirms me in a decision that has been in my mind for some days I will no longer calmly accept this terrible position I will try to make amends While I am in charge I will give our public something worth reading All these Watermans and Ashers and Parslows must go Go Go repeated Smith firmly I have been thinking it over for days You cannot look me in the face Comrade Brown and say that there is a single feature which would not be better away I mean in the paper not in my face Every one of these punk pages must disappear Letters must be despatched at once informing Julia Burdett Parslow and the others and in particular B Henderson Asher who on brief acquaintance strikes me as an ideal candidate for a lethal chamber that unless they cease their contributions instantly we shall call up the police reserves Then we can begin to move Betty like most of his acquaintances seldom knew whether Smith was talking seriously or not She decided to assume till he should dismiss the idea that he meant what he said But you can t she exclaimed With your kind cooperation nothing easier You supply the mechanical work I will compose the letters First B Henderson Asher Dear Sir But she fell back on her original remark but you can t What will mister Renshaw say when he comes back Sufficient unto the day I have a suspicion that he will be the first to approve His vacation will have made him see things differently purified him as it were His conscience will be alive once more But Why should we worry ourselves because the end of this venture is wrapped in obscurity Why Columbus didn t know where he was going to when he set out All he knew was some highly interesting fact about an egg What that was I do not at the moment recall but I understand it acted on Columbus like a tonic We are the Columbuses of the journalistic world Full steam ahead and see what happens If Comrade Renshaw is not pleased why I shall have been a martyr to a good cause It is a far far better thing that I do than I have ever done so to speak Why should I allow possible inconvenience to myself to stand in the way of the happiness which we propose to inject into those Brooklyn and Flatbush homes Are you ready then once more Dear Sir Betty gave in When the letters were finished she made one more objection They are certain to call here and make a fuss she said mister Asher and the rest You think they will not bear the blow with manly fortitude I certainly do And I think it s hard on them too Suppose they depend for a living on what they make from Peaceful Moments They don t said Smith reassuringly I ve looked into that Have no pity for them They are amateurs degraded creatures of substance who take the cocktails out of the mouths of deserving professionals B Henderson Asher for instance is largely interested in gents haberdashery And so with the others We touch their pride perhaps but not their purses Betty s soft heart was distinctly relieved by the information I see she said But suppose they do call what will you do It will be very unpleasant Smith pondered True he said True I think you are right there My nervous system is so delicately attuned that anything in the shape of a brawl would reduce it to a frazzle I think that for this occasion only we will promote Comrade Maloney to the post of editor He is a stern hard rugged man who does not care how unpopular he is Yes I think that would be best He signed the letters with a firm hand per pro P Maloney editor Then he lit a cigarette and leaned back in his chair An excellent morning s work he said Already I begin to feel the dawnings of a new self respect Betty thinking the thing over a little dazed by the rapidity of Smith s method of action had found a fresh flaw in the scheme If you send mister Asher and the others away how are you going to bring the paper out at all You can t write it all yourself Smith looked at her with benevolent admiration She thinks of everything he murmured That busy brain is never still No Comrade Brown I do not propose to write the whole paper myself I do not shirk work when it gets me in a corner and I can t side step but there are limits I propose to apply to a few of my late companions of Park Row bright boys who will be delighted to come across with red hot stuff for a moderate fee And the proprietor of the paper Won t he make any objection Smith shook his head with a touch of reproof You seem determined to try to look on the dark side Do you insinuate that we are not acting in the proprietor s best interests When he gets his check for the receipts after I have handled the paper awhile he will go singing about the streets His beaming smile will be a byword Visitors will be shown it as one of the sights His only doubt will be whether to send his money to the bank or keep it in tubs and roll in it And anyway he added he s in Europe somewhere and never sees the paper sensible man He scratched a speck of dust off his coat sleeve with his finger nail This is a big thing he resumed Wait till you see the first number of the new series My idea is that Peaceful Moments shall become a pretty warm proposition Its tone shall be such that the public will wonder why we do not print it on asbestos We shall comment on all the live events of the week murders Wall Street scandals glove fights and the like in a manner which will make our readers spines thrill Above all we shall be the guardians of the people s rights We shall be a spot light showing up the dark places and bringing into prominence those who would endeavor in any way to put the people in Dutch We shall detect the wrongdoer and hand him such a series of resentful wallops that he will abandon his little games and become a model citizen In this way we shall produce a bright readable little sheet which will make our city sit up and take notice I think so I think so And now I must be hustling about and seeing our new contributors There is no time to waste

none	none	 THE HONEYED WORD The offices of Peaceful Moments were in a large building in a street off Madison Avenue They consisted of a sort of outer lair where Pugsy Maloney spent his time reading tales of life on the prairies and heading off undesirable visitors a small room into which desirable but premature visitors were loosed to wait their turn for admission into the Presence and a larger room beyond which was the editorial sanctum Smith returning from luncheon on the day following his announcement of the great change found both Betty and Pugsy waiting in the outer lair evidently with news of import
5304_55856_000004_000000	train-clean-360	 mister Smith began Betty 
none	none	Dey re in dere said Master Maloney with his customary terseness
5304_55856_000006_000000	train-clean-360	 Who exactly asked Smith

5304_55856_000008_000000	train-clean-360	Smith inspected Pugsy through his eyeglass

5304_55856_000010_000001	train-clean-360	Asher said Betty and mister Philpotts and all the rest of them She struggled for a moment but unable to resist the temptation added I told you so 
5304_55856_000011_000000	train-clean-360	A faint smile appeared upon Smith s face 
none	none	Dey just butted in said Master Maloney resuming his narrative I was sittin here readin me book when de foist of de guys blows in Boy says he is de editor in Nope I says

5304_55856_000013_000000	train-clean-360	 And what more could you have said agreed Smith approvingly 
5304_55856_000013_000001	train-clean-360	 Tell me did these gentlemen appear to be gay and light hearted or did they seem to be looking for someone with a hatchet 
none	none	Dey was hoppin mad de whole bunch of dem
5304_55856_000015_000000	train-clean-360	 Dreadfully attested Betty 
5304_55856_000016_000000	train-clean-360	 As I suspected said Smith but we must not repine 
5304_55856_000016_000001	train-clean-360	These trifling contretemps are the penalties we pay for our high journalistic aims 
none	none	I fancy that with the aid of the diplomatic smile and the honeyed word I may manage to win out Will you come and give me your moral support Comrade Brown He opened the door of the inner room for Betty and followed her in 
5304_55856_000018_000000	train-clean-360	Master Maloney s statement that about steen visitors had arrived proved to be a little exaggerated 
5304_55856_000018_000001	train-clean-360	There were five men in the room 
none	none	As Smith entered every eye was turned upon him To an outside spectator he would have seemed rather like a very well dressed Daniel introduced into a den of singularly irritable lions Five pairs of eyes were smoldering with a long nursed resentment Five brows were corrugated with wrathful lines Such however was the simple majesty of Smith s demeanor that for a moment there was dead silence 
5304_55856_000019_000005	train-clean-360	Not a word was spoken as he paced wrapped in thought to the editorial chair 
none	none	Stillness brooded over the room as he carefully dusted that piece of furniture and having done so to his satisfaction hitched up the knees of his trousers and sank gracefully into a sitting position 
5304_55856_000020_000000	train-clean-360	This accomplished he looked up and started 
none	none	He gazed round the room
5304_55856_000021_000000	train-clean-360	 Ha 
5304_55856_000021_000001	train-clean-360	I am observed he murmured 
5304_55856_000022_000000	train-clean-360	The words broke the spell 
5304_55856_000022_000001	train-clean-360	Instantly the five visitors burst simultaneously into speech 
5304_55856_000023_000000	train-clean-360	 Are you the acting editor of this paper 
5304_55856_000024_000000	train-clean-360	 I wish to have a word with you sir 
5304_55856_000025_000000	train-clean-360	 mister Maloney I presume 
5304_55856_000026_000000	train-clean-360	 Pardon me 
5304_55856_000027_000000	train-clean-360	 I should like a few moments conversation 
none	none	The start was good and even but the gentleman who said Pardon me necessarily finished first with the rest nowhere Smith turned to him bowed and fixed him with a benevolent gaze through his eyeglass
5304_55856_000030_000000	train-clean-360	 Are you mister Maloney may I ask enquired the favored one 
5304_55856_000031_000000	train-clean-360	The others paused for the reply 
none	none	Smith shook his head
5304_55856_000031_000002	train-clean-360	 My name is Smith 
none	none	Where is mister Maloney 
5304_55856_000033_000000	train-clean-360	Smith looked across at Betty who had seated herself in her place by the typewriter 
none	none	Where did you tell me mister Maloney had gone to Miss Brown 
5304_55856_000034_000001	train-clean-360	Ah well never mind 
none	none	Is there anything I can do for you gentlemen 
5304_55856_000034_000003	train-clean-360	I am on the editorial staff of this paper 
none	none	Then maybe said a small round gentleman who so far had done only chorus work you can tell me what all this means My name is Waterman sir I am here on behalf of my wife whose name you doubtless know Correct me if I am wrong said Smith but I should say it also was Waterman Luella Granville Waterman sir said the little man proudly
5304_55856_000037_000001	train-clean-360	 My wife he went on has received this extraordinary communication from a man signing himself P Maloney 
5304_55856_000037_000002	train-clean-360	We are both at a loss to make head or tail of it 
none	none	It seems reasonably clear to me said Smith reading the letter
5304_55856_000039_000000	train-clean-360	 It s an outrage 
none	none	My wife has been a contributor to this journal since its foundation We are both intimate friends of mister Renshaw to whom my wife s work has always given complete satisfaction 
5304_55856_000039_000003	train-clean-360	And now without the slightest warning comes this peremptory dismissal from P Maloney Who is P Maloney 
5304_55856_000039_000004	train-clean-360	Where is mister Renshaw 
5304_55856_000040_000000	train-clean-360	The chorus burst forth 
5304_55856_000040_000001	train-clean-360	It seemed that that was what they all wanted to know 
5304_55856_000040_000002	train-clean-360	Who was P Maloney 
5304_55856_000040_000003	train-clean-360	Where was mister Renshaw 
none	none	I am the Reverend Edwin T Philpott sir said a cadaverous looking man with light blue eyes and a melancholy face I have contributed Moments of Meditation to this journal for some considerable time Smith nodded
5304_55856_000043_000000	train-clean-360	 I know yours has always seemed to me work which the world will not willingly let die 
5304_55856_000044_000000	train-clean-360	The Reverend Edwin s frosty face thawed into a bleak smile 
5304_55856_000045_000000	train-clean-360	 And yet continued Smith I gather that P Maloney on the other hand actually wishes to hurry on its decease 
none	none	Strange A man in a serge suit who had been lurking behind Betty bobbed into the open
5304_55856_000047_000000	train-clean-360	 Where s this fellow Maloney 
none	none	P Maloney That s the man we want to see I ve been working for this paper without a break except when I had the grip for four years and now up comes this Maloney fellow if you please and tells me in so many words that the paper s got no use for me These are life s tragedies sighed Smith What does he mean by it That s what I want to know And that s what these gentlemen want to know See here I am addressing said Smith Asher s my name B Henderson Asher 
5304_55856_000051_000002	train-clean-360	I write Moments of Mirth 
none	none	A look almost of excitement came into Smith s face such a look as a visitor to a foreign land might wear when confronted with some great national monument 
5304_55856_000052_000001	train-clean-360	He stood up and shook mister Asher reverently by the hand 
5304_55856_000053_000000	train-clean-360	 Gentlemen he said reseating himself this is a painful case 
5304_55856_000053_000001	train-clean-360	The circumstances as you will admit when you have heard all are peculiar You have asked me where mister Renshaw is 
none	none	I don t know
5304_55856_000054_000000	train-clean-360	 You don t know exclaimed mister Asher 
none	none	Nobody knows With luck you may find a black cat in a coal cellar on a moonless night but not mister Renshaw 
5304_55856_000055_000002	train-clean-360	Shortly after I joined this journal he started out on a vacation by his doctor s orders and left no address 
none	none	No letters were to be forwarded 
5304_55856_000055_000004	train-clean-360	He was to enjoy complete rest 
none	none	Who can say where he is now 
5304_55856_000055_000006	train-clean-360	Possibly racing down some rugged slope in the Rockies with two grizzlies and a wildcat in earnest pursuit 
none	none	Possibly in the midst of Florida Everglades making a noise like a piece of meat in order to snare alligators 
5304_55856_000055_000008	train-clean-360	Who can tell 
5304_55856_000056_000000	train-clean-360	Silent consternation prevailed among his audience 
none	none	Then do you mean to say demanded mister Asher that this fellow Maloney s the boss here and that what he says goes 
5304_55856_000058_000000	train-clean-360	Smith bowed 
none	none	Exactly A man of intensely masterful character he will brook no opposition I am powerless to sway him Suggestions from myself as to the conduct of the paper would infuriate him He believes that radical changes are necessary in the policy of Peaceful Moments and he will carry them through if it snows Doubtless he would gladly consider your work if it fitted in with his ideas

none	none	But I have never heard of such a thing said mister Waterman indignantly
5304_55856_000061_000000	train-clean-360	 In this life said Smith shaking his head we must be prepared for every emergency 
none	none	We must distinguish between the unusual and the impossible It is unusual for the acting editor of a weekly paper to revolutionize its existing policy and you have rashly ordered your life on the assumption that it is impossible

5304_55856_000061_000004	train-clean-360	The thing comes on you as a surprise

5304_55856_000063_000001	train-clean-360	It may be that when mister Renshaw having dodged the bears and eluded the wildcat returns to his post he will decide not to continue the paper on the lines at present mapped out 
5304_55856_000063_000002	train-clean-360	He should be back in about ten weeks

5304_55856_000065_000003	train-clean-360	Smith is keeping a watchful eye on our interests

none	none	He suffers in an excellent cause CHAPTER XVI TWO VISITORS TO THE OFFICE There was once an editor of a paper in the Far West who was sitting at his desk musing pleasantly on life when a bullet crashed through the window and imbedded itself in the wall at the back of his head A happy smile lighted up the editor s face Ah he said complacently I knew that personal column of ours would make a hit What the bullet was to the Far West editor the visit of mister Martin Parker to the offices of Peaceful Moments was to Smith It occurred shortly after the publication of the second number of the new series and was directly due to Betty s first and only suggestion for the welfare of the paper If the first number of the series had not staggered humanity it had at least caused a certain amount of comment The warm weather had begun and there was nothing much going on in New York The papers were consequently free to take notice of the change in the policy of Peaceful Moments Through the agency of Smith s newspaper friends it received some very satisfactory free advertisement and the sudden increase in the sales enabled Smith to bear up with fortitude against the numerous letters of complaint from old subscribers who did not know what was good for them Visions of a large new public which should replace these Brooklyn and Flatbush ingrates filled his mind The sporting section of the paper pleased him most The personality of Kid Brady bulked large in it A photograph of the ambitious pugilist looking moody and important in an attitude of self defense filled half a page and under the photograph was the legend Jimmy Garvin must meet this boy Jimmy was the present holder of the light weight title He had won it a year before and since then had confined himself to smoking cigars as long as walking sticks and appearing nightly in a vaudeville sketch entitled A Fight for Honor His reminiscences were being published in a Sunday paper It was this that gave Smith the idea of publishing Kid Brady s autobiography in Peaceful Moments an idea which won the Kid s whole hearted gratitude Like most pugilists he had a passion for bursting into print Print is the fighter s accolade It signifies that he has arrived He was grateful to Smith too for not editing his contributions Jimmy Garvin groaned under the supervision of a member of the staff of his Sunday paper who deleted his best passages and altered the rest into Addisonian English The readers of Peaceful Moments got their Brady raw Comrade Brady said Smith meditatively to Betty one morning has a singularly pure and pleasing style It is bound to appeal powerfully to the many headed Listen to this Our hero is fighting one Benson in the latter s home town San Francisco and the audience is rooting hard for the native son Here is Comrade Brady on the subject I looked around that house and I seen I hadn t a friend in it And then the gong goes and I says to myself how I has one friend my old mother down in Illinois and I goes in and mixes it and then I seen Benson losing his goat so I gives him a half scissor hook and in the next round I picks up a sleep producer from the floor and hands it to him and he takes the count That is what the public wants Crisp lucid and to the point If that does not get him a fight with some eminent person nothing will He leaned back in his chair What we really need now he said thoughtfully is a good honest muck raking series That s the thing to put a paper on the map The worst of it is that everything seems to have been done Have you by any chance a second Frenzied Finance at the back of your mind Or proofs that nut sundaes are composed principally of ptomaine and outlying portions of the American workingman It would be the making of us Now it happened that in the course of her rambles through the city Betty had lost herself one morning in the slums The experience had impressed itself on her mind with an extraordinary vividness Her lot had always been cast in pleasant places and she had never before been brought into close touch with this side of life The sight of actual raw misery had come home to her with an added force from that circumstance Wandering on she had reached a street which eclipsed in cheerlessness even its squalid neighbors All the smells and noises of the East Side seemed to be penned up here in a sort of canyon The masses of dirty clothes hanging from the fire escapes increased the atmosphere of depression Groups of ragged children covered the roadway It was these that had stamped the scene so indelibly on her memory She loved children and these seemed so draggled and uncared for Smith s words gave her an idea Do you know Broster Street mister Smith she asked Down on the East Side Yes I went there once to get a story one red hot night in August when I was on the News The Ice Company had been putting up their prices and trouble was expected down there I was sent to cover it He did not add that he had spent a week s salary that night buying ice and distributing it among the denizens of Broster Street It s an awful place said Betty her eyes filling with tears Those poor children Smith nodded Some of those tenement houses are fierce he said thoughtfully Like Betty he found himself with a singularly clear recollection of his one visit to Broster Street But you can t do anything Why not cried Betty Oh why not Surely you couldn t have a better subject for your series It s wicked People only want to be told about them to make them better Why can t we draw attention to them It s been done already Not about Broster Street but about other tenements Tenements as a subject are played out The public isn t interested in them Besides it wouldn t be any use You can t tree the man who is really responsible unless you can spend thousands scaring up evidence The land belongs in the first place to some corporation or other They lease it to a lessee When there s a fuss they say they aren t responsible it s up to the lessee And he bright boy lies so low you can t find out who it is But we could try urged Betty Smith looked at her curiously The cause was plainly one that lay near to her heart Her face was flushed and eager He wavered and having wavered he did what no practical man should do He allowed sentiment to interfere with business He knew that a series of articles on Broster Street would probably be so much dead weight on the paper something to be skipped by the average reader but he put the thought aside Very well he said If you care to turn in a few crisp remarks on the subject I ll print them Betty s first instalment was ready on the following morning It was a curious composition A critic might have classed it with Kid Brady s reminiscences for there was a complete absence of literary style It was just a wail of pity and a cry of indignation straight from the heart and split up into paragraphs Smith read it with interest and sent it off to the printer unaltered Have another ready for next week Comrade Brown he said It s a long shot but this might turn out to be just what we need And when two days after the publication of the number containing the article mister Martin Parker called at the office he felt that the long shot had won out He was holding forth on life in general to Betty shortly before the luncheon hour when Pugsy Maloney entered bearing a card Martin Parker said Smith taking it I don t know him We make new friends daily He s a guy wit a tall shaped hat volunteered Master Maloney an he s wearing a dude suit an shiny shoes Comrade Parker said Smith approvingly has evidently not been blind to the importance of a visit to Peaceful Moments He has dressed himself in his best He has felt rightly that this is no occasion for the flannel suit and the old straw hat I would not have it otherwise It is the right spirit Show the guy in We will give him audience Pugsy withdrew mister Martin Parker proved to be a man who might have been any age between thirty five and forty five He had a dark face and a black mustache As Pugsy had stated in effect he wore a morning coat trousers with a crease which brought a smile of kindly approval to Smith s face and patent leather shoes of pronounced shininess I want to see the editor he said Will you take a seat said Smith He pushed a chair toward the visitor who seated himself with the care inspired by a perfect trouser crease There was a momentary silence while he selected a spot on the table on which to place his hat I have come about a private matter he said looking meaningly at Betty who got up and began to move toward the door Smith nodded to her and she went out Say said mister Parker hasn t something happened to this paper these last few weeks It used not to take such an interest in things used it You are very right responded Smith Comrade Renshaw s methods were good in their way I have no quarrel with Comrade Renshaw But he did not lead public thought He catered exclusively to children with water on the brain and men and women with solid ivory skulls I feel that there are other and larger publics I cannot content myself with ladling out a weekly dole of predigested mental breakfast food I Then you I guess said mister Parker are responsible for this Broster Street thing At any rate I approve of it and put it in the paper If any husky guy as Comrade Maloney would put it is anxious to aim a swift kick at the author of that article he can aim it at me I see said mister Parker He paused It said Number one in the paper Does that mean there are going to be more of them There is no flaw in your reasoning There are to be several more mister Parker looked at the door It was closed He bent forward See here he said I m going to talk straight if you ll let me Assuredly Comrade Parker There must be no secrets no restraint between us I would not have you go away and say to yourself Did I make my meaning clear Was I too elusive mister Parker scratched the floor with the point of a gleaming shoe He seemed to be searching for words Say on urged Smith Have you come to point out some flaw in that article Does it fall short in any way of your standard for such work mister Parker came to the point If I were you he said I should quit it I shouldn t go on with those articles Why enquired Smith Because said mister Parker He looked at Smith and smiled slowly an ingratiating smile Smith did not respond I do not completely gather your meaning he said I fear I must ask you to hand it to me with still more breezy frankness Do you speak from purely friendly motives Are you advising me to discontinue the series because you fear that it will damage the literary reputation of the paper Do you speak solely as a literary connoisseur Or are there other reasons mister Parker leaned forward The gentleman whom I represent Then this is no matter of your own personal taste There is another See here I m representing a gentleman who shall be nameless and I ve come on his behalf to tip you off to quit this game These articles of yours are liable to cause him inconvenience Financial Do you mean that he may possibly have to spend some of his spare doubloons in making Broster Street fit to live in It s not so much the money It s the publicity There are reasons why he would prefer not to have it made too public that he s the owner of the tenements down there Well he knows what to do If he makes Broster Street fit for a not too fastidious pig to live in mister Parker coughed A tentative cough suggesting that the situation was now about to enter upon a more delicate phase Now see here sir he said I m going to be frank I m going to put my cards on the table and see if we can t fix something up Now see here We don t want any unpleasantness You aren t in this business for your health eh You ve got your living to make same as everybody else I guess Well this is how it stands To a certain extent I don t mind owning since we re being frank with one another you ve got us that s to say this gentleman I m speaking of in a cleft stick Frankly that Broster Street story of yours has attracted attention I saw it myself in two Sunday papers and if there s going to be any more of them Well now here s a square proposition How much do you want to stop those articles That s straight I ve been frank with you and I want you to be frank with me What s your figure Name it and if you don t want the earth I guess we needn t quarrel He looked expectantly at Smith Smith gazing sadly at him through his monocle spoke quietly with the restrained dignity of some old Roman senator dealing with the enemies of the Republic Comrade Parker he said I fear that you have allowed your intercourse with this worldly city to undermine your moral sense It is useless to dangle rich bribes before the editorial eyes Peaceful Moments cannot be muzzled You doubtless mean well according to your somewhat murky lights but we are not for sale except at fifteen cents weekly From the hills of Maine to the Everglades of Florida from Portland Oregon to Melonsquashville Tennessee one sentence is in every man s mouth And what is that sentence I give you three guesses You give it up It is this Peaceful Moments cannot be muzzled mister Parker rose Nothing doing then he said Nothing mister Parker picked up his hat See here he said a grating note in his voice hitherto smooth and conciliatory I ve no time to fool away talking to you I ve given you your chance Those stories are going to be stopped And if you ve any sense in you at all you ll stop them yourself before you get hurt That s all I ve got to say and that goes He went out closing the door behind him with a bang that added emphasis to his words All very painful and disturbing murmured Smith Comrade Brown he called Betty came in Did our late visitor bite a piece out of you on his way out He was in the mood to do something of the sort He seemed angry said Betty He was angry said Smith Do you know what has happened Comrade Brown With your very first contribution to the paper you have hit the bull s eye You have done the state some service Friend Parker came as the representative of the owner of those Broster Street houses He wanted to buy us off We ve got them scared or he wouldn t have shown his hand with such refreshing candor Have you any engagements at present I was just going out to lunch if you could spare me Not alone This lunch is on the office As editor of this journal I will entertain you if you will allow me to a magnificent banquet Peaceful Moments is grateful to you Peaceful Moments he added with the contented look the Far West editor must have worn as the bullet came through the window is owing to you going some now When they returned from lunch and reentered the outer office Pugsy Maloney raising his eyes for a moment from his book met them with the information that another caller had arrived and was waiting in the inner room Dere s a guy in dere waitin to see youse he said jerking his head towards the door Yet another guy This is our busy day Did he give a name Says his name s Maude said Master Maloney turning a page Maude cried Betty falling back Smith beamed Old John Maude he said Great I ve been wondering what on earth he s been doing with himself all this time Good old John You ll like him he said turning and stopped abruptly for he was speaking to the empty air Betty had disappeared Where s Miss Brown Pugsy he said Where did she go Pugsy vouchsafed another jerk of the head in the direction of the outer door She s beaten it he said I seen her make a break for de stairs Guess she s forgotten to remember somet ing he added indifferently turning once more to his romance of prairie life Goils is bone heads CHAPTER XVII THE MAN AT THE ASTOR Refraining from discussing with Master Maloney the alleged bone headedness of girls Smith went through into the inner room and found John sitting in the editorial chair glancing through the latest number of Peaceful Moments Why John friend of my youth he said where have you been hiding all this time I called you up at your office weeks ago and an acid voice informed me that you were no longer there Have you been fired Yes said John Why aren t you on the News any more Nobody seemed to know where you were till I met Faraday this morning who told me you were here Smith was conscious of an impression that in some subtle way John had changed since their last meeting For a moment he could not have said what had given him this impression Then it flashed upon him Before John had always been like missus Fezziwig in The Christmas Carol one vast substantial smile He had beamed cheerfully on what to him was evidently the best of all possible worlds Now however it would seem that doubts had occurred to him as to the universal perfection of things His face was graver His eyes and his mouth alike gave evidence of disturbing happenings In the matter of confidences Smith was not a believer in spade work If they were offered to him he was invariably sympathetic but he never dug for them That John had something on his mind was obvious but he intended to allow him if he wished to reveal it to select his own time for the revelation John for his part had no intention of sharing this particular trouble even with Smith It was too new and intimate for discussion It was only since his return to New York that the futility of his quest had really come home to him In the belief of having at last escaped from Mervo he had been inclined to overlook obstacles It had seemed to him while he waited for his late subjects to dismiss him that once he could move all would be simple New York had dispelled that idea Logically he saw with perfect clearness there was no reason why he and Betty should ever meet again To retain a spark of hope beneath this knowledge was not easy and John having been in New York now for nearly three weeks without any encouragement from the fates was near the breaking point A gray apathy had succeeded the frenzied restlessness of the first few days The necessity for some kind of work that would to some extent occupy his mind was borne in upon him and the thought of Smith had followed naturally If anybody could supply distraction it would be Smith Faraday another of the temporary exiles from the News whom he had met by chance in Washington Square had informed him of Smith s new position and of the renaissance of Peaceful Moments and he had hurried to the office to present himself as an unskilled but willing volunteer to the cause Inspection of the current number of the paper had convinced him that the Peaceful Moments atmosphere if it could not cure would at least relieve Faraday told me all about what you had done to this paper he said I came to see if you would let me in on it I want work Excellent said Smith Consider yourself one of us I ve never done any newspaper work of course but Never cried Smith Is it so long since the deaf old college days that you forget the Gridiron In their last year at Harvard Smith and John assisted by others of a congenial spirit had published a small but lively magazine devoted to college topics with such success from one point of view that on the appearance of the third number it was suppressed by the authorities You were the life and soul of the Gridiron went on Smith You shall be the life and soul of Peaceful Moments You have special qualifications for the post A young man once called at the office of a certain newspaper and asked for a job Have you any specialty enquired the editor Yes replied the bright boy I am rather good at invective Any particular kind of invective queried the man up top No replied our hero just general invective Such is your case my son You have a genius for general invective You are the man Peaceful Moments has been waiting for If you think so I do think so Let us consider it settled And now tell me what do you think of our little journal Well aren t you asking for trouble Isn t the proprietor Smith waved his hand airily Dismiss him from your mind he said He is a gentleman of the name of Benjamin Scobell who Benjamin Scobell Who lives in Europe and never sees the paper I happen to know that he is anxious to get rid of it His solicitors have instructions to accept any reasonable offer If only I could close in on a small roll I would buy it myself for by the time we have finished our improvements it will be a sound investment for the young speculator Have you read the Broster Street story It has hit somebody already Already some unknown individual is grasping the lemon in his unwilling fingers And to remove any diffidence you may still have about lending your sympathetic aid that was written by no hardened professional but by our stenographer She ll be in soon and I ll introduce you You ll like her I do not despair later on of securing an epoch making contribution from Comrade Maloney As he spoke that bulwark of the paper entered in person bearing an envelope Ah Comrade Maloney said Smith Is that your contribution What is the subject Mustangs I have Met A kid brought dis said Pugsy Dere ain t no answer Smith read the letter with raised eyebrows We shall have to get another stenographer he said The gifted author of our Broster Street series has quit Oh said John not interested Quit at a moment s notice and without explanation I can t understand it I guess she had some reason said John absently He was inclined to be absent during these days His mind was always stealing away to occupy itself with the problem of the discovery of Betty The motives that might have led a stenographer to resign her position had no interest for him Smith shrugged his shoulders Oh Woman Woman he said resignedly She says she will send in some more Broster Street stuff though which is a comfort But I m sorry she s quit You would have liked her Yes said John At this moment there came from the outer office a piercing squeal It penetrated into the editorial sanctum losing only a small part of its strength on the way Smith looked up with patient sadness If Comrade Maloney he said is going to take to singing during business hours I fear this journal must put up its shutters Concentrated thought will be out of the question He moved to the door and flung it open as a second squeal rent the air and found Master Maloney writhing in the grip of a tough looking person in patched trousers and a stained sweater His left ear was firmly grasped between the stranger s finger and thumb The tough person released Pugsy and having eyed Smith keenly for a moment made a dash for the stairs leaving the guardian of the gate rubbing his ear resentfully He blows in said Master Maloney aggrieved an asks is de editor in I tells him no an he nips me by the ear when I tries to stop him buttin t roo Comrade Maloney said Smith you are a martyr What would Horatius have done if somebody had nipped him by the ear when he was holding the bridge It might have made all the difference Did the gentleman state his business Nope Just tried to butt t roo One of these strong silent men The world is full of us These are the perils of the journalistic life You will be safer and happier when you are a cowboy Comrade Maloney Smith was thoughtful as he returned to the inner room Things are warming up John he said The sport who has just left evidently came just to get a sight of me Otherwise why should he tear himself away without stopping for a chat I suppose he was sent to mark me down for whichever gang Comrade Parker is employing What do you mean said John All this gets past me Who is Parker Smith related the events leading up to mister Parker s visit and described what had happened on that occasion So before you throw in your lot with this journal he concluded it would be well to think the matter over You must weigh the pros and cons Is your passion for literature such that you do not mind being put out of business with a black jack for the cause Will the knowledge that a low browed gentleman is waiting round the corner for you stimulate or hinder you in your work There s no doubt now that we are up against a tough crowd By Jove said John I hadn t a notion it was like that You feel then that on the whole I feel that on the whole this is just the business I ve been hunting for You couldn t keep me out of it now with an ax Smith looked at him curiously but refrained from enquiries That there must be something at the back of this craving for adventure and excitement he knew The easy going John he had known of old would certainly not have deserted the danger zone but he would not have welcomed entry to it so keenly It was plain that he was hungry for work that would keep him from thought Smith was eminently a patient young man and though the problem of what upheaval had happened to change John to such an extent interested him greatly he was prepared to wait for explanations Of the imminence of the danger he was perfectly aware He had known from the first that mister Parker s concluding words were not an empty threat His experience as a reporter had given him the knowledge that is only given in its entirety to police and newspaper men that there are two New Yorks one a modern well policed city through which one may walk from end to end without encountering adventure the other a city as full of sinister intrigue of whisperings and conspiracies of battle murder and sudden death in dark byways as any town of mediaeval Italy Given certain conditions anything may happen in New York And Smith realized that these conditions now prevailed in his own case He had come into conflict with New York s underworld Circumstances had placed him below the surface where only his wits could help him He would have been prepared to see the thing through by himself but there was no doubt that John as an ally would be a distinct comfort Nevertheless he felt compelled to give his friend a last chance of withdrawing You know he said there is really no reason why you should But I m going to interrupted John That s all there is to it What s going to happen anyway I don t know anything about these gangs I thought they spent all their time shooting each other up Not all unfortunately Comrade John They are always charmed to take on a small job like this on the side And what does it come to Do we have an entire gang camping on our trail in a solid mass or only one or two toughs Merely a section I should imagine Comrade Parker would go to the main boss of the gang Bat Jarvis if it was the Groome Street gang or Spider Reilly and Dude Dawson if he wanted the Three Points or the Table Hill lot The boss would chat over the matter with his own special partners and they would fix it up among themselves The rest of the gang would probably know nothing about it The fewer in the game you see the fewer to divide the Parker dollars So what we have to do is to keep a lookout for a dozen or so aristocrats of that dignified deportment which comes from constant association with the main boss and if we can elude these all will be well It was by Smith s suggestion that the editorial staff of Peaceful Moments dined that night at the Astor roof garden The tired brain he said needs to recuperate To feed on such a night as this in some low down hostelry on the level of the street with German waiters breathing heavily down the back of one s neck and two fiddles and a piano hitting up ragtime about three feet from one s tympanum would be false economy Here fanned by cool breezes and surrounded by passably fair women and brave men one may do a certain amount of tissue restoring Moreover there is little danger up here of being slugged by our moth eaten acquaintance of this afternoon We shall probably find him waiting for us at the main entrance with a black jack but till then He turned with gentle grace to his soup It was a warm night and the roof garden was full From where they sat they could see the million twinkling lights of the city John watching them as he smoked a cigarette at the conclusion of the meal had fallen into a dream He came to himself with a start to find Smith in conversation with a waiter Yes my name is Smith he was saying The waiter retired to one of the tables and spoke to a young man sitting there John recollected having seen this solitary diner looking in their direction once or twice during dinner but the fact had not impressed him What s the matter he asked The man at that table sent over to ask if my name was Smith It was He is now coming along to chat in person I wonder why I don t know him from Adam The stranger was threading his way between the tables Can I have a word with you mister Smith he said The waiter brought a chair and he seated himself By the way said Smith my friend mister Maude Your own name will doubtless come up in the course of general chitchat over the coffee cups Not on your tintype it won t said the stranger decidedly It won t be needed Is mister Maude on your paper That s all right then I can go ahead He turned to Smith It s about that Broster Street thing More fame murmured Smith We certainly are making a hit with the great public over Broster Street Well you understand certain parties have got it in against you A charming conversationalist one Comrade Parker hinted at something of the sort in a recent conversation We shall endeavor however to look after ourselves You ll need to The man behind is a big bug Who is he The stranger shrugged his shoulders Search me You wouldn t expect him to give that away Then on what system have you estimated the size of the gentleman s bug hood What makes you think that he s a big bug By the number of dollars he was ready to put up to have you put through Smith s eyes gleamed for an instant but he spoke as coolly as ever Oh he said And which gang has he hired I couldn t say He his agent that is came to Bat Jarvis Bat for some reason turned the job down He did Why Search me Nobody knows But just as soon as he heard who it was he was being asked to lay for he turned it down cold Said none of his fellows was going to put a finger on anyone who had anything to do with your paper I don t know what you ve been doing to Bat but he sure is the long lost brother to you A powerful argument in favor of kindness to animals said Smith One of his celebrated stud of cats came into the possession of our stenographer What did she do Instead of having the animal made into a nourishing soup she restored it to its bereaved owner Observe the sequel We are very much obliged to Comrade Jarvis He sent me along went on the stranger to tell you to watch out because one of the other gangs was dead sure to take on the job And he said you were to know that he wasn t mixed up in it Well that s all I ll be pushing along I ve a date Glad to have met you mister Maude Good night For a few moments after he had gone Smith and John sat smoking in silence What s the time asked Smith suddenly If it s not too late Hello here comes our friend once more The stranger came up to the table a light overcoat over his dress clothes From the pocket of this he produced a watch Force of habit he said apologetically handing it to John You ll pardon me Good night again CHAPTER XVIII THE HIGHFIELD John looked after him open mouthed The events of the evening had been a revelation to him He had not realized the ramifications of New York s underworld That members of the gangs should appear in gorgeous raiment in the Astor roof garden was a surprise And now said Smith that our friend has so sportingly returned your watch take a look at it and see the time Nine Excellent We shall do it comfortably What s that asked John Our visit to the Highfield A young friend of mine who is fighting there to night sent me tickets a few days ago In your perusal of Peaceful Moments you may have chanced to see mention of one Kid Brady He is the man I was intending to go in any case but an idea has just struck me that we might combine pleasure with business Has it occurred to you that these black jack specialists may drop in on us at the office And if so that Comrade Maloney s statement that we are not in may be insufficient to keep them out Comrade Brady would be an invaluable assistant And as we are his pugilistic sponsors without whom he would not have got this fight at all I think we may say that he will do any little thing we may ask of him It was certainly true that from the moment the paper had taken up his cause Kid Brady s star had been in the ascendant The sporting pages of the big dailies had begun to notice him until finally the management of the Highfield Club had signed him on for a ten round bout with a certain Cyclone Dick Fisher He should continued Smith if equipped in any degree with the finer feelings be bubbling over with gratitude toward us At any rate it is worth investigating Far away from the comfortable glare of Broadway in a place of disheveled houses and insufficient street lamps there stands the old warehouse which modern enterprise has converted into the Highfield Athletic and Gymnastic Club The imagination stimulated by the title conjures up picture covered walls padded chairs and seas of white shirt front The Highfield differs in some respects from this fancy picture Indeed it would be hard to find a respect in which it does not differ But these names are so misleading The title under which the Highfield used to be known till a few years back was Swifty Bob s It was a good honest title You knew what to export and if you attended seances at Swifty Bob s you left your gold watch and your little savings at home But a wave of anti pugilistic feeling swept over the New York authorities Promoters of boxing contests found themselves to their acute disgust raided by the police The industry began to languish Persons avoided places where at any moment the festivities might be marred by an inrush of large men in blue uniforms armed with locust sticks And then some big brained person suggested the club idea which stands alone as an example of American dry humor At once there were no boxing contests in New York Swifty Bob and his fellows would have been shocked at the idea of such a thing All that happened now was exhibition sparring bouts between members of the club It is true that next day the papers very tactlessly reported the friendly exhibition spar as if it had been quite a serious affair but that was not the fault of Swifty Bob Kid Brady the chosen of Peaceful Moments was billed for a ten round exhibition contest to be the main event of the evening s entertainment A long journey on the subway took them to the neighborhood and after considerable wandering they arrived at their destination Smith s tickets were for a ring side box a species of sheep pen of unpolished wood with four hard chairs in it The interior of the Highfield Athletic and Gymnastic Club was severely free from anything in the shape of luxury and ornament Along the four walls were raised benches in tiers On these were seated as tough looking a collection of citizens as one might wish to see On chairs at the ringside were the reporters with tickers at their sides In the center of the room brilliantly lighted by half a dozen electric chandeliers was the ring There were preliminary bouts before the main event A burly gentleman in shirt sleeves entered the ring followed by two slim youths in fighting costume and a massive person in a red jersey blue serge trousers and yellow braces who chewed gum with an abstracted air throughout the proceedings The burly gentleman gave tongue in a voice that cleft the air like a cannon ball Ex hibit i on four round bout between Patsy Milligan and Tommy Goodley members of this club Patsy on my right Tommy on my left Gentlemen will kindly stop smokin The audience did nothing of the sort Possibly they did not apply the description to themselves Possibly they considered the appeal a mere formula Somewhere in the background a gong sounded and Patsy from the right stepped briskly forward to meet Tommy approaching from the left The contest was short but energetic At intervals the combatants would cling affectionately to one another and on these occasions the red jerseyed man still chewing gum and still wearing the same air of being lost in abstract thought would split up the mass by the simple method of ploughing his way between the pair Toward the end of the first round Thomas eluding a left swing put Patrick neatly to the floor where the latter remained for the necessary ten seconds The remaining preliminaries proved disappointing So much so that in the last of the series a soured sportsman on one of the benches near the roof began in satirical mood to whistle the Merry Widow Waltz It was here that the red jerseyed thinker for the first and last time came out of his meditative trance He leaned over the ropes and spoke without heat but firmly If that guy whistling back up yonder thinks he can do better than these boys he can come right down into the ring The whistling ceased There was a distinct air of relief when the last preliminary was finished and preparations for the main bout began It did not commence at once There were formalities to be gone through introductions and the like The burly gentleman reappeared from nowhere ushering into the ring a sheepishly grinning youth in a flannel suit In ter doo cin Young Leary he bellowed impressively a noo member of this club who will box some good boy here in September He walked to the other side of the ring and repeated the remark A raucous welcome was accorded to the new member Two other notable performers were introduced in a similar manner and then the building became suddenly full of noise for a tall youth in a bath robe attended by a little army of assistants had entered the ring One of the army carried a bright green bucket on which were painted in white letters the words Cyclone Dick Fisher A moment later there was another though a far less uproar as Kid Brady his pleasant face wearing a self conscious smirk ducked under the ropes and sat down in the opposite corner Ex hib it i on ten round bout thundered the burly gentleman between Cyclone Dick Fisher Loud applause mister Fisher was one of the famous a fighter with a reputation from New York to San Francisco He was generally considered the most likely man to give the hitherto invincible Jimmy Garvin a hard battle for the light weight championship Oh you Dick roared the crowd mister Fisher bowed benevolently and Kid Brady member of this There was noticeably less applause for the Kid He was an unknown A few of those present had heard of his victories in the West but these were but a small section of the crowd When the faint applause had ceased Smith rose to his feet Oh you Kid he observed encouragingly I should not like Comrade Brady he said reseating himself to think that he has no friend but his poor old mother as occurred on a previous occasion The burly gentleman followed by the two armies of assistants dropped down from the ring and the gong sounded mister Fisher sprang from his corner as if somebody had touched a spring He seemed to be of the opinion that if you are a cyclone it is never too soon to begin behaving like one He danced round the Kid with an india rubber agility The Peaceful Moments representative exhibited more stolidity Except for the fact that he was in fighting attitude with one gloved hand moving slowly in the neighborhood of his stocky chest and the other pawing the air on a line with his square jaw one would have said that he did not realize the position of affairs He wore the friendly smile of the good natured guest who is led forward by his hostess to join in some game to amuse the children Suddenly his opponent s long left shot out The Kid who had been strolling forward received it under the chin and continued to stroll forward as if nothing of note had happened He gave the impression of being aware that mister Fisher had committed a breach of good taste and of being resolved to pass it off with ready tact The Cyclone having executed a backward leap a forward leap and a feint landed heavily with both hands The Kid s genial smile did not even quiver but he continued to move forward His opponent s left flashed out again but this time instead of ignoring the matter the Kid replied with a heavy right swing and mister Fisher leaping back found himself against the ropes By the time he had got out of that uncongenial position two more of the Kid s swings had found their mark mister Fisher somewhat perturbed scuttled out into the middle of the ring the Kid following in his self contained stolid way The Cyclone now became still more cyclonic He had a left arm which seemed to open out in joints like a telescope Several times when the Kid appeared well out of distance there was a thud as a brown glove ripped in over his guard and jerked his head back But always he kept boring in delivering an occasional right to the body with the pleased smile of an infant destroying a Noah s ark with a tack hammer Despite these efforts however he was plainly getting all the worst of it Energetic mister Fisher relying on his long left was putting in three blows to his one When the gong sounded ending the first round the house was practically solid for the Cyclone Whoops and yells rose from everywhere The building rang with shouts of Oh you Dick Smith turned sadly to John It seems to me he said that this merry meeting looks like doing Comrade Brady no good I should not be surprised at any moment to see his head bounce off on to the floor Rounds two and three were a repetition of round one The Cyclone raged almost unchecked about the ring In one lightning rally in the third he brought his right across squarely on to the Kid s jaw It was a blow which should have knocked any boxer out The Kid merely staggered slightly and returned to business still smiling With the opening of round four there came a subtle change The Cyclone s fury was expending itself That long left shot out less sharply Instead of being knocked back by it the Peaceful Moments champion now took the hits in his stride and came shuffling in with his damaging body blows There were cheers and Oh you Dick s at the sound of the gong but there was an appealing note in them this time The gallant sportsmen whose connection with boxing was confined to watching other men fight and betting on what they considered a certainty and who would have expired promptly if anyone had tapped them sharply on their well filled vests were beginning to fear that they might lose their money after all In the fifth round the thing became a certainty Like the month of March the Cyclone who had come in like a lion was going out like a lamb A slight decrease in the pleasantness of the Kid s smile was noticeable His expression began to resemble more nearly the gloomy importance of the Peaceful Moments photographs Yells of agony from panic stricken speculators around the ring began to smite the rafters The Cyclone now but a gentle breeze clutched repeatedly hanging on like a leech till removed by the red jerseyed referee Suddenly a grisly silence fell upon the house For the Kid battered but obviously content was standing in the middle of the ring while on the ropes the Cyclone drooping like a wet sock was sliding slowly to the floor Peaceful Moments wins said Smith An omen I fancy Comrade John Penetrating into the Kid s dressing room some moments later the editorial staff found the winner of the ten round exhibition bout between members of the club seated on a chair having his right leg rubbed by a shock headed man in a sweater who had been one of his seconds during the conflict The Kid beamed as they entered Gents he said come right in Mighty glad to see you It is a relief to me Comrade Brady said Smith to find that you can see us I had expected to find that Comrade Fisher s purposeful wallops had completely closed your star likes Sure I never felt them He s a good quick boy is Dick but continued the Kid with powerful imagery he couldn t hit a hole in a block of ice cream not if he was to use a coke hammer And yet at one period in the proceedings said Smith I fancied that your head would come unglued at the neck But the fear was merely transient When you began to get going why then I felt like some watcher of the skies when a new planet swims into his ken or like stout Cortez when with eagle eyes he stared at the Pacific The Kid blinked How s that he enquired And why did I feel like that Comrade Brady I will tell you Because my faith in you was justified Because there before me stood the ideal fighting editor of Peaceful Moments It is not a post that any weakling can fill Mere charm of manner cannot qualify a man for the position No one can hold down the job simply by having a kind heart or being good at comic songs No We want a man of thews and sinews a man who would rather be hit on the head with a half brick than not And you Comrade Brady are such a man The shock headed man who during this conversation had been concentrating himself on his subject s left leg now announced that he guessed that would about do and having advised the Kid not to stop and pick daisies but to get into his clothes at once before he caught a chill bade the company goodnight and retired Smith shut the door Comrade Brady he said you know those articles about the tenements we ve been having in the paper Sure I read em They re to the good It was about time some strong josher came and put it across em So we thought Comrade Parker however totally disagreed with us Parker That s what I m coming to said Smith The day before yesterday a man named Parker called at the office and tried to buy us off You gave him the hook I guess queried the interested Kid To such an extent Comrade Brady said Smith that he left breathing threatenings and slaughter And it is for that reason that we have ventured to call upon you We re pretty sure by this time that Comrade Parker has put one of the gangs on to us You don t say exclaimed the Kid Gee They re tough propositions those gangs So we ve come along to you We can look after ourselves out of the office but what we want is someone to help in case they try to rush us there In brief a fighting editor At all costs we must have privacy No writer can prune and polish his sentences to his satisfaction if he is compelled constantly to break off in order to eject boisterous toughs We therefore offer you the job of sitting in the outer room and intercepting these bravoes before they can reach us The salary we leave to you There are doubloons and to spare in the old oak chest Take what you need and put the rest if any back How does the offer strike you Comrade Brady Gents said the Kid it s this way He slipped into his coat and resumed Now that I ve made good by licking Dick they ll be giving me a chance of a big fight Maybe with Jimmy Garvin Well if that happens see what I mean I ll have to be going away somewhere and getting into training I shouldn t be able to come and sit with you But if you gents feel like it I d be mighty glad to come in till I m wanted to go into training camp Great said Smith And touching salary Shucks said the Kid with emphasis Nix on the salary thing I wouldn t take a dime If it hadn t a been for you I d have been waiting still for a chance of lining up in the championship class That s good enough for me Any old thing you want me to do I ll do it and glad to Comrade Brady said Smith warmly you are if I may say so the goods You are beyond a doubt supremely the stuff We three then hand in hand will face the foe and if the foe has good sound sense he will keep right away You appear to be ready Shall we meander forth The building was empty and the lights were out when they emerged from the dressing room They had to grope their way in darkness It was raining when they reached the street and the only signs of life were a moist policeman and the distant glare of saloon lights down the road They turned off to the left and after walking some hundred yards found themselves in a blind alley Hello said John Where have we come to Smith sighed In my trusting way he said I had imagined that either you or Comrade Brady was in charge of this expedition and taking me by a known route to the nearest subway station I did not think to ask I placed myself without hesitation wholly in your hands I thought the Kid knew the way said John I was just taggin along with you gents protested the light weight I thought you was taking me right This is the first time I been up here Next time we three go on a little jaunt anywhere said Smith resignedly it would be as well to take a map and a corps of guides with us Otherwise we shall start for Broadway and finish up at Minneapolis They emerged from the blind alley and stood in the dark street looking doubtfully up and down it Aha said Smith suddenly I perceive a native Several natives in fact Quite a little covey of them We will put our case before them concealing nothing and rely on their advice to take us to our goal A little knot of men was approaching from the left In the darkness it was impossible to say how many of them were there Smith stepped forward the Kid at his side Excuse me sir he said to the leader but if you can spare me a moment of your valuable time There was a sudden shuffle of feet on the pavement a quick movement on the part of the Kid a chunky sound as of wood striking wood and the man Smith had been addressing fell to the ground in a heap As he fell something dropped from his hand on to the pavement with a bump and a rattle Stooping swiftly the Kid picked it up and handed it to Smith His fingers closed upon it It was a short wicked looking little bludgeon the black jack of the New York tough Get busy advised the Kid briefly CHAPTER XIX THE FIRST BATTLE The promptitude and despatch with which the Kid had attended to the gentleman with the black jack had not been without its effect on the followers of the stricken one Physical courage is not an outstanding quality of the New York gangsman His personal preference is for retreat when it is a question of unpleasantness with a stranger And in any case even when warring among themselves the gangs exhibit a lively distaste for the hard knocks of hand to hand fighting Their chosen method of battling is to lie down on the ground and shoot The Kid s rapid work on the present occasion created a good deal of confusion There was no doubt that much had been hoped for from speedy attack Also the generalship of the expedition had been in the hands of the fallen warrior His removal from the sphere of active influence had left the party without a head And to add to their discomfiture they could not account for the Kid Smith they knew and John was to be accounted for but who was this stranger with the square shoulders and the uppercut that landed like a cannon ball Something approaching a panic prevailed among the gang It was not lessened by the behavior of the intended victims John was the first to join issue He had been a few paces behind the others during the black jack incident but dark as it was he had seen enough to show him that the occasion was as Smith would have said one for the shrewd blow rather than the prolonged parley With a shout he made a football rush into the confused mass of the enemy A moment later Smith and the Kid followed and there raged over the body of the fallen leader a battle of Homeric type It was not a long affair The rules and conditions governing the encounter offended the delicate sensibilities of the gang Like artists who feel themselves trammeled by distasteful conventions they were damped and could not do themselves justice Their forte was long range fighting with pistols With that they felt en rapport But this vulgar brawling in the darkness with muscular opponents who hit hard and often with the clenched fist was distasteful to them They could not develop any enthusiasm for it They carried pistols but it was too dark and the combatants were too entangled to allow them to use these There was but one thing to be done Reluctant as they might be to abandon their fallen leader it must be done Already they were suffering grievously from John the black jack and the lightning blows of the Kid For a moment they hung wavering then stampeded in half a dozen different directions melting into the night whence they had come John full of zeal pursued one fugitive some fifty yards down the street but his quarry exhibiting a rare turn of speed easily outstripped him He came back panting to find Smith and the Kid examining the fallen leader of the departed ones with the aid of a match which went out just as John arrived The Kid struck another The head of it fell off and dropped upon the up turned face The victim stirred shook himself sat up and began to mutter something in a foggy voice He s still woozy said the Kid Still what exactly Comrade Brady In the air explained the Kid Bats in the belfry Dizzy See what I mean It s often like that when a feller puts one in with a bit of weight behind it just where that one landed Gee I remember when I fought Martin Kelly I was only starting to learn the game then Martin and me was mixing it good and hard all over the ring when suddenly he puts over a stiff one right on the point What do you think I done Fall down and take the count Not on your life I just turns round and walks straight out of the ring to my dressing room Willie Harvey who was seconding me comes tearing in after me and finds me getting into my clothes What s doing Kid he asks I m going fishin Willie I says It s a lovely day You ve lost the fight he says Fight says I What fight See what I mean I hadn t a notion of what had happened It was half an hour and more before I could remember a thing During this reminiscence the man on the ground had contrived to clear his mind of the mistiness induced by the Kid s upper cut The first sign he showed of returning intelligence was a sudden dash for safety up the road But he had not gone five yards when he sat down limply The Kid was inspired to further reminiscence Guess he s feeling pretty poor he said It s no good him trying to run for a while after he s put his chin in the way of a real live one I remember when Joe Peterson put me out way back when I was new to the game it was the same year I fought Martin Kelly He had an awful punch had old Joe and he put me down and out in the eighth round After the fight they found me on the fire escape outside my dressing room Come in Kid says they It s all right chaps I says I m dying Like that It s all right chaps I m dying Same with this guy See what I mean They formed a group about the fallen black jack expert Pardon us said Smith courteously for breaking in upon your reverie but if you could spare us a moment of your valuable time there are one or two things which we would like to know Sure thing agreed the Kid In the first place continued Smith would it be betraying professional secrets if you told us which particular bevy of energetic cutthroats it is to which you are attached Gent explained the Kid wants to know what s your gang The man on the ground muttered something that to Smith and John was unintelligible It would be a charity said the former if some philanthropist would give this fellow elocution lessons Can you interpret Comrade Brady Says it s the Three Points said the Kid The Three Points That s Spider Reilly s lot Perhaps this is Spider Reilly Nope said the Kid I know the Spider This ain t him This is some other mutt Which other mutt in particular asked Smith Try and find out Comrade Brady You seem to be able to understand what he says To me personally his remarks sound like the output of a gramophone with a hot potato in its mouth Says he s Jack Repetto announced the interpreter There was another interruption at this moment The bashful mister Repetto plainly a man who was not happy in the society of strangers made another attempt to withdraw Reaching out a pair of lean hands he pulled the Kid s legs from under him with a swift jerk and wriggling to his feet started off again down the road Once more however desire outran performance He got as far as the nearest street lamp but no further The giddiness seemed to overcome him again for he grasped the lamp post and sliding slowly to the ground sat there motionless The Kid whose fall had jolted and bruised him was inclined to be wrathful and vindictive He was the first of the three to reach the elusive mister Repetto and if that worthy had happened to be standing instead of sitting it might have gone hard with him But the Kid was not the man to attack a fallen foe He contented himself with brushing the dust off his person and addressing a richly abusive flow of remarks to mister Repetto Under the rays of the lamp it was possible to discern more closely the features of the black jack exponent There was a subtle but noticeable resemblance to those of mister Bat Jarvis Apparently the latter s oiled forelock worn low over the forehead was more a concession to the general fashion prevailing in gang circles than an expression of personal taste mister Repetto had it too In his case it was almost white for the fallen warrior was an albino His eyes which were closed had white lashes and were set as near together as Nature had been able to manage without actually running them into one another His underlip protruded and drooped Looking at him one felt instinctively that no judging committee of a beauty contest would hesitate a moment before him It soon became apparent that the light of the lamp though bestowing the doubtful privilege of a clearer view of mister Repetto s face held certain disadvantages Scarcely had the staff of Peaceful Moments reached the faint yellow pool of light in the center of which mister Repetto reclined than with a suddenness which caused them to leap into the air there sounded from the darkness down the road the crack crack crack of a revolver Instantly from the opposite direction came other shots Three bullets cut grooves in the roadway almost at John s feet The Kid gave a sudden howl Smith s hat suddenly imbued with life sprang into the air and vanished whirling into the night The thought did not come to them consciously at the moment there being little time to think but it was evident as soon as diving out of the circle of light into the sheltering darkness they crouched down and waited for the next move that a somewhat skilful ambush had been effected The other members of the gang who had fled with such remarkable speed had by no means been eliminated altogether from the game While the questioning of mister Repetto had been in progress they had crept back unperceived except by mister Repetto himself It being too dark for successful shooting it had become mister Repetto s task to lure his captors into the light which he had accomplished with considerable skill For some minutes the battle halted There was dead silence The circle of light was empty now mister Repetto had vanished A tentative shot from nowhere ripped through the air close to where Smith lay flattened on the pavement And then the pavement began to vibrate and give out a curious resonant sound Somewhere it might be near or far a policeman had heard the shots and was signaling for help to other policemen along the line by beating on the flagstones with his night stick The noise grew filling the still air Prom somewhere down the road sounded the ring of running feet De cops cried a voice Beat it Next moment the night was full of clatter The gang was beating it Smith rose to his feet and felt his wet and muddy clothes ruefully The rescue party was coming up at the gallop What s doing asked a voice Nothing now said the disgusted voice of the Kid from the shadows They ve beaten it The circle of lamplight became as if by mutual consent a general rendezvous Three gray clad policemen tough clean shaven men with keen eyes and square jaws stood there revolvers in one hand night sticks in the other Smith hatless and muddy joined them John and the Kid the latter bleeding freely from his left ear the lobe of which had been chipped by a bullet were the last to arrive What s been the rough house inquired one of the policemen mildly interested Do you know a sport of the name of Repetto enquired Smith Jack Repetto Sure He belongs to the Three Points said another intelligent officer as one naming some fashionable club When next you see him said Smith I should be obliged if you would use your authority to make him buy me a new hat I could do with another pair of trousers too but I will not press the trousers A new hat is however essential Mine has a six inch hole in it Shot at you did they said one of the policemen as who should say Tut tut Shot at us burst out the ruffled Kid What do you think s been happening Think an aeroplane ran into my ear and took half of it off Think the noise was somebody opening bottles of pop Think those guys that sneaked off down the road was just training for a Marathon Comrade Brady said Smith touches the spot He Say are you Kid Brady enquired one of the officers For the first time the constabulary had begun to display real animation Reckoned I d seen you somewhere said another You licked Cyclone Dick all right Kid I hear And who but a bone head thought he wouldn t demanded the third warmly He could whip a dozen Cyclone Dicks in the same evening with his eyes shut He s the next champeen admitted the first speaker If he juts it over Jimmy Garvin argued the second Jimmy Garvin cried the third He can whip twenty Jimmy Garvins with his feet tied I tell you I am loath observed Smith to interrupt this very impressive brain barbecue but trivial as it may seem to you to me there is a certain interest in this other little matter of my ruined hat I know that it may strike you as hypersensitive of us to protest against being riddled with bullets but Well what s been doin inquired the Force It was a nuisance this perpetual harping on trifles when the deep question of the light weight championship of the world was under discussion but the sooner it was attended to the sooner it would be over John undertook to explain The Three Points laid for us he said This man Jack Repetto was bossing the crowd The Kid put one over on to Jack Repetto s chin and we were asking him a few questions when the rest came back and started shooting Then we got to cover quick and you came up and they beat it That said Smith nodding is a very fair precis of the evening s events We should like you if you will be so good to corral this Comrade Repetto and see that he buys me a new hat We ll round Jack up said one of the policemen indulgently Do it nicely urged Smith Don t go hurting his feelings The second policeman gave it as his opinion that Jack was getting too gay The third policeman conceded this Jack he said had shown signs for some time past of asking for it in the neck It was an error on Jack s part he gave his hearers to understand to assume that the lid was completely off the great city of New York Too blamed fresh he s gettin the trio agreed They seemed to think it was too bad of Jack The wrath of the Law said Smith is very terrible We will leave the matter then in your hands In the meantime we should be glad if you would direct us to the nearest subway station Just at the moment the cheerful lights of the Great White Way are what I seem chiefly to need So ended the opening engagement of the campaign in a satisfactory but far from decisive victory for the Peaceful Moments army The victory said Smith was not bloodless Comrade Brady s ear my hat these are not slight casualties On the other hand the elimination of Comrade Repetto is pleasant I know few men whom I would not rather meet on a lonely road than Comrade Repetto He is one of nature s black jackers Probably the thing crept upon him slowly He started possibly in a merely tentative way by slugging one of the family circle His aunt let us say or his small brother But once started he is unable to resist the craving The thing grips him like dram drinking He black jacks now not because he really wants to but because he cannot help himself There s something singularly consoling in the thought that Comrade Repetto will no longer be among those present There are others said John As you justly remark said Smith there are others I am glad we have secured Comrade Brady s services We may need them CHAPTER XX BETTY AT LARGE It was not till Betty found herself many blocks distant from the office of Peaceful Moments that she checked her headlong flight She had run down the stairs and out into the street blindly filled only with that passion for escape which had swept her away from Mervo Not till she had dived into the human river of Broadway and reached Times Square did she feel secure Then with less haste she walked on to the park and sat down on a bench to think Inevitably she had placed her own construction on John s sudden appearance in New York and at the spot where only one person in any way connected with Mervo knew her to be She did not know that Smith and he were friends and did not therefore suspect that the former and not herself might be the object of his visit Nor had any word reached her of what had happened at Mervo after her departure She had taken it for granted that things had continued as she had left them and the only possible explanation to her of John s presence in New York was that acting under orders from mister Scobell he had come to try and bring her back She shuddered as she conjured up the scene that must have taken place if Pugsy had not mentioned his name and she had gone on into the inner room In itself the thought that after what she had said that morning on the island after she had forced on him stripping it of the uttermost rag of disguise the realization of how his position appeared to her he should have come under orders to bring her back was well nigh unendurable But to have met him to have seen the man she loved plunging still deeper into shame would have been pain beyond bearing Better a thousand times than that this panic flight into the iron wilderness of New York It was cool and soothing in the park The roar of the city was hushed It was pleasant to sit there and watch the squirrels playing on the green slopes or scampering up into the branches through which one could see the gleam of water Her thoughts became less chaotic The peace of the summer afternoon stole upon her It did not take her long to make up her mind that the door of Peaceful Moments was closed to her John not finding her might go away but he would return Reluctantly she abandoned the paper Her heart was heavy when she had formed the decision She had been as happy at Peaceful Moments as it was possible for her to be now She would miss Smith and the leisurely work and the feeling of being one of a team working in a good cause And that brought Broster Street back to her mind and she thought of the children No she could not abandon them She had started the tenement articles and she would go on with them But she must do it without ever venturing into the dangerous neighborhood of the office A squirrel ran up and sat begging for a nut Betty searched in the grass in the hope of finding one but came upon nothing but shells The squirrel bounded away with a disdainful flick of the tail Betty laughed You think of nothing but food You ought to be ashamed to be so greedy And then it came to her suddenly that it was no trifle this same problem of food The warm green park seemed to grow chill and gray Once again she must deal with life s material side Her case was at the same time better and worse than it had been on that other occasion when she had faced the future in the French train better because then New York had been to her something vague and terrifying while now it was her city worse because she could no longer seek help from missus Oakley That missus Oakley had given John the information which had enabled him to discover her hiding place Betty felt certain By what other possible means could he have found it Why missus Oakley whom she had considered an ally should have done so she did not know She attributed it to a change of mind a reconsideration of the case when uninfluenced by sentiment And yet it seemed strange Perhaps John had gone to her and the sight of him had won the old lady over to his side It might be so At any rate it meant that the cottage on Staten Island like the office of Peaceful Moments was closed to her She must look elsewhere for help or trust entirely to herself She sat on thinking with grave troubled eyes while the shadows lengthened and the birds rustled sleepily in the branches overhead Among the good qualities none too numerous of mister Bat Jarvis of Groome Street in the Bowery early rising was not included It was his habit to retire to rest at an advanced hour and to balance accounts by lying abed on the following morning This idiosyncrasy of his was well known in the neighborhood and respected and it was generally bold to be both bad taste and unsafe to visit Bat s shop until near the fashionable hour for luncheon when the great one shirt sleeved and smoking a short pipe would appear in the doorway looking out upon the world and giving it to understand that he was now open to be approached by deserving acquaintances When therefore at ten o clock in the morning his slumbers were cut short by a sharp rapping at the front door his first impression was that he had been dreaming When after a brief interval the noise was resumed he rose in his might and knuckling the sleep from his eyes went down tight lipped to interview this person He had got as far as a preliminary Say when speech was wiped from his lips as with a sponge and he stood gaping and ashamed for the murderer of sleep and untimely knocker on front doors was Betty mister Jarvis had not forgotten Betty His meeting with her at the office of Peaceful Moments had marked an epoch in his life Never before had anyone quite like her crossed his path and at that moment romance had come to him His was essentially a respectful admiration He was content indeed he preferred to worship from afar Of his own initiative he would never have met her again In her presence with those gray eyes of hers looking at him tremors ran down his spine and his conscience usually a battered and downtrodden wreck became fiercely aggressive She filled him with novel emotions and whether these were pleasant or painful was more than he could say He had not the gift of analysis where his feelings were concerned To himself he put it broadly that she made him feel like a nickel with a hole in it But that was not entirely satisfactory There were other and pleasanter emotions mixed in with this humility The thought of her made him feel for instance vaguely chivalrous He wanted to do risky and useful things for her Thus if any fresh guy should endeavor to get gay with her it would he felt be a privilege to fix that same guy If she should be in bad he would be more than ready to get busy on her behalf But he had never expected to meet her again certainly not on his own doorstep at ten in the morning To Bat ten in the morning was included with the small hours Betty smiled at him a little anxiously She had no suspicion that she played star to mister Jarvis moth in the latter s life and as she eyed him standing there on the doorstep her excuse for coming to him began to seem terribly flimsy Not being aware that he was in reality a tough Bayard keenly desirous of obeying her lightest word she had staked her all on the chance of his remembering the cat episode and being grateful on account of it and in the cold light of the morning this idea born in the watches of the night when things tend to lose their proportion struck her as less happy than she had fancied Suppose he had forgotten all about it Suppose he should be violent For a moment her heart sank He certainly was not a pleasing and encouraging sight as he stood there blinking at her No man looks his best immediately on rising from bed and Bat even at his best was not a hero of romance His forelock drooped dankly over his brow there was stubble on his chin his eyes were red like a dog s He did not look like the Fairy Prince who was to save her in her trouble I I hope you remember me mister Jarvis she faltered Your cat I He nodded speechlessly Hideous things happened to his face He was really trying to smile pleasantly but it seemed a scowl to Betty and her voice died away mister Jarvis spoke Ma am sure step nside Betty followed him into the shop There were birds in cages on the walls and patroling the floor a great company of cats each with its leather collar One rubbed itself against Betty s skirt She picked it up and began to stroke it And looking over its head at mister Jarvis she was aware that he was beaming sheepishly His eyes darted away the instant they met hers but Betty had seen enough to show her that she had mistaken nervousness for truculence Immediately she was at her ease and womanlike had begun to control the situation She made conversation pleasantly praising the cats admiring the birds touching lightly on the general subject of domestic pets until her woman s sixth sense told her that her host s panic had passed and that she might now proceed to discuss business I hope you don t mind my coming to you mister Jarvis she said You know you told me to if ever I were in trouble so I ve taken you at your word You don t mind mister Jarvis gulped and searched for words Glad he said at last I ve left Peaceful Moments You know I used to be stenographer there She was surprised and gratified to see a look of consternation spread itself across mister Jarvis face It was a hopeful sign that he should take her cause to heart to such an extent But mister Jarvis consternation was not due wholly to solicitude for her His thoughts at that moment put after having been expurgated into speech might have been summed up in the line Of all sad words of tongue or pen the saddest are these It might have been Ain t youse woikin dere no more Is dat right he gasped Gee I wisht I d a known it sooner Why a guy come to me and wants to give me half a ton of the long green to go to dat poiper what youse was woikin on and fix de guy what s runnin it An I truns him down cos I don t want you to be frown out of your job Say why youse quit woikin dere His eyes narrowed as an idea struck him Say he went on you ain t bin fired Has de boss give youse de trun down Cos if he has say de woid and I ll fix him for youse loidy An it won t set you back a nickel he concluded handsomely No no cried Betty horrified mister Smith has been very kind to me I left of my own free will mister Jarvis looked disappointed His demeanor was like that of some mediaeval knight called back on the eve of starting out to battle with the Paynim for the honor of his lady What was that you said about the man who came to you and offered you money asked Betty Her mind had flashed back to mister Parker s visit and her heart was beating quickly Sure He come to me all right an wants de guy on de poiper fixed An I truns him down Oh You won t dream of doing anything to hurt mister Smith will you mister Jarvis said Betty anxiously Not if you say so loidy And your friends You won t let them do anything Nope Betty breathed freely again Her knowledge of the East Side was small and that there might be those there who acted independently of mister Jarvis disdainful of his influence did not occur to her She returned to her own affairs satisfied that danger no longer threatened mister Jarvis I wonder if you can help me I want to find some work to do she said Woik I have to earn my living you see and I m afraid I don t know how to begin mister Jarvis pondered What sort of woik Any sort said Betty valiantly I don t care what it is mister Jarvis knitted his brows in thought He was not used to being an employment agency But Betty was Betty and even at the cost of a headache he must think of something At the end of five minutes inspiration came to him Say he said what do youse call de guy dat sits an takes de money at an eatin joint Cashier Well say could youse be dat It would be just the thing Do you know a place Sure Just around de corner I ll take you dere Betty waited while he put on his coat and they started out Betty chatted as they walked but mister Jarvis who appeared a little self conscious beneath the unconcealed interest of the neighbors was silent At intervals he would turn and glare ferociously at the heads that popped out of windows or protruded from doorways Fame has its penalties and most of the population of that portion of the Bowery had turned out to see their most prominent citizen so romantically employed as a squire of dames After a short walk Bat halted the expedition before a dingy restaurant The glass window bore in battered letters the name Fontelli Dis is de joint he said Inside the restaurant a dreamy eyed Italian sat gazing at vacancy and twirling a pointed mustache In a far corner a solitary customer was finishing a late breakfast Signor Fontelli for the sad eyed exile was he sprang to his feet at the sight of mister Jarvis well known figure An ingratiating but nervous smile came into view behind the pointed mustache Hey Tony said mister Jarvis coming at once to the point I want you to know dis loidy She s going to be cashier at dis joint Signor Fontelli looked at Betty and shook his head He smiled deprecatingly His manner seemed to indicate that while she met with the approval of Fontelli the slave of her sex to Fontelli the employer she appealed in vain He gave his mustache a sorrowful twirl Ah no he sighed Not da cashier do I need I take a myself da money mister Jarvis looked at him coldly He continued to look at him coldly His lower jaw began slowly to protrude and his forehead retreated further behind its zareba of forelock There was a pause The signor was plainly embarrassed Dis loidy repeated mister Jarvis is cashier at dis joint at six per He paused Does dat go he added smoothly Certainly there was magnetism about mister Jarvis With a minimum of words he produced remarkable results Something seemed to happen suddenly to Signor Fontelli s spine He wilted like a tired flower A gesture in which were blended resignation humility and a desire to be at peace with all men particularly mister Jarvis completed his capitulation mister Jarvis waited while Betty was instructed in her simple duties then drew her aside Say he remarked confidentially youse ll be all right here Six per ain t all de dough dere is in de woild but bein cashier see you can swipe a whole heap more whenever you feel like it And if Tony registers a kick I ll come around and talk to him see Dat s right Good morning loidy And having delivered these admirable hints to young cashiers in a hurry to get rich mister Jarvis ducked his head in a species of bow declined to be thanked and shuffled out into the street leaving Betty to open her new career by taking thirty seven cents from the late breakfaster CHAPTER XXI CHANGES IN THE STAFF Three days had elapsed since the battle which had opened the campaign and there had been no further movement on the part of the enemy Smith was puzzled A strange quiet seemed to be brooding over the other camp He could not believe that a single defeat had crushed the foe but it was hard to think of any other explanation It was Pugsy Maloney who on the fourth morning brought to the office the inner history of the truce His version was brief and unadorned as was the way with his narratives Such things as first causes and piquant details he avoided as tending to prolong the telling excessively thus keeping him from the perusal of his cowboy stories He gave the thing out merely as an item of general interest a bubble on the surface of the life of a great city He did not know how nearly interested were his employers in any matter touching that gang which is known as the Three Points Pugsy said Dere s been fuss n going on down where I live Dude Dawson s mad at Spider Reilly and now de Table Hills is layin for de T ree Points to soak it to em Dat s right He then retired to his outer fastness yielding further details jerkily and with the distrait air of one whose mind is elsewhere Skilfully extracted and pieced together these details formed themselves into the following typical narrative of East Side life There were four really important gangs in New York at this time There were other less important institutions besides but these were little more than mere friendly gatherings of old boyhood chums for purposes of mutual companionship They might grow into formidable organizations in time but for the moment the amount of ice which good judges declared them to cut was but small They would stick up an occasional wayfarer for his cush and they carried canisters and sometimes fired them off but these things do not signify the cutting of ice In matters political there were only four gangs which counted the East Side the Groome Street the Three Points and the Table Hill Greatest of these by virtue of their numbers were the East Side and the Groome Street the latter presided over at the time of this story by mister Bat Jarvis These two were colossal and though they might fight each other were immune from attack at the hands of the rest But between the other gangs and especially between the Table Hill and the Three Points which were much of a size warfare raged as frequently as among the Republics of South America There had always been bad blood between the Table Hill and the Three Points Little events trifling in themselves had always occurred to shatter friendly relations just when there seemed a chance of their being formed Thus just as the Table Hillites were beginning to forgive the Three Points for shooting the redoubtable Paul Horgan down at Coney Island a Three Pointer injudiciously wiped out a Table Hillite near Canal Street He pleaded self defense and in any case it was probably mere thoughtlessness but nevertheless the Table Hillites were ruffled That had been a month or so back During that month things had been simmering down and peace was just preparing to brood when there occurred the incident alluded to by Pugsy the regrettable falling out between Dude Dawson and Spider Reilly To be as brief as possible Dude Dawson had gone to spend a happy evening at a dancing saloon named Shamrock Hall near Groome Street Now Shamrock Hall belonged to a mister Maginnis a friend of Bat Jarvis and was under the direct protection of that celebrity It was therefore sacred ground and mister Dawson visited it in a purely private and peaceful capacity The last thing he intended was to spoil the harmony of the evening Alas for the best intentions Two stepping clumsily round the room for he was a poor though enthusiastic dancer Dude Dawson collided with and upset a certain Reddy Davis and his partner Reddy Davis was a member of the Three Points and his temper was the temper of a red headed man He slugged mister Dawson mister Dawson more skilful at the fray than at the dance joined battle willingly and they were absorbed in a stirring combat when an interruption occurred In the far corner of the room surrounded by admiring friends sat Spider Reilly monarch of the Three Points He had noticed that there was a slight disturbance at the other side of the hall but had given it little attention till the dancing ceasing suddenly and the floor emptying itself of its crowd he had a plain view of mister Dawson and mister Davis squaring up at each other for the second round We must assume that mister Reilly was not thinking of what he did for his action was contrary to all rules of gang etiquette In the street it would have been perfectly legitimate even praiseworthy but in a dance hall under the protection of a neutral power it was unpardonable What he did was to produce his revolver and shoot the unsuspecting mister Dawson in the leg Having done which he left hurriedly fearing the wrath of Bat Jarvis mister Dawson meanwhile was attended to and helped home Willing informants gave him the name of his aggressor and before morning the Table Hill camp was in a ferment Shooting broke out in three places though there were no casualties When the day dawned there existed between the two gangs a state of war more bitter than any in their record for this time it was chieftain who had assaulted chieftain Royal blood had been spilt Such was the explanation of the lull in the campaign against Peaceful Moments The new war had taken the mind of Spider Reilly and his warriors off the paper and its affairs for the moment much as the unexpected appearance of a mad bull would make a man forget that he had come out snipe shooting At present there had been no pitched battle As was usual between the gangs war had broken out in a somewhat tentative fashion at first There had been skirmishes by the wayside but nothing more The two armies were sparring for an opening Smith was distinctly relieved at the respite for necessitating careful thought This was the defection of Kid Brady The Kid s easy defeat of Cyclone Dick Fisher had naturally created a sensation in sporting circles He had become famous in a night It was not with surprise therefore that Smith received from his fighting editor the information that he had been matched against one Eddie Wood whose fame outshone even that of the late Cyclone The Kid a white man to the core exhibited quite a feudal loyalty to the paper which had raised him from the ruck and placed him on the road to eminence Say the word he said and I ll call it off If you feel you need me around here mister Smith say so and I ll side step Eddie Comrade Brady said Smith with enthusiasm I have had occasion before to call you sport I do so again But I m not going to stand in your way If you eliminate this Comrade Wood they will have to give you a chance against Jimmy Garvin won t they I guess that s right said the Kid Eddie stayed nineteen rounds against Jimmy and if I can put him away it gets me clear into line with Jim and he ll have to meet me Then go in and win Comrade Brady We shall miss you It will be as if a ray of sunshine had been removed from the office But you mustn t throw a chance away I ll train at White Plains said the Kid so I ll be pretty near in case I m wanted Oh we shall be all right said Smith and if you win we ll bring out a special number Good luck Comrade Brady and many thanks for your help John when he arrived at the office and learned the news was for relying on their own unaided efforts And anyway he said I don t see who else there is to help us You could tell the police I suppose he went on doubtfully Smith shook his head The New York policeman Comrade John is like all great men somewhat peculiar If you go to a New York policeman and exhibit a black eye he is more likely to express admiration for the handiwork of the citizen responsible for the same than sympathy No since coming to this city I have developed a habit of taking care of myself or employing private help I do not want allies who will merely shake their heads at Comrade Reilly and his merry men however sternly I want someone who if necessary will soak it to them good Sure said John But who is there now the Kid s gone Who else but Comrade Jarvis said Smith Jarvis Bat Jarvis The same I fancy that we shall find on enquiry that we are ace high with him At any rate there is no harm in sounding him It is true that he may have forgotten or it may be that it is to Comrade Brown alone that he is Who s Brown asked John Our late stenographer explained Smith A Miss Brown She entertained Comrade Jarvis cat if you remember I wonder what has become of her She has sent in three more corking efforts on the subject of Broster Street but she gives no address I wish I knew where she was I d have liked for you to meet her CHAPTER XXII A GATHERING OF CAT SPECIALISTS It will probably be necessary said Smith as they set out for Groome Street to allude to you Comrade John in the course of this interview as one of our most eminent living cat fanciers You have never met Comrade Jarvis I believe Well he is a gentleman with just about enough forehead to prevent his front hair getting inextricably blended with his eyebrows and he owns twenty three cats each with a leather collar round its neck It is I fancy the cat note which we shall have to strike to day If only Comrade Brown were with us we could appeal to his finer feelings But he has seen me only once and you never and I should not care to bet that he will feel the least particle of dismay at the idea of our occiputs getting all mussed up with a black jack But when I inform him that you are an English cat fancier and that in your island home you have seventy four fine cats mostly Angoras that will be a different matter I shall be surprised if he does not fall on your neck They found mister Jarvis in his fancier s shop engaged in the intellectual occupation of greasing a cat s paws with butter He looked up as they entered and then resumed his task Comrade Jarvis said Smith we meet again You remember me Nope said mister Jarvis promptly Smith was not discouraged Ah he said tolerantly the fierce rush of New York life How it wipes from the retina to day the image impressed on it but yesterday Is it not so Comrade Jarvis The cat expert concentrated himself on his patient s paws without replying A fine animal said Smith adjusting his monocle To what particular family of the Felis Domestica does that belong In color it resembles a Neapolitan ice more than anything mister Jarvis manner became unfriendly Say what do youse want That s straight ain t it If youse want to buy a boid or a snake why don t youse say so I stand corrected said Smith I should have remembered that time is money I called in here partly in the hope that though you only met me once on the stairs of my office you might retain pleasant recollections of me but principally in order that I might make two very eminent cat fanciers acquainted This he said with a wave of his hand in the direction of John is Comrade Maude possibly the best known of English cat fanciers Comrade Maude s stud of Angoras is celebrated wherever the English language is spoken mister Jarvis s expression changed He rose and having inspected John with silent admiration for a while extended a well buttered hand towards him Smith looked on benevolently What Comrade Maude does not know about cats he said is not knowledge His information on Angoras alone would fill a volume Say mister Jarvis was evidently touching on a point which had weighed deeply upon him why s catnip called catnip John looked at Smith helplessly It sounded like a riddle but it was obvious that mister Jarvis s motive in putting the question was not frivolous He really wished to know The word as Comrade Maude was just about to observe said Smith is a corruption of catmint Why it should be so corrupted I do not know But what of that The subject is too deep to be gone fully into at the moment I should recommend you to read mister Maude s little brochure on the matter Passing lightly on from that Did youse ever have a cat dat ate bettles enquired mister Jarvis There was a time when many of Comrade Maude s Felidae supported life almost entirely on beetles Did they git thin John felt it was time if he were to preserve his reputation to assert himself No he replied firmly mister Jarvis looked astonished English beetles said Smith don t make cats thin Passing lightly I had a cat oncst said mister Jarvis ignoring the remark and sticking to his point dat ate beetles and got thin and used to tie itself inter knots A versatile animal agreed Smith Say mister Jarvis went on now plainly on a subject near to his heart dem beetles is fierce Sure Can t keep de cats off of eatin dem I can t First t ing you know dey ve swallowed dem and den dey gits thin and ties theirselves into knots You should put them into strait waistcoats said Smith Passing however lightly Say ever have a cross eyed cat Comrade Maude s cats said Smith have happily been almost entirely free from strabismus Dey s lucky cross eyed cats is You has a cross eyed cat and not in don t never go wrong But say was dere ever a cat wit one blue and one yaller one in your bunch Gee it s fierce when it s like dat It s a skidoo is a cat wit one blue eye and one yaller one Puts you in bad surest t ing you know Oncst a guy give me a cat like dat and first t ing you know I m in bad all round It wasn t till I give him away to de cop on de corner and gets me one dat s cross eyed dat I lifts de skidoo off of me And what happened to the cop enquired Smith interested Oh he got in bad sure enough said mister Jarvis without emotion One of de boys what he d pinched and had sent up the road once lays for him and puts one over on him wit a black jack Sure Dat s what comes of havin a cat wit one blue and one yaller one mister Jarvis relapsed into silence He seemed to be meditating on the inscrutable workings of Fate Smith took advantage of the pause to leave the cat topic and touch on matters of more vital import Tense and exhilarating as is this discussion of the optical peculiarities of cats he said there is another matter on which if you will permit me I should like to touch I would hesitate to bore you with my own private troubles but this is a matter which concerns Comrade Maude as well as myself and I can see that your regard for Comrade Maude is almost an obsession How s that I can see said Smith that Comrade Maude is a man to whom you give the glad hand mister Jarvis regarded John with respectful affection Sure He s to the good mister Maude is Exactly said Smith To resume then The fact is Comrade Jarvis we are much persecuted by scoundrels How sad it is in this world We look to every side We look to north east south and west and what do we see Mainly scoundrels I fancy you have heard a little about our troubles before this In fact I gather that the same scoundrels actually approached you with a view to engaging your services to do us up but that you very handsomely refused the contract We are the staff of Peaceful Moments Peaceful Moments said mister Jarvis Sure dat s right A guy comes to me and says he wants you put through it but I gives him de trundown So I was informed said Smith Well failing you they went to a gentleman of the name of Reilly Spider Reilly Exactly Spider Reilly the lessee and manager of the Three Points gang mister Jarvis frowned Dose T ree Points dey re to de bad Dey re fresh It is too true Comrade Jarvis Say went on mister Jarvis waxing wrathful at the recollection what do youse t ink dem fresh stiffs done de odder night Started some rough woik in me own dance joint Shamrock Hall said Smith I heard about it Dat s right Shamrock Hall Got gay dey did wit some of the Table Hillers Say I got it in for dem gazebos sure I have Surest t ing you know Smith beamed approval That he said is the right spirit Nothing could be more admirable We are bound together by our common desire to check the ever growing spirit of freshness among the members of the Three Points Add to that the fact that we are united by a sympathetic knowledge of the manners and customs of cats and especially that Comrade Maude England s greatest fancier is our mutual friend and what more do we want Nothing mister Maude s to de good assented mister Jarvis eying John once more in friendly fashion We are all to the good said Smith Now the thing I wished to ask you is this The office of the paper was until this morning securely guarded by Comrade Brady whose name will be familiar to you De Kid On the bull s eye as usual Kid Brady the coming light weight champion of the world Well he has unfortunately been compelled to leave us and the way into the office is consequently clear to any sand bag specialist who cares to wander in So what I came to ask was will you take Comrade Brady s place for a few days How s that Will you come in and sit in the office for the next day or so and help hold the fort I may mention that there is money attached to the job We will pay for your services mister Jarvis reflected but a brief moment Why sure he said Me fer dat Excellent Comrade Jarvis Nothing could be better We will see you to morrow then I rather fancy that the gay band of Three Pointers who will undoubtedly visit the offices of Peaceful Moments in the next few days is scheduled to run up against the surprise of their lives Sure t ing I ll bring me canister Do said Smith In certain circumstances one canister is worth a flood of rhetoric Till to morrow then Comrade Jarvis I am very much obliged to you Not at all a bad hour s work he said complacently as they turned out of Groome Street A vote of thanks to you John for your invaluable assistance I didn t do much said John with a grin Apparently no In reality yes Your manner was exactly right Reserved yet not haughty Just what an eminent cat fancier s manner should be I could see that you made a pronounced hit with Comrade Jarvis By the way as he is going to show up at the office to morrow perhaps it would be as well if you were to look up a few facts bearing on the feline world There is no knowing what thirst for information a night s rest may not give Comrade Jarvis I do not presume to dictate but if you were to make yourself a thorough master of the subject of catnip for instance it might quite possibly come in useful CHAPTER XXIII THE RETIREMENT OF SMITH The first member of the staff of Peaceful Moments to arrive at the office on the following morning was Master Maloney This sounds like the beginning of a Plod and Punctuality or How Great Fortunes have been Made story but as a matter of fact Master Maloney like mister Bat Jarvis was no early bird Larks who rose in his neighborhood rose alone He did not get up with them He was supposed to be at the office at nine o clock It was a point of honor with him a sort of daily declaration of independence never to put in an appearance before nine thirty On this particular morning he was punctual to the minute or half an hour late whichever way you choose to look at it He had only whistled a few bars of My Little Irish Rose and had barely got into the first page of his story of life on the prairie when Kid Brady appeared The Kid had come to pay a farewell visit He had not yet begun training and he was making the best of the short time before such comforts should be forbidden by smoking a big black cigar Master Maloney eyed him admiringly The Kid unknown to that gentleman himself was Pugsy s ideal He came from the Plains and had indeed once actually been a cowboy he was a coming champion and he could smoke big black cigars There was no trace of his official well what is it now air about Pugsy as he laid down his book and prepared to converse Say mister Smith around anywhere Pugsy asked the Kid Naw mister Brady He ain t came yet replied Master Maloney respectfully Late ain t he Sure He generally blows in before I do Wonder what s keepin him As he spoke John appeared Hello Kid he said Come to say good by Yep said the Kid Seen mister Smith around anywhere mister Maude Hasn t he come yet I guess he ll be here soon Hello who s this A small boy was standing at the door holding a note mister Maude he said Cop at Jefferson Market give me dis fer you What He took the letter and gave the boy a dime Why it s from Smith Great Scott It was apparent that the Kid was politely endeavoring to veil his curiosity Master Maloney had no such delicacy What s in de letter boss he enquired The letter said John slowly is from mister Smith And it says that he was sentenced this morning to thirty days on the Island for resisting the police He s de guy admitted Master Maloney approvingly What s that said the Kid mister Smith been slugging cops What s he been doin that for I must go and find out at once It beats me It did not take John long to reach Jefferson Market and by the judicious expenditure of a few dollars he was enabled to obtain an interview with Smith in a back room The editor of Peaceful Moments was seated on a bench looking remarkably disheveled There was a bruise on his forehead just where the hair began He was however cheerful Ah John he said You got my note all right then John looked at him concerned What on earth does it all mean Smith heaved a regretful sigh I fear he said I have made precisely the blamed fool of myself that Comrade Parker hoped I would Parker Smith nodded I may be misjudging him but I seem to see the hand of Comrade Parker in this We had a raid at my house last night John We were pulled What on earth Somebody if it was not Comrade Parker it was some other citizen dripping with public spirit tipped the police off that certain sports were running a pool room in the house where I live On his departure from the News Smith from motives of economy had moved from his hotel in Washington Square and taken a furnished room on Fourteenth Street There actually was a pool room there he went on so possibly I am wronging Comrade Parker in thinking that this was a scheme of his for getting me out of the way At any rate somebody gave the tip and at about three o clock this morning I was aroused from a dreamless slumber by quite a considerable hammering at my door There standing on the mat were two policemen Very cordially the honest fellows invited me to go with them A conveyance it seemed waited in the street without I disclaimed all connection with the bad gambling persons below but they replied that they were cleaning up the house and if I wished to make any remarks I had better make them to the magistrate This seemed reasonable I said I would put on some clothes and come along They demurred They said they couldn t wait about while I put on clothes I pointed out that sky blue pajamas with old rose frogs were not the costume in which the editor of a great New York weekly paper should be seen abroad in one of the world s greatest cities but they assured me more by their manner than their words that my misgivings were groundless so I yielded These men I told myself have lived longer in New York than I They know what is done and what is not done I will bow to their views So I was starting to go with them like a lamb when one of them gave me a shove in the ribs with his night stick And it was here that I fancy I may have committed a slight error of policy He smiled dreamily for a moment then went on I admit that the old Berserk blood of the Smiths boiled at that juncture I picked up a sleep producer from the floor as Comrade Brady would say and handed it to the big stick merchant He went down like a sack of coal over the bookcase and at that moment I rather fancy the other gentleman must have got busy with his club At any rate somebody suddenly loosed off some fifty thousand dollars worth of fireworks and the next thing I knew was that the curtain had risen for the next act on me discovered sitting in a prison cell with an out size in lumps on my forehead He sighed again What Peaceful Moments really needs he said is a sitz redacteur A sitz redacteur John is a gentleman employed by German newspapers with a taste for lese majeste to go to prison whenever required in place of the real editor The real editor hints in his bright and snappy editorial for instance that the Kaiser s mustache gives him bad dreams The police force swoops down in a body on the office of the journal and are met by the sitz redacteur who goes with them cheerfully allowing the editor to remain and sketch out plans for his next week s article on the Crown Prince We need a sitz redacteur on Peaceful Moments almost as much as a fighting editor Not now of course This has finished the thing You ll have to close down the paper now Close it down cried John You bet I won t My dear old son said Smith seriously what earthly reason have you for going on with it You only came in to help me and I am no more I am gone like some beautiful flower that withers in the night Where s the sense of getting yourself beaten up then Quit John shook his head I wouldn t quit now if you paid me But A policeman appeared at the door Say pal he remarked to John you ll have to be fading away soon I guess Give you three minutes more Say it quick He retired Smith looked at John You won t quit he said No Smith smiled You re an all wool sport John he said I don t suppose you know how to spell quit Well then if you are determined to stand by the ship like Comrade Casabianca I ll tell you an idea that came to me in the watches of the night If ever you want to get ideas John you spend a night in one of these cells They flock to you I suppose I did more profound thinking last night than I ve ever done in my life Well here s the idea Act on it or not as you please I was thinking over the whole business from soup to nuts and it struck me that the queerest part of it all is that whoever owns these Broster Street tenements should care a Canadian dime whether we find out who he is or not Well there s the publicity began John Tush said Smith And possibly bah Do you suppose that the sort of man who runs Broster Street is likely to care a darn about publicity What does it matter to him if the papers soak it to him for about two days He knows they ll drop him and go on to something else on the third and he knows he s broken no law No there s something more in this business than that Don t think that this bright boy wants to hush us up simply because he is a sensitive plant who can t bear to think that people should be cross with him He has got some private reason for wanting to lie low Well but what difference Comrade I ll tell you It makes this difference that the rents are almost certainly collected by some confidential person belonging to his own crowd not by an ordinary collector In other words the collector knows the name of the man he s collecting for But for this little misfortune of mine I was going to suggest that we waylay that collector administer the Third Degree and ask him who his boss is John uttered an exclamation You re right I ll do it You think you can Alone Sure Don t you worry I ll The door opened and the policeman reappeared Time s up Slide sonny John said good by to Smith and went out He had a last glimpse of his late editor a sad smile on his face telling the policeman what was apparently a humorous story Complete good will seemed to exist between them John consoled himself as he went away with the reflection that Smith s was a temperament that would probably find a bright side even to a thirty days visit to Blackwell s Island He walked thoughtfully back to the office There was something lonely and yet wonderfully exhilarating in the realization that he was now alone and in sole charge of the campaign It braced him For the first time in several weeks he felt positively light hearted CHAPTER XXIV THE CAMPAIGN QUICKENS mister Jarvis was as good as his word Early in the afternoon he made his appearance at the office of Peaceful Moments his forelock more than usually well oiled in honor of the occasion and his right coat pocket bulging in a manner that betrayed to the initiated eye the presence of his trusty canister With him in addition he brought a long thin young man who wore under his brown tweed coat a blue and red striped sweater Whether he brought him as an ally in case of need or merely as a kindred soul with whom he might commune during his vigil did not appear Pugsy startled out of his wonted calm by the arrival of this distinguished company gazed after the pair as they passed into the inner office with protruding eyes John greeted the allies warmly and explained Smith s absence mister Jarvis listened to the story with interest and introduced his colleague T ought I d let him chase along Long Otto s his monaker Sure said John The more the merrier Take a seat You ll find cigars over there You won t mind my not talking for the moment There s a wad of work to clear up This was an overstatement He was comparatively free of work press day having only just gone by but he was keenly anxious to avoid conversation on the subject of cats of his ignorance of which mister Jarvis s appearance had suddenly reminded him He took up an old proof sheet and began to glance through it frowning thoughtfully mister Jarvis regarded the paraphernalia of literature on the table with interest So did Long Otto who however being a man of silent habit made no comment Throughout the seance and the events which followed it he confined himself to an occasional grunt He seemed to lack other modes of expression Is dis where youse writes up pieces fer de poiper enquired mister Jarvis This is the spot said John On busy mornings you could hear our brains buzzing in Madison Square Garden Oh one moment He rose and went into the outer office Pugsy he said do you know Broster Street Sure Could you find out for me exactly when the man comes round collecting the rents Surest t ing you know I knows a kid what knows anodder kid what lives dere Then go and do it now And after you ve found out you can take the rest of the day off Me fer dat said Master Maloney with enthusiasm I ll take me goil to de Bronx Zoo Your girl I didn t know you d got a girl Pugsy I always imagined you as one of those strong stern blood and iron men who despised girls Who is she Aw she s a kid said Pugsy Her pa runs a delicatessen shop down our street She ain t a bad mutt added the ardent swain I m her steady Well mind you send me a card for the wedding And if two dollars would be a help Sure t ing T anks boss You re all right It had occurred to John that the less time Pugsy spent in the outer office during the next few days the better The lull in the warfare could not last much longer and at any moment a visit from Spider Reilly and his adherents might be expected Their probable first move in such an event would be to knock Master Maloney on the head to prevent his giving warning of their approach Events proved that he had not been mistaken He had not been back in the inner office for more than a quarter of an hour when there came from without the sound of stealthy movements The handle of the door began to revolve slowly and quietly The next moment three figures tumbled into the room It was evident that they had not expected to find the door unlocked and the absence of resistance when they applied their weight had surprising effects Two of the three did not pause in their career till they cannoned against the table The third checked himself by holding the handle John got up coolly Come right in he said What can we do for you It had been too dark on the other occasion of his meeting with the Three Pointers to take note of their faces though he fancied that he had seen the man holding the door handle before The others were strangers They were all exceedingly unprepossessing in appearance There was a pause The three marauders had become aware of the presence of mister Jarvis and his colleague and the meeting was causing them embarrassment which may have been due in part to the fact that both had produced and were toying meditatively with ugly looking pistols mister Jarvis spoke Well he said what s doin The man to whom the question was directly addressed appeared to have some difficulty in finding a reply He shuffled his feet and looked at the floor His two companions seemed equally at a loss Goin to start anything enquired mister Jarvis casually The humor of the situation suddenly tickled John The embarrassment of the uninvited guests was ludicrous You ve just dropped in for a quiet chat is that it he said Well we re all delighted to see you The cigars are on the table Draw up your chairs mister Jarvis opposed the motion He drew slow circles in the air with his revolver Say Youse had best beat it See Long Otto grunted sympathy with the advice And youse had best go back to Spider Reilly continued mister Jarvis and tell him there ain t nothin doing in the way of rough house wit dis gent here And you can tell de Spider went on Bat with growing ferocity dat next time he gits fresh and starts in to shootin up my dance joint I ll bite de head off n him See Dat goes If he t inks his little two by four crowd can git way wit de Groome Street he s got anodder guess comin An don t fergit dis gent here and me is friends and anyone dat starts anyt ing wit dis gent is going to find trouble Does dat go Beat it He jerked his shoulder in the direction of the door The delegation then withdrew Thanks said John I m much obliged to you both You re certainly there with the goods as fighting editors I don t know what I should have done without you Aw Chee said mister Jarvis handsomely dismissing the matter Long Otto kicked the leg of a table and grunted Pugsy Maloney s report on the following morning was entirely satisfactory Rents were collected in Broster Street on Thursdays Nothing could have been more convenient for that very day happened to be Thursday I rubbered around said Pugsy an done de sleut act an it s this way Dere s a feller blows in every T ursday bout six o clock an den it s up to de folks to dig down inter deir jeans for de stuff or out dey goes before supper I got dat from my kid frien what knows a kid what lives dere An say he has it pretty fierce dat kid De kid what lives dere He s a wop kid an Italian an he s in bad cos his pa comes over from Italy to woik on de subway I don t see why that puts him in bad said John wonderingly You don t construct your stories well Pugsy You start at the end then go back to any part which happens to appeal to you at the moment and eventually wind up at the beginning Why is this kid in bad because his father has come to work on the subway Why sure because his pa got fired an swatted de foreman one on de coco an dey gives him t oity days So de kid s all alone an no one to pay de rent I see said John Well come along with me and introduce me and I ll look after that At half past five John closed the office for the day and armed with a big stick and conducted by Master Maloney made his way to Broster Street To reach it it was necessary to pass through a section of the enemy s country but the perilous passage was safely negotiated The expedition reached its unsavory goal intact The wop kid inhabited a small room at the very top of a building half way down the street He was out when John and Pugsy arrived It was not an abode of luxury the tenement they had to feel their way up the stairs in almost pitch darkness Most of the doors were shut but one on the second floor was ajar Through the opening John had a glimpse of a number of women sitting on up turned boxes The floor was covered with little heaps of linen All the women were sewing Stumbling in the darkness John almost fell against the door None of the women looked up at the noise In Broster Street time was evidently money On the top floor Pugsy halted before the open door of an empty room The architect in this case had apparently given rein to a passion for originality for he had constructed the apartment without a window of any sort whatsoever The entire stock of air used by the occupants came through a small opening over the door It was a warm day and John recoiled hastily Is this the kid s room he said I guess the corridor s good enough for me to wait in What the owner of this place wants he went on reflectively is scalping Well we ll do it in the paper if we can t in any other way Is this your kid A small boy had appeared He seemed surprised to see visitors Pugsy undertook to do the honors Pugsy as interpreter was energetic but not wholly successful He appeared to have a fixed idea that the Italian language was one easily mastered by the simple method of saying da instead of the and adding a final a to any word that seemed to him to need one Say kid he began has da rent a man come yet a The black eyes of the wop kid clouded He gesticulated and said something in his native language He hasn t got next reported Master Maloney He can t git on to me curves Dese wop kids is all bone heads Say kid look a here He walked to the door rapped on it smartly and assuming a look of extreme ferocity stretched out his hand and thundered Unbelt a Slip a me da stuff The wop kid s puzzlement in the face of this address became pathetic This said John deeply interested is getting exciting Don t give in Pugsy I guess the trouble is that your too perfect Italian accent is making the kid homesick Master Maloney made a gesture of disgust I m t roo Dese Dagoes makes me tired Dey don t know enough to go upstairs to take de elevated Beat it you mutt he observed with moody displeasure accompanying the words with a gesture which conveyed its own meaning The wop kid plainly glad to get away slipped down the stairs like a shadow Pugsy shrugged his shoulders Boss he said resignedly it s up to youse John reflected It s all right he said Of course if the collector had been here the kid wouldn t be All I ve got to do is to wait He peered over the banisters into the darkness below Not that it s not enough he said for of all the poisonous places I ever met this is the worst I wish whoever built it had thought to put in a few windows His idea of ventilation was apparently to leave a hole about the size of a lima bean and let the thing go at that I guess there s a door on to de roof somewhere suggested Pugsy At de joint where I lives dere is His surmise proved correct At the end of the passage a ladder nailed against the wall ended in a large square opening through which was visible if not that narrow strip of blue which prisoners call the sky at any rate a tall brick chimney and a clothesline covered with garments that waved lazily in the breeze John stood beneath it looking up Well he said this isn t much but it s better than nothing I suppose the architect of this place was one of those fellows who don t begin to appreciate air till it s thick enough to scoop chunks out with a spoon It s an acquired taste I guess like Limburger cheese And now Pugsy old scout you had better beat it There may be a rough house here any minute now Pugsy looked up indignant Beat it While your shoe leather s good said John firmly This is no place for a minister s son Take it from me I want to stop and pipe de fun objected Master Maloney What fun I guess you ain t here to play ball surmised Pugsy shrewdly eying the big stick Never mind why I m here said John Beat it I ll tell you all about it to morrow Master Maloney prepared reluctantly to depart As he did so there was a sound of well shod feet on the stairs and a man in a snuff colored suit wearing a brown Homburg hat and carrying a small notebook in one hand walked briskly up the stairs His whole appearance proclaimed him to be the long expected collector of rents CHAPTER XXV CORNERED He did not see John for a moment and had reached the door of the room when he became aware of a presence He turned in surprise He was a smallish pale faced man with protruding eyes and teeth which gave him a certain resemblance to a rabbit Hello he said Welcome to our city said John stepping unostentatiously between him and the stairs Master Maloney who had taken advantage of the interruption to edge back into the center of things now appeared to consider the question of his departure permanently shelved He sidled to a corner of the landing and sat down on an empty soap box with the air of a dramatic critic at the opening night of a new play The scene looked good to him It promised interesting developments He was an earnest student of the drama as exhibited in the theaters of the East Side and few had ever applauded the hero of Escaped from Sing Sing or hissed the villain of Nellie the Beautiful Cloak model with more fervor He liked his drama to have plenty of action and to his practised eye this one promised well There was a set expression on John s face which suggested great things His pleasure was abruptly quenched John placing a firm hand on his collar led him to the top of the stairs and pushed him down Beat it he said The rent collector watched these things with a puzzled eye He now turned to John Say seen anything of the wops that live here he enquired My name s Gooch I ve come to take the rent John nodded I don t think there s much chance of your seeing them to night he said The father I hear is in prison You won t get any rent out of him Then it s outside for theirs said mister Gooch definitely What about the kid said John Where s he to go That s up to him Nothing to do with me I m only acting under orders from up top Whose orders enquired John The gent who owns this joint Who is he Suspicion crept into the protruding eyes of the rent collector Say he demanded Who are you anyway and what do you think you re doing here That s what I d like to know What do you want with the name of the owner of this place What business is it of yours I m a newspaper man I guessed you were said mister Gooch with triumph You can t bluff me Well it s no good sonny I ve nothing for you You d better chase off and try something else He became more friendly Say though he said I just guessed you were from some paper I wish I could give you a story but I can t I guess it s this Peaceful Moments business that s been and put your editor on to this joint ain t it Say though that s a queer thing that paper Why only a few weeks ago it used to be a sort of take home and read to the kids affair A friend of mine used to buy it regular And then suddenly it comes out with a regular whoop and starts knocking these tenements and boosting Kid Brady and all that It gets past me All I know is that it s begun to get this place talked about Why you see for yourself how it is Here is your editor sending you down to get a story about it But say those Peaceful Moments guys are taking big risks I tell you straight they are and I know I happen to be wise to a thing or two about what s going on on the other side and I tell you there s going to be something doing if they don t cut it out quick mister Qem the fellow who owns this place isn t the man to sit still and smile He s going to get busy Say what paper do you come from Peaceful Moments said John For a moment the inwardness of the information did not seem to come home to mister Gooch Then it hit him He spun round John was standing squarely between him and the stairs Hey what s all this demanded mister Gooch nervously The light was dim in the passage but it was sufficiently light to enable him to see John s face and it did not reassure him I ll soon tell you said John First however let s get this business of the kid s rent settled Take it out of this and give me the receipt He pulled out a bill Curse his rent said mister Gooch Let me pass Soon said John Business before pleasure How much does the kid have to pay for the privilege of suffocating in this infernal place As much as that Well give me a receipt and then we can get on to more important things Let me pass Receipt said John laconically mister Gooch looked at the big stick then scribbled a few words in his notebook and tore out the page John thanked him I will see that it reaches him he said And now will you kindly tell me the name of the man for whom you collected that money Let me pass bellowed mister Gooch I ll bring an action against you for assault and battery Playing a fool game like this Get away from those stairs There has been no assault and battery yet said John Well are you going to tell me mister Gooch shuffled restlessly John leaned against the banisters As you said a moment ago he observed the staff of Peaceful Moments is taking big risks I knew it before you told me I have had practical demonstration of the fact And that is why this Broster Street thing has got to be finished quick We can t afford to wait So I am going to have you tell me this man s name right now Help yelled mister Gooch The noise died away echoing against the walls No answering cry came from below Custom had staled the piquancy of such cries in Broster Street If anybody heard it nobody thought the matter worth investigation If you do that again said John I ll break you in half Now then I can t wait much longer Get busy He looked huge and sinister to mister Gooch standing there in the uncertain light it was very lonely on that top floor and the rest of the world seemed infinitely far away mister Gooch wavered He was loyal to his employer but he was still more loyal to mister Gooch Well said John There was a clatter on the stairs of one running swiftly and Pugsy Maloney burst into view For the first time since John had known him Pugsy was openly excited Say boss he cried dey s coming What Who Why dem I seen dem T ree Pointers Spider Reilly an He broke off with a yelp of surprise mister Gooch had seized his opportunity and had made his dash for safety With a rush he dived past John nearly upsetting Pugsy who stood in his path and sprang down the stairs Once he tripped but recovered himself and in another instant only the faint sound of his hurrying footsteps reached them John had made a movement as if to follow but the full meaning of Pugsy s words came upon him and he stopped Spider Reilly he said I guess it was Spider Reilly said Pugsy excitedly Dey called him Spider I guess dey piped youse comin in here Gee it s pretty fierce boss dis What youse goin to do Where did you see them Pugsy On the street just outside Dere was a bunch of dem spielin togedder and I hears dem say you was in here Dere ain t no ways out but de front so dey ain t hurryin Dey just reckon to pike along upstairs peekin inter each room till dey find you An dere s a bunch of dem goin to wait on de street in case youse beat it past down de stairs while de odder guys is rubberin for youse Gee ain t dis de limit John stood thinking His mind was working rapidly Suddenly he smiled It s all right Pugsy he said It looks bad but I see a way out I m going up that ladder there and through the trapdoor on to the roof I shall be all right there If they find me they can only get at me one at a time And while I m there here s what I want you to do Shall I go for de cops boss No not the cops Do you know where Dude Dawson lives The light of intelligence began to shine in Master Maloney s face His eye glistened with approval This was strategy of the right sort I can ask around he said I ll soon find him all right Do and as quick as you can And when you ve found him tell him that his old chum Spider Reilly is here with the rest of his crowd And now I d better be getting up on to my perch Off you go Pugsy my son and don t take a week about it Good by Pugsy vanished and John going to the ladder climbed out on to the roof with his big stick He looked about him The examination was satisfactory The trapdoor appeared to be the only means of access to the roof and between this roof and that of the next building there was a broad gulf The position was practically impregnable Only one thing could undo him and that was if the enemy should mount to the next roof and shoot from there And even then he would have cover in the shape of the chimney It was a pity that the trap opened downward for he had no means of securing it and was obliged to allow it to hang open But except for that his position could hardly have been stronger As yet there was no sound of the enemy s approach Evidently as Pugsy had said they were conducting the search room by room in a thorough and leisurely way He listened with his ear close to the open trapdoor but could hear nothing A startled exclamation directly behind him brought him to his feet in a flash every muscle tense He whirled his stick above his head as he turned ready to strike then let it fall with a clatter For there a bare yard away stood Betty CHAPTER XXVI JOURNEY S END The capacity of the human brain for surprise like that of the human body for pain is limited For a single instant a sense of utter unreality struck John like a physical blow The world flickered before his eyes and the air seemed full of strange noises Then quite suddenly these things passed and he found himself looking at her with a total absence of astonishment mildly amused in some remote corner of his brain at his own calm It was absurd he told himself that he should be feeling as if he had known of her presence there all the time Yet it was so If this were a dream he could not be taking the miracle more as a matter of course Joy at the sight of her he felt keen and almost painful but no surprise The shock had stunned his sense of wonder She was wearing a calico apron over her dress an apron that had evidently been designed for a large woman Swathed in its folds she suggested a child playing at being grown up Her sleeves were rolled back to the elbow and her slim arms dripped with water Strands of brown hair were blowing loose in the evening breeze To John she had never seemed so bewitchingly pretty He stared at her till the pallor of her face gave way to a warm red glow As they stood there speechless there came from the other side of the chimney softly at first then swelling the sound of a child s voice raised in a tentative wail Betty started violently The next moment she was gone and from the unseen parts beyond the chimney came the noise of splashing water And at the same instant through the trap came a trampling of feet and the sound of whispering The enemy had reached the top floor John was conscious of a remarkable exhilaration He felt insanely light hearted He laughed aloud at the thought that until then he had completely forgotten the very existence of these earnest seekers after his downfall He threw back his head and shouted There was something so ridiculous in their assumption that they mattered to a man who had found Betty again He thrust his head down through the trap to see what was going on The dark passage was full of indistinct forms gathered together in puzzled groups The mystery of the vanished object of their pursuit was being discussed in hoarse whispers Suddenly there was an excited shout then a rush of feet John drew back his head and waited gripping his stick Voices called to each other in the passage below De roof On top de roof He s beaten it for de roof Feet shuffled on the stone floor The voices ceased abruptly And then like a jack in the box there popped through the trap a head and shoulders The new arrival was a young man with a shock of red hair a broken nose and a mouth from which force or the passage of time had removed three front teeth He held on to the edge of the trap and stared up at John John beamed down at him and shifted his grip on the stick Who s here he cried Historic picture Old doctor Cook discovers the North Pole The red headed young man blinked The strong light of the open air was trying to his eyes Youse had best come down he observed coldly We ve got youse And continued John unmoved is instantly handed a gum drop by his faithful Eskimo As he spoke he brought the stick down on the knuckles which disfigured the edges of the trap The intruder uttered a howl and dropped out of sight In the passage below there were whisperings and mutterings growing gradually louder till something resembling coherent conversation came to John s ears as he knelt by the trap making meditative billiard shots with the stick at a small pebble Aw g wan Don t be a quitter Who s a quitter Youse a quitter Get on top de roof He can t hoit youse De guy s gotten a big stick John nodded appreciatively I and Theodore he murmured A somewhat baffled silence on the part of the attacking force was followed by further conversation Gee Some guy s got to go up Murmur of assent from the audience A voice in inspired tones Let Sam do it The suggestion made a hit There was no doubt about that It was a success from the start Quite a little chorus of voices expressed sincere approval of the very happy solution to what had seemed an insoluble problem John listening from above failed to detect in the choir of glad voices one that might belong to Sam himself Probably gratification had rendered the chosen one dumb Yes let Sam do it cried the unseen chorus The first speaker unnecessarily perhaps for the motion had been carried almost unanimously but possibly with the idea of convincing the one member of the party in whose bosom doubts might conceivably be harbored went on to adduce reasons Sam bein a coon he argued ain t goin to git hoit by no stick Youse can t hoit a coon by soakin him on de coco can you Sam John waited with some interest for the reply but it did not come Possibly Sam did not wish to generalize on insufficient experience We can but try said John softly turning the stick round in his fingers A report like a cannon sounded in the passage below It was merely a revolver shot but in the confined space it was deafening The bullet sang up into the sky Never hit me said John cheerfully The noise was succeeded by a shuffling of feet John grasped his stick more firmly This was evidently the real attack The revolver shot had been a mere demonstration of artillery to cover the infantry s advance Sure enough the next moment a woolly head popped through the opening and a pair of rolling eyes gleamed up at him Why Sam he said cordially this is great Now for our interesting experiment My idea is that you can hurt a coon s head with a stick if you hit it hard enough Keep quite still Now What are you coming up Sam I hate to do it but A yell rang out John s theory had been tested and proved correct By this time the affair had begun to attract spectators The noise of the revolver had proved a fine advertisement The roof of the house next door began to fill up Only a few of the occupants could get a clear view of the proceedings for the chimney intervened There was considerable speculation as to what was passing in the Three Points camp John was the popular favorite The early comers had seen his interview with Sam and were relating it with gusto to their friends Their attitude toward John was that of a group of men watching a dog at a rat hole They looked to him to provide entertainment for them but they realized that the first move must be with the attackers They were fair minded men and they did not expect John to make any aggressive move Their indignation when the proceedings began to grow slow was directed entirely at the dilatory Three Pointers They hooted the Three Pointers They urged them to go home and tuck themselves up in bed The spectators were mostly Irishmen and it offended them to see what should have been a spirited fight so grossly bungled G wan away home ye quitters roared one A second member of the audience alluded to them as stiffs It was evident that the besieging army was beginning to grow a little unpopular More action was needed if they were to retain the esteem of Broster Street Suddenly there came another and a longer explosion from below and more bullets wasted themselves on air John sighed You make me tired he said The Irish neighbors expressed the same sentiment in different and more forcible words There was no doubt about it as warriors the Three Pointers were failing to give satisfaction A voice from the passage called to John Say Well said John Are youse comin down off out of dat roof Would you mind repeating that remark Are youse goin to quit off out of dat roof Go away and learn some grammar said John severely Hey Well Are youse No my son said John since you ask it I am not I like being up here How is Sam There was silence below The time began to pass slowly The Irishmen on the other roof now definitely abandoning hope of further entertainment proceeded with hoots of derision to climb down one by one into the recesses of their own house And then from the street far below there came a fusillade of shots and a babel of shouts and counter shouts The roof of the house next door filled again with a magical swiftness and the low wall facing the street became black with the backs of those craning over There appeared to be great doings in the street John smiled comfortably In the army of the corridor confusion had arisen A scout clattering upstairs had brought the news of the Table Hillites advent and there was doubt as to the proper course to pursue Certain voices urged going down to help the main body Others pointed out that this would mean abandoning the siege of the roof The scout who had brought the news was eloquent in favor of the first course Gee he cried don t I keep tellin youse dat de Table Hills is here Sure dere s a whole bunch of dem and unless youse come on down dey ll bite de hull head off of us lot Leave dat stiff on de roof Let Sam wait here wit his canister and den he can t get down cos Sam ll pump him full of lead while he s beatin it t roo de trapdoor Sure John nodded reflectively There is certainly something in that he murmured I guess the grand rescue scene in the third act has sprung a leak This will want thinking over In the street the disturbance had now become terrible Both sides were hard at it and the Irishmen on the roof rewarded at last for their long vigil were yelling encouragement promiscuously and whooping with the unfettered ecstasy of men who are getting the treat of their lives without having paid a penny for it The behavior of the New York policeman in affairs of this kind is based on principles of the soundest practical wisdom The unthinking man would rush in and attempt to crush the combat in its earliest and fiercest stages The New York policeman knowing the importance of his safety and the insignificance of the gangsman s permits the opposing forces to hammer each other into a certain distaste for battle and then when both sides have begun to have enough of it rushes in himself and clubs everything in sight It is an admirable process in its results but it is sure rather than swift Proceedings in the affair below had not yet reached the police interference stage The noise what with the shots and yells from the street and the ear piercing approval of the roof audience was just working up to a climax John rose He was tired of kneeling by the trap and there was no likelihood of Sam making another attempt to climb through He got up and stretched himself And then he saw that Betty was standing beside him holding with each hand a small and by Broster Street standards uncannily clean child The children were scared and whimpering and she stooped to soothe them Then she turned to John her eyes wide with anxiety Are you hurt she cried What has been happening Are you hurt John s heart leaped at the anxious break in her voice It s all right he said soothingly It s absolutely all right Everything s over As if to give him the lie the noise in the street swelled to a crescendo of yells and shots What s that cried Betty starting I fancy said John the police must be taking a hand It s all right There s a little trouble down below there between two of the gangs It won t last long now Who were those men My friends in the passage he said lightly Those were some of the Three Points gang We were holding the concluding exercise of a rather lively campaign that s been Betty leaned weakly against the chimney There was silence now in the street Only the distant rumble of an elevated train broke the stillness She drew her hands from the children s grasp and covered her face As she lowered them again John saw that the blood had left her cheeks She was white and shaking He moved forward impulsively Betty She tottered reaching blindly for the chimney for support and without further words he gathered her into his arms as if she had been the child she looked and held her there clutching her to him fiercely kissing the brown hair that brushed against his face and soothing her with vague murmurings Her breath came in broken gasps She laughed hysterically I thought they were killing you killing you and I couldn t leave my babies they were so frightened poor little mites I thought they were killing you Betty Her arms about his neck tightened their grip convulsively forcing his head down until his face rested against hers And so they stood rigid while the two children stared with round eyes and whimpered unheeded Her grip relaxed Her hands dropped slowly to her side She leaned back against the circle of his arms and looked up at him a strange look full of a sweet humility I thought I was strong she said quietly I m weak but I don t care He looked at her with glowing eyes not understanding but content that the journey was ended that she was there in his arms speaking to him I always loved you dear she went on You knew that didn t you But I thought I was strong enough to give you up for for a principle but I was wrong I can t do without you I knew it just now when I saw She stopped and shuddered I can t do without you she repented She felt the muscles of his arms quiver and pressed more closely against them They were strong arms protecting arms restful to lean against at the journey s end CHAPTER XXVII A LEMON That bulwark of Peaceful Moments Pugsy Maloney was rather the man of action than the man of tact Otherwise when a moment later he thrust his head up through the trap he would have withdrawn delicately and not split the silence with a raucous Hey which acted on John and Betty like an electric shock John glowered at him Betty was pink but composed Pugsy climbed leisurely on to the roof and surveyed the group Why hello he said as he saw Betty more closely Well Pugsy said Betty How are you John turned in surprise Do you know Pugsy Betty looked at him puzzled Why of course I do Sure said Pugsy Miss Brown was stenographer on de poiper till she beat it Miss Brown There was utter bewilderment in John s face I changed my name when I went to Peaceful Moments Then are you did you Yes I wrote those articles That s how I happen to be here now I come down every day and help look after the babies Poor little souls there seems to be nobody else here who has time to do it It s dreadful Some of them you wouldn t believe I don t think they could ever have had a real bath in their lives Baths is foolishness commented Master Maloney austerely eying the scoured infants with a touch of disfavor John was reminded of a second mystery that needed solution How on earth did you get up here Pugsy he asked How did you get past Sam Sam I didn t see no Sam Who s Sam One of those fellows A coon They left him on guard with a gun so that I shouldn t get down Ah I met a coon beating it down de stairs I guess dat was him I guess he got cold feet Then there s nothing to stop us from getting down Nope Dat s right Dere ain t a T ree Pointer wit in a mile De cops have been loadin dem into de patrol wagon by de dozen John turned to Betty We ll go and have dinner somewhere You haven t begun to explain things yet Betty shook her head with a smile I haven t got time to go out to dinners she said I m a working girl I m cashier at Fontelli s Italian Restaurant I shall be on duty in another half hour John was aghast You It s a very good situation said Betty demurely Six dollars a week and what I steal I haven t stolen anything yet and I think mister Jarvis is a little disappointed in me But of course I haven t settled down properly Jarvis Bat Jarvis Yes He has been very good to me He got me this place and has looked after me all the time I ll buy him a thousand cats said John fervently But Betty you mustn t go there any more You must quit You If Peaceful Moments would reengage me said Betty She spoke lightly but her face was serious Dear she said quickly I can t be away from you now while there s danger I couldn t bear it Will you let me come He hesitated You will You must Her manner changed again That s settled then Pugsy I m coming back to the paper Are you glad Sure t ing said Pugsy You re to de good And now she went on I must give these babies back to their mothers and then I ll come with you She lowered herself through the trap and John handed the children down to her Pugsy looked on smoking a thoughtful cigarette John drew a deep breath Pugsy removing the cigarette from his mouth delivered himself of a stately word of praise She s a boid he said Pugsy said John feeling in his pocket and producing a roll of bills a dollar a word is our rate for contributions like that John pushed back his chair slightly stretched out his legs and lighted a cigarette watching Betty fondly through the smoke The resources of the Knickerbocker Hotel had proved equal to supplying the staff of Peaceful Moments with an excellent dinner and John had stoutly declined to give or listen to any explanations until the coffee arrived Thousands of promising careers he said have been ruined by the fatal practise of talking seriously at dinner But now we might begin Betty looked at him across the table with shining eyes It was good to be together again My explanations won t take long she said I ran away from you And when you found me I ran away again But I didn t find you objected John That was my trouble But my aunt told you I was at Peaceful Moments On the contrary I didn t even know you had an aunt Well she s not exactly that She s my stepfather s aunt missus Oakley I was certain you had gone straight to her and that she had told you where I was The missus Oakley The er philanthropist Don t laugh at her said Betty quickly She was so good to me She passes said John decidedly And now said Betty it s your turn John lighted another cigarette My story he said is rather longer When they threw me out of Mervo What I m afraid you don t keep abreast of European history he said Haven t you heard of the great revolution in Mervo and the overthrow of the dynasty Bloodless but invigorating The populace rose against me as one man except good old General Poineau He was for me and Crump was neutral but apart from them my subjects were unanimous There s a republic again in Mervo now But why What had you done Well I abolished the gaming tables But more probably he went on quickly they saw what a perfect dub I was in every She interrupted him Do you mean to say that just because of me Well he said awkwardly as a matter of fact what you said did make me think over my position and of course directly I thought over it oh well anyway I closed down gambling in Mervo and then John He was aware of a small hand creeping round the table under cover of the cloth He pressed it swiftly and looking round caught the eye of a hovering waiter who swooped like a respectful hawk Did you want anything sir I ve got it thanks said John The waiter moved away Well directly they had fired me I came over here I don t know what I expected to do I suppose I thought I might find you by chance I pretty soon saw how hopeless it was and it struck me that if I didn t get some work to do mighty quick I shouldn t be much good to anyone except the alienists Dear The waiter stared but John s eyes stopped him in mid swoop Then I found Smith Where is mister Smith In prison said John with a chuckle In prison He resisted and assaulted the police I ll tell you about it later Well Smith told me of the alterations in Peaceful Moments and I saw that it was just the thing for me And it has occupied my mind quite some To think of you being the writer of those Broster Street articles You certainly have started something Betty Goodness knows where it will end I hoped to have brought off a coup this afternoon but the arrival of Sam and his friends just spoiled it This afternoon Yes why were you there What were you doing I was interviewing the collector of rents and trying to dig his employer s name out of him It was Smith s idea Smith s theory was that the owner of the tenements must have some special private reason for lying low and that he would employ some special fellow whom he could trust as a rent collector And I m pretty certain he was right I cornered the collector a little rabbit faced man named Gooch and I believe he was on the point of What s the matter Betty s forehead was wrinkled Her eyes wore a far away expression I m trying to remember something I seem to know the name Gooch And I seem to associate it with a little rabbit faced man And quick tell me some more about him He s just hovering about on the edge of my memory Quick Push him in John threw his mind back to the interview in the dark passage trying to reconstruct it He s small he said slowly His eyes protrude so do his teeth He he yes I remember now he has a curious red mark On his right cheek said Betty triumphantly By Jove cried John You ve got him I remember him perfectly He was She stopped with a little gasp Yes John he was one of my stepfather s secretaries she said They looked at each other in silence It can t be said John at length It can It is He must be He has scores of interests everywhere He prides himself on it It s the most natural thing John shook his head doubtfully But why all the fuss Your stepfather isn t the man to mind public opinion But don t you see It s as mister Smith said The private reason It s as clear as daylight Naturally he would do anything rather than be found out Don t you see Because of missus Oakley Because of missus Oakley You don t know her as I do She is a curious mixture She s double natured You called her the philanthropist just now Well she would be one if if she could bear to part with money Yes I know it sounds ridiculous But it s so She is mean about money but she honestly hates to hear of anybody treating poor people badly If my stepfather were really the owner of those tenements and she should find it out she would have nothing more to do with him It s true I know her The smile passed away from John s face By George he said It certainly begins to hang together I know I m right I think you are He sat meditating for a moment Well he said at last What do you mean I mean what are we to do Do we go on with this Go on with it I don t understand I mean well it has become rather a family matter you see Do you feel as warlike against mister Scobell as you did against an unknown lessee Betty s eyes sparkled I don t think I should feel any different if if it was you she said I ve been spending days and days in those houses John dear and I ve seen such utter squalor and misery where there needn t be any at all if only the owner would do his duty and and She stopped Her eyes were misty Thumbs down in fact said John nodding I m with you As he spoke two men came down the broad staircase into the grill room Betty s back was towards them but John saw them and stared What are you looking at asked Betty Will you count ten before looking round What is it Your stepfather has just come in What He s sitting at the other side of the room directly behind you Count ten But Betty had twisted round in her chair Where Where Just where you re looking Don t let him see you I don t Oh Got him He leaned back in his chair The plot thickens eh he said What is mister Scobell doing in New York I wonder if he has not come to keep an eye on his interests Betty had whipped round again Her face was white with excitement It s true she whispered I was right Do you see who that is with him The man Do you know him He s a stranger to me It s mister Parker said Betty John drew in his breath sharply Are you sure Positive John laughed quietly He thought for a moment then beckoned to the hovering waiter What are you going to do asked Betty Bring me a small lemon said John Lemon squash sir Not a lemon squash A plain lemon The fruit of that name The common or garden citron which is sharp to the taste and not pleasant to have handed to one Also a piece of note paper a little tissue paper and an envelope What are you going to do asked Betty again John beamed Did you ever read the Sherlock Holmes story entitled The Five Orange Pips Well when a man in that story received a mysterious envelope containing five orange pips it was a sign that he was due to get his It was all over as far as he was concerned except phoning for the undertaker I propose to treat mister Scobell better than that He shall have a whole lemon The waiter returned John wrapped up the lemon carefully wrote on the note paper the words To B Scobell esquire Property Owner Broster Street from Prince John of Peaceful Moments this gift and enclosed it in the envelope Do you see that gentleman at the table by the pillar he said Give him these Just say a gentleman sent them The waiter smiled doubtfully John added a two dollar bill to the collection in his hand You needn t give him that he said The waiter smiled again but this time not doubtfully And now said John as the messenger ambled off perhaps it would be just as well if we retired CHAPTER XXVIII THE FINAL ATTEMPT Proof that his shot had not missed its mark was supplied to John immediately upon his arrival at the office on the following morning when he was met by Pugsy Maloney with the information that a gentleman had called to see him With or without a black jack enquired John Did he give any name Sure Parker s his name He blew in oncst before when mister Smith was here I loosed him into de odder room John walked through The man he had seen with mister Scobell at the Knickerbocker was standing at the window mister Parker The other turned as the door opened and looked at him keenly Are you mister Maude I am said John I guess you don t need to be told what I ve come about No See here said mister Parker I don t know how you ve found things out but you ve done it and we re through We quit I m glad of that said John Would you mind informing Spider Reilly of that fact It will make life pleasanter for all of us mister Scobell sent me along here to ask you to come and talk over this thing with him He s at the Knickerbocker I ve a cab waiting outside Can you come along I d rather he came here And I bet he d rather come here than be where he is That little surprise packet of yours last night put him down and out Gave him a stroke of some sort He s in bed now with half a dozen doctors working on him John thought for a moment Oh he said slowly if it s that very well He could not help feeling a touch of remorse He had no reason to be fond of mister Scobell but he was sorry that this should have happened They went out on the street A taximeter cab was standing by the sidewalk They got in Neither spoke John was thoughtful and preoccupied mister Parker too appeared to be absorbed in his own thoughts He sat with folded arms and lowered head The cab buzzed up Fifth Avenue Suddenly something half seen through the window brought John to himself with a jerk It was the great white mass of the Plaza Hotel The next moment he saw that they were abreast of the park and for the first time an icy wave of suspicion swept over him Here what s this he cried Where are you taking me mister Parker s right hand came swiftly out of ambush and something gleamed in the sun Don t move said mister Parker The hard nozzle of a pistol pressed against John s chest Keep that hand still John dropped his hand mister Parker leaned back with the pistol resting easily on his knee The cab began to move more quickly John s mind was in a whirl His chief emotion was not fear but disgust that he should have allowed himself to be trapped with such absurd ease He blushed for himself mister Parker s face was expressionless but who could say what tumults of silent laughter were not going on inside him John bit his lip Well he said at last mister Parker did not reply Well said John again What s the next move It flashed across his mind that unless driven to it by an attack his captor would do nothing for the moment without running grave risks himself To shoot now would be to attract attention The cab would be overtaken at once by bicycle police and stopped There would be no escape No nothing could happen till they reached open country At least he would have time to think this matter over in all its bearings mister Parker ignored the question He was sitting in the same attitude of watchfulness the revolver resting on his knee He seemed mistrustful of John s right hand which was hanging limply at his side It was from this quarter that he appeared to expect attack The cab was bowling easily up the broad street past rows and rows of high houses each looking exactly the same as the last Occasionally to the right through a break in the line of buildings a glimpse of the river could be seen A faint hope occurred to John that by talking he might put the other off his guard for just that instant which was all he asked He exerted himself to find material for conversation Tell me he said what you said about mister Scobell was that true About his being ill in bed mister Parker did not answer but a wintry smile flittered across his face It was not said John Well I m glad of that I don t wish mister Scobell any harm mister Parker looked at him doubtfully Say why are you in this game at all he said What made you butt in One must do something said John It s interesting work If you ll quit John shook his head I own it s a tempting proposition things being as they are but I won t give up yet You never know what may happen Well you can make a mighty near guess this trip You can t do a thing yet that s sure said John confidently If you shot me now the cab would be stopped and you would be lynched by the populace I seem to see them tearing you limb from limb She loves me Off comes an arm She loves me not A leg joins the little heap on the ground That is what would happen mister Parker The other shrugged his shoulders and relapsed into silence once more What are you going to do with me mister Parker asked John mister Parker did not reply The cab moved swiftly on Now they had reached the open country An occasional wooden shack was passed but that was all At any moment John felt the climax of the drama might be reached and he got ready His muscles stiffened for a spring There was little chance of its being effective but at least it would be good to put up some kind of a fight And he had a faint hope that the suddenness of his movement might upset the other s aim He was bound to be hit somewhere That was certain But quickness might save him to some extent He braced his leg against the back of the cab And as he did so its smooth speed changed to a series of jarring jumps each more emphatic than the last It slowed down then came to a halt There was a thud as the chauffeur jumped down John heard him fumbling in the tool box Presently the body of the machine was raised slightly as he got to work with the jack John s muscles relaxed He leaned back Surely something could be made of this new development But the hand that held the revolver never wavered He paused irresolute And at the moment somebody spoke in the road outside Had a breakdown enquired the voice John recognized it It was the voice of Kid Brady The Kid as he had stated that he intended to do had begun his training for his match with Eddie Wood at White Plains It was his practise to open a course of training with a little gentle road work and it was while jogging along the highway a couple of miles from his training camp in company with the two thick necked gentlemen who acted as his sparring partners that he had come upon the broken down taxicab If this had happened after his training had begun in real earnest he would have averted his eyes from the spectacle however alluring and continued on his way without a pause But now as he had not yet settled down to genuine hard work he felt justified in turning aside and looking into the matter The fact that the chauffeur who seemed to be a taciturn man lacking the conversational graces manifestly objected to an audience deterred him not at all One cannot have everything in this world and the Kid and his attendant thick necks were content to watch the process of mending the tire without demanding the additional joy of sparkling small talk from the man in charge of the operations Guy s had a breakdown sure said the first of the thick necks Surest thing you know agreed his colleague Seems to me the tire s punctured said the Kid All three concentrated their gaze on the machine Kid s right said thick neck number one Guy s been an bust a tire Surest thing you know said thick neck number two They observed the perspiring chauffeur in silence for a while Wonder how he did that now speculated the Kid Ran over a nail I guess said thick neck number one Surest thing you know said the other who while perhaps somewhat deficient in the matter of original thought was a most useful fellow to have by one a sort of Boswell Did you run over a nail the Kid enquired of the chauffeur The chauffeur worked on unheeding This is his busy day said the first thick neck with satire Guy s too full of work to talk to us Deaf shouldn t wonder surmised the Kid Say wonder what s he doing with a taxi so far out of the city Some guy tells him to drive him out here I guess Say it ll cost him something too He ll have to strip off a few from his roll to pay for this John glanced at mister Parker quivering with excitement It was his last chance Would the Kid think to look inside the cab or would he move on Could he risk a shout mister Parker leaned forward and thrust the muzzle of the pistol against his body The possibilities of the situation had evidently not been lost upon him Keep quiet he whispered Outside the conversation had begun again and the Kid had made his decision Pretty rich guy inside he said following up his companion s train of thought I m going to rubber through the window John met mister Parker s eye and smiled There came the sound of the Kid s feet grating on the road as he turned and as he heard it mister Parker for the first time lost his head With a vague idea of screening John he half rose The pistol wavered It was the chance John had prayed for His left hand shot out grasped the other s wrist and gave it a sharp wrench The pistol went off with a deafening report the bullet passing through the back of the cab then fell to the floor as the fingers lost their hold And the next moment John s right fist darting upward crashed home The effect was instantaneous John had risen from his seat as he delivered the blow and it got the full benefit of his weight mister Parker literally crumpled up His head jerked then fell limply forward John pushed him on to the seat as he slid toward the floor The interested face of the Kid appeared at the window Behind him could be seen portions of the faces of the two thick necks Hello Kid said John I heard your voice I hoped you might look in for a chat The Kid stared amazed What s doin he queried A good deal I ll explain later First will you kindly knock that chauffeur down and sit on his head De guy s beat it volunteered the first thick neck Surest thing you know said the other What s been doin asked the Kid What are you going to do with this guy John inspected the prostrate mister Parker who had begun to stir slightly I guess we ll leave him here he said I ve had all of his company that I need for to day Show me the nearest station Kid I must be getting back to New York I ll tell you all about it as we go A walk will do me good Riding in a taxi is pleasant but believe me you can have too much of it CHAPTER XXIX A REPRESENTATIVE GATHERING When John returned to the office he found that his absence had been causing Betty an anxious hour s waiting She had been informed by Pugsy that he had gone out in the company of mister Parker and she felt uneasy She turned white at his story of the ride but he minimized the dangers I don t think he ever meant to shoot I think he was going to shut me up somewhere out there and keep me till I promised to be good Do you think my stepfather told him to do it I doubt it I fancy Parker is a man who acts a good deal on his own inspirations But we ll ask him when he calls to day Is he going to call I have an idea he will said John I sent him a note just now asking if he could manage a visit It was unfortunate in the light of subsequent events that mister Jarvis should have seen fit to bring with him to the office that afternoon two of his collection of cats and that Long Otto who as before accompanied him should have been fired by his example to the extent of introducing a large yellow dog For before the afternoon was ended space in the office was destined to be at premium mister Jarvis when he had recovered from the surprise of seeing Betty and learning that she had returned to her old situation explained T ought I d bring de kits along he said Dey starts fuss n wit each odder yesterday so I brings dem along John inspected the menagerie without resentment Sure he said They add a kind of peaceful touch to the scene The atmosphere was indeed one of peace The dog after an inquisitive journey round the room lay down and went to sleep The cats settled themselves comfortably one on each of mister Jarvis knees Long Otto surveying the ceiling with his customary glassy stare smoked a long cigar And Bat scratching one of the cats under the ear began to entertain John with some reminiscences of fits and kittens But the peace did not last Ten minutes had barely elapsed when the dog sitting up with a start uttered a whine The door burst open and a little man dashed in He was brown in the face and had evidently been living recently in the open air Behind him was a crowd of uncertain numbers They were all strangers to John Yes he said The little man glared speechlessly at the occupants of the room The two Bowery boys rose awkwardly The cats fell to the floor The rest of the party had entered Betty recognized the Reverend Edwin T Philpotts and mister B Henderson Asher My name is Renshaw said the little man having found speech What can I do for you asked John The question appeared to astound the other What can you Of all mister Renshaw is the editor of Peaceful Moments she said mister Smith was only acting for him mister Renshaw caught the name Yes mister Smith I want to see mister Smith Where is he In prison said John In prison John nodded A good many things have happened since you left for your vacation Smith assaulted a policeman and is now on Blackwell s Island mister Renshaw gasped mister B Henderson Asher stared and stumbled over the cat And who are you asked the editor My name is Maude I He broke off to turn his attention to mister Jarvis and mister Asher between whom unpleasantness seemed to have arisen mister Jarvis holding a cat in his arms was scowling at mister Asher who had backed away and appeared apprehensive What is the trouble asked John Dis guy here wit two left feet said Bat querulously treads on de kit mister Renshaw eying Bat and the silent Otto with disgust intervened Who are these persons he enquired Poison yourself rejoined Bat justly incensed Who s de little squirt mister Maude John waved his hands Gentlemen gentlemen he said why descend to mere personalities I ought to have introduced you This is mister Renshaw our editor These mister Renshaw are Bat Jarvis and Long Otto our acting fighting editors vice Kid Brady absent on unavoidable business The name stung mister Renshaw to indignation as Smith s had done Brady he shrilled I insist that you give me a full explanation I go away by my doctor s orders for a vacation leaving mister Smith to conduct the paper on certain clearly defined lines By mere chance while on my vacation I saw a copy of the paper It had been ruined Ruined said John On the contrary The circulation has been going up every week Who is this person Brady With mister Philpotts I have been going carefully over the numbers which have been issued since my departure An intellectual treat murmured John and in each there is a picture of this young man in a costume which I will not particularize There is hardly enough of it to particularize together with a page of disgusting autobiographical matter John held up his hand I protest he said We court criticism but this is mere abuse I appeal to these gentlemen to say whether this for instance is not bright and interesting He picked up the current number of Peaceful Moments and turned to the Kid s page This he said describes a certain ten round unpleasantness with one Mexican Joe Joe comes up for the second round and he gives me a nasty look but I thinks of my mother and swats him one in the lower ribs He gives me another nasty look All right Kid he says now I ll knock you up into the gallery And with that he cuts loose with a right swing but I falls into the clinch and then Pah exclaimed mister Renshaw Go on boss urged mister Jarvis approvingly It s to de good dat stuff There said John triumphantly You heard mister Jarvis one of the most firmly established critics east of Fifth Avenue stamps Kid Brady s reminiscences with the hall mark of his approval I falls fer de Kid every time assented mister Jarvis Sure You know a good thing when you see one Why he went on warmly there is stuff in these reminiscences which would stir the blood of a jellyfish Let me quote you another passage to show that they are not only enthralling but helpful as well Let me see where is it Ah I have it A bully good way of putting a guy out of business is this You don t want to use it in the ring because rightly speaking it s a foul but you will find it mighty useful if any thick neck comes up to you in the street and tries to start anything It s this way While he s setting himself for a punch just place the tips of the fingers of your left hand on the right side of the chest Then bring down the heel of your left hand There isn t a guy living that could stand up against that The fingers give you a leverage to beat the band The guy doubles up and you upper cut him with your right and out he goes Now I bet you never knew that before mister Philpotts Try it on your parishioners Peaceful Moments said mister Renshaw irately is no medium for exploiting low prize fighters Low prize fighters No no The Kid is as decent a little chap as you d meet anywhere And right up in the championship class too He s matched against Eddie Wood at this very moment And mister Waterman will support me in my statement that a victory over Eddie Wood means that he gets a cast iron claim to meet Jimmy Garvin for the championship It is abominable burst forth mister Renshaw It is disgraceful The paper is ruined You keep saying that It really isn t so The returns are excellent Prosperity beams on us like a sun The proprietor is more than satisfied Indeed said mister Renshaw sardonically Sure said John mister Renshaw laughed an acid laugh You may not know it he said but mister Scobell is in New York at this very moment We arrived together yesterday on the Mauretania I was spending my vacation in England when I happened to see the copy of the paper I instantly communicated with mister Scobell who was at Mervo an island in the Mediterranean I seem to know the name and received in reply a long cable desiring me to return to New York immediately I sailed on the Mauretania and found that he was one of the passengers He was extremely agitated let me tell you So that your impudent assertion that the proprietor is pleased John raised his eyebrows I don t quite understand he said From what you say one would almost imagine that you thought mister Scobell was the proprietor of this paper mister Renshaw stared Everyone stared except mister Jarvis who since the readings from the Kid s reminiscences had ceased had lost interest in the proceedings and was now entertaining the cats with a ball of paper tied to a string Thought that mister Scobell repeated mister Renshaw Who is if he is not I am said John There was a moment s absolute silence You cried mister Renshaw You exclaimed mister Waterman mister Asher and the Reverend Edwin T Philpotts Sure thing said John mister Renshaw groped for a chair and sat down Am I going mad he demanded feebly Do I understand you to say that you own this paper I do Since when Roughly speaking about three days Among his audience still excepting mister Jarvis who was tickling one of the cats and whistling a plaintive melody there was a tendency toward awkward silence To start assailing a seeming nonentity and then to discover he is the proprietor of the paper to which you wish to contribute is like kicking an apparently empty hat and finding your rich uncle inside it mister Renshaw in particular was disturbed Editorships of the kind to which he aspired are not easy to get If he were to be removed from Peaceful Moments he would find it hard to place himself anywhere else Editors like manuscripts are rejected from want of space I had a little money to invest continued John And it seemed to me that I couldn t do better than put it into Peaceful Moments If it did nothing else it would give me a free hand in pursuing a policy in which I was interested Smith told me that mister Scobell s representatives had instructions to accept any offer so I made an offer and they jumped at it Pugsy Maloney entered bearing a card Ask him to wait just one moment said John reading it He turned to mister Renshaw mister Renshaw he said if you took hold of the paper again helped by these other gentlemen do you think you could gather in our old subscribers and generally make the thing a live proposition on the old lines Because if so I should be glad if you would start in with the next number I am through with the present policy At least I hope to be in a few minutes Do you think you can undertake that mister Renshaw with a sigh of relief intimated that he could Good said John And now I m afraid I must ask you to go A rather private and delicate interview is in the offing Bat I m very much obliged to you and Otto for your help I don t know what we should have done without it Aw Chee said mister Jarvis Then good by for the present Good by boss Good by loidy Long Otto pulled his forelock and accompanied by the cats and the dog they left the room When mister Renshaw and the others had followed them John rang the bell for Pugsy Ask mister Scobell to step in he said The man of many enterprises entered His appearance had deteriorated since John had last met him He had the air of one who has been caught in the machinery His face was even sallower than of yore and there was no gleam in his dull green eyes He started at the sight of Betty but he was evidently too absorbed in the business in hand to be surprised at seeing her He sank into a chair and stared gloomily at John Well he said Well said John This observed mister Scobell simply is hell He drew a cigar stump mechanically from his vest pocket and lighted it What are you going to do about it he asked What are you said John It s up to you mister Scobell gazed heavily into vacancy Ever since I started in to monkey with that darned Mervo he said sadly there ain t a thing gone right I haven t been able to turn around without bumping into myself Everything I touch turns to mud I guess I can still breathe but I m not betting on that lasting long Of all the darned hoodoos that island was the worst Say I gotta close down that Casino What do you know about that Sure thing The old lady won t stand for it I had a letter from her He turned to Betty You got her all worked up Betty I m not blaming you It s just my jinx She took it into her head I d been treating you mean and she kicked at the Casino I gotta close it down or nix on the heir thing That was enough for me I m going to turn it into a hotel He relighted his cigar And now just as I got her smoothed down along comes this darned tenement business Say Prince for the love of Mike cut it out If those houses are as bad as you say they are and the old lady finds out that I own them it ll be Katie bar the door for me She wouldn t stand for it for a moment I guess I didn t treat you good Prince but let s forget it Ease up on this rough stuff I ll do anything you want Betty spoke We only want you to make the houses fit to live in she said I don t believe you know what they re like Why no I left Parker in charge It was up to him to do what was wanted Say Prince I want to talk to you about that guy Parker I understand he s been rather rough with you and your crowd That wasn t my doing I didn t know anything about it till he told me It s the darned Wild West strain in him coming out He used to do those sort of things out there and he s forgotten his manners I pay him well and I guess he thinks that s the way it s up to him to earn it You mustn t mind Parker Oh well So long as he means well said John I ve no grudge against Parker I ve settled with him Well then what about this Broster Street thing You want me to fix some improvements is that it That s it Why say I ll do that Sure And then you ll quit handing out the newspaper stories That goes I ll start right in He rose That s taken a heap off my mind he said There s just one other thing said John Have you by any chance such a thing as a stepfather s blessing on you Eh John took Betty s hand We ve come round to your views mister Scobell he said That scheme of yours for our future looks good to us mister Scobell bit through his cigar in his emotion Now why the Heck he moaned couldn t you have had the sense to do that before and save all this trouble CHAPTER XXX CONCLUSION Smith drew thoughtfully at his cigar and shifted himself more comfortably into his chair It was long since he had visited the West and he had found all the old magic in the still scented darkness of the prairie night He gave a little sigh of content When John a year before had announced his intention of buying this ranch and as it seemed to Smith burying himself alive a thousand miles from anywhere he had disapproved He had pointed out that John was not doing what Fate expected of him A miracle in the shape of a six figure wedding present from missus Oakley who had never been known before in the memory of man to give away a millionth of that sum had happened to him Fate argued Smith plainly intended him to stay in New York and spend his money in a civilized way John had had only one reply but it was clinching Betty likes the idea he said and Smith ceased to argue Now as he sat smoking on the porch on the first night of his inaugural visit to the ranch a conviction was creeping over him that John had chosen wisely A door opened behind him Betty came out on to the porch and dropped into a chair close to where John s cigar glowed redly in the darkness They sat there without speaking The stirring of unseen cattle in the corral made a soothing accompaniment to thought It is very pleasant for an old jail bird like myself said Smith at last to sit here at my ease I wish all our absent friends could be with us to night Or perhaps not quite all Let us say Comrade Parker here Comrades Brady and Maloney over there by you and our old friend Renshaw sharing the floor with B Henderson Asher Bat Jarvis and the cats By the way I was round at Broster Street before I left New York There is certainly an improvement Millionaires now stop there instead of going on to the Plaza Are you asleep John No Excellent I also saw Comrade Brady before I left He has definitely got on his match with Jimmy Garvin Good He ll win The papers seem to think so Peaceful Moments however I am sorry to say is silent on the subject It was not like this in the good old days How is the paper going now John Are the receipts satisfactory Pretty fair Renshaw is rather a marvel in his way He seems to have roped in nearly all the old subscribers They eat out of his hand Smith stretched himself These he said are the moments in life to which we look back with that wistful pleasure This peaceful scene John will remain with me when I have forgotten that such a man as Spider Reilly ever existed These are the real Peaceful Moments He closed his eyes The cigar dropped from his fingers There was a long silence mister Smith said Betty There was no answer He s asleep said John He had a long journey to day Betty drew her chair closer From somewhere out in the darkness from the direction of the men s quarters came the soft tinkle of a guitar and a voice droning a Mexican love song Her hand stole out and found his They began to talk in whispers THE END End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Prince and Betty by P G Wodehouse END
