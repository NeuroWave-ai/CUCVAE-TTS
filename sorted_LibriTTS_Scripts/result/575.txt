God gives to my Pen and Labours I could yeeld God leade your Grace by the Hand Your Graces most Obliged and faithfull Servant FR saint ALBAN Of Truth WHAT is truth said jesting Pilate and would not stay for an answer Certainly there be that delight in giddiness and count it a bondage to fix a belief affecting free will in thinking as well as in acting And though the sects of philosophers of that kind be gone yet there remain certain discoursing wits which are of the same veins though there be not so much blood in them as was in those of the ancients But it is not only the difficulty and labor which men take in finding out of truth nor again that when it is found it imposeth upon men s thoughts that doth bring lies in favor but a natural though corrupt love of the lie itself One of the later school of the Grecians examineth the matter and is at a stand to think what should be in it that men should love lies where neither they make for pleasure as with poets nor for advantage as with the merchant but for the lie s sake But I cannot tell this same truth is a naked and open day light that doth not show the masks and mummeries and triumphs of the world half so stately and daintily as candle lights Truth may perhaps come to the price of a pearl that showeth best by day but it will not rise to the price of a diamond or carbuncle that showeth best in varied lights A mixture of a lie doth ever add pleasure Doth any man doubt that if there were taken out of men s minds vain opinions flattering hopes false valuations imaginations as one would and the like but it would leave the minds of a number of men poor shrunken things full of melancholy and indisposition and unpleasing to themselves One of the fathers in great severity called poesy vinum daemonum because it fireth the imagination and yet it is but with the shadow of a lie But it is not the lie that passeth through the mind but the lie that sinketh in and settleth in it that doth the hurt such as we spake of before But howsoever these things are thus in men s depraved judgments and affections yet truth which only doth judge itself teacheth that the inquiry of truth which is the love making or wooing of it the knowledge of truth which is the presence of it and the belief of truth which is the enjoying of it is the sovereign good of human nature The first creature of God in the works of the days was the light of the sense the last was the light of reason and his sabbath work ever since is the illumination of his Spirit First he breathed light upon the face of the matter or chaos then he breathed light into the face of man and still he breatheth and inspireth light into the face of his chosen The poet that beautified the sect that was otherwise inferior to the rest saith yet excellently well It is a pleasure to stand upon the shore and to see ships tossed upon the sea a pleasure to stand in the window of a castle and to see a battle and the adventures thereof below but no pleasure is comparable to the standing upon the vantage ground of truth a hill not to be commanded and where the air is always clear and serene and to see the errors and wanderings and mists and tempests in the vale below so always that this prospect be with pity and not with swelling or pride Certainly it is heaven upon earth to have a man s mind move in charity rest in providence and turn upon the poles of truth To pass from theological and philosophical truth to the truth of civil business it will be acknowledged even by those that practise it not that clear and round dealing is the honor of man s nature and that mixture of falsehoods is like alloy in coin of gold and silver which may make the metal work the better but it embaseth it For these winding and crooked courses are the goings of the serpent which goeth basely upon the belly and not upon the feet There is no vice that doth so cover a man with shame as to be found false and perfidious And therefore Montaigne saith prettily when he inquired the reason why the word of the lie should be such a disgrace and such an odious charge Saith he If it be well weighed to say that a man lieth is as much to say as that he is brave towards God and a coward towards men For a lie faces God and shrinks from man Surely the wickedness of falsehood and breach of faith cannot possibly be so highly expressed as in that it shall be the last peal to call the judgments of God upon the generations of men it being foretold that when Christ cometh he shall not find faith upon the earth Of Death MEN fear death as children fear to go in the dark and as that natural fear in children is increased with tales so is the other Certainly the contemplation of death as the wages of sin and passage to another world is holy and religious but the fear of it as a tribute due unto nature is weak Yet in religious meditations there is sometimes mixture of vanity and of superstition You shall read in some of the friars books of mortification that a man should think with himself what the pain is if he have but his finger s end pressed or tortured and thereby imagine what the pains of death are when the whole body is corrupted and dissolved when many times death passeth with less pain than the torture of a limb for the most vital parts are not the quickest of sense And by him that spake only as a philosopher and natural man it was well said Pompa mortis magis terret quam mors ipsa Groans and convulsions and a discolored face and friends weeping and blacks and obsequies and the like show death terrible It is worthy the observing that there is no passion in the mind of man so weak but it mates and masters the fear of death and therefore death is no such terrible enemy when a man hath so many attendants about him that can win the combat of him Revenge triumphs over death love slights it honor aspireth to it grief flieth to it fear preoccupateth it nay we read after Otho the emperor had slain himself pity which is the tenderest of affections provoked many to die out of mere compassion to their sovereign and as the truest sort of followers Nay Seneca adds niceness and satiety Cogita quamdiu eadem feceris mori velle non tantum fortis aut miser sed etiam fastidiosus potest A man would die though he were neither valiant nor miserable only upon a weariness to do the same thing so oft over and over It is no less worthy to observe how little alteration in good spirits the approaches of death make for they appear to be the same men till the last instant Augustus Caesar died in a compliment Livia conjugii nostri memor vive et vale Tiberius in dissimulation as Tacitus saith of him Jam Tiberium vires et corpus non dissimulatio deserebant Vespasian in a jest sitting upon the stool Ut puto deus fio Galba with a sentence Feri si ex re sit populi Romani holding forth his neck Septimius Severus in despatch Adeste si quid mihi restat agendum And the like Certainly the Stoics bestowed too much cost upon death and by their great preparations made it appear more fearful Better saith he qui finem vitae extremum inter munera ponat naturae It is as natural to die as to be born and to a little infant perhaps the one is as painful as the other He that dies in an earnest pursuit is like one that is wounded in hot blood who for the time scarce feels the hurt and therefore a mind fixed and bent upon somewhat that is good doth avert the dolors of death But above all believe it the sweetest canticle is Nunc dimittis when a man hath obtained worthy ends and expectations Death hath this also that it openeth the gate to good fame and extinguisheth envy Extinctus amabitur idem Of Unity In Religion RELIGION being the chief band of human society it is a happy thing when itself is well contained within the true band of unity The quarrels and divisions about religion were evils unknown to the heathen The reason was because the religion of the heathen consisted rather in rites and ceremonies than in any constant belief For you may imagine what kind of faith theirs was when the chief doctors and fathers of their church were the poets But the true God hath this attribute that he is a jealous God and therefore his worship and religion will endure no mixture nor partner We shall therefore speak a few words concerning the unity of the church what are the fruits thereof what the bounds and what the means The fruits of unity next unto the well pleasing of God which is all in all are two the one towards those that are without the church the other towards those that are within For the former it is certain that heresies and schisms are of all others the greatest scandals yea more than corruption of manners For as in the natural body a wound or solution of continuity is worse than a corrupt humor so in the spiritual So that nothing doth so much keep men out of the church and drive men out of the church as breach of unity And therefore whensoever it cometh to that pass that one saith Ecce in deserto another saith Ecce in penetralibus that is when some men seek Christ in the conventicles of heretics and others in an outward face of a church that voice had need continually to sound in men s ears Nolite exire Go not out The doctor of the Gentiles the propriety of whose vocation drew him to have a special care of those without saith if an heathen come in and hear you speak with several tongues will he not say that you are mad And certainly it is little better when atheists and profane persons do hear of so many discordant and contrary opinions in religion it doth avert them from the church and maketh them to sit down in the chair of the scorners It is but a light thing to be vouched in so serious a matter but yet it expresseth well the deformity There is a master of scoffing that in his catalogue of books of a feigned library sets down this title of a book The Morris Dance of Heretics For indeed every sect of them hath a diverse posture or cringe by themselves which cannot but move derision in worldlings and depraved politics who are apt to contemn holy things As for the fruit towards those that are within it is peace which containeth infinite blessings It establisheth faith it kindleth charity the outward peace of the church distilleth into peace of conscience and it turneth the labors of writing and reading of controversies into treaties of mortification and devotion Concerning the bounds of unity the true placing of them importeth exceedingly There appear to be two extremes For to certain zealants all speech of pacification is odious Is it peace Jehu What hast thou to do with peace turn thee behind me Peace is not the matter but following and party Contrariwise certain Laodiceans and lukewarm persons think they may accommodate points of religion by middle way and taking part of both and witty reconcilements as if they would make an arbitrament between God and man Both these extremes are to be avoided which will be done if the league of Christians penned by our Savior himself were in two cross clauses thereof soundly and plainly expounded He that is not with us is against us and again He that is not against us is with us that is if the points fundamental and of substance in religion were truly discerned and distinguished from points not merely of faith but of opinion order or good intention This is a thing may seem to many a matter trivial and done already But if it were done less partially it would be embraced more generally Of this I may give only this advice according to my small model Men ought to take heed of rending God s church by two kinds of controversies The one is when the matter of the point controverted is too small and light not worth the heat and strife about it kindled only by contradiction For as it is noted by one of the fathers Christ s coat indeed had no seam but the church s vesture was of divers colors whereupon he saith In veste varietas sit scissura non sit they be two things unity and uniformity The other is when the matter of the point controverted is great but it is driven to an over great subtilty and obscurity so that it becometh a thing rather ingenious than substantial A man that is of judgment and understanding shall sometimes hear ignorant men differ and know well within himself that those which so differ mean one thing and yet they themselves would never agree And if it come so to pass in that distance of judgment which is between man and man shall we not think that God above that knows the heart doth not discern that frail men in some of their contradictions intend the same thing and accepteth of both The nature of such controversies is excellently expressed by saint Paul in the warning and precept that he giveth concerning the same Devita profanas vocum novitates et oppositiones falsi nominis scientiae Men create oppositions which are not and put them into new terms so fixed as whereas the meaning ought to govern the term the term in effect governeth the meaning There be also two false peaces or unities the one when the peace is grounded but upon an implicit ignorance for all colors will agree in the dark the other when it is pieced up upon a direct admission of contraries in fundamental points For truth and falsehood in such things are like the iron and clay in the toes of Nebuchadnezzar s image they may cleave but they will not incorporate Concerning the means of procuring unity men must beware that in the procuring or reuniting of religious unity they do not dissolve and deface the laws of charity and of human society There be two swords amongst Christians the spiritual and temporal and both have their due office and place in the maintenance of religion But we may not take up the third sword which is Mahomet s sword or like unto it that is to propagate religion by wars or by sanguinary persecutions to force consciences except it be in cases of overt scandal blasphemy or intermixture of practice against the state much less to nourish seditions to authorize conspiracies and rebellions to put the sword into the people s hands and the like tending to the subversion of all government which is the ordinance of God For this is but to dash the first table against the second and so to consider men as Christians as we forget that they are men Lucretius the poet when he beheld the act of Agamemnon that could endure the sacrificing of his own daughter exclaimed Tantum Religio potuit suadere malorum What would he have said if he had known of the massacre in France or the powder treason of England He would have been seven times more Epicure and atheist than he was For as the temporal sword is to be drawn with great circumspection in cases of religion so it is a thing monstrous to put it into the hands of the common people Let that be left unto the Anabaptists and other furies It was great blasphemy when the devil said I will ascend and be like the highest but it is greater blasphemy to personate God and bring him in saying I will descend and be like the prince of darkness and what is it better to make the cause of religion to descend to the cruel and execrable actions of murthering princes butchery of people and subversion of states and governments Surely this is to bring down the Holy Ghost instead of the likeness of a dove in the shape of a vulture or raven and set out of the bark of a Christian church a flag of a bark of pirates and assassins Therefore it is most necessary that the church by doctrine and decree princes by their sword and all learnings both Christian and moral as by their Mercury rod do damn and send to hell for ever those facts and opinions tending to the support of the same as hath been already in good part done Surely in counsels concerning religion that counsel of the apostle would be prefixed Ira hominis non implet justitiam Dei And it was a notable observation of a wise father and no less ingenuously confessed that those which held and persuaded pressure of consciences were commonly interested therein themselves for their own ends Of Revenge REVENGE is a kind of wild justice which the more man s nature runs to the more ought law to weed it out 
764_132272_000003_000001	train-clean-360	For as for the first wrong it doth but offend the law but the revenge of that wrong putteth the law out of office 
none	none	Certainly in taking revenge a man is but even with his enemy but in passing it over he is superior for it is a prince s part to pardon 
764_132272_000003_000003	train-clean-360	And Solomon I am sure saith It is the glory of a man to pass by an offence 
764_132272_000003_000004	train-clean-360	That which is past is gone and irrevocable and wise men have enough to do with things present and to come therefore they do but trifle with themselves that labor in past matters 
764_132272_000003_000005	train-clean-360	There is no man doth a wrong for the wrong s sake but thereby to purchase himself profit or pleasure or honor or the like 
none	none	Therefore why should I be angry with a man for loving himself better than me And if any man should do wrong merely out of ill nature why yet it is but like the thorn or briar which prick and scratch because they can do no other The most tolerable sort of revenge is for those wrongs which there is no law to remedy but then let a man take heed the revenge be such as there is no law to punish else a man s enemy is still before hand and it is two for one 
764_132272_000003_000008	train-clean-360	Some when they take revenge are desirous the party should know whence it cometh 
none	none	This is the more generous 
764_132272_000003_000010	train-clean-360	For the delight seemeth to be not so much in doing the hurt as in making the party repent 
764_132272_000003_000011	train-clean-360	But base and crafty cowards are like the arrow that flieth in the dark 
764_132272_000003_000012	train-clean-360	Cosmus duke of Florence had a desperate saying against perfidious or neglecting friends as if those wrongs were unpardonable You shall read saith he that we are commanded to forgive our enemies but you never read that we are commanded to forgive our friends 
764_132272_000003_000013	train-clean-360	But yet the spirit of Job was in a better tune Shall we saith he take good at God s hands and not be content to take evil also 
764_132272_000003_000014	train-clean-360	And so of friends in a proportion 
none	none	This is certain that a man that studieth revenge keeps his own wounds green which otherwise would heal and do well 
764_132272_000003_000016	train-clean-360	Public revenges are for the most part fortunate as that for the death of Caesar for the death of Pertinax for the death of Henry the Third of France and many more 
none	none	But in private revenges it is not so Nay rather vindictive persons live the life of witches who as they are mischievous so end they infortunate Of Adversity IT WAS an high speech of Seneca after the manner of the Stoics that the good things which belong to prosperity are to be wished but the good things that belong to adversity are to be admired 
764_132272_000005_000001	train-clean-360	Bona rerum secundarum optabilia adversarum mirabilia 
764_132272_000005_000002	train-clean-360	Certainly if miracles be the command over nature they appear most in adversity 
764_132272_000005_000003	train-clean-360	It is yet a higher speech of his than the other much too high for a heathen It is true greatness to have in one the frailty of a man and the security of a God 
none	none	Vere magnum habere fragilitatem hominis securitatem Dei This would have done better in poesy where transcendences are more allowed And the poets indeed have been busy with it for it is in effect the thing which figured in that strange fiction of the ancient poets which seemeth not to be without mystery nay and to have some approach to the state of a Christian that Hercules when he went to unbind Prometheus by whom human nature is represented sailed the length of the great ocean in an earthen pot or pitcher lively describing Christian resolution that saileth in the frail bark of the flesh through the waves of the world 
764_132272_000005_000006	train-clean-360	But to speak in a mean 
764_132272_000005_000007	train-clean-360	The virtue of prosperity is temperance the virtue of adversity is fortitude which in morals is the more heroical virtue 
764_132272_000005_000008	train-clean-360	Prosperity is the blessing of the Old Testament adversity is the blessing of the New which carrieth the greater benediction and the clearer revelation of God s favor 
none	none	Yet even in the Old Testament if you listen to David s harp you shall hear as many hearse like airs as carols and the pencil of the Holy Ghost hath labored more in describing the afflictions of Job than the felicities of Solomon 
764_132272_000005_000010	train-clean-360	Prosperity is not without many fears and distastes and adversity is not without comforts and hopes 
764_132272_000005_000011	train-clean-360	We see in needle works and embroideries it is more pleasing to have a lively work upon a sad and solemn ground than to have a dark and melancholy work upon a lightsome ground judge therefore of the pleasure of the heart by the pleasure of the eye 
none	none	Certainly virtue is like precious odors most fragrant when they are incensed or crushed for prosperity doth best discover vice but adversity doth best discover virtue Of Simulation And Dissimulation DISSIMULATION is but a faint kind of policy or wisdom for it asketh a strong wit and a strong heart to know when to tell truth and to do it 
764_132272_000007_000001	train-clean-360	Therefore it is the weaker sort of politics that are the great dissemblers 
764_132272_000008_000000	train-clean-360	Tacitus saith Livia sorted well with the arts of her husband and dissimulation of her son attributing arts or policy to Augustus and dissimulation to Tiberius 
none	none	And again when Mucianus encourageth Vespasian to take arms against Vitellius he saith We rise not against the piercing judgment of Augustus nor the extreme caution or closeness of Tiberius 
764_132272_000008_000002	train-clean-360	These properties of arts or policy and dissimulation or closeness are indeed habits and faculties several and to be distinguished 
none	none	For if a man have that penetration of judgment as he can discern what things are to be laid open and what to be secreted and what to be showed at half lights and to whom and when which indeed are arts of state and arts of life as Tacitus well calleth them to him a habit of dissimulation is a hinderance and a poorness 
764_132272_000008_000004	train-clean-360	But if a man cannot obtain to that judgment then it is left to him generally to be close and a dissembler 
none	none	For where a man cannot choose or vary in particulars there it is good to take the safest and wariest way in general like the going softly by one that cannot well see Certainly the ablest men that ever were have had all an openness and frankness of dealing and a name of certainty and veracity but then they were like horses well managed for they could tell passing well when to stop or turn and at such times when they thought the case indeed required dissimulation if then they used it it came to pass that the former opinion spread abroad of their good faith and clearness of dealing made them almost invisible There be three degrees of this hiding and veiling of a man s self 
764_132272_000009_000001	train-clean-360	The first closeness reservation and secrecy when a man leaveth himself without observation or without hold to be taken what he is 
none	none	The second dissimulation in the negative when a man lets fall signs and arguments that he is not that he is 
764_132272_000009_000003	train-clean-360	And the third simulation in the affirmative when a man industriously and expressly feigns and pretends to be that he is not 
764_132272_000010_000000	train-clean-360	For the first of these secrecy it is indeed the virtue of a confessor And assuredly the secret man heareth many confessions 
764_132272_000010_000001	train-clean-360	For who will open himself to a blab or a babbler 
764_132272_000010_000002	train-clean-360	But if a man be thought secret it inviteth discovery as the more close air sucketh in the more open and as in confession the revealing is not for worldly use but for the ease of a man s heart so secret men come to the knowledge of many things in that kind while men rather discharge their minds than impart their minds 
none	none	In few words mysteries are due to secrecy Besides to say truth nakedness is uncomely as well in mind as body and it addeth no small reverence to men s manners and actions if they be not altogether open 
764_132272_000010_000005	train-clean-360	As for talkers and futile persons they are commonly vain and credulous withal 
764_132272_000010_000006	train-clean-360	For he that talketh what he knoweth will also talk what he knoweth not 
764_132272_000010_000007	train-clean-360	Therefore set it down that an habit of secrecy is both politic and moral 
764_132272_000010_000008	train-clean-360	And in this part it is good that a man s face give his tongue leave to speak 
none	none	For the discovery of a man s self by the tracts of his countenance is a great weakness and betraying by how much it is many times more marked and believed than a man s words 
764_132272_000011_000000	train-clean-360	For the second which is dissimulation it followeth many times upon secrecy by a necessity so that he that will be secret must be a dissembler in some degree 
none	none	For men are too cunning to suffer a man to keep an indifferent carriage between both and to be secret without swaying the balance on either side They will so beset a man with questions and draw him on and pick it out of him that without an absurd silence he must show an inclination one way or if he do not they will gather as much by his silence as by his speech 
764_132272_000011_000003	train-clean-360	As for equivocations or oraculous speeches they cannot hold out long 
764_132272_000011_000004	train-clean-360	So that no man can be secret except he give himself a little scope of dissimulation which is as it were but the skirts or train of secrecy 
764_132272_000012_000000	train-clean-360	But for the third degree which is simulation and false profession that I hold more culpable and less politic except it be in great and rare matters 
none	none	And therefore a general custom of simulation which is this last degree is a vice using either of a natural falseness or fearfulness or of a mind that hath some main faults which because a man must needs disguise it maketh him practise simulation in other things lest his hand should be out of use The great advantages of simulation and dissimulation are three 
764_132272_000013_000001	train-clean-360	First to lay asleep opposition and to surprise 
764_132272_000013_000002	train-clean-360	For where a man s intentions are published it is an alarum to call up all that are against them The second is to reserve to a man s self a fair retreat 
764_132272_000013_000003	train-clean-360	For if a man engage himself by a manifest declaration he must go through or take a fall 
764_132272_000013_000004	train-clean-360	The third is the better to discover the mind of another 
none	none	For to him that opens himself men will hardly show themselves adverse but will fair let him go on and turn their freedom of speech to freedom of thought And therefore it is a good shrewd proverb of the Spaniard Tell a lie and find a troth 
764_132272_000013_000007	train-clean-360	As if there were no way of discovery but by simulation 
none	none	There be also three disadvantages to set it even 
764_132272_000013_000009	train-clean-360	The first that simulation and dissimulation commonly carry with them a show of fearfulness which in any business doth spoil the feathers of round flying up to the mark 
764_132272_000013_000010	train-clean-360	The second that it puzzleth and perplexeth the conceits of many that perhaps would otherwise company operate with him and makes a man walk almost alone to his own ends 
764_132272_000013_000011	train-clean-360	The third and greatest is that it depriveth a man of one of the most principal instruments for action which is trust and belief 
none	none	The best composition and temperature is to have openness in fame and opinion secrecy in habit dissimulation in seasonable use and a power to feign if there be no remedy Of Parents And Children THE joys of parents are secret and so are their griefs and fears They cannot utter the one nor they will not utter the other 
764_132272_000015_000001	train-clean-360	Children sweeten labors but they make misfortunes more bitter 
764_132272_000015_000002	train-clean-360	They increase the cares of life but they mitigate the remembrance of death

none	none	And surely a man shall see the noblest works and foundations have proceeded from childless men which have sought to express the images of their minds where those of their bodies have failed

764_132272_000015_000006	train-clean-360	They that are the first raisers of their houses are most indulgent towards their children beholding them as the continuance not only of their kind but of their work and so both children and creatures 
none	none	The difference in affection of parents towards their several children is many times unequal and sometimes unworthy especially in the mothers as Solomon saith A wise son rejoiceth the father but an ungracious son shames the mother 
764_132272_000016_000001	train-clean-360	A man shall see where there is a house full of children one or two of the eldest respected and the youngest made wantons but in the midst some that are as it were forgotten who many times nevertheless prove the best 
764_132272_000016_000002	train-clean-360	The illiberality of parents in allowance towards their children is an harmful error makes them base acquaints them with shifts makes them sort with mean company and makes them surfeit more when they come to plenty 
764_132272_000016_000003	train-clean-360	And therefore the proof is best when men keep their authority towards the children but not their purse 
none	none	Men have a foolish manner both parents and schoolmasters and servants in creating and breeding an emulation between brothers during childhood which many times sorteth to discord when they are men and disturbeth families The Italians make little difference between children and nephews or near kinsfolks but so they be of the lump they care not though they pass not through their own body And to say truth in nature it is much a like matter insomuch that we see a nephew sometimes resembleth an uncle or a kinsman more than his own parent as the blood happens Let parents choose betimes the vocations and courses they mean their children should take for then they are most flexible and let them not too much apply themselves to the disposition of their children as thinking they will take best to that which they have most mind to It is true that if the affection or aptness of the children be extraordinary then it is good not to cross it but generally the precept is good optimum elige suave et facile illud faciet consuetudo Younger brothers are commonly fortunate but seldom or never where the elder are disinherited Of Marriage And Single Life HE THAT hath wife and children hath given hostages to fortune for they are impediments to great enterprises either of virtue or mischief Certainly the best works and of greatest merit for the public have proceeded from the unmarried or childless men which both in affection and means have married and endowed the public 
764_132272_000018_000001	train-clean-360	Yet it were great reason that those that have children should have greatest care of future times unto which they know they must transmit their dearest pledges Some there are who though they lead a single life yet their thoughts do end with themselves and account future times impertinences 
764_132272_000018_000002	train-clean-360	Nay there are some other that account wife and children but as bills of charges 
764_132272_000018_000003	train-clean-360	Nay more there are some foolish rich covetous men that take a pride in having no children because they may be thought so much the richer 
none	none	For perhaps they have heard some talk Such an one is a great rich man and another except to it Yea but he hath a great charge of children as if it were an abatement to his riches 
764_132272_000018_000005	train-clean-360	But the most ordinary cause of a single life is liberty especially in certain self pleasing and humorous minds which are so sensible of every restraint as they will go near to think their girdles and garters to be bonds and shackles

none	none	Certainly wife and children are a kind of discipline of humanity and single men though they may be many times more charitable because their means are less exhaust yet on the other side they are more cruel and hardhearted good to make severe inquisitors because their tenderness is not so oft called upon 
764_132272_000018_000011	train-clean-360	Grave natures led by custom and therefore constant are commonly loving husbands as was said of Ulysses vetulam suam praetulit immortalitati Chaste women are often proud and froward as presuming upon the merit of their chastity 
none	none	It is one of the best bonds both of chastity and obedience in the wife if she think her husband wise which she will never do if she find him jealous Wives are young men s mistresses companions for middle age and old men s nurses So as a man may have a quarrel to marry when he will But yet he was reputed one of the wise men that made answer to the question when a man should marry A young man not yet an elder man not at all 
764_132272_000018_000016	train-clean-360	It is often seen that bad husbands have very good wives whether it be that it raiseth the price of their husband s kindness when it comes or that the wives take a pride in their patience 
none	none	But this never fails if the bad husbands were of their own choosing against their friends consent for then they will be sure to make good their own folly Of Envy THERE be none of the affections which have been noted to fascinate or bewitch but love and envy They both have vehement wishes they frame themselves readily into imaginations and suggestions and they come easily into the eye especially upon the present of the objects which are the points that conduce to fascination if any such thing there be We see likewise the Scripture calleth envy an evil eye and the astrologers call the evil influences of the stars evil aspects so that still there seemeth to be acknowledged in the act of envy an ejaculation or irradiation of the eye Nay some have been so curious as to note that the times when the stroke or percussion of an envious eye doth most hurt are when the party envied is beheld in glory or triumph for that sets an edge upon envy and besides at such times the spirits of the person envied do come forth most into the outward parts and so meet the blow But leaving these curiosities though not unworthy to be thought on in fit place we will handle what persons are apt to envy others what persons are most subject to be envied themselves and what is the difference between public and private envy A man that hath no virtue in himself ever envieth virtue in others For men s minds will either feed upon their own good or upon others evil and who wanteth the one will prey upon the other and whoso is out of hope to attain to another s virtue will seek to come at even hand by depressing another s fortune A man that is busy and inquisitive is commonly envious For to know much of other men s matters cannot be because all that ado may concern his own estate therefore it must needs be that he taketh a kind of play pleasure in looking upon the fortunes of others Neither can he that mindeth but his own business find much matter for envy For envy is a gadding passion and walketh the streets and doth not keep home Non est curiosus quin idem sit malevolus Men of noble birth are noted to be envious towards new men when they rise For the distance is altered and it is like a deceit of the eye that when others come on they think themselves go back Deformed persons and eunuchs and old men and bastards are envious For he that cannot possibly mend his own case will do what he can to impair another s except these defects light upon a very brave and heroical nature which thinketh to make his natural wants part of his honor in that it should be said that an eunuch or a lame man did such great matters affecting the honor of a miracle as it was in Narses the eunuch and Agesilaus and Tamberlanes that were lame men The same is the case of men that rise after calamities and misfortunes For they are as men fallen out with the times and think other men s harms a redemption of their own sufferings They that desire to excel in too many matters out of levity and vain glory are ever envious For they cannot want work it being impossible but many in some one of those things should surpass them Which was the character of Adrian the Emperor that mortally envied poets and painters and artificers in works wherein he had a vein to excel Lastly near kinsfolks and fellows in office and those that have been bred together are more apt to envy their equals when they are raised For it doth upbraid unto them their own fortunes and pointeth at them and cometh oftener into their remembrance and incurreth likewise more into the note of others and envy ever redoubleth from speech and fame Cain s envy was the more vile and malignant towards his brother Abel because when his sacrifice was better accepted there was no body to look on Thus much for those that are apt to envy Concerning those that are more or less subject to envy First persons of eminent virtue when they are advanced are less envied For their fortune seemeth but due unto them and no man envieth the payment of a debt but rewards and liberality rather Again envy is ever joined with the comparing of a man s self and where there is no comparison no envy and therefore kings are not envied but by kings Nevertheless it is to be noted that unworthy persons are most envied at their first coming in and afterwards overcome it better whereas contrariwise persons of worth and merit are most envied when their fortune continueth long For by that time though their virtue be the same yet it hath not the same lustre for fresh men grow up that darken it Persons of noble blood are less envied in their rising For it seemeth but right done to their birth Besides there seemeth not much added to their fortune and envy is as the sunbeams that beat hotter upon a bank or steep rising ground than upon a flat And for the same reason those that are advanced by degrees are less envied than those that are advanced suddenly and per saltum Those that have joined with their honor great travels cares or perils are less subject to envy For men think that they earn their honors hardly and pity them sometimes and pity ever healeth envy Wherefore you shall observe that the more deep and sober sort of politic persons in their greatness are ever bemoaning themselves what a life they lead chanting a quanta patimur Not that they feel it so but only to abate the edge of envy But this is to be understood of business that is laid upon men and not such as they call unto themselves For nothing increaseth envy more than an unnecessary and ambitious engrossing of business And nothing doth extinguish envy more than for a great person to preserve all other inferior officers in their full lights and pre eminences of their places For by that means there be so many screens between him and envy Above all those are most subject to envy which carry the greatness of their fortunes in an insolent and proud manner being never well but while they are showing how great they are either by outward pomp or by triumphing over all opposition or competition whereas wise men will rather do sacrifice to envy in suffering themselves sometimes of purpose to be crossed and overborne in things that do not much concern them Notwithstanding so much is true that the carriage of greatness in a plain and open manner so it be without arrogancy and vain glory doth draw less envy than if it be in a more crafty and cunning fashion For in that course a man doth but disavow fortune and seemeth to be conscious of his own want in worth and doth but teach others to envy him Lastly to conclude this part as we said in the beginning that the act of envy had somewhat in it of witchcraft so there is no other cure of envy but the cure of witchcraft and that is to remove the lot as they call it and to lay it upon another For which purpose the wiser sort of great persons bring in ever upon the stage somebody upon whom to derive the envy that would come upon themselves sometimes upon ministers and servants sometimes upon colleagues and associates and the like and for that turn there are never wanting some persons of violent and undertaking natures who so they may have power and business will take it at any cost Now to speak of public envy There is yet some good in public envy whereas in private there is none For public envy is as an ostracism that eclipseth men when they grow too great And therefore it is a bridle also to great ones to keep them within bounds This envy being in the Latin word invidia goeth in the modern language by the name of discontentment of which we shall speak in handling sedition It is a disease in a state like to infection For as infection spreadeth upon that which is sound and tainteth it so when envy is gotten once into a state it traduceth even the best actions thereof and turneth them into an ill odor And therefore there is little won by intermingling of plausible actions For that doth argue but a weakness and fear of envy which hurteth so much the more as it is likewise usual in infections which if you fear them you call them upon you This public envy seemeth to beat chiefly upon principal officers or ministers rather than upon kings and estates themselves But this is a sure rule that if the envy upon the minister be great when the cause of it in him is small or if the envy be general in a manner upon all the ministers of an estate then the envy though hidden is truly upon the state itself And so much of public envy or discontentment and the difference thereof from private envy which was handled in the first place We will add this in general touching the affection of envy that of all other affections it is the most importune and continual For of other affections there is occasion given but now and then and therefore it was well said Invidia festos dies non agit for it is ever working upon some or other And it is also noted that love and envy do make a man pine which other affections do not because they are not so continual It is also the vilest affection and the most depraved for which cause it is the proper attribute of the devil who is called the envious man that soweth tares amongst the wheat by night as it always cometh to pass that envy worketh subtilly and in the dark and to the prejudice of good things such as is the wheat Of Love THE stage is more beholding to love than the life of man For as to the stage love is ever matter of comedies and now and then of tragedies but in life it doth much mischief sometimes like a siren sometimes like a fury You may observe that amongst all the great and worthy persons whereof the memory remaineth either ancient or recent there is not one that hath been transported to the mad degree of love which shows that great spirits and great business do keep out this weak passion You must except nevertheless Marcus Antonius the half partner of the empire of Rome and Appius Claudius the decemvir and lawgiver whereof the former was indeed a voluptuous man and inordinate but the latter was an austere and wise man and therefore it seems though rarely that love can find entrance not only into an open heart but also into a heart well fortified if watch be not well kept It is a poor saying of Epicurus Satis magnum alter alteri theatrum sumus as if man made for the contemplation of heaven and all noble objects should do nothing but kneel before a little idol and make himself a subject though not of the mouth as beasts are yet of the eye which was given him for higher purposes It is a strange thing to note the excess of this passion and how it braves the nature and value of things by this that the speaking in a perpetual hyperbole is comely in nothing but in love Neither is it merely in the phrase for whereas it hath been well said that the arch flatterer with whom all the petty flatterers have intelligence is a man s self certainly the lover is more For there was never proud man thought so absurdly well of himself as the lover doth of the person loved and therefore it was well said That it is impossible to love and to be wise Neither doth this weakness appear to others only and not to the party loved but to the loved most of all except the love be reciproque For it is a true rule that love is ever rewarded either with the reciproque or with an inward and secret contempt By how much the more men ought to beware of this passion which loseth not only other things but itself As for the other losses the poet s relation doth well figure them that he that preferred Helena quitted the gifts of Juno and Pallas For whosoever esteemeth too much of amorous affection quitteth both riches and wisdom This passion hath his floods in very times of weakness which are great prosperity and great adversity though this latter hath been less observed both which times kindle love and make it more fervent and therefore show it to be the child of folly They do best who if they cannot but admit love yet make it keep quarters and sever it wholly from their serious affairs and actions of life for if it check once with business it troubleth men s fortunes and maketh men that they can no ways be true to their own ends I know not how but martial men are given to love I think it is but as they are given to wine for perils commonly ask to be paid in pleasures There is in man s nature a secret inclination and motion towards love of others which if it be not spent upon some one or a few doth naturally spread itself towards many and maketh men become humane and charitable as it is seen sometime in friars Nuptial love maketh mankind friendly love perfecteth it but wanton love corrupteth and embaseth it Of Great Place MEN in great place are thrice servants servants of the sovereign or state servants of fame and servants of business So as they have no freedom neither in their persons nor in their actions nor in their times It is a strange desire to seek power and to lose liberty or to seek power over others and to lose power over a man s self The rising unto place is laborious and by pains men come to greater pains and it is sometimes base and by indignities men come to dignities The standing is slippery and the regress is either a downfall or at least an eclipse which is a melancholy thing Cum non sis qui fueris non esse cur velis vivere Nay retire men cannot when they would neither will they when it were reason but are impatient of privateness even in age and sickness which require the shadow like old townsmen that will be still sitting at their street door though thereby they offer age to scom Certainly great persons had need to borrow other men s opinions to think themselves happy for if they judge by their own feeling they cannot find it but if they think with themselves what other men think of them and that other men would fain be as they are then they are happy as it were by report when perhaps they find the contrary within For they are the first that find their own griefs though they be the last that find their own faults Certainly men in great fortunes are strangers to themselves and while they are in the puzzle of business they have no time to tend their health either of body or mind Illi mors gravis incubat qui notus nimis omnibus ignotus moritur sibi In place there is license to do good and evil whereof the latter is a curse for in evil the best condition is not to win the second not to can But power to do good is the true and lawful end of aspiring For good thoughts though God accept them yet towards men are little better than good dreams except they be put in act and that cannot be without power and place as the vantage and commanding ground Merit and good works is the end of man s motion and conscience of the same is the accomplishment of man s rest For if a man can be partaker of God s theatre he shall likewise be partaker of God s rest Et conversus Deus ut aspiceret opera quae fecerunt manus suae vidit quod omnia essent bona nimis and then the sabbath In the discharge of thy place set before thee the best examples for imitation is a globe of precepts And after a time set before thee thine own example and examine thyself strictly whether thou didst not best at first Neglect not also the examples of those that have carried themselves ill in the same place not to set off thyself by taxing their memory but to direct thyself what to avoid Reform therefore without bravery or scandal of former times and persons but yet set it down to thyself as well to create good precedents as to follow them Reduce things to the first institution and observe wherein and how they have degenerate but yet ask counsel of both times of the ancient time what is best and of the latter time what is fittest Seek to make thy course regular that men may know beforehand what they may expect but be not too positive and peremptory and express thyself well when thou digressest from thy rule Preserve the right of thy place but stir not questions of jurisdiction and rather assume thy right in silence and de facto than voice it with claims and challenges Preserve likewise the rights of inferior places and think it more honor to direct in chief than to be busy in all Embrace and invite helps and advices touching the execution of thy place and do not drive away such as bring thee information as meddlers but accept of them in good part The vices of authority are chiefly four delays corruption roughness and facility For delays give easy access keep times appointed go through with that which is in hand and interlace not business but of necessity For corruption do not only bind thine own hands or thy servants hands from taking but bind the hands of suitors also from offering For integrity used doth the one but integrity professed and with a manifest detestation of bribery doth the other And avoid not only the fault but the suspicion Whosoever is found variable and changeth manifestly without manifest cause giveth suspicion of corruption Therefore always when thou changest thine opinion or course profess it plainly and declare it together with the reasons that move thee to change and do not think to steal it A servant or a favorite if he be inward and no other apparent cause of esteem is commonly thought but a by way to close corruption For roughness it is a needless cause of discontent severity breedeth fear but roughness breedeth hate Even reproofs from authority ought to be grave and not taunting As for facility it is worse than bribery For bribes come but now and then but if importunity or idle respects lead a man he shall never be without As Solomon saith To respect persons is not good for such a man will transgress for a piece of bread It is most true that was anciently spoken A place showeth the man And it showeth some to the better and some to the worse Omnium consensu capax imperii nisi imperasset saith Tacitus of Galba but of Vespasian he saith Solus imperantium Vespasianus mutatus in melius though the one was meant of sufficiency the other of manners and affection It is an assured sign of a worthy and generous spirit whom honor amends For honor is or should be the place of virtue and as in nature things move violently to their place and calmly in their place so virtue in ambition is violent in authority settled and calm All rising to great place is by a winding star and if there be factions it is good to side a man s self whilst he is in the rising and to balance himself when he is placed Use the memory of thy predecessor fairly and tenderly for if thou dost not it is a debt will sure be paid when thou art gone If thou have colleagues respect them and rather call them when they look not for it than exclude them when they have reason to look to be called Be not too sensible or too remembering of thy place in conversation and private answers to suitors but let it rather be said When he sits in place he is another man Of Boldness IT IS a trivial grammar school text but yet worthy a wise man s consideration Question was asked of Demosthenes what was the chief part of an orator he answered action what next action what next again action He said it that knew it best and had by nature himself no advantage in that he commended A strange thing that that part of an orator which is but superficial and rather the virtue of a player should be placed so high above those other noble parts of invention elocution and the rest nay almost alone as if it were all in all But the reason is plain There is in human nature generally more of the fool than of the wise and therefore those faculties by which the foolish part of men s minds is taken are most potent Wonderful like is the case of boldness in civil business what first boldness what second and third boldness And yet boldness is a child of ignorance and baseness far inferior to other parts But nevertheless it doth fascinate and bind hand and foot those that are either shallow in judgment or weak in courage which are the greatest part yea and prevaileth with wise men at weak times Therefore we see it hath done wonders in popular states but with senates and princes less and more ever upon the first entrance of bold persons into action than soon after for boldness is an ill keeper of promise Surely as there are mountebanks for the natural body so are there mountebanks for the politic body men that undertake great cures and perhaps have been lucky in two or three experiments but want the grounds of science and therefore cannot hold out Nay you shall see a bold fellow many times do Mahomet s miracle Mahomet made the people believe that he would call an hill to him and from the top of it offer up his prayers for the observers of his law The people assembled Mahomet called the hill to come to him again and again and when the hill stood still he was never a whit abashed but said If the hill will not come to Mahomet Mahomet will go to the hill So these men when they have promised great matters and failed most shamefully yet if they have the perfection of boldness they will but slight it over and make a turn and no more ado Certainly to men of great judgment bold persons are a sport to behold nay and to the vulgar also boldness has somewhat of the ridiculous For if absurdity be the subject of laughter doubt you not but great boldness is seldom without some absurdity Especially it is a sport to see when a bold fellow is out of countenance for that puts his face into a most shrunken and wooden posture as needs it must for in bashfulness the spirits do a little go and come but with bold men upon like occasion they stand at a stay like a stale at chess where it is no mate but yet the game cannot stir But this last were fitter for a satire than for a serious observation This is well to be weighed that boldness is ever blind for it seeth not danger and inconveniences Therefore it is ill in counsel good in execution so that the right use of bold persons is that they never command in chief but be seconds and under the direction of others For in counsel it is good to see dangers and in execution not to see them except they be very great Of Goodness and Goodness Of Nature I TAKE goodness in this sense the affecting of the weal of men which is that the Grecians call philanthropia and the word humanity as it is used is a little too light to express it Goodness I call the habit and goodness of nature the inclination This of all virtues and dignities of the mind is the greatest being the character of the Deity and without it man is a busy mischievous wretched thing no better than a kind of vermin Goodness answers to the theological virtue charity and admits no excess but error The desire of power in excess caused the angels to fall the desire of knowledge in excess caused man to fall but in charity there is no excess neither can angel nor man come in danger by it The inclination to goodness is imprinted deeply in the nature of man insomuch that if it issue not towards men it will take unto other living creatures as it is seen in the Turks a cruel people who nevertheless are kind to beasts and give alms to dogs and birds insomuch as Busbechius reporteth a Christian boy in Constantinople had like to have been stoned for gagging in a waggishness a long billed fowl Errors indeed in this virtue of goodness or charity may be committed The Italians have an ungracious proverb Tanto buon che val niente so good that he is good for nothing And one of the doctors of Italy Nicholas Machiavel had the confidence to put in writing almost in plain terms That the Christian faith had given up good men in prey to those that are tyrannical and unjust Which he spake because indeed there was never law or sect or opinion did so much magnify goodness as the Christian religion doth Therefore to avoid the scandal and the danger both it is good to take knowledge of the errors of an habit so excellent Seek the good of other men but be not in bondage to their faces or fancies for that is but facility or softness which taketh an honest mind prisoner Neither give thou AEsop s cock a gem who would be better pleased and happier if he had had a barley corn The example of God teacheth the lesson truly He sendeth his rain and maketh his sun to shine upon the just and unjust but he doth not rain wealth nor shine honor and virtues upon men equally Common benefits are to be communicate with all but peculiar benefits with choice And beware how in making the portraiture thou breakest the pattern For divinity maketh the love of ourselves the pattern the love of our neighbors but the portraiture Sell all thou hast and give it to the poor and follow me but sell not all thou hast except thou come and follow me that is except thou have a vocation wherein thou mayest do as much good with little means as with great for otherwise in feeding the streams thou driest the fountain Neither is there only a habit of goodness directed by right reason but there is in some men even in nature a disposition towards it as on the other side there is a natural malignity For there be that in their nature do not affect the good of others The lighter sort of malignity turneth but to a crassness or frowardness or aptness to oppose or difficulties or the like but the deeper sort to envy and mere mischief Such men in other men s calamities are as it were in season and are ever on the loading part not so good as the dogs that licked Lazarus sores but like flies that are still buzzing upon any thing that is raw misanthropi that make it their practice to bring men to the bough and yet never a tree for the purpose in their gardens as Timon had Such dispositions are the very errors of human nature and yet they are the fittest timber to make great politics of like to knee timber that is good for ships that are ordained to be tossed but not for building houses that shall stand firm The parts and signs of goodness are many If a man be gracious and courteous to strangers it shows he is a citizen of the world and that his heart is no island cut off from other lands but a continent that joins to them If he be compassionate towards the afflictions of others it shows that his heart is like the noble tree that is wounded itself when it gives the balm If he easily pardons and remits offences it shows that his mind is planted above injuries so that he cannot be shot If he be thankful for small benefits it shows that he weighs men s minds and not their trash But above all if he have saint Paul s perfection that he would wish to be anathema from Christ for the salvation of his brethren it shows much of a divine nature and a kind of conformity with Christ himself Of Nobility WE WILL speak of nobility first as a portion of an estate then as a condition of particular persons A monarchy where there is no nobility at all is ever a pure and absolute tyranny as that of the Turks For nobility attempers sovereignty and draws the eyes of the people somewhat aside from the line royal But for democracies they need it not and they are commonly more quiet and less subject to sedition than where there are stirps of nobles For men s eyes are upon the business and not upon the persons or if upon the persons it is for the business sake as fittest and not for flags and pedigree We see the Switzers last well notwithstanding their diversity of religion and of cantons For utility is their bond and not respects The united provinces of the Low Countries in their government excel for where there is an equality the consultations are more indifferent and the payments and tributes more cheerful A great and potent nobility addeth majesty to a monarch but diminisheth power and putteth life and spirit into the people but presseth their fortune It is well when nobles are not too great for sovereignty nor for justice and yet maintained in that height as the insolency of inferiors may be broken upon them before it come on too fast upon the majesty of kings A numerous nobility causeth poverty and inconvenience in a state for it is a surcharge of expense and besides it being of necessity that many of the nobility fall in time to be weak in fortune it maketh a kind of disproportion between honor and means As for nobility in particular persons it is a reverend thing to see an ancient castle or building not in decay or to see a fair timber tree sound and perfect How much more to behold an ancient noble family which has stood against the waves and weathers of time For new nobility is but the act of power but ancient nobility is the act of time Those that are first raised to nobility are commonly more virtuous but less innocent than their descendants for there is rarely any rising but by a commixture of good and evil arts But it is reason the memory of their virtues remain to their posterity and their faults die with themselves Nobility of birth commonly abateth industry and he that is not industrious envieth him that is Besides noble persons cannot go much higher and he that standeth at a stay when others rise can hardly avoid motions of envy On the other side nobility extinguisheth the passive envy from others towards them because they are in possession of honor Certainly kings that have able men of their nobility shall find ease in employing them and a better slide into their business for people naturally bend to them as born in some sort to command Of Seditions And Troubles SHEPHERDS of people had need know the calendars of tempests in state which are commonly greatest when things grow to equality as natural tempests are greatest about the Equinoctia And as there are certain hollow blasts of wind and secret swellings of seas before a tempest so are there in states Ille etiam caecos instare tumultus Saepe monet fraudesque et operta tunescere bella Libels and licentious discourses against the state when they are frequent and open and in like sort false news often running up and down to the disadvantage of the state and hastily embraced are amongst the signs of troubles Virgil giving the pedigree of Fame saith she was sister to the Giants Illam Terra parens irra irritata deorum Extremam ut perhibent Coeo Enceladoque sororem Progenuit As if fames were the relics of seditions past but they are no less indeed the preludes of seditions to come Howsoever he noteth it right that seditious tumults and seditious fames differ no more but as brother and sister masculine and feminine especially if it come to that that the best actions of a state and the most plausible and which ought to give greatest contentment are taken in ill sense and traduced for that shows the envy great as Tacitus saith conflata magna invidia seu bene seu male gesta premunt Neither doth it follow that because these fames are a sign of troubles that the suppressing of them with too much severity should be a remedy of troubles For the despising of them many times checks them best and the going about to stop them doth but make a wonder long lived Also that kind of obedience which Tacitus speaketh of is to be held suspected Erant in officio sed tamen qui mallent mandata imperantium interpretari quam exequi disputing excusing cavilling upon mandates and directions is a kind of shaking off the yoke and assay of disobedience especially if in those disputings they which are for the direction speak fearfully and tenderly and those that are against it audaciously Also as Machiavel noteth well when princes that ought to be common parents make themselves as a party and lean to a side it is as a boat that is overthrown by uneven weight on the one side as was well seen in the time of Henry the Third of France for first himself entered league for the extirpation of the Protestants and presently after the same league was turned upon himself For when the authority of princes is made but an accessory to a cause and that there be other bands that tie faster than the band of sovereignty kings begin to be put almost out of possession Also when discords and quarrels and factions are carried openly and audaciously it is a sign the reverence of government is lost For the motions of the greatest persons in a government ought to be as the motions of the planets under primum mobile according to the old opinion which is that every of them is carried swiftly by the highest motion and softly in their own motion And therefore when great ones in their own particular motion move violently and as Tacitus expresseth it well liberius quam ut imperantium meminissent it is a sign the orbs are out of frame For reverence is that wherewith princes are girt from God who threateneth the dissolving thereof Solvam cingula regum So when any of the four pillars of government are mainly shaken or weakened which are religion justice counsel and treasure men had need to pray for fair weather But let us pass from this part of predictions concerning which nevertheless more light may be taken from that which followeth and let us speak first of the materials of seditions then of the motives of them and thirdly of the remedies Concerning the materials of seditions It is a thing well to be considered for the surest way to prevent seditions if the times do bear it is to take away the matter of them For if there be fuel prepared it is hard to tell whence the spark shall come that shall set it on fire The matter of seditions is of two kinds much poverty and much discontentment It is certain so many overthrown estates so many votes for troubles Lucan noteth well the state of Rome before the Civil War Hinc usura vorax rapidumque in tempore foenus Hinc concussa fides et multis utile bellum This same multis utile bellum is an assured and infallible sign of a state disposed to seditions and troubles And if this poverty and broken estate in the better sort be joined with a want and necessity in the mean people the danger is imminent and great For the rebellions of the belly are the worst As for discontentments they are in the politic body like to humors in the natural which are apt to gather a preternatural heat and to inflame And let no prince measure the danger of them by this whether they be just or unjust for that were to imagine people to be too reasonable who do often spurn at their own good nor yet by this whether the griefs whereupon they rise be in fact great or small for they are the most dangerous discontentments where the fear is greater than the feeling Dolendi modus timendi non item Besides in great oppressions the same things that provoke the patience do withal mate the courage but in fears it is not so Neither let any prince or state be secure concerning discontentments because they have been often or have been long and yet no peril hath ensued for as it is true that every vapor or fume doth not turn into a storm so it is nevertheless true that storms though they blow over divers times yet may fall at last and as the Spanish proverb noteth well The cord breaketh at the last by the weakest pull The causes and motives of seditions are innovation in religion taxes alteration of laws and customs breaking of privileges general oppression advancement of unworthy persons strangers dearths disbanded soldiers factions grown desperate and what soever in offending people joineth and knitteth them in a common cause For the remedies there may be some general preservatives whereof we will speak as for the just cure it must answer to the particular disease and so be left to counsel rather than rule The first remedy or prevention is to remove by all means possible that material cause of sedition whereof we spake which is want and poverty in the estate To which purpose serveth the opening and well balancing of trade the cherishing of manufactures the banishing of idleness the repressing of waste and excess by sumptuary laws the improvement and husbanding of the soil the regulating of prices of things vendible the moderating of taxes and tributes and the like Generally it is to be foreseen that the population of a kingdom especially if it be not mown down by wars do not exceed the stock of the kingdom which should maintain them Neither is the population to be reckoned only by number for a smaller number that spend more and earn less do wear out an estate sooner than a greater number that live lower and gather more Therefore the multiplying of nobility and other degrees of quality in an over proportion to the common people doth speedily bring a state to necessity and so doth likewise an overgrown clergy for they bring nothing to the stock and in like manner when more are bred scholars than preferments can take off It is likewise to be remembered that forasmuch as the increase of any estate must be upon the foreigner for whatsoever is somewhere gotten is somewhere lost there be but three things which one nation selleth unto another the commodity as nature yieldeth it the manufacture and the vecture or carriage So that if these three wheels go wealth will flow as in a spring tide And it cometh many times to pass that materiam superabit opus that the work and carriage is more worth than the material and enricheth a state more as is notably seen in the Low Countrymen who have the best mines above ground in the world Above all things good policy is to be used that the treasure and moneys in a state be not gathered into few hands For otherwise a state may have a great stock and yet starve And money is like muck not good except it be spread This is done chiefly by suppressing or at least keeping a strait hand upon the devouring trades of usury ingrossing great pasturages and the like For removing discontentments or at least the danger of them there is in every state as we know two portions of subjects the noblesse and the commonalty When one of these is discontent the danger is not great for common people are of slow motion if they be not excited by the greater sort and the greater sort are of small strength except the multitude be apt and ready to move of themselves Then is the danger when the greater sort do but wait for the troubling of the waters amongst the meaner that then they may declare themselves The poets feign that the rest of the gods would have bound Jupiter which he hearing of by the counsel of Pallas sent for Briareus with his hundred hands to come in to his aid An emblem no doubt to show how safe it is for monarchs to make sure of the good will of common people To give moderate liberty for griefs and discontentments to evaporate so it be without too great insolency or bravery is a safe way For he that turneth the humors back and maketh the wound bleed inwards endangereth malign ulcers and pernicious imposthumations The part of Epimetheus mought well become Prometheus in the case of discontentments for there is not a better provision against them Epimetheus when griefs and evils flew abroad at last shut the lid and kept hope in the bottom of the vessel Certainly the politic and artificial nourishing and entertaining of hopes and carrying men from hopes to hopes is one of the best antidotes against the poison of discontentments And it is a certain sign of a wise government and proceeding when it can hold men s hearts by hopes when it cannot by satisfaction and when it can handle things in such manner as no evil shall appear so peremptory but that it hath some outlet of hope which is the less hard to do because both particular persons and factions are apt enough to flatter themselves or at least to brave that which they believe not Also the foresight and prevention that there be no likely or fit head whereunto discontented persons may resort and under whom they may join is a known but an excellent point of caution I understand a fit head to be one that hath greatness and reputation that hath confidence with the discontented party and upon whom they turn their eyes and that is thought discontented in his own particular which kind of persons are either to be won and reconciled to the state and that in a fast and true manner or to be fronted with some other of the same party that may oppose them and so divide the reputation Generally the dividing and breaking of all factions and combinations that are adverse to the state and setting them at distance or at least distrust amongst themselves is not one of the worst remedies For it is a desperate case if those that hold with the proceeding of the state be full of discord and faction and those that are against it be entire and united I have noted that some witty and sharp speeches which have fallen from princes have given fire to seditions Caesar did himself infinite hurt in that speech Sylla nescivit literas non potuit dictare for it did utterly cut off that hope which men had entertained that he would at one time or other give over his dictatorship Galba undid himself by that speech legi a se militem non emi for it put the soldiers out of hope of the donative Probus likewise by that speech Si vixero non opus erit amplius Romano imperio militibus a speech of great despair for the soldiers And many the like Surely princes had need in tender matters and ticklish times to beware what they say especially in these short speeches which fly abroad like darts and are thought to be shot out of their secret intentions For as for large discourses they are flat things and not so much noted Lastly let princes against all events not be without some great person one or rather more of military valor near unto them for the repressing of seditions in their beginnings For without that there useth to be more trepidation in court upon the first breaking out of troubles than were fit And the state runneth the danger of that which Tacitus saith Atque is habitus animorum fuit ut pessimum facinus auderent pauci plures vellent omnes paterentur But let such military persons be assured and well reputed of rather than factious and popular holding also good correspondence with the other great men in the state or else the remedy is worse than the disease Of Atheism I HAD rather believe all the fables in the Legend and the Talmud and the Alcoran than that this universal frame is without a mind And therefore God never wrought miracle to convince atheism because his ordinary works convince it It is true that a little philosophy inclineth man s mind to atheism but depth in philosophy bringeth men s minds about to religion For while the mind of man looketh upon second causes scattered it may sometimes rest in them and go no further but when it beholdeth the chain of them confederate and linked together it must needs fly to Providence and Deity Nay even that school which is most accused of atheism doth most demonstrate religion that is the school of Leucippus and Democritus and Epicurus For it is a thousand times more credible that four mutable elements and one immutable fifth essence duly and eternally placed need no God than that an army of infinite small portions or seeds unplaced should have produced this order and beauty without a divine marshal The Scripture saith The fool hath said in his heart there is no God it is not said The fool hath thought in his heart so as he rather saith it by rote to himself as that he would have than that he can thoroughly believe it or be persuaded of it For none deny there is a God but those for whom it maketh that there were no God It appeareth in nothing more that atheism is rather in the lip than in the heart of man than by this that atheists will ever be talking of that their opinion as if they fainted in it within themselves and would be glad to be strengthened by the consent of others Nay more you shall have atheists strive to get disciples as it fareth with other sects And which is most of all you shall have of them that will suffer for atheism and not recant whereas if they did truly think that there were no such thing as God why should they trouble themselves Epicurus is charged that he did but dissemble for his credit s sake when he affirmed there were blessed natures but such as enjoyed themselves without having respect to the government of the world Wherein they say he did temporize though in secret he thought there was no God But certainly he is traduced for his words are noble and divine Non deos vulgi negare profanum sed vulgi opiniones diis applicare profanum Plato could have said no more And although he had the confidence to deny the administration he had not the power to deny the nature The Indians of the West have names for their particular gods though they have no name for God as if the heathens should have had the names Jupiter Apollo Mars et cetera but not the word Deus which shows that even those barbarous people have the notion though they have not the latitude and extent of it So that against atheists the very savages take part with the very subtlest philosophers The contemplative atheist is rare a Diagoras a Bion a Lucian perhaps and some others and yet they seem to be more than they are for that all that impugn a received religion or superstition are by the adverse part branded with the name of atheists But the great atheists indeed are hypocrites which are ever handling holy things but without feeling so as they must needs be cauterized in the end The causes of atheism are divisions in religion if they be many for any one main division addeth zeal to both sides but many divisions introduce atheism Another is scandal of priests when it is come to that which saint Bernard saith non est jam dicere ut populus sic sacerdos quia nec sic populus ut sacerdos A third is custom of profane scoffing in holy matters which doth by little and little deface the reverence of religion And lastly learned times specially with peace and prosperity for troubles and adversities do more bow men s minds to religion They that deny a God destroy man s nobility for certainly man is of kin to the beasts by his body and if he be not of kin to God by his spirit he is a base and ignoble creature It destroys likewise magnanimity and the raising of human nature for take an example of a dog and mark what a generosity and courage he will put on when he finds himself maintained by a man who to him is instead of a God or melior natura which courage is manifestly such as that creature without that confidence of a better nature than his own could never attain So man when he resteth and assureth himself upon divine protection and favor gathered a force and faith which human nature in itself could not obtain Therefore as atheism is in all respects hateful so in this that it depriveth human nature of the means to exalt itself above human frailty As it is in particular persons so it is in nations Never was there such a state for magnanimity as Rome Of this state hear what Cicero saith Quam volumus licet patres conscripti nos amemus tamen nec numero Hispanos nec robore Gallos nec calliditate Poenos nec artibus Graecos nec denique hoc ipso hujus gentis et terrae domestico nativoque sensu Italos ipsos et Latinos sed pietate ac religione atque hac una sapientia quod deorum immortalium numine omnia regi gubernarique perspeximus omnes gentes nationesque superavimus Of Superstition IT WERE better to have no opinion of God at all than such an opinion as is unworthy of him For the one is unbelief the other is contumely and certainly superstition is the reproach of the Deity Plutarch saith well to that purpose Surely saith he I had rather a great deal men should say there was no such man at all as Plutarch than that they should say that there was one Plutarch that would eat his children as soon as they were born as the poets speak of Saturn And as the contumely is greater towards God so the danger is greater towards men Atheism leaves a man to sense to philosophy to natural piety to laws to reputation all which may be guides to an outward moral virtue though religion were not but superstition dismounts all these and erecteth an absolute monarchy in the minds of men Therefore atheism did never perturb states for it makes men wary of themselves as looking no further and we see the times inclined to atheism as the time of Augustus Caesar were civil times But superstition hath been the confusion of many states and bringeth in a new primum mobile that ravisheth all the spheres of government The master of superstition is the people and in all superstition wise men follow fools and arguments are fitted to practice in a reversed order It was gravely said by some of the prelates in the Council of Trent where the doctrine of the Schoolmen bare great sway that the Schoolmen were like astronomers which did feign eccentrics and epicycles and such engines of orbs to save the phenomena though they knew there were no such things and in like manner that the Schoolmen had framed a number of subtle and intricate axioms and theorems to save the practice of the church The causes of superstition are pleasing and sensual rites and ceremonies excess of outward and pharisaical holiness overgreat reverence of traditions which cannot but load the church the stratagems of prelates for their own ambition and lucre the favoring too much of good intentions which openeth the gate to conceits and novelties the taking an aim at divine matters by human which cannot but breed mixture of imaginations and lastly barbarous times especially joined with calamities and disasters Superstition without a veil is a deformed thing for as it addeth deformity to an ape to be so like a man so the similitude of superstition to religion makes it the more deformed And as wholesome meat corrupteth to little worms so good forms and orders corrupt into a number of petty observances There is a superstition in avoiding superstition when men think to do best if they go furthest from the superstition formerly received therefore care would be had that as it fareth in ill purgings the good be not taken away with the bad which commonly is done when the people is the reformer Of Travel TRAVEL in the younger sort is a part of education in the elder a part of experience He that travelleth into a country before he hath some entrance into the language goeth to school and not to travel That young men travel under some tutor or grave servant I allow well so that he be such a one that hath the language and hath been in the country before whereby he may be able to tell them what things are worthy to be seen in the country where they go what acquaintances they are to seek what exercises or discipline the place yieldeth For else young men shall go hooded and look abroad little It is a strange thing that in sea voyages where there is nothing to be seen but sky and sea men should make diaries but in land travel wherein so much is to be observed for the most part they omit it as if chance were fitter to be registered than observation Let diaries therefore be brought in use The things to be seen and observed are the courts of princes especially when they give audience to ambassadors the courts of justice while they sit and hear causes and so of consistories ecclesiastic the churches and monasteries with the monuments which are therein extant the walls and fortifications of cities and towns and so the heavens and harbors antiquities and ruins libraries colleges disputations and lectures where any are shipping and navies houses and gardens of state and pleasure near great cities armories arsenals magazines exchanges burses warehouses exercises of horsemanship fencing training of soldiers and the like comedies such whereunto the better sort of persons do resort treasuries of jewels and robes cabinets and rarities and to conclude whatsoever is memorable in the places where they go After all which the tutors or servants ought to make diligent inquiry As for triumphs masks feasts weddings funerals capital executions and such shows men need not to be put in mind of them yet are they not to be neglected If you will have a young man to put his travel into a little room and in short time to gather much this you must do First as was said he must have some entrance into the language before he goeth Then he must have such a servant or tutor as knoweth the country as was likewise said Let him carry with him also some card or book describing the country where he travelleth which will be a good key to his inquiry Let him keep also a diary Let him not stay long in one city or town more or less as the place deserveth but not long nay when he stayeth in one city or town let him change his lodging from one end and part of the town to another which is a great adamant of acquaintance Let him sequester himself from the company of his countrymen and diet in such places where there is good company of the nation where he travelleth Let him upon his removes from one place to another procure recommendation to some person of quality residing in the place whither he removeth that he may use his favor in those things he desireth to see or know Thus he may abridge his travel with much profit As for the acquaintance which is to be sought in travel that which is most of all profitable is acquaintance with the secretaries and employed men of ambassadors for so in travelling in one country he shall suck the experience of many Let him also see and visit eminent persons in all kinds which are of great name abroad that he may be able to tell how the life agreeth with the fame For quarrels they are with care and discretion to be avoided They are commonly for mistresses healths place and words And let a man beware how he keepeth company with choleric and quarrelsome persons for they will engage him into their own quarrels When a traveller returneth home let him not leave the countries where he hath travelled altogether behind him but maintain a correspondence by letters with those of his acquaintance which are of most worth And let his travel appear rather in his discourse than his apparel or gesture and in his discourse let him be rather advised in his answers than forward to tell stories and let it appear that he doth not change his country manners for those of foreign parts but only prick in some flowers of that he hath learned abroad into the customs of his own country Of Empire IT IS a miserable state of mind to have few things to desire and many things to fear and yet that commonly is the case of kings who being at the highest want matter of desire which makes their minds more languishing and have many representations of perils and shadows which makes their minds the less clear And this is one reason also of that effect which the Scripture speaketh of That the king s heart is inscrutable For multitude of jealousies and lack of some predominant desire that should marshal and put in order all the rest maketh any man s heart hard to find or sound Hence it comes likewise that princes many times make themselves desires and set their hearts upon toys sometimes upon a building sometimes upon erecting of an order sometimes upon the advancing of a person sometimes upon obtaining excellency in some art or feat of the hand as Nero for playing on the harp Domitian for certainty of the hand with the arrow Commodus for playing at fence Caracalla for driving chariots and the like This seemeth incredible unto those that know not the principle that the mind of man is more cheered and refreshed by profiting in small things than by standing at a stay in great We see also that kings that have been fortunate conquerors in their first years it being not possible for them to go forward infinitely but that they must have some check or arrest in their fortunes turn in their latter years to be superstitious and melancholy as did Alexander the Great Diocletian and in our memory Charles the Fifth and others for he that is used to go forward and findeth a stop falleth out of his own favor and is not the thing he was To speak now of the true temper of empire it is a thing rare and hard to keep for both temper and distemper consist of contraries But it is one thing to mingle contraries another to interchange them The answer of Apollonius to Vespasian is full of excellent instruction Vespasian asked him What was Nero s overthrow He answered Nero could touch and tune the harp well but in government sometimes he used to wind the pins too high sometimes to let them down too low And certain it is that nothing destroyeth authority so much as the unequal and untimely interchange of power pressed too far and relaxed too much This is true that the wisdom of all these latter times in princes affairs is rather fine deliveries and shiftings of dangers and mischiefs when they are near than solid and grounded courses to keep them aloof But this is but to try masteries with fortune And let men beware how they neglect and suffer matter of trouble to be prepared for no man can forbid the spark nor tell whence it may come The difficulties in princes business are many and great but the greatest difficulty is often in their own mind For it is common with princes saith Tacitus to will contradictories Sunt plerumque regum voluntates vehementes et inter se contrariae For it is the solecism of power to think to command the end and yet not to endure the mean Kings have to deal with their neighbors their wives their children their prelates or clergy their nobles their second nobles or gentlemen their merchants their commons and their men of war and from all these arise dangers if care and circumspection be not used First for their neighbors there can no general rule be given for occasions are so variable save one which ever holdeth which is that princes do keep due sentinel that none of their neighbors do ever grow so by increase of territory by embracing of trade by approaches or the like as they become more able to annoy them than they were And this is generally the work of standing counsels to foresee and to hinder it During that triumvirate of kings King Henry the Eighth of England Francis the First King of France and Charles the Fifth Emperor there was such a watch kept that none of the three could win a palm of ground but the other two would straightways balance it either by confederation or if need were by a war and would not in any wise take up peace at interest And the like was done by that league which Guicciardini saith was the security of Italy made between Ferdinando King of Naples Lorenzius Medici and Ludovicus Sforza potentates the one of Florence the other of Milan Neither is the opinion of some of the Schoolmen to be received that a war cannot justly be made but upon a precedent injury or provocation For there is no question but a just fear of an imminent danger though there be no blow given is a lawful cause of a war For their wives there are cruel examples of them Livia is infamed for the poisoning of her husband Roxalana Solyman s wife was the destruction of that renowned prince Sultan Mustapha and otherwise troubled his house and succession Edward the Second of England his queen had the principal hand in the deposing and murder of her husband This kind of danger is then to be feared chiefly when the wives have plots for the raising of their own children or else that they be advoutresses For their children the tragedies likewise of dangers from them have been many And generally the entering of fathers into suspicion of their children hath been ever unfortunate The destruction of Mustapha that we named before was so fatal to Solyman s line as the succession of the Turks from Solyman until this day is suspected to be untrue and of strange blood for that Selymus the Second was thought to be suppositious The destruction of Crispus a young prince of rare towardness by Constantinus the Great his father was in like manner fatal to his house for both Constantinus and Constance his sons died violent deaths and Constantius his other son did little better who died indeed of sickness but after that Julianus had taken arms against him The destruction of Demetrius son to Philip the Second of Macedon turned upon the father who died of repentance And many like examples there are but few or none where the fathers had good by such distrust except it were where the sons were up in open arms against them as was Selymus the First against Bajazet and the three sons of Henry the Second King of England For their prelates when they are proud and great there is also danger from them as it was in the times of Anselmus and Thomas Becket Archbishops of Canterbury who with their croziers did almost try it with the king s sword and yet they had to deal with stout and haughty kings William Rufus Henry the First and Henry the Second The danger is not from that state but where it hath a dependence of foreign authority or where the churchmen come in and are elected not by the collation of the king or particular patrons but by the people For their nobles to keep them at a distance it is not amiss but to depress them may make a king more absolute but less safe and less able to perform any thing that he desires I have noted it in my History of King Henry the Seventh of England who depressed his nobility whereupon it came to pass that his times were full of difficulties and troubles for the nobility though they continued loyal unto him yet did they not company operate with him in his business So that in effect he was fain to do all things himself For their second nobles there is not much danger from them being a body dispersed They may sometimes discourse high but that doth little hurt besides they are a counterpoise to the higher nobility that they grow not too potent and lastly being the most immediate in authority with the common people they do best temper popular commotions For their merchants they are vena porta and if they flourish not a kingdom may have good limbs but will have empty veins and nourish little Taxes and imposts upon them do seldom good to the king s revenue for that that he wins in the hundred he leeseth in the shire the particular rates being increased but the total bulk of trading rather decreased For their commons there is little danger from them except it be where they have great and potent heads or where you meddle with the point of religion or their customs or means of life For their men of war it is a dangerous state where they live and remain in a body and are used to donatives whereof we see examples in the janizaries and pretorian bands of Rome but trainings of men and arming them in several places and under several commanders and without donatives are things of defence and no danger Princes are like to heavenly bodies which cause good or evil times and which have much veneration but no rest All precepts concerning kings are in effect comprehended in those two remembrances memento quod es homo and memento quod es Deus or vice Dei the one bridleth their power and the other their will Of Counsel THE greatest trust between man and man is the trust of giving counsel For in other confidences men commit the parts of life their lands their goods their children their credit some particular affair but to such as they make their counsellors they commit the whole by how much the more they are obliged to all faith and integrity The wisest princes need not think it any diminution to their greatness or derogation to their sufficiency to rely upon counsel God himself is not without but hath made it one of the great names of his blessed Son The Counsellor Solomon hath pronounced that in counsel is stability Things will have their first or second agitation if they be not tossed upon the arguments of counsel they will be tossed upon the waves of fortune and be full of inconstancy doing and undoing like the reeling of a drunken man Solomon s son found the force of counsel as his father saw the necessity of it For the beloved kingdom of God was first rent and broken by ill counsel upon which counsel there are set for our instruction the two marks whereby bad counsel is for ever best discerned that it was young counsel for the person and violent counsel for the matter The ancient times do set forth in figure both the incorporation and inseparable conjunction of counsel with kings and the wise and politic use of counsel by kings the one in that they say Jupiter did marry Metis which signifieth counsel whereby they intend that Sovereignty is married to Counsel the other in that which followeth which was thus They say after Jupiter was married to Metis she conceived by him and was with child but Jupiter suffered her not to stay till she brought forth but eat her up whereby he became himself with child and was delivered of Pallas armed out of his head Which monstrous fable containeth a secret of empire how kings are to make use of their counsel of state That first they ought to refer matters unto them which is the first begetting or impregnation but when they are elaborate moulded and shaped in the womb of their counsel and grow ripe and ready to be brought forth that then they suffer not their counsel to go through with the resolution and direction as if it depended on them but take the matter back into their own hands and make it appear to the world that the decrees and final directions which because they come forth with prudence and power are resembled to Pallas armed proceeded from themselves and not only from their authority but the more to add reputation to themselves from their head and device Let us now speak of the inconveniences of counsel and of the remedies The inconveniences that have been noted in calling and using counsel are three First the revealing of affairs whereby they become less secret Secondly the weakening of the authority of princes as if they were less of themselves Thirdly the danger of being unfaithfully counselled and more for the good of them that counsel than of him that is counselled For which inconveniences the doctrine of Italy and practice of France in some kings times hath introduced cabinet counsels a remedy worse than the disease As to secrecy princes are not bound to communicate all matters with all counsellors but may extract and select Neither is it necessary that he that consulteth what he should do should declare what he will do But let princes beware that the unsecreting of their affairs comes not from themselves And as for cabinet counsels it may be their motto plenus rimarum sum one futile person that maketh it his glory to tell will do more hurt than many that know it their duty to conceal It is true there be some affairs which require extreme secrecy which will hardly go beyond one or two persons besides the king neither are those counsels unprosperous for besides the secrecy they commonly go on constantly in one spirit of direction without distraction But then it must be a prudent king such as is able to grind with a handmill and those inward counsellors had need also be wise men and especially true and trusty to the king s ends as it was with King Henry the Seventh of England who in his great business imparted himself to none except it were to Morton and Fox For weakening of authority the fable showeth the remedy Nay the majesty of kings is rather exalted than diminished when they are in the chair of counsel neither was there ever prince bereaved of his dependences by his counsel except where there hath been either an over greatness in one counsellor or an over strict combination in divers which are things soon found and holpen For the last inconvenience that men will counsel with an eye to themselves certainly non inveniet fidem super terram is meant of the nature of times and not of all particular persons There be that are in nature faithful and sincere and plain and direct not crafty and involved let princes above all draw to themselves such natures Besides counsellors are not commonly so united but that one counsellor keepeth sentinel over another so that if any do counsel out of faction or private ends it commonly comes to the king s ear But the best remedy is if princes know their counsellors as well as their counsellors know them Principis est virtus maxima nosse suos And on the other side counsellors should not be too speculative into their sovereign s person The true composition of a counsellor is rather to be skilful in their master s business than in his nature for then he is like to advise him and not feed his humor It is of singular use to princes if they take the opinions of their counsel both separately and together For private opinion is more free but opinion before others is more reverent In private men are more bold in their own humors and in consort men are more obnoxious to others humors therefore it is good to take both and of the inferior sort rather in private to preserve freedom of the greater rather in consort to preserve respect It is in vain for princes to take counsel concerning matters if they take no counsel likewise concerning persons for all matters are as dead images and the life of the execution of affairs resteth in the good choice of persons Neither is it enough to consult concerning persons secundum genera as in an idea or mathematical description what the kind and character of the person should be for the greatest errors are committed and the most judgment is shown in the choice of individuals It was truly said optimi consiliarii mortui books will speak plain when counsellors blanch Therefore it is good to be conversant in them specially the books of such as themselves have been actors upon the stage The counsels at this day in most places are but familiar meetings where matters are rather talked on than debated And they run too swift to the order or act of counsel It were better that in causes of weight the matter were propounded one day and not spoken to till the next day in nocte consilium So was it done in the Commission of Union between England and Scotland which was a grave and orderly assembly I commend set days for petitions for both it gives the suitors more certainty for their attendance and it frees the meetings for matters of estate that they may hoc agere In choice of committees for ripening business for the counsel it is better to choose indifferent persons than to make an indifferency by putting in those that are strong on both sides I commend also standing commissions as for trade for treasure for war for suits for some provinces for where there be divers particular counsels and but one counsel of estate as it is in Spain they are in effect no more than standing commissions save that they have greater authority Let such as are to inform counsels out of their particular professions as lawyers seamen mintmen and the like be first heard before committees and then as occasion serves before the counsel And let them not come in multitudes or in a tribunitious manner for that is to clamor counsels not to inform them A long table and a square table or seats about the walls seem things of form but are things of substance for at a long table a few at the upper end in effect sway all the business but in the other form there is more use of the counsellors opinions that sit lower A king when he presides in counsel let him beware how he opens his own inclination too much in that which he propoundeth for else counsellors will but take the wind of him and instead of giving free counsel sing him a song of placebo Of Delays FORTUNE is like the market where many times if you can stay a little the price will fall Again it is sometimes like Sibylla s offer which at first offereth the commodity at full then consumeth part and part and still holdeth up the price For occasion as it is in the common verse turneth a bald noddle after she hath presented her locks in front and no hold taken or at least turneth the handle of the bottle first to be received and after the belly which is hard to clasp There is surely no greater wisdom than well to time the beginnings and onsets of things Dangers are no more light if they once seem light and more dangers have deceived men than forced them Nay it were better to meet some dangers half way though they come nothing near than to keep too long a watch upon their approaches for if a man watch too long it is odds he will fall asleep On the other side to be deceived with too long shadows as some have been when the moon was low and shone on their enemies back and so to shoot off before the time or to teach dangers to come on by over early buckling towards them is another extreme The ripeness or unripeness of the occasion as we said must ever be well weighed and generally it is good to commit the beginnings of all great actions to Argus with his hundred eyes and the ends to Briareus with his hundred hands first to watch and then to speed For the helmet of Pluto which maketh the politic man go invisible is secrecy in the counsel and celerity in the execution For when things are once come to the execution there is no secrecy comparable to celerity like the motion of a bullet in the air which flieth so swift as it outruns the eye Of Cunning WE TAKE cunning for a sinister or crooked wisdom And certainly there is a great difference between a cunning man and a wise man not only in point of honesty but in point of ability There be that can pack the cards and yet cannot play well so there are some that are good in canvasses and factions that are otherwise weak men Again it is one thing to understand persons and another thing to understand matters for many are perfect in men s humors that are not greatly capable of the real part of business which is the constitution of one that hath studied men more than books Such men are fitter for practice than for counsel and they are good but in their own alley turn them to new men and they have lost their aim so as the old rule to know a fool from a wise man Mitte ambos nudos ad ignotos et videbis doth scarce hold for them And because these cunning men are like haberdashers of small wares it is not amiss to set forth their shop It is a point of cunning to wait upon him with whom you speak with your eye as the Jesuits give it in precept for there be many wise men that have secret hearts and transparent countenances Yet this would be done with a demure abasing of your eye sometimes as the Jesuits also do use Another is that when you have anything to obtain of present despatch you entertain and amuse the party with whom you deal with some other discourse that he be not too much awake to make objections I knew a counsellor and secretary that never came to Queen Elizabeth of England with bills to sign but he would always first put her into some discourse of estate that she mought the less mind the bills The like surprise may be made by moving things when the party is in haste and cannot stay to consider advisedly of that is moved If a man would cross a business that he doubts some other would handsomely and effectually move let him pretend to wish it well and move it himself in such sort as may foil it The breaking off in the midst of that one was about to say as if he took himself up breeds a greater appetite in him with whom you confer to know more And because it works better when anything seemeth to be gotten from you by question than if you offer it of yourself you may lay a bait for a question by showing another visage and countenance than you are wont to the end to give occasion for the party to ask what the matter is of the change As Nehemias did And I had not before that time been sad before the king In things that are tender and unpleasing it is good to break the ice by some whose words are of less weight and to reserve the more weighty voice to come in as by chance so that he may be asked the question upon the other s speech as Narcissus did relating to Claudius the marriage of Messalina and Silius In things that a man would not be seen in himself it is a point of cunning to borrow the name of the world as to say The world says or There is a speech abroad I knew one that when he wrote a letter he would put that which was most material in the postscript as if it had been a by matter I knew another that when he came to have speech he would pass over that that he intended most and go forth and come back again and speak of it as of a thing that he had almost forgot Some procure themselves to be surprised at such times as it is like the party that they work upon will suddenly come upon them and to be found with a letter in their hand or doing somewhat which they are not accustomed to the end they may be apposed of those things which of themselves they are desirous to utter It is a point of cunning to let fall those words in a man s own name which he would have another man learn and use and thereupon take advantage I knew two that were competitors for the secretary s place in Queen Elizabeth s time and yet kept good quarter between themselves and would confer one with another upon the business and the one of them said That to be a secretary in the declination of a monarchy was a ticklish thing and that he did not affect it the other straight caught up those words and discoursed with divers of his friends that he had no reason to desire to be secretary in the declination of a monarchy The first man took hold of it and found means it was told the Queen who hearing of a declination of a monarchy took it so ill as she would never after hear of the other s suit There is a cunning which we in England call the turning of the cat in the pan which is when that which a man says to another he lays it as if another had said it to him And to say truth it is not easy when such a matter passed between two to make it appear from which of them it first moved and began It is a way that some men have to glance and dart at others by justifying themselves by negatives as to say This I do not as Tigellinus did towards Burrhus Se non diversas spes sed incolumitatem imperatoris simpliciter spectare Some have in readiness so many tales and stories as there is nothing they would insinuate but they can wrap it into a tale which serveth both to keep themselves more in guard and to make others carry it with more pleasure It is a good point of cunning for a man to shape the answer he would have in his own words and propositions for it makes the other party stick the less It is strange how long some men will lie in wait to speak somewhat they desire to say and how far about they will fetch and how many other matters they will beat over to come near it It is a thing of great patience but yet of much use A sudden bold and unexpected question doth many times surprise a man and lay him open Like to him that having changed his name and walking in Paul s another suddenly came behind him and called him by his true name whereat straightways he looked back But these small wares and petty points of cunning are infinite and it were a good deed to make a list of them for that nothing doth more hurt in a state than that cunning men pass for wise But certainly some there are that know the resorts and falls of business that cannot sink into the main of it like a house that hath convenient stairs and entries but never a fair room Therefore you shall see them find out pretty looses in the conclusion but are no ways able to examine or debate matters And yet commonly they take advantage of their inability and would be thought wits of direction Some build rather upon the abusing of others and as we now say putting tricks upon them than upon soundness of their own proceedings But Solomon saith Prudens advertit ad gressus suos stultus divertit ad dolos Of Wisdom For A Man s Self AN ANT is a wise creature for itself but it is a shrewd thing in an orchard or garden And certainly men that are great lovers of themselves waste the public Divide with reason between self love and society and be so true to thyself as thou be not false to others specially to thy king and country It is a poor centre of a man s actions himself It is right earth For that only stands fast upon his own centre whereas all things that have affinity with the heavens move upon the centre of another which they benefit The referring of all to a man s self is more tolerable in a sovereign prince because themselves are not only themselves but their good and evil is at the peril of the public fortune But it is a desperate evil in a servant to a prince or a citizen in a republic For whatsoever affairs pass such a man s hands he crooketh them to his own ends which must needs be often eccentric to the ends of his master or state Therefore let princes or states choose such servants as have not this mark except they mean their service should be made but the accessory That which maketh the effect more pernicious is that all proportion is lost It were disproportion enough for the servant s good to be preferred before the master s but yet it is a greater extreme when a little good of the servant shall carry things against a great good of the master s And yet that is the case of bad officers treasurers ambassadors generals and other false and corrupt servants which set a bias upon their bowl of their own petty ends and envies to the overthrow of their master s great and important affairs And for the most part the good such servants receive is after the model of their own fortune but the hurt they sell for that good is after the model of their master s fortune And certainly it is the nature of extreme self lovers as they will set an house on fire and it were but to roast their eggs and yet these men many times hold credit with their masters because their study is but to please them and profit themselves and for either respect they will abandon the good of their affairs Wisdom for a man s self is in many branches thereof a depraved thing It is the wisdom of rats that will be sure to leave a house somewhat before it fall It is the wisdom of the fox that thrusts out the badger who digged and made room for him It is the wisdom of crocodiles that shed tears when they would devour But that which is specially to be noted is that those which as Cicero says of Pompey are sui amantes sine rivali are many times unfortunate And whereas they have all their times sacrificed to themselves they become in the end themselves sacrifices to the inconstancy of fortune whose wings they thought by their self wisdom to have pinioned Of Innovations AS THE births of living creatures at first are ill shapen so are all innovations which are the births of time Yet notwithstanding as those that first bring honor into their family are commonly more worthy than most that succeed so the first precedent if it be good is seldom attained by imitation For ill to man s nature as it stands perverted hath a natural motion strongest in continuance but good as a forced motion strongest at first Surely every medicine is an innovation and he that will not apply new remedies must expect new evils for time is the greatest innovator and if time of course alter things to the worse and wisdom and counsel shall not alter them to the better what shall be the end It is true that what is settled by custom though it be not good yet at least it is fit and those things which have long gone together are as it were confederate within themselves whereas new things piece not so well but though they help by their utility yet they trouble by their inconformity Besides they are like strangers more admired and less favored All this is true if time stood still which contrariwise moveth so round that a froward retention of custom is as turbulent a thing as an innovation and they that reverence too much old times are but a scorn to the new It were good therefore that men in their innovations would follow the example of time itself which indeed innovateth greatly but quietly by degrees scarce to be perceived For otherwise whatsoever is new is unlooked for and ever it mends some and pairs others and he that is holpen takes it for a fortune and thanks the time and he that is hurt for a wrong and imputeth it to the author It is good also not to try experiments in states except the necessity be urgent or the utility evident and well to beware that it be the reformation that draweth on the change and not the desire of change that pretendeth the reformation And lastly that the novelty though it be not rejected yet be held for a suspect and as the Scripture saith that we make a stand upon the ancient way and then look about us and discover what is the straight and right way and so to walk in it Of Dispatch AFFECTED dispatch is one of the most dangerous things to business that can be It is like that which the physicians call predigestion or hasty digestion which is sure to fill the body full of crudities and secret seeds of diseases Therefore measure not dispatch by the times of sitting but by the advancement of the business And as in races it is not the large stride or high lift that makes the speed so in business the keeping close to the matter and not taking of it too much at once procureth dispatch It is the care of some only to come off speedily for the time or to contrive some false periods of business because they may seem men of dispatch But it is one thing to abbreviate by contracting another by cutting off And business so handled at several sittings or meetings goeth commonly backward and forward in an unsteady manner I knew a wise man that had it for a byword when he saw men hasten to a conclusion Stay a little that we may make an end the sooner On the other side true dispatch is a rich thing For time is the measure of business as money is of wares and business is bought at a dear hand where there is small dispatch The Spartans and Spaniards have been noted to be of small dispatch Mi venga la muerte de Spagna Let my death come from Spain for then it will be sure to be long in coming Give good hearing to those that give the first information in business and rather direct them in the beginning than interrupt them in the continuance of their speeches for he that is put out of his own order will go forward and backward and be more tedious while he waits upon his memory than he could have been if he had gone on in his own course But sometimes it is seen that the moderator is more troublesome than the actor Iterations are commonly loss of time But there is no such gain of time as to iterate often the state of the question for it chaseth away many a frivolous speech as it is coming forth Long and curious speeches are as fit for dispatch as a robe or mantle with a long train is for race Prefaces and passages and excusations and other speeches of reference to the person are great wastes of time and though they seem to proceed of modesty they are bravery Yet beware of being too material when there is any impediment or obstruction in men s wills for pre occupation of mind ever requireth preface of speech like a fomentation to make the unguent enter Above all things order and distribution and singling out of parts is the life of dispatch so as the distribution be not too subtle for he that doth not divide will never enter well into business and he that divideth too much will never come out of it clearly To choose time is to save time and an unseasonable motion is but beating the air There be three parts of business the preparation the debate or examination and the perfection Whereof if you look for dispatch let the middle only be the work of many and the first and last the work of few The proceeding upon somewhat conceived in writing doth for the most part facilitate dispatch for though it should be wholly rejected yet that negative is more pregnant of direction than an indefinite as ashes are more generative than dust Of Seeming Wise IT HATH been an opinion that the French are wiser than they seem and the Spaniards seem wiser than they are But howsoever it be between nations certainly it is so between man and man For as the Apostle saith of godliness Having a show of godliness but denying the power thereof so certainly there are in point of wisdom and sufficiency that do nothing or little very solemnly magno conatu nugas It is a ridiculous thing and fit for a satire to persons of judgment to see what shifts these formalists have and what prospectives to make superficies to seem body that hath depth and bulk Some are so close and reserved as they will not show their wares but by a dark light and seem always to keep back somewhat and when they know within themselves they speak of that they do not well know would nevertheless seem to others to know of that which they may not well speak Some help themselves with countenance and gesture and are wise by signs as Cicero saith of Piso that when he answered him he fetched one of his brows up to his forehead and bent the other down to his chin Respondes altero ad frontem sublato altero ad mentum depresso supercilio crudelitatem tibi non placere Some think to bear it by speaking a great word and being peremptory and go on and take by admittance that which they cannot make good Some whatsoever is beyond their reach will seem to despise or make light of it as impertinent or curious and so would have their ignorance seem judgment Some are never without a difference and commonly by amusing men with a subtilty blanch the matter of whom A Gellius saith Hominem delirum qui verborum minutiis rerum frangit pondera Of which kind also Plato in his Protagoras bringeth in Prodicus in scorn and maketh him make a speech that consisteth of distinction from the beginning to the end Generally such men in all deliberations find ease to be of the negative side and affect a credit to object and foretell difficulties for when propositions are denied there is an end of them but if they be allowed it requireth a new work which false point of wisdom is the bane of business To conclude there is no decaying merchant or inward beggar hath so many tricks to uphold the credit of their wealth as these empty persons have to maintain the credit of their sufficiency Seeming wise men may make shift to get opinion but let no man choose them for employment for certainly you were better take for business a man somewhat absurd than over formal Of Friendship IT HAD been hard for him that spake it to have put more truth and untruth together in few words than in that speech Whatsoever is delighted in solitude is either a wild beast or a god For it is most true that a natural and secret hatred and aversation towards society in any man hath somewhat of the savage beast but it is most untrue that it should have any character at all of the divine nature except it proceed not out of a pleasure in solitude but out of a love and desire to sequester a man s self for a higher conversation such as is found to have been falsely and feignedly in some of the heathen as Epimenides the Candian Numa the Roman Empedocles the Sicilian and Apollonius of Tyana and truly and really in divers of the ancient hermits and holy fathers of the church But little do men perceive what solitude is and how far it extendeth For a crowd is not company and faces are but a gallery of pictures and talk but a tinkling cymbal where there is no love The Latin adage meeteth with it a little Magna civitas magna solitudo because in a great town friends are scattered so that there is not that fellowship for the most part which is in less neighborhoods But we may go further and affirm most truly that it is a mere and miserable solitude to want true friends without which the world is but a wilderness and even in this sense also of solitude whosoever in the frame of his nature and affections is unfit for friendship he taketh it of the beast and not from humanity A principal fruit of friendship is the ease and discharge of the fulness and swellings of the heart which passions of all kinds do cause and induce We know diseases of stoppings and suffocations are the most dangerous in the body and it is not much otherwise in the mind you may take sarza to open the liver steel to open the spleen flowers of sulphur for the lungs castoreum for the brain but no receipt openeth the heart but a true friend to whom you may impart griefs joys fears hopes suspicions counsels and whatsoever lieth upon the heart to oppress it in a kind of civil shrift or confession It is a strange thing to observe how high a rate great kings and monarchs do set upon this fruit of friendship whereof we speak so great as they purchase it many times at the hazard of their own safety and greatness For princes in regard of the distance of their fortune from that of their subjects and servants cannot gather this fruit except to make themselves capable thereof they raise some persons to be as it were companions and almost equals to themselves which many times sorteth to inconvenience The modern languages give unto such persons the name of favorites or privadoes as if it were matter of grace or conversation But the Roman name attaineth the true use and cause thereof naming them participes curarum for it is that which tieth the knot And we see plainly that this hath been done not by weak and passionate princes only but by the wisest and most politic that ever reigned who have oftentimes joined to themselves some of their servants whom both themselves have called friends and allowed other likewise to call them in the same manner using the word which is received between private men L Sylla when he commanded Rome raised Pompey after surnamed the Great to that height that Pompey vaunted himself for Sylla s overmatch For when he had carried the consulship for a friend of his against the pursuit of Sylla and that Sylla did a little resent thereat and began to speak great Pompey turned upon him again and in effect bade him be quiet for that more men adored the sun rising than the sun setting With Julius Caesar Decimus Brutus had obtained that interest as he set him down in his testament for heir in remainder after his nephew And this was the man that had power with him to draw him forth to his death For when Caesar would have discharged the senate in regard of some ill presages and specially a dream of Calpurnia this man lifted him gently by the arm out of his chair telling him he hoped he would not dismiss the senate till his wife had dreamt a better dream And it seemeth his favor was so great as Antonius in a letter which is recited verbatim in one of Cicero s Philippics calleth him venefica witch as if he had enchanted Caesar Augustus raised Agrippa though of mean birth to that height as when he consulted with Maecenas about the marriage of his daughter Julia Maecenas took the liberty to tell him that he must either marry his daughter to Agrippa or take away his life there was no third way he had made him so great With Tiberius Caesar Sejanus had ascended to that height as they two were termed and reckoned as a pair of friends Tiberius in a letter to him saith Haec pro amicitia nostra non occultavi and the whole senate dedicated an altar to Friendship as to a goddess in respect of the great dearness of friendship between them two The like or more was between Septimius Severus and Plautianus For he forced his eldest son to marry the daughter of Plautianus and would often maintain Plautianus in doing affronts to his son and did write also in a letter to the senate by these words I love the man so well as I wish he may over live me Now if these princes had been as a Trajan or a Marcus Aurelius a man might have thought that this had proceeded of an abundant goodness of nature but being men so wise of such strength and severity of mind and so extreme lovers of themselves as all these were it proveth most plainly that they found their own felicity though as great as ever happened to mortal men but as an half piece except they mought have a friend to make it entire and yet which is more they were princes that had wives sons nephews and yet all these could not supply the comfort of friendship It is not to be forgotten what Comineus observeth of his first master Duke Charles the Hardy namely that he would communicate his secrets with none and least of all those secrets which troubled him most Whereupon he goeth on and saith that towards his latter time that closeness did impair and a little perish his understanding Surely Comineus mought have made the same judgment also if it had pleased him of his second master Lewis the Eleventh whose closeness was indeed his tormentor The parable of Pythagoras is dark but true Cor ne edito Eat not the heart Certainly if a man would give it a hard phrase those that want friends to open themselves unto are cannibals of their own hearts But one thing is most admirable wherewith I will conclude this first fruit of friendship which is that this communicating of a man s self to his friend works two contrary effects for it redoubleth joys and cutteth griefs in halves For there is no man that imparteth his joys to his friend but he joyeth the more and no man that imparteth his griefs to his friend but he grieveth the less So that it is in truth of operation upon a man s mind of like virtue as the alchemists use to attribute to their stone for man s body that it worketh all contrary effects but still to the good and benefit of nature But yet without praying in aid of alchemists there is a manifest image of this in the ordinary course of nature For in bodies union strengtheneth and cherisheth any natural action and on the other side weakeneth and dulleth any violent impression and even so it is of minds The second fruit of friendship is healthful and sovereign for the understanding as the first is for the affections For friendship maketh indeed a fair day in the affections from storm and tempests but it maketh daylight in the understanding out of darkness and confusion of thoughts Neither is this to be understood only of faithful counsel which a man receiveth from his friend but before you come to that certain it is that whosoever hath his mind fraught with many thoughts his wits and understanding do clarify and break up in the communicating and discoursing with another he tosseth his thoughts more easily he marshalleth them more orderly he seeth how they look when they are turned into words finally he waxeth wiser than himself and that more by an hour s discourse than by a day s meditation It was well said by Themistocles to the king of Persia That speech was like cloth of Arras opened and put abroad whereby the imagery doth appear in figure whereas in thoughts they lie but as in packs Neither is this second fruit of friendship in opening the understanding restrained only to such friends as are able to give a man counsel they indeed are best but even without that a man learneth of himself and bringeth his own thoughts to light and whetteth his wits as against a stone which itself cuts not In a word a man were better relate himself to a statua or picture than to suffer his thoughts to pass in smother Add now to make this second fruit of friendship complete that other point which lieth more open and falleth within vulgar observation which is faithful counsel from a friend Heraclitus saith well in one of his enigmas Dry light is ever the best And certain it is that the light that a man receiveth by counsel from another is drier and purer than that which cometh from his own understanding and judgment which is ever infused and drenched in his affections and customs So as there is as much difference between the counsel that a friend giveth and that a man giveth himself as there is between the counsel of a friend and of a flatterer For there is no such flatterer as is a man s self and there is no such remedy against flattery of a man s self as the liberty of a friend Counsel is of two sorts the one concerning manners the other concerning business For the first the best preservative to keep the mind in health is the faithful admonition of a friend The calling of a man s self to a strict account is a medicine sometime too piercing and corrosive Reading good books of morality is a little flat and dead Observing our faults in others is sometimes improper for our case But the best receipt best I say to work and best to take is the admonition of a friend It is a strange thing to behold what gross errors and extreme absurdities many especially of the greater sort do commit for want of a friend to tell them of them to the great damage both of their fame and fortune for as saint James saith they are as men that look sometimes into a glass and presently forget their own shape and favor As for business a man may think if he win that two eyes see no more than one or that a gamester seeth always more than a looker on or that a man in anger is as wise as he that hath said over the four and twenty letters or that a musket may be shot off as well upon the arm as upon a rest and such other fond and high imaginations to think himself all in all But when all is done the help of good counsel is that which setteth business straight And if any man think that he will take counsel but it shall be by pieces asking counsel in one business of one man and in another business of another man it is well that is to say better perhaps than if he asked none at all but he runneth two dangers one that he shall not be faithfully counselled for it is a rare thing except it be from a perfect and entire friend to have counsel given but such as shall be bowed and crooked to some ends which he hath that giveth it The other that he shall have counsel given hurtful and unsafe though with good meaning and mixed partly of mischief and partly of remedy even as if you would call a physician that is thought good for the cure of the disease you complain of but is unacquainted with your body and therefore may put you in way for a present cure but overthroweth your health in some other kind and so cure the disease and kill the patient But a friend that is wholly acquainted with a man s estate will beware by furthering any present business how he dasheth upon other inconvenience And therefore rest not upon scattered counsels they will rather distract and mislead than settle and direct After these two noble fruits of friendship peace in the affections and support of the judgment followeth the last fruit which is like the pomegranate full of many kernels I mean aid and bearing a part in all actions and occasions Here the best way to represent to life the manifold use of friendship is to cast and see how many things there are which a man cannot do himself and then it will appear that it was a sparing speech of the ancients to say that a friend is another himself for that a friend is far more than himself Men have their time and die many times in desire of some things which they principally take to heart the bestowing of a child the finishing of a work or the like If a man have a true friend he may rest almost secure that the care of those things will continue after him So that a man hath as it were two lives in his desires A man hath a body and that body is confined to a place but where friendship is all offices of life are as it were granted to him and his deputy For he may exercise them by his friend How many things are there which a man cannot with any face or comeliness say or do himself A man can scarce allege his own merits with modesty much less extol them a man cannot sometimes brook to supplicate or beg and a number of the like But all these things are graceful in a friend s mouth which are blushing in a man s own So again a man s person hath many proper relations which he cannot put off A man cannot speak to his son but as a father to his wife but as a husband to his enemy but upon terms whereas a friend may speak as the case requires and not as it sorteth with the person But to enumerate these things were endless I have given the rule where a man cannot fitly play his own part if he have not a friend he may quit the stage Of Expense RICHES are for spending and spending for honor and good actions Therefore extraordinary expense must be limited by the worth of the occasion for voluntary undoing may be as well for a man s country as for the kingdom of heaven But ordinary expense ought to be limited by a man s estate and governed with such regard as it be within his compass and not subject to deceit and abuse of servants and ordered to the best show that the bills may be less than the estimation abroad Certainly if a man will keep but of even hand his ordinary expenses ought to be but to the half of his receipts and if he think to wax rich but to the third part It is no baseness for the greatest to descend and look into their own estate Some forbear it not upon negligence alone but doubting to bring themselves into melancholy in respect they shall find it broken But wounds cannot be cured without searching He that cannot look into his own estate at all had need both choose well those whom he employeth and change them often for new are more timorous and less subtle He that can look into his estate but seldom it behooveth him to turn all to certainties A man had need if he be plentiful in some kind of expense to be as saving again in some other As if he be plentiful in diet to be saving in apparel if he be plentiful in the hall to be saving in the stable and the like For he that is plentiful in expenses of all kinds will hardly be preserved from decay In clearing of a man s estate he may as well hurt himself in being too sudden as in letting it run on too long For hasty selling is commonly as disadvantageable as interest Besides he that clears at once will relapse for finding himself out of straits he will revert to his custom but he that cleareth by degrees induceth a habit of frugality and gaineth as well upon his mind as upon his estate Certainly who hath a state to repair may not despise small things and commonly it is less dishonorable to abridge petty charges than to stoop to petty gettings A man ought warily to begin charges which once begun will continue but in matters that return not he may be more magnificent Of the True Greatness Of Kingdoms And Estates THE speech of Themistocles the Athenian which was haughty and arrogant in taking so much to himself had been a grave and wise observation and censure applied at large to others Desired at a feast to touch a lute he said He could not fiddle but yet he could make a small town a great city These words holpen a little with a metaphor may express two differing abilities in those that deal in business of estate For if a true survey be taken of counsellors and statesmen there may be found though rarely those which can make a small state great and yet cannot fiddle as on the other side there will be found a great many that can fiddle very cunningly but yet are so far from being able to make a small state great as their gift lieth the other way to bring a great and flourishing estate to ruin and decay And certainly whose degenerate arts and shifts whereby many counsellors and governors gain both favor with their masters and estimation with the vulgar deserve no better name than fiddling being things rather pleasing for the time and graceful to themselves only than tending to the weal and advancement of the state which they serve There are also no doubt counsellors and governors which may be held sufficient negotiis pares able to manage affairs and to keep them from precipices and manifest inconveniences which nevertheless are far from the ability to raise and amplify an estate in power means and fortune But be the workmen what they may be let us speak of the work that is the true greatness of kingdoms and estates and the means thereof An argument fit for great and mighty princes to have in their hand to the end that neither by over measuring their forces they leese themselves in vain enterprises nor on the other side by undervaluing them they descend to fearful and pusillanimous counsels The greatness of an estate in bulk and territory doth fall under measure and the greatness of finances and revenue doth fall under computation The population may appear by musters and the number and greatness of cities and towns by cards and maps But yet there is not any thing amongst civil affairs more subject to error than the right valuation and true judgment concerning the power and forces of an estate The kingdom of heaven is compared not to any great kernel or nut but to a grain of mustard seed which is one of the least grains but hath in it a property and spirit hastily to get up and spread So are there states great in territory and yet not apt to enlarge or command and some that have but a small dimension of stem and yet apt to be the foundations of great monarchies Walled towns stored arsenals and armories goodly races of horse chariots of war elephants ordnance artillery and the like all this is but a sheep in a lion s skin except the breed and disposition of the people be stout and warlike Nay number itself in armies importeth not much where the people is of weak courage for as Virgil saith It never troubles a wolf how many the sheep be The army of the Persians in the plains of Arbela was such a vast sea of people as it did somewhat astonish the commanders in Alexander s army who came to him therefore and wished him to set upon them by night and he answered He would not pilfer the victory And the defeat was easy When Tigranes the Armenian being encamped upon a hill with four hundred thousand men discovered the army of the Romans being not above fourteen thousand marching towards him he made himself merry with it and said Yonder men are too many for an embassage and too few for a fight But before the sun set he found them enow to give him the chase with infinite slaughter Many are the examples of the great odds between number and courage so that a man may truly make a judgment that the principal point of greatness in any state is to have a race of military men Neither is money the sinews of war as it is trivially said where the sinews of men s arms in base and effeminate people are failing For Solon said well to Croesus when in ostentation he showed him his gold Sir if any other come that hath better iron than you he will be master of all this gold Therefore let any prince or state think solely of his forces except his militia of natives be of good and valiant soldiers And let princes on the other side that have subjects of martial disposition know their own strength unless they be otherwise wanting unto themselves As for mercenary forces which is the help in this case all examples show that whatsoever estate or prince doth rest upon them he may spread his feathers for a time but he will mew them soon after The blessing of Judah and Issachar will never meet that the same people or nation should be both the lion s whelp and the ass between burthens neither will it be that a people overlaid with taxes should ever become valiant and martial It is true that taxes levied by consent of the estate do abate men s courage less as it hath been seen notably in the excises of the Low Countries and in some degree in the subsidies of England For you must note that we speak now of the heart and not of the purse So that although the same tribute and tax laid by consent or by imposing be all one to the purse yet it works diversely upon the courage So that you may conclude that no people overcharged with tribute is fit for empire Let states that aim at greatness take heed how their nobility and gentlemen do multiply too fast For that maketh the common subject grow to be a peasant and base swain driven out of heart and in effect but the gentleman s laborer Even as you may see in coppice woods if you leave your staddles too thick you shall never have clean underwood but shrubs and bushes So in countries if the gentlemen be too many the commons will be base and you will bring it to that that not the hundred poll will be fit for an helmet especially as to the infantry which is the nerve of an army and so there will be great population and little strength This which I speak of hath been nowhere better seen than by comparing of England and France whereof England though far less in territory and population hath been nevertheless an overmatch in regard the middle people of England make good soldiers which the peasants of France do not And herein the device of king Henry the Seventh whereof I have spoken largely in the History of his Life was profound and admirable in making farms and houses of husbandry of a standard that is maintained with such a proportion of land unto them as may breed a subject to live in convenient plenty and no servile condition and to keep the plough in the hands of the owners and not mere hirelings And thus indeed you shall attain to Virgil s character which he gives to ancient Italy Terra potens armis atque ubere glebae Neither is that state which for any thing I know is almost peculiar to England and hardly to be found anywhere else except it be perhaps in Poland to be passed over I mean the state of free servants and attendants upon noblemen and gentlemen which are no ways inferior unto the yeomanry for arms And therefore out of all questions the splendor and magnificence and great retinues and hospitality of noblemen and gentlemen received into custom doth much conduce unto martial greatness Whereas contrariwise the close and reserved living of noblemen and gentlemen causeth a penury of military forces By all means it is to be procured that the trunk of Nebuchadnezzar s tree of monarchy be great enough to bear the branches and the boughs that is that the natural subjects of the crown or state bear a sufficient proportion to the stranger subjects that they govern Therefore all states that are liberal of naturalization towards strangers are fit for empire For to think that an handful of people can with the greatest courage and policy in the world embrace too large extent of dominion it may hold for a time but it will fail suddenly The Spartans were a nice people in point of naturalization whereby while they kept their compass they stood firm but when they did spread and their boughs were becomen too great for their stem they became a windfall upon the sudden Never any state was in this point so open to receive strangers into their body as were the Romans Therefore it sorted with them accordingly for they grew to the greatest monarchy Their manner was to grant naturalization which they called jus civitatis and to grant it in the highest degree that is not only jus commercii jus connubii jus haereditatis but also jus suffragii and jus honorum And this not to singular persons alone but likewise to whole families yea to cities and sometimes to nations Add to this their custom of plantation of colonies whereby the Roman plant was removed into the soil of other nations And putting both constitutions together you will say that it was not the Romans that spread upon the world but it was the world that spread upon the Romans and that was the sure way of greatness I have marvelled sometimes at Spain how they clasp and contain so large dominions with so few natural Spaniards but sure the whole compass of Spain is a very great body of a tree far above Rome and Sparta at the first And besides though they have not had that usage to naturalize liberally yet they have that which is next to it that is to employ almost indifferently all nations in their militia of ordinary soldiers yea and sometimes in their highest commands Nay it seemeth at this instant they are sensible of this want of natives as by the Pragmatical Sanction now published appeareth It is certain that sedentary and within door arts and delicate manufactures that require rather the finger than the arm have in their nature a contrariety to a military disposition And generally all warlike people are a little idle and love danger better than travail Neither must they be too much broken of it if they shall be preserved in vigor Therefore it was great advantage in the ancient states of Sparta Athens Rome and others that they had the use of slaves which commonly did rid those manufactures But that is abolished in greatest part by the Christian law That which cometh nearest to it is to leave those arts chiefly to strangers which for that purpose are the more easily to be received and to contain the principal bulk of the vulgar natives within those three kinds tillers of the ground free servants and handicraftsmen of strong and manly arts as smiths masons carpenters et cetera not reckoning professed soldiers But above all for empire and greatness it importeth most that a nation do profess arms as their principal honor study and occupation For the things which we formerly have spoken of are but habilitations towards arms and what is habilitation without intention and act Romulus after his death as they report or feign sent a present to the Romans that above all they should intend arms and then they should prove the greatest empire of the world The fabric of the state of Sparta was wholly though not wisely framed and composed to that scope and end The Persians and Macedonians had it for a flash The Gauls Germans Goths Saxons Normans and others had it for a time The Turks have it at this day though in great declination Of Christian Europe they that have it are in effect only the Spaniards But it is so plain that every man profiteth in that he most intendeth that it needeth not to be stood upon It is enough to point at it that no nation which doth not directly profess arms may look to have greatness fall into their mouths And on the other side it is a most certain oracle of time that those states that continue long in that profession as the Romans and Turks principally have done do wonders And those that have professed arms but for an age have notwithstanding commonly attained that greatness in that age which maintained them long after when their profession and exercise of arms hath grown to decay Incident to this point is for a state to have those laws or customs which may reach forth unto them just occasions as may be pretended of war For there is that justice imprinted in the nature of men that they enter not upon wars whereof so many calamities do ensue but upon some at the least specious grounds and quarrels The Turk hath at hand for cause of war the propagation of his law or sect a quarrel that he may always command The Romans though they esteemed the extending the limits of their empire to be great honor to their generals when it was done yet they never rested upon that alone to begin a war First therefore let nations that pretend to greatness have this that they be sensible of wrongs either upon borderers merchants or politic ministers and that they sit not too long upon a provocation Secondly let them be prest and ready to give aids and succors to their confederates as it ever was with the Romans insomuch as if the confederate had leagues defensive with divers other states and upon invasion offered did implore their aids severally yet the Romans would ever be the foremost and leave it to none other to have the honor As for the wars which were anciently made on the behalf of a kind of party or tacit conformity of estate I do not see how they may be well justified as when the Romans made a war for the liberty of Grecia or when the Lacedaemonians and Athenians made wars to set up or pull down democracies and oligarchies or when wars were made by foreigners under the pretence of justice or protection to deliver the subjects of others from tyranny and oppression and the like Let it suffice that no estate expect to be great that is not awake upon any just occasion of arming No body can be healthful without exercise neither natural body nor politic and certainly to a kingdom or estate a just and honorable war is the true exercise A civil war indeed is like the heat of a fever but a foreign war is like the heat of exercise and serveth to keep the body in health for in a slothful peace both courages will effeminate and manners corrupt But howsoever it be for happiness without all question for greatness it maketh to be still for the most part in arms and the strength of a veteran army though it be a chargeable business always on foot is that which commonly giveth the law or at least the reputation amongst all neighbor states as may well be seen in Spain which hath had in one part or other a veteran army almost continually now by the space of six score years To be master of the sea is an abridgment of a monarchy Cicero writing to Atticus of Pompey his preparation against Caesar saith Consilium Pompeii plane Themistocleum est putat enim qui mari potitur eum rerum potiri And without doubt Pompey had tired out Caesar if upon vain confidence he had not left that way We see the great effects of battles by sea The battle of Actium decided the empire of the world The battle of Lepanto arrested the greatness of the Turk There be many examples where sea fights have been final to the war but this is when princes or states have set up their rest upon the battles But thus much is certain that he that commands the sea is at great liberty and may take as much and as little of the war as he will Whereas those that be strongest by land are many times nevertheless in great straits Surely at this day with us of Europe the vantage of strength at sea which is one of the principal dowries of this kingdom of Great Britain is great both because most of the kingdoms of Europe are not merely inland but girt with the sea most part of their compass and because the wealth of both Indies seems in great part but an accessory to the command of the seas The wars of latter ages seem to be made in the dark in respect of the glory and honor which reflected upon men from the wars in ancient time There be now for martial encouragement some degrees and orders of chivalry which nevertheless are conferred promiscuously upon soldiers and no soldiers and some remembrance perhaps upon the scutcheon and some hospitals for maimed soldiers and such like things But in ancient times the trophies erected upon the place of the victory the funeral laudatives and monuments for those that died in the wars the crowns and garlands personal the style of emperor which the great kings of the world after borrowed the triumphs of the generals upon their return the great donatives and largesses upon the disbanding of the armies were things able to inflame all men s courages But above all that of the triumph amongst the Romans was not pageants or gaudery but one of the wisest and noblest institutions that ever was For it contained three things honor to the general riches to the treasury out of the spoils and donatives to the army But that honor perhaps were not fit for monarchies except it be in the person of the monarch himself or his sons as it came to pass in the times of the Roman emperors who did impropriate the actual triumphs to themselves and their sons for such wars as they did achieve in person and left only for wars achieved by subjects some triumphal garments and ensigns to the general To conclude no man can by care taking as the Scripture saith add a cubit to his stature in this little model of a man s body but in the great frame of kingdoms and commonwealths it is in the power of princes or estates to add amplitude and greatness to their kingdoms for by introducing such ordinances constitutions and customs as we have now touched they may sow greatness to their posterity and succession But these things are commonly not observed but left to take their chance Of Regiment Of Health THERE is a wisdom in this beyond the rules of physic a man s own observation what he finds good of and what he finds hurt of is the best physic to preserve health But it is a safer conclusion to say This agreeth not well with me therefore I will not continue it than this I find no offence of this therefore I may use it For strength of nature in youth passeth over many excesses which are owing a man till his age Discern of the coming on of years and think not to do the same things still for age will not be defied Beware of sudden change in any great point of diet and if necessity enforce it fit the rest to it For it is a secret both in nature and state that it is safer to change many things than one Examine thy customs of diet sleep exercise apparel and the like and try in any thing thou shalt judge hurtful to discontinue it by little and little but so as if thou dost find any inconvenience by the change thou come back to it again for it is hard to distinguish that which is generally held good and wholesome from that which is good particularly and fit for thine own body To be free minded and cheerfully disposed at hours of meat and of sleep and of exercise is one of the best precepts of long lasting As for the passions and studies of the mind avoid envy anxious fears anger fretting inwards subtle and knotty inquisitions joys and exhilarations in excess sadness not communicated Entertain hopes mirth rather than joy variety of delights rather than surfeit of them wonder and admiration and therefore novelties studies that fill the mind with splendid and illustrious objects as histories fables and contemplations of nature If you fly physic in health altogether it will be too strange for your body when you shall need it If you make it too familiar it will work no extraordinary effect when sickness cometh I commend rather some diet for certain seasons than frequent use of physic except it be grown into a custom For those diets alter the body more and trouble it less Despise no new accident in your body but ask opinion of it In sickness respect health principally and in health action For those that put their bodies to endure in health may in most sicknesses which are not very sharp be cured only with diet and tendering Celsus could never have spoken it as a physician had he not been a wise man withal when he giveth it for one of the great precepts of health and lasting that a man do vary and interchange contraries but with an inclination to the more benign extreme use fasting and full eating but rather full eating watching and sleep but rather sleep sitting and exercise but rather exercise and the like So shall nature be cherished and yet taught masteries Physicians are some of them so pleasing and conformable to the humor of the patient as they press not the true cure of the disease and some other are so regular in proceeding according to art for the disease as they respect not sufficiently the condition of the patient Take one of a middle temper or if it may not be found in one man combine two of either sort and forget not to call as well the best acquainted with your body as the best reputed of for his faculty Of Suspicion SUSPICIONS amongst thoughts are like bats amongst birds they ever fly by twilight Certainly they are to be repressed or at least well guarded for they cloud the mind they leese friends and they check with business whereby business cannot go on currently and constantly They dispose kings to tyranny husbands to jealousy wise men to irresolution and melancholy They are defects not in the heart but in the brain for they take place in the stoutest natures as in the example of Henry the Seventh of England There was not a more suspicious man nor a more stout And in such a composition they do small hurt For commonly they are not admitted but with examination whether they be likely or no But in fearful natures they gain ground too fast There is nothing makes a man suspect much more than to know little and therefore men should remedy suspicion by procuring to know more and not to keep their suspicions in smother What would men have Do they think those they employ and deal with are saints Do they not think they will have their own ends and be truer to themselves than to them Therefore there is no better way to moderate suspicions than to account upon such suspicions as true and yet to bridle them as false For so far a man ought to make use of suspicions as to provide as if that should be true that he suspects yet it may do him no hurt Suspicions that the mind of itself gathers are but buzzes but suspicions that are artificially nourished and put into men s heads by the tales and whisperings of others have stings Certainly the best mean to clear the way in this same wood of suspicions is frankly to communicate them with the party that he suspects for thereby he shall be sure to know more of the truth of them than he did before and withal shall make that party more circumspect not to give further cause of suspicion But this would not be done to men of base natures for they if they find themselves once suspected will never be true The Italian says Sospetto licentia fede as if suspicion did give a passport to faith but it ought rather to kindle it to discharge itself Of Discourse SOME in their discourse desire rather commendation of wit in being able to hold all arguments than of judgment in discerning what is true as if it were a praise to know what might be said and not what should be thought Some have certain common places and themes wherein they are good and want variety which kind of poverty is for the most part tedious and when it is once perceived ridiculous The honorablest part of talk is to give the occasion and again to moderate and pass to somewhat else for then a man leads the dance It is good in discourse and speech of conversation to vary and intermingle speech of the present occasion with arguments tales with reasons asking of questions with telling of opinions and jest with earnest for it is a dull thing to tire and as we say now to jade any thing too far As for jest there be certain things which ought to be privileged from it namely religion matters of state great persons any man s present business of importance and any case that deserveth pity Yet there be some that think their wits have been asleep except they dart out somewhat that is piquant and to the quick That is a vein which would be bridled Parce puer stimulis et fortius utere loris And generally men ought to find the difference between saltness and bitterness Certainly he that hath a satirical vein as he maketh others afraid of his wit so he had need be afraid of others memory He that questioneth much shall learn much and content much but especially if he apply his questions to the skill of the persons whom he asketh for he shall give them occasion to please themselves in speaking and himself shall continually gather knowledge But let his questions not be troublesome for that is fit for a poser And let him be sure to leave other men their turns to speak Nay if there be any that would reign and take up all the time let him find means to take them off and to bring others on as musicians use to do with those that dance too long galliards If you dissemble sometimes your knowledge of that you are thought to know you shall be thought another time to know that you know not Speech of a man s self ought to be seldom and well chosen I knew one was wont to say in scorn He must needs be a wise man he speaks so much of himself and there is but one case wherein a man may commend himself with good grace and that is in commending virtue in another especially if it be such a virtue whereunto himself pretendeth Speech of touch towards others should be sparingly used for discourse ought to be as a field without coming home to any man I knew two noblemen of the west part of England whereof the one was given to scoff but kept ever royal cheer in his house the other would ask of those that had been at the other s table Tell truly was there never a flout or dry blow given To which the guest would answer Such and such a thing passed The lord would say I thought he would mar a good dinner Discretion of speech is more than eloquence and to speak agreeably to him with whom we deal is more than to speak in good words or in good order A good continued speech without a good speech of interlocution shows slowness and a good reply or second speech without a good settled speech showeth shallowness and weakness As we see in beasts that those that are weakest in the course are yet nimblest in the turn as it is betwixt the greyhound and the hare To use too many circumstances ere one come to the matter is wearisome to use none at all is blunt Of Plantations PLANTATIONS are amongst ancient primitive and heroical works When the world was young it begat more children but now it is old it begets fewer for I may justly account new plantations to be the children of former kingdoms I like a plantation in a pure soil that is where people are not displanted to the end to plant in others For else it is rather an extirpation than a plantation Planting of countries is like planting of woods for you must make account to leese almost twenty years profit and expect your recompense in the end For the principal thing that hath been the destruction of most plantations hath been the base and hasty drawing of profit in the first years It is true speedy profit is not to be neglected as far as may stand with the good of the plantation but no further It is a shameful and unblessed thing to take the scum of people and wicked condemned men to be the people with whom you plant and not only so but it spoileth the plantation for they will ever live like rogues and not fall to work but be lazy and do mischief and spend victuals and be quickly weary and then certify over to their country to the discredit of the plantation The people wherewith you plant ought to be gardeners ploughmen laborers smiths carpenters joiners fishermen fowlers with some few apothecaries surgeons cooks and bakers In a country of plantation first look about what kind of victual the country yields of itself to hand as chestnuts walnuts pineapples olives dates plums cherries wild honey and the like and make use of them Then consider what victual or esculent things there are which grow speedily and within the year as parsnips carrots turnips onions radish artichokes of Hierusalem maize and the like For wheat barley and oats they ask too much labor but with pease and beans you may begin both because they ask less labor and because they serve for meat as well as for bread And of rice likewise cometh a great increase and it is a kind of meat Above all there ought to be brought store of biscuit oat meal flour meal and the like in the beginning till bread may be had For beasts or birds take chiefly such as are least subject to diseases and multiply fastest as swine goats cocks hens turkeys geese house doves and the like The victual in plantations ought to be expended almost as in a besieged town that is with certain allowance And let the main part of the ground employed to gardens or corn be to a common stock and to be laid in and stored up and then delivered out in proportion besides some spots of ground that any particular person will manure for his own private Consider likewise what commodities the soil where the plantation is doth naturally yield that they may some way help to defray the charge of the plantation so it be not as was said to the untimely prejudice of the main business as it hath fared with tobacco in Virginia Wood commonly aboundeth but too much and therefore timber is fit to be one If there be iron ore and streams whereupon to set the mills iron is a brave commodity where wood aboundeth Making of bay salt if the climate be proper for it would be put in experience Growing silk likewise if any be is a likely commodity Pitch and tar where store of firs and pines are will not fail So drugs and sweet woods where they are cannot but yield great profit Soap ashes likewise and other things that may be thought of But moil not too much under ground for the hope of mines is very uncertain and useth to make the planters lazy in other things For government let it be in the hands of one assisted with some counsel and let them have commission to exercise martial laws with some limitation And above all let men make that profit of being in the wilderness as they have God always and his service before their eyes Let not the government of the plantation depend upon too many counsellors and undertakers in the country that planteth but upon a temperate number and let those be rather noblemen and gentlemen than merchants for they look ever to the present gain Let there be freedom from custom till the plantation be of strength and not only freedom from custom but freedom to carry their commodities where they may make their best of them except there be some special cause of caution Cram not in people by sending too fast company after company but rather harken how they waste and send supplies proportionably but so as the number may live well in the plantation and not by surcharge be in penury It hath been a great endangering to the health of some plantations that they have built along the sea and rivers in marish and unwholesome grounds Therefore though you begin there to avoid carriage and like discommodities yet build still rather upwards from the streams than along It concerneth likewise the health of the plantation that they have good store of salt with them that they may use it in their victuals when it shall be necessary If you plant where savages are do not only entertain them with trifles and gingles but use them justly and graciously with sufficient guard nevertheless and do not win their favor by helping them to invade their enemies but for their defence it is not amiss and send oft of them over to the country that plants that they may see a better condition than their own and commend it when they return When the plantation grows to strength then it is time to plant with women as well as with men that the plantation may spread into generations and not be ever pieced from without It is the sinfullest thing in the world to forsake or destitute a plantation once in forwardness for besides the dishonor it is the guiltiness of blood of many commiserable persons Of Riches I CANNOT call riches better than the baggage of virtue The Roman word is better impedimenta For as the baggage is to an army so is riches to virtue It cannot be spared nor left behind but it hindereth the march yea and the care of it sometimes loseth or disturbeth the victory Of great riches there is no real use except it be in the distribution the rest is but conceit So saith Solomon Where much is there are many to consume it and what hath the owner but the sight of it with his eyes The personal fruition in any man cannot reach to feel great riches there is a custody of them or a power of dole and donative of them or a fame of them but no solid use to the owner Do you not see what feigned prices are set upon little stones and rarities and what works of ostentation are undertaken because there might seem to be some use of great riches But then you will say they may be of use to buy men out of dangers or troubles As Solomon saith Riches are as a strong hold in the imagination of the rich man But this is excellently expressed that it is in imagination and not always in fact For certainly great riches have sold more men than they have bought out Seek not proud riches but such as thou mayest get justly use soberly distribute cheerfully and leave contentedly Yet have no abstract nor friarly contempt of them But distinguish as Cicero saith well of Rabirius Posthumus In studio rei amplificandae apparebat non avaritiae praedam sed instrumentum bonitati quaeri Harken also to Solomon and beware of hasty gathering of riches Qui festinat ad divitias non erit insons The poets feign that when Plutus which is Riches is sent from Jupiter he limps and goes slowly but when he is sent from Pluto he runs and is swift of foot Meaning that riches gotten by good means and just labor pace slowly but when they come by the death of others as by the course of inheritance testaments and the like they come tumbling upon a man But it mought be applied likewise to Pluto taking him for the devil For when riches come from the devil as by fraud and oppression and unjust means they come upon speed The ways to enrich are many and most of them foul Parsimony is one of the best and yet is not innocent for it withholdeth men from works of liberality and charity The improvement of the ground is the most natural obtaining of riches for it is our great mother s blessing the earth s but it is slow And yet where men of great wealth do stoop to husbandry it multiplieth riches exceedingly I knew a nobleman in England that had the greatest audits of any man in my time a great grazier a great sheep master a great timber man a great collier a great corn master a great lead man and so of iron and a number of the like points of husbandry So as the earth seemed a sea to him in respect of the perpetual importation It was truly observed by one that himself came very hardly to a little riches and very easily to great riches For when a man s stock is come to that that he can expect the prime of markets and overcome those bargains which for their greatness are few men s money and be partner in the industries of younger men he cannot but increase mainly The gains of ordinary trades and vocations are honest and furthered by two things chiefly by diligence and by a good name for good and fair dealing But the gains of bargains are of a more doubtful nature when men shall wait upon others necessity broke by servants and instruments to draw them on put off others cunningly that would be better chapmen and the like practices which are crafty and naught As for the chopping of bargains when a man buys not to hold but to sell over again that commonly grindeth double both upon the seller and upon the buyer Sharings do greatly enrich if the hands be well chosen that are trusted Usury is the certainest means of gain though one of the worst as that whereby a man doth eat his bread in sudore vultus alieni and besides doth plough upon Sundays But yet certain though it be it hath flaws for that the scriveners and brokers do value unsound men to serve their own turn The fortune in being the first in an invention or in a privilege doth cause sometimes a wonderful overgrowth in riches as it was with the first sugar man in the Canaries Therefore if a man can play the true logician to have as well judgment as invention he may do great matters especially if the times be fit He that resteth upon gains certain shall hardly grow to great riches and he that puts all upon adventures doth oftentimes break and come to poverty it is good therefore to guard adventures with certainties that may uphold losses Monopolies and coemption of wares for re sale where they are not restrained are great means to enrich especially if the party have intelligence what things are like to come into request and so store himself beforehand Riches gotten by service though it be of the best rise yet when they are gotten by flattery feeding humors and other servile conditions they may be placed amongst the worst As for fishing for testaments and executorships as Tacitus saith of Seneca testamenta et orbos tamquam indagine capi it is yet worse by how much men submit themselves to meaner persons than in service Believe not much them that seem to despise riches for they despise them that despair of them and none worse when they come to them Be not penny wise riches have wings and sometimes they fly away of themselves sometimes they must be set flying to bring in more Men leave their riches either to their kindred or to the public and moderate portions prosper best in both A great state left to an heir is as a lure to all the birds of prey round about to seize on him if he be not the better stablished in years and judgment Likewise glorious gifts and foundations are like sacrifices without salt and but the painted sepulchres of alms which soon will putrefy and corrupt inwardly Therefore measure not thine advancements by quantity but frame them by measure and defer not charities till death for certainly if a man weigh it rightly he that doth so is rather liberal of another man s than of his own Of Prophecies I MEAN not to speak of divine prophecies nor of heathen oracles nor of natural predictions but only of prophecies that have been of certain memory and from hidden causes Saith the Pythonissa to Saul To morrow thou and thy son shall be with me Homer hath these verses At domus AEneae cunctis dominabitur oris Et nati natorum et qui nascentur ab illis A prophecy as it seems of the Roman empire Seneca the tragedian hath these verses Venient annis Saecula seris quibus Oceanus Vincula rerum laxet et ingens Pateat Tellus Tiphysque novos Detegat orbes nec sit terris Ultima Thule a prophecy of the discovery of America The daughter of Polycrates dreamed that Jupiter bathed her father and Apollo anointed him and it came to pass that he was crucified in an open place where the sun made his body run with sweat and the rain washed it Philip of Macedon dreamed he sealed up his wife s belly whereby he did expound it that his wife should be barren but Aristander the soothsayer told him his wife was with child because men do not use to seal vessels that are empty A phantasm that appeared to M Brutus in his tent said to him Philippis iterum me videbis Tiberius said to Galba Tu quoque Galba degustabis imperium In Vespasian s time there went a prophecy in the East that those that should come forth of Judea should reign over the world which though it may be was meant of our Savior yet Tacitus expounds it of Vespasian Domitian dreamed the night before he was slain that a golden head was growing out of the nape of his neck and indeed the succession that followed him for many years made golden times Henry the Sixth of England said of Henry the Seventh when he was a lad and gave him water This is the lad that shall enjoy the crown for which we strive When I was in France I heard from one doctor Pena that the Queen Mother who was given to curious arts caused the King her husband s nativity to be calculated under a false name and the astrologer gave a judgment that he should be killed in a duel at which the Queen laughed thinking her husband to be above challenges and duels but he was slain upon a course at tilt the splinters of the staff of Montgomery going in at his beaver The trivial prophecy which I heard when I was a child and Queen Elizabeth was in the flower of her years was When hempe is spun England s done whereby it was generally conceived that after the princes had reigned which had the principal letters of that word hempe which were Henry Edward Mary Philip and Elizabeth England should come to utter confusion which thanks be to God is verified only in the change of the name for that the King s style is now no more of England but of Britain There was also another prophecy before the year of eighty eight which I do not well understand There shall be seen upon a day Between the Baugh and the May The black fleet of Norway When that that is come and gone England build houses of lime and stone For after wars shall you have none It was generally conceived to be meant of the Spanish fleet that came in eighty eight for that the king of Spain s surname as they say is Norway The prediction of Regiomontanus Octogesimus octavus mirabilis annus was thought likewise accomplished in the sending of that great fleet being the greatest in strength though not in number of all that ever swam upon the sea As for Cleon s dream I think it was a jest It was that he was devoured of a long dragon and it was expounded of a maker of sausages that troubled him exceedingly There are numbers of the like kind especially if you include dreams and predictions of astrology But I have set down these few only of certain credit for example My judgment is that they ought all to be despised and ought to serve but for winter talk by the fireside Though when I say despised I mean it as for belief for otherwise the spreading or publishing of them is in no sort to be despised For they have done much mischief and I see many severe laws made to suppress them That that hath given them grace and some credit consisteth in three things First that men mark when they hit and never mark when they miss as they do generally also of dreams The second is that probable conjectures or obscure traditions many times turn themselves into prophecies while the nature of man which coveteth divination thinks it no peril to foretell that which indeed they do but collect As that of Seneca s verse For so much was then subject to demonstration that the globe of the earth had great parts beyond the Atlantic which mought be probably conceived not to be all sea and adding thereto the tradition in Plato s Timaeus and his Atlanticus it mought encourage one to turn it to a prediction The third and last which is the great one is that almost all of them being infinite in number have been impostures and by idle and crafty brains merely contrived and feigned after the event past Of Ambition AMBITION is like choler which is an humor that maketh men active earnest full of alacrity and stirring if it be not stopped But if it be stopped and cannot have his way it becometh adust and thereby malign and venomous So ambitious men if they find the way open for their rising and still get forward they are rather busy than dangerous but if they be checked in their desires they become secretly discontent and look upon men and matters with an evil eye and are best pleased when things go backward which is the worst property in a servant of a prince or state Therefore it is good for princes if they use ambitious men to handle it so as they be still progressive and not retrograde which because it cannot be without inconvenience it is good not to use such natures at all For if they rise not with their service they will take order to make their service fall with them But since we have said it were good not to use men of ambitious natures except it be upon necessity it is fit we speak in what cases they are of necessity Good commanders in the wars must be taken be they never so ambitious for the use of their service dispenseth with the rest and to take a soldier without ambition is to pull off his spurs There is also great use of ambitious men in being screens to princes in matters of danger and envy for no man will take that part except he be like a seeled dove that mounts and mounts because he cannot see about him There is use also of ambitious men in pulling down the greatness of any subject that overtops as Tiberius used Marco in the pulling down of Sejanus Since therefore they must be used in such cases there resteth to speak how they are to be bridled that they may be less dangerous There is less danger of them if they be of mean birth than if they be noble and if they be rather harsh of nature than gracious and popular and if they be rather new raised than grown cunning and fortified in their greatness It is counted by some a weakness in princes to have favorites but it is of all others the best remedy against ambitious great ones For when the way of pleasuring and displeasuring lieth by the favorite it is impossible any other should be overgreat Another means to curb them is to balance them by others as proud as they But then there must be some middle counsellors to keep things steady for without that ballast the ship will roll too much At the least a prince may animate and inure some meaner persons to be as it were scourges to ambitious men As for the having of them obnoxious to ruin if they be of fearful natures it may do well but if they be stout and daring it may precipitate their designs and prove dangerous As for the pulling of them down if the affairs require it and that it may not be done with safety suddenly the only way is the interchange continually of favors and disgraces whereby they may not know what to expect and be as it were in a wood Of ambitions it is less harmful the ambition to prevail in great things than that other to appear in every thing for that breeds confusion and mars business But yet it is less danger to have an ambitious man stirring in business than great in dependences He that seeketh to be eminent amongst able men hath a great task but that is ever good for the public But he that plots to be the only figure amongst ciphers is the decay of a whole age Honor hath three things in it the vantage ground to do good the approach to kings and principal persons and the raising of a man s own fortunes He that hath the best of these intentions when he aspireth is an honest man and that prince that can discern of these intentions in another that aspireth is a wise prince Generally let princes and states choose such ministers as are more sensible of duty than of using and such as love business rather upon conscience than upon bravery and let them discern a busy nature from a willing mind Of Masques And Triumphs THESE things are but toys to come amongst such serious observations But yet since princes will have such things it is better they should be graced with elegancy than daubed with cost Dancing to song is a thing of great state and pleasure I understand it that the song be in quire placed aloft and accompanied with some broken music and the ditty fitted to the device Acting in song especially in dialogues hath an extreme good grace I say acting not dancing for that is a mean and vulgar thing and the voices of the dialogue would be strong and manly a base and a tenor no treble and the ditty high and tragical not nice or dainty

764_132280_000001_000006	train-clean-360	And generally let it be noted that those things which I here set down are such as do naturally take the sense and not respect petty wonderments It is true the alterations of scenes so it be quietly and without noise are things of great beauty and pleasure for they feed and relieve the eye before it be full of the same object 
none	none	Let the scenes abound with light specially colored and varied and let the masquers or any other that are to come down from the scene have some motions upon the scene itself before their coming down for it draws the eye strangely and makes it with great pleasure to desire to see that it cannot perfectly discern Let the songs be loud and cheerful and not chirpings or pulings 
764_132280_000001_000009	train-clean-360	Let the music likewise be sharp and loud and well placed

764_132280_000001_000015	train-clean-360	But chiefly let the music of them be recreative and with some strange changes

764_132280_000004_000001	train-clean-360	Force maketh nature more violent in the return doctrine and discourse maketh nature less importune but custom only doth alter and subdue nature 
764_132280_000004_000002	train-clean-360	He that seeketh victory over his nature let him not set himself too great nor too small tasks for the first will make him dejected by often failings and the second will make him a small proceeder though by often prevailings 
none	none	And at the first let him practise with helps as swimmers do with bladders or rushes but after a time let him practise with disadvantages as dancers do with thick shoes 
764_132280_000004_000004	train-clean-360	For it breeds great perfection if the practice be harder than the use 
none	none	Where nature is mighty and therefore the victory hard the degrees had need be first to stay and arrest nature in time like to him that would say over the four and twenty letters when he was angry then to go less in quantity as if one should in forbearing wine come from drinking healths to a draught at a meal and lastly to discontinue altogether But if a man have the fortitude and resolution to enfranchise himself at once that is the best Optimus ille animi vindex laedentia pectus Vincula qui rupit dedoluitque semel Neither is the ancient rule amiss to bend nature as a wand to a contrary extreme whereby to set it right understanding it where the contrary extreme is no vice 
764_132280_000006_000001	train-clean-360	Let not a man force a habit upon himself with a perpetual continuance but with some intermission 
764_132280_000006_000002	train-clean-360	For both the pause reinforceth the new onset and if a man that is not perfect be ever in practice he shall as well practise his errors as his abilities and induce one habit of both and there is no means to help this but by seasonable intermissions 
764_132280_000006_000003	train-clean-360	But let not a man trust his victory over his nature too far for nature will lay buried a great time and yet revive upon the occasion or temptation 
none	none	Like as it was with AEsop s damsel turned from a cat to a woman who sat very demurely at the board s end till a mouse ran before her 
764_132280_000006_000005	train-clean-360	Therefore let a man either avoid the occasion altogether or put himself often to it that he may be little moved with it 
764_132280_000006_000006	train-clean-360	A man s nature is best perceived in privateness for there is no affectation in passion for that putteth a man out of his precepts and in a new case or experiment for there custom leaveth him 
none	none	They are happy men whose natures sort with their vocations otherwise they may say multum incola fuit anima mea when they converse in those things they do not affect 
764_132280_000006_000008	train-clean-360	In studies whatsoever a man commandeth upon himself let him set hours for it but whatsoever is agreeable to his nature let him take no care for any set times for his thoughts will fly to it of themselves so as the spaces of other business or studies will suffice

764_132280_000008_000000	train-clean-360	MEN S thoughts are much according to their inclination their discourse and speeches according to their learning and infused opinions but their deeds are after as they have been accustomed 
764_132280_000008_000001	train-clean-360	And therefore as Machiavel well noteth though in an evil favored instance there is no trusting to the force of nature nor to the bravery of words except it be corroborate by custom 
764_132280_000008_000002	train-clean-360	His instance is that for the achieving of a desperate conspiracy a man should not rest upon the fierceness of any man s nature or his resolute undertakings but take such an one as hath had his hands formerly in blood 
none	none	But Machiavel knew not of a Friar Clement nor a Ravillac nor a Jaureguy nor a Baltazar Gerard yet his rule holdeth still that nature nor the engagement of words are not so forcible as custom 
764_132280_000008_000004	train-clean-360	Only superstition is now so well advanced that men of the first blood are as firm as butchers by occupation and votary resolution is made equipollent to custom even in matter of blood 
none	none	In other things the predominancy of custom is everywhere visible insomuch as a man would wonder to hear men profess protest engage give great words and then do just as they have done before as if they were dead images and engines moved only by the wheels of custom We see also the reign or tyranny of custom what it is

none	none	Many examples may be put of the force of custom both upon mind and body 
764_132280_000008_000013	train-clean-360	Therefore since custom is the principal magistrate of man s life let men by all means endeavor to obtain good customs Certainly custom is most perfect when it beginneth in young years this we call education which is in effect but an early custom 
764_132280_000008_000014	train-clean-360	So we see in languages the tongue is more pliant to all expressions and sounds the joints are more supple to all feats of activity and motions in youth than afterwards 
764_132280_000008_000015	train-clean-360	For it is true that late learners cannot so well take the ply except it be in some minds that have not suffered themselves to fix but have kept themselves open and prepared to receive continual amendment which is exceeding rare 
764_132280_000008_000016	train-clean-360	But if the force of custom simple and separate be great the force of custom copulate and conjoined and collegiate is far greater 
764_132280_000008_000017	train-clean-360	For there example teacheth company comforteth emulation quickeneth glory raiseth so as in such places the force of custom is in his exaltation 
764_132280_000008_000018	train-clean-360	Certainly the great multiplication of virtues upon human nature resteth upon societies well ordained and disciplined 
none	none	For commonwealths and good governments do nourish virtue grown but do not much mend the deeds But the misery is that the most effectual means are now applied to the ends least to be desired Of Fortune 
764_132280_000010_000000	train-clean-360	IT CANNOT be denied but outward accidents conduce much to fortune favor opportunity death of others occasion fitting virtue

764_132280_000010_000003	train-clean-360	And the most frequent of external causes is that the folly of one man is the fortune of another 
764_132280_000010_000004	train-clean-360	For no man prospers so suddenly as by others errors 
764_132280_000010_000005	train-clean-360	Serpens nisi serpentem comederit non fit draco 
764_132280_000010_000006	train-clean-360	Overt and apparent virtues bring forth praise but there be secret and hidden virtues that bring forth fortune certain deliveries of a man s self which have no name 
764_132280_000010_000007	train-clean-360	The Spanish name desemboltura partly expresseth them when there be not stonds nor restiveness in a man s nature but that the wheels of his mind keep way with the wheels of his fortune 
none	none	For so Livy after he had described Cato Major in these words In illo viro tantum robur corporis et animi fuit ut quocunque loco natus esset fortunam sibi facturus videretur falleth upon that that he had versatile ingenium Therefore if a man look sharply and attentively he shall see Fortune for though she be blind yet she is not invisible 
764_132280_000010_000010	train-clean-360	The way of fortune is like the Milken Way in the sky which is a meeting or knot of a number of small stars not seen asunder but giving light together 
764_132280_000010_000011	train-clean-360	So are there a number of little and scarce discerned virtues or rather faculties and customs that make men fortunate 
none	none	The Italians note some of them such as a man would little think When they speak of one that cannot do amiss they will throw in into his other conditions that he hath Poco di matto 
764_132280_000010_000014	train-clean-360	And certainly there be not two more fortunate properties than to have a little of the fool and not too much of the honest 
764_132280_000010_000015	train-clean-360	Therefore extreme lovers of their country or masters were never fortunate neither can they be 
none	none	For when a man placeth his thoughts without himself he goeth not his own way An hasty fortune maketh an enterpriser and remover the French hath it better entreprenant or remuant but the exercised fortune maketh the able man 
764_132280_000010_000017	train-clean-360	Fortune is to be honored and respected and it be but for her daughters Confidence and Reputation 
764_132280_000010_000018	train-clean-360	For those two Felicity breedeth the first within a man s self the latter in others towards him 
none	none	All wise men to decline the envy of their own virtues use to ascribe them to Providence and Fortune for so they may the better assume them and besides it is greatness in a man to be the care of the higher powers So Caesar said to the pilot in the tempest Caesarem portas et fortunam ejus 
764_132280_000010_000020	train-clean-360	So Sylla chose the name of Felix and not of Magnus 
none	none	And it hath been noted that those who ascribe openly too much to their own wisdom and policy end infortunate 
764_132280_000010_000022	train-clean-360	It is written that Timotheus the Athenian after he had in the account he gave to the state of his government often interlaced this speech and in this Fortune had no part never prospered in anything he undertook afterwards 
none	none	Certainly there be whose fortunes are like Homer s verses that have a slide and easiness more than the verses of other poets as Plutarch saith of Timoleon s fortune in respect of that of Agesilaus or Epaminondas And that this should be no doubt it is much in a man s self Of Usury MANY have made witty invectives against usury They say that it is a pity the devil should have God s part which is the tithe That the usurer is the greatest Sabbath breaker because his plough goeth every Sunday That the usurer is the drone that Virgil speaketh of Ignavum fucos pecus a praesepibus arcent That the usurer breaketh the first law that was made for mankind after the fall which was in sudore vultus tui comedes panem tuum not in sudore vultus alieni That usurers should have orange tawny bonnets because they do judaize That it is against nature for money to beget money and the like I say this only that usury is a concessum propter duritiem cordis for since there must be borrowing and lending and men are so hard of heart as they will not lend freely usury must be permitted Some others have made suspicious and cunning propositions of banks discovery of men s estates and other inventions But few have spoken of usury usefully It is good to set before us the incommodities and commodities of usury that the good may be either weighed out or culled out and warily to provide that while we make forth to that which is better we meet not with that which is worse The discommodities of usury are First that it makes fewer merchants For were it not for this lazy trade of usury money would not be still but would in great part be employed upon merchandizing which is the vena porta of wealth in a state The second that it makes poor merchants For as a farmer cannot husband his ground so well if he sit at a great rent so the merchant cannot drive his trade so well if he sit at great usury The third is incident to the other two and that is the decay of customs of kings or states which ebb or flow with merchandizing The fourth that it bringeth the treasure of a realm or state into a few hands For the usurer being at certainties and others at uncertainties at the end of the game most of the money will be in the box and ever a state flourisheth when wealth is more equally spread The fifth that it beats down the price of land for the employment of money is chiefly either merchandizing or purchasing and usury waylays both The sixth that it doth dull and damp all industries improvements and new inventions wherein money would be stirring if it were not for this slug The last that it is the canker and ruin of many men s estates which in process of time breeds a public poverty On the other side the commodities of usury are first that howsoever usury in some respect hindereth merchandizing yet in some other it advanceth it for it is certain that the greatest part of trade is driven by young merchants upon borrowing at interest so as if the usurer either call in or keep back his money there will ensue presently a great stand of trade The second is that were it not for this easy borrowing upon interest men s necessities would draw upon them a most sudden undoing in that they would be forced to sell their means be it lands or goods far under foot and so whereas usury doth but gnaw upon them bad markets would swallow them quite up As for mortgaging or pawning it will little mend the matter for either men will not take pawns without use or if they do they will look precisely for the forfeiture I remember a cruel moneyed man in the country that would say The devil take this usury it keeps us from forfeitures of mortgages and bonds The third and last is that it is a vanity to conceive that there would be ordinary borrowing without profit and it is impossible to conceive the number of inconveniences that will ensue if borrowing be cramped Therefore to speak of the abolishing of usury is idle All states have ever had it in one kind or rate or other So as that opinion must be sent to Utopia To speak now of the reformation and reiglement of usury how the discommodities of it may be best avoided and the commodities retained It appears by the balance of commodities and discommodities of usury two things are to be reconciled The one that the tooth of usury be grinded that it bite not too much the other that there be left open a means to invite moneyed men to lend to the merchants for the continuing and quickening of trade This cannot be done except you introduce two several sorts of usury a less and a greater For if you reduce usury to one low rate it will ease the common borrower but the merchant will be to seek for money And it is to be noted that the trade of merchandize being the most lucrative may bear usury at a good rate other contracts not so To serve both intentions the way would be briefly thus That there be two rates of usury the one free and general for all the other under license only to certain persons and in certain places of merchandizing First therefore let usury in general be reduced to five in the hundred and let that rate be proclaimed to be free and current and let the state shut itself out to take any penalty for the same This will preserve borrowing from any general stop or dryness This will ease infinite borrowers in the country This will in good part raise the price of land because land purchased at sixteen years purchase will yield six in the hundred and somewhat more whereas this rate of interest yields but five This by like reason will encourage and edge industrious and profitable improvements because many will rather venture in that kind than take five in the hundred especially having been used to greater profit Secondly let there be certain persons licensed to lend to known merchants upon usury at a higher rate and let it be with the cautions following Let the rate be even with the merchant himself somewhat more easy than that he used formerly to pay for by that means all borrowers shall have some ease by this reformation be he merchant or whosoever Let it be no bank or common stock but every man be master of his own money Not that I altogether mislike banks but they will hardly be brooked in regard of certain suspicions Let the state be answered some small matter for the license and the rest left to the lender for if the abatement be but small it will no whit discourage the lender For he for example that took before ten or nine in the hundred will sooner descend to eight in the hundred than give over his trade of usury and go from certain gains to gains of hazard Let these licensed lenders be in number indefinite but restrained to certain principal cities and towns of merchandizing for then they will be hardly able to color other men s moneys in the country so as the license of nine will not suck away the current rate of five for no man will send his moneys far off nor put them into unknown hands If it be objected that this doth in a sort authorize usury which before was in some places but permissive the answer is that it is better to mitigate usury by declaration than to suffer it to rage by connivance Of Youth And Age A MAN that is young in years may be old in hours if he have lost no time But that happeneth rarely Generally youth is like the first cogitations not so wise as the second For there is a youth in thoughts as well as in ages And yet the invention of young men is more lively than that of old and imaginations stream into their minds better and as it were more divinely Natures that have much heat and great and violent desires and perturbations are not ripe for action till they have passed the meridian of their years as it was with Julius Caesar and Septimius Severus Of the latter of whom it is said Juventutem egit erroribus imo furoribus plenam And yet he was the ablest emperor almost of all the list But reposed natures may do well in youth As it is seen in Augustus Caesar Cosmus Duke of Florence Gaston de Foix and others On the other side heat and vivacity in age is an excellent composition for business Young men are fitter to invent than to judge fitter for execution than for counsel and fitter for new projects than for settled business For the experience of age in things that fall within the compass of it directeth them but in new things abuseth them The errors of young men are the ruin of business but the errors of aged men amount but to this that more might have been done or sooner Young men in the conduct and manage of actions embrace more than they can hold stir more than they can quiet fly to the end without consideration of the means and degrees pursue some few principles which they have chanced upon absurdly care not to innovate which draws unknown inconveniences use extreme remedies at first and that which doubleth all errors will not acknowledge or retract them like an unready horse that will neither stop nor turn Men of age object too much consult too long adventure too little repent too soon and seldom drive business home to the full period but content themselves with a mediocrity of success Certainly it is good to compound employments of both for that will be good for the present because the virtues of either age may correct the defects of both and good for succession that young men may be learners while men in age are actors and lastly good for extern accidents because authority followeth old men and favor and popularity youth But for the moral part perhaps youth will have the pre eminence as age hath for the politic A certain rabbin upon the text Your young men shall see visions and your old men shall dream dreams inferreth that young men are admitted nearer to God than old because vision is a clearer revelation than a dream And certainly the more a man drinketh of the world the more it intoxicateth and age doth profit rather in the powers of understanding than in the virtues of the will and affections There be some have an over early ripeness in their years which fadeth betimes These are first such as have brittle wits the edge whereof is soon turned such as was Hermogenes the rhetorician whose books are exceeding subtle who afterwards waxed stupid A second sort is of those that have some natural dispositions which have better grace in youth than in age such as is a fluent and luxuriant speech which becomes youth well but not age so Tully saith of Hortensius Idem manebat neque idem decebat The third is of such as take too high a strain at the first and are magnanimous more than tract of years can uphold As was Scipio Africanus of whom Livy saith in effect Ultima primis cedebant Of Beauty VIRTUE is like a rich stone best plain set and surely virtue is best in a body that is comely though not of delicate features and that hath rather dignity of presence than beauty of aspect Neither is it almost seen that very beautiful persons are otherwise of great virtue as if nature were rather busy not to err than in labor to produce excellency And therefore they prove accomplished but not of great spirit and study rather behavior than virtue But this holds not always for Augustus Caesar Titus Vespasianus Philip le Belle of France Edward the Fourth of England Alcibiades of Athens Ismael the Sophy of Persia were all high and great spirits and yet the most beautiful men of their times In beauty that of favor is more than that of color and that of decent and gracious motion more than that of favor That is the best part of beauty which a picture cannot express no nor the first sight of the life There is no excellent beauty that hath not some strangeness in the proportion A man cannot tell whether Apelles or Albert Durer were the more trifler whereof the one would make a personage by geometrical proportions the other by taking the best parts out of divers faces to make one excellent Such personages I think would please nobody but the painter that made them Not but I think a painter may make a better face than ever was but he must do it by a kind of felicity as a musician that maketh an excellent air in music and not by rule A man shall see faces that if you examine them part by part you shall find never a good and yet altogether do well If it be true that the principal part of beauty is in decent motion certainly it is no marvel though persons in years seem many times more amiable pulchrorum autumnus pulcher for no youth can be comely but by pardon and considering the youth as to make up the comeliness Beauty is as summer fruits which are easy to corrupt and cannot last and for the most part it makes a dissolute youth and an age a little out of countenance but yet certainly again if it light well it maketh virtue shine and vices blush Of Deformity DEFORMED persons are commonly even with nature for as nature hath done ill by them so do they by nature being for the most part as the Scripture saith void of natural affection and so they have their revenge of nature Certainly there is a consent between the body and the mind and where nature erreth in the one she ventureth in the other Ubi peccat in uno periclitatur in altero But because there is in man an election touching the frame of his mind and a necessity in the frame of his body the stars of natural inclination are sometimes obscured by the sun of discipline and virtue Therefore it is good to consider of deformity not as a sign which is more deceivable but as a cause which seldom faileth of the effect Whosoever hath anything fixed in his person that doth induce contempt hath also a perpetual spur in himself to rescue and deliver himself from scorn Therefore all deformed persons are extreme bold First as in their own defence as being exposed to scorn but in process of time by a general habit Also it stirreth in them industry and especially of this kind to watch and observe the weakness of others that they may have somewhat to repay Again in their superiors it quencheth jealousy towards them as persons that they think they may at pleasure despise and it layeth their competitors and emulators asleep as never believing they should be in possibility of advancement till they see them in possession So that upon the matter in a great wit deformity is an advantage to rising Kings in ancient times and at this present in some countries were wont to put great trust in eunuchs because they that are envious towards all are more obnoxious and officious towards one But yet their trust towards them hath rather been as to good spials and good whisperers than good magistrates and officers And much like is the reason of deformed persons Still the ground is they will if they be of spirit seek to free themselves from scorn which must be either by virtue or malice and therefore let it not be marvelled if sometimes they prove excellent persons as was Agesilaus Zanger the son of Solyman AEsop Gasca President of Peru and Socrates may go likewise amongst them with others Of Building HOUSES are built to live in and not to look on therefore let use be preferred before uniformity except where both may be had Leave the goodly fabrics of houses for beauty only to the enchanted palaces of the poets who build them with small cost He that builds a fair house upon an ill seat committeth himself to prison Neither do I reckon it an ill seat only where the air is unwholesome but likewise where the air is unequal as you shall see many fine seats set upon a knap of ground environed with higher hills round about it whereby the heat of the sun is pent in and the wind gathereth as in troughs so as you shall have and that suddenly as great diversity of heat and cold as if you dwelt in several places Neither is it ill air only that maketh an ill seat but ill ways ill markets and if you will consult with Momus ill neighbors I speak not of many more want of water want of wood shade and shelter want of fruitfulness and mixture of grounds of several natures want of prospect want of level grounds want of places at some near distance for sports of hunting hawking and races too near the sea too remote having the commodity of navigable rivers or the discommodity of their overflowing too far off from great cities which may hinder business or too near them which lurcheth all provisions and maketh everything dear where a man hath a great living laid together and where he is scanted all which as it is impossible perhaps to find together so it is good to know them and think of them that a man may take as many as he can and if he have several dwellings that he sort them so that what he wanteth in the one he may find in the other Lucullus answered Pompey well who when he saw his stately galleries and rooms so large and lightsome in one of his houses said Surely an excellent place for summer but how do you in winter Lucullus answered Why do you not think me as wise as some fowl are that ever change their abode towards the winter To pass from the seat to the house itself we will do as Cicero doth in the orator s art who writes books De Oratore and a book he entitles Orator whereof the former delivers the precepts of the art and the latter the perfection We will therefore describe a princely palace making a brief model thereof For it is strange to see now in Europe such huge buildings as the Vatican and Escurial and some others be and yet scarce a very fair room in them First therefore I say you cannot have a perfect palace except you have two several sides a side for the banquet as it is spoken of in the book of Hester and a side for the household the one for feasts and triumphs and the other for dwelling I understand both these sides to be not only returns but parts of the front and to be uniform without though severally partitioned within and to be on both sides of a great and stately tower in the midst of the front that as it were joineth them together on either hand I would have on the side of the banquet in front one only goodly room above stairs of some forty foot high and under it a room for a dressing or preparing place at times of triumphs On the other side which is the household side I wish it divided at the first into a hall and a chapel with a partition between both of good state and bigness and those not to go all the length but to have at the further end a winter and a summer parlor both fair And under these rooms a fair and large cellar sunk under ground and likewise some privy kitchens with butteries and pantries and the like As for the tower I would have it two stories of eighteen foot high apiece above the two wings and a goodly leads upon the top railed with statuas interposed and the same tower to be divided into rooms as shall be thought fit The stairs likewise to the upper rooms let them be upon a fair open newel and finely railed in with images of wood cast into a brass color and a very fair landing place at the top But this to be if you do not point any of the lower rooms for a dining place of servants For otherwise you shall have the servants dinner after your own for the steam of it will come up as in a tunnel And so much for the front Only I understand the height of the first stairs to be sixteen foot which is the height of the lower room Beyond this front is there to be a fair court but three sides of it of a far lower building than the front And in all the four corners of that court fair staircases cast into turrets on the outside and not within the row of buildings themselves But those towers are not to be of the height of the front but rather proportionable to the lower building Let the court not be paved for that striketh up a great heat in summer and much cold in winter But only some side alleys with a cross and the quarters to graze being kept shorn but not too near shorn The row of return on the banquet side let it be all stately galleries in which galleries let there be three or five fine cupolas in the length of it placed at equal distance and fine colored windows of several works On the household side chambers of presence and ordinary entertainments with some bed chambers and let all three sides be a double house without thorough lights on the sides that you may have rooms from the sun both for forenoon and afternoon Cast it also that you may have rooms both for summer and winter shady for summer and warm for winter You shall have sometimes fair houses so full of glass that one cannot tell where to become to be out of the sun or cold For inbowed windows I hold them of good use in cities indeed upright do better in respect of the uniformity towards the street for they be pretty retiring places for conference and besides they keep both the wind and sun off for that which would strike almost through the room doth scarce pass the window But let them be but few four in the court on the sides only Beyond this court let there be an inward court of the same square and height which is to be environed with the garden on all sides and in the inside cloistered on all sides upon decent and beautiful arches as high as the first story On the under story towards the garden let it be turned to a grotto or a place of shade or estivation And only have opening and windows towards the garden and be level upon the floor no whit sunken under ground to avoid all dampishness And let there be a fountain or some fair work of statuas in the midst of this court and to be paved as the other court was These buildings to be for privy lodgings on both sides and the end for privy galleries Whereof you must foresee that one of them be for an infirmary if the prince or any special person should be sick with chambers bed chamber antecamera and recamera joining to it This upon the second story Upon the ground story a fair gallery open upon pillars and upon the third story likewise an open gallery upon pillars to take the prospect and freshness of the garden At both corners of the further side by way of return let there be two delicate or rich cabinets daintily paved richly hanged glazed with crystalline glass and a rich cupola in the midst and all other elegancy that may be thought upon In the upper gallery too I wish that there may be if the place will yield it some fountains running in divers places from the wall with some fine avoidances And thus much for the model of the palace save that you must have before you come to the front three courts A green court plain with a wall about it a second court of the same but more garnished with little turrets or rather embellishments upon the wall and a third court to make a square with the front but not to be built nor yet enclosed with a naked wall but enclosed with terraces leaded aloft and fairly garnished on the three sides and cloistered on the inside with pillars and not with arches below As for offices let them stand at distance with some low galleries to pass from them to the palace itself Of Gardens GOD Almighty first planted a garden And indeed it is the purest of human pleasures It is the greatest refreshment to the spirits of man without which buildings and palaces are but gross handiworks and a man shall ever see that when ages grow to civility and elegancy men come to build stately sooner than to garden finely as if gardening were the greater perfection I do hold it in the royal ordering of gardens there ought to be gardens for all the months in the year in which severally things of beauty may be then in season For December and January and the latter part of November you must take such things as are green all winter holly ivy bays juniper cypress trees yew pine apple trees fir trees rosemary lavender periwinkle the white the purple and the blue germander flags orange trees lemon trees and myrtles if they be stoved and sweet marjoram warm set There followeth for the latter part of January and February the mezereon tree which then blossoms crocus vernus both the yellow and the grey primroses anemones the early tulippa hyacinthus orientalis chamairis fritellaria For March there come violets specially the single blue which are the earliest the yellow daffodil the daisy the almond tree in blossom the peach tree in blossom the cornelian tree in blossom sweet briar In April follow the double white violet the wallflower the stock gilliflower the cowslip flowerdelices and lilies of all natures rosemary flowers the tulippa the double peony the pale daffodil the French honeysuckle the cherry tree in blossom the damson and plum trees in blossom the white thorn in leaf the lilac tree In May and June come pinks of all sorts specially the blushpink roses of all kinds except the musk which comes later honeysuckles strawberries bugloss columbine the French marigold flos Africanus cherry tree in fruit ribes figs in fruit rasps vineflowers lavender in flowers the sweet satyrian with the white flower herba muscaria lilium convallium the apple tree in blossom In July come gilliflowers of all varieties musk roses the lime tree in blossom early pears and plums in fruit jennetings codlins In August come plums of all sorts in fruit pears apricocks berberries filberds musk melons monks hoods of all colors In September come grapes apples poppies of all colors peaches melocotones nectarines cornelians wardens quinces In October and the beginning of November come services medlars bullaces roses cut or removed to come late hollyhocks and such like These particulars are for the climate of London but my meaning is perceived that you may have ver perpetuum as the place affords And because the breath of flowers is far sweeter in the air where it comes and goes like the warbling of music than in the hand therefore nothing is more fit for that delight than to know what be the flowers and plants that do best perfume the air Roses damask and red are fast flowers of their smells so that you may walk by a whole row of them and find nothing of their sweetness yea though it be in a morning s dew Bays likewise yield no smell as they grow Rosemary little nor sweet marjoram That which above all others yields the sweetest smell in the air is the violet specially the white double violet which comes twice a year about the middle of April and about Bartholomew tide Next to that is the musk rose Then the strawberry leaves dying which yield a most excellent cordial smell Then the flower of vines it is a little dust like the dust of a bent which grows upon the cluster in the first coming forth Then sweet briar Then wall flowers which are very delightful to be set under a parlor or lower chamber window Then pinks and gilliflowers especially the matted pink and clove gilliflower Then the flowers of the lime tree Then the honeysuckles so they be somewhat afar off Of beanflowers I speak not because they are field flowers But those which perfume the air most delightfully not passed by as the rest but being trodden upon and crushed are three that is burnet wildthyme and watermints Therefore you are to set whole alleys of them to have the pleasure when you walk or tread For gardens speaking of those which are indeed princelike as we have done of buildings the contents ought not well to be under thirty acres of ground and to be divided into three parts a green in the entrance a heath or desert in the going forth and the main garden in the midst besides alleys on both sides And I like well that four acres of ground be assigned to the green six to the heath four and four to either side and twelve to the main garden The green hath two pleasures the one because nothing is more pleasant to the eye than green grass kept finely shorn the other because it will give you a fair alley in the midst by which you may go in front upon a stately hedge which is to enclose the garden But because the alley will be long and in great heat of the year or day you ought not to buy the shade in the garden by going in the sun through the green therefore you are of either side the green to plant a covert alley upon carpenter s work about twelve foot in height by which you may go in shade into the garden As for the making of knots or figures with divers colored earths that they may lie under the windows of the house on that side which the garden stands they be but toys you may see as good sights many times in tarts The garden is best to be square encompassed on all the four sides with a stately arched hedge The arches to be upon pillars of carpenter s work of some ten foot high and six foot broad and the spaces between of the same dimension with the breadth of the arch Over the arches let there be an entire hedge of some four foot high framed also upon carpenter s work and upon the upper hedge over every arch a little turret with a belly enough to receive a cage of birds and over every space between the arches some other little figure with broad plates of round colored glass gilt for the sun to play upon But this hedge I intend to be raised upon a bank not steep but gently slope of some six foot set all with flowers Also I understand that this square of the garden should not be the whole breadth of the ground but to leave on either side ground enough for diversity of side alleys unto which the two covert alleys of the green may deliver you But there must be no alleys with hedges at either end of this great enclosure not at the hither end for letting your prospect upon this fair hedge from the green nor at the further end for letting your prospect from the hedge through the arches upon the heath For the ordering of the ground within the great hedge I leave it to variety of device advising nevertheless that whatsoever form you cast it into first it be not too busy or full of work Wherein I for my part do not like images cut out in juniper or other garden stuff they be for children Little low hedges round like welts with some pretty pyramids I like well and in some places fair columns upon frames of carpenter s work I would also have the alleys spacious and fair You may have closer alleys upon the side grounds but none in the main garden I wish also in the very middle a fair mount with three ascents and alleys enough for four to walk abreast which I would have to be perfect circles without any bulwarks or embossments and the whole mount to be thirty foot high and some fine banqueting house with some chimneys neatly cast and without too much glass For fountains they are a great beauty and refreshment but pools mar all and make the garden unwholesome and full of flies and frogs Fountains I intend to be of two natures the one that sprinkleth or spouteth water the other a fair receipt of water of some thirty or forty foot square but without fish or slime or mud For the first the ornaments of images gilt or of marble which are in use do well but the main matter is so to convey the water as it never stay either in the bowls or in the cistern that the water be never by rest discolored green or red or the like or gather any mossiness or putrefaction Besides that it is to be cleansed every day by the hand Also some steps up to it and some fine pavement about it doth well As for the other kind of fountain which we may call a bathing pool it may admit much curiosity and beauty wherewith we will not trouble ourselves as that the bottom be finely paved and with images the sides likewise and withal embellished with colored glass and such things of lustre encompassed also with fine rails of low statuas But the main point is the same which we mentioned in the former kind of fountain which is that the water be in perpetual motion fed by a water higher than the pool and delivered into it by fair spouts and then discharged away under ground by some equality of bores that it stay little And for fine devices of arching water without spilling and making it rise in several forms of feathers drinking glasses canopies and the like they be pretty things to look on but nothing to health and sweetness For the heath which was the third part of our plot I wish it to be framed as much as may be to a natural wildness Trees I would have none in it but some thickets made only of sweet briar and honeysuckle and some wild vine amongst and the ground set with violets strawberries and primroses For these are sweet and prosper in the shade And these to be in the heath here and there not in any order I like also little heaps in the nature of mole hills such as are in wild heaths to be set some with wild thyme some with pinks some with germander that gives a good flower to the eye some with periwinkle some with violets some with strawberries some with cowslips some with daisies some with red roses some with lilium convallium some with sweet williams red some with bear s foot and the like low flowers being withal sweet and sightly Part of which heaps are to be with standards of little bushes pricked upon their top and part without The standards to be roses juniper holly berberries but here and there because of the smell of their blossoms red currants gooseberries rosemary bays sweetbriar and such like But these standards to be kept with cutting that they grow not out of course For the side grounds you are to fill them with variety of alleys private to give a full shade some of them wheresoever the sun be You are to frame some of them likewise for shelter that when the wind blows sharp you may walk as in a gallery And those alleys must be likewise hedged at both ends to keep out the wind and these closer alleys must be ever finely gravelled and no grass because of going wet In many of these alleys likewise you are to set fruit trees of all sorts as well upon the walls as in ranges And this would be generally observed that the borders wherein you plant your fruit trees be fair and large and low and not steep and set with fine flowers but thin and sparingly lest they deceive the trees At the end of both the side grounds I would have a mount of some pretty height leaving the wall of the enclosure breast high to look abroad into the fields For the main garden I do not deny but there should be some fair alleys ranged on both sides with fruit trees and some pretty tufts of fruit trees and arbors with seats set in some decent order but these to be by no means set too thick but to leave the main garden so as it be not close but the air open and free For as for shade I would have you rest upon the alleys of the side grounds there to walk if you be disposed in the heat of the year or day but to make account that the main garden is for the more temperate parts of the year and in the heat of summer for the morning and the evening or overcast days For aviaries I like them not except they be of that largeness as they may be turfed and have living plants and bushes set in them that the birds may have more scope and natural nesting and that no foulness appear in the floor of the aviary So I have made a platform of a princely garden partly by precept partly by drawing not a model but some general lines of it and in this I have spared for no cost But it is nothing for great princes that for the most part taking advice with workmen with no less cost set their things together and sometimes add statuas and such things for state and magnificence but nothing to the true pleasure of a garden Of Negotiating IT IS generally better to deal by speech than by letter and by the mediation of a third than by a man s self Letters are good when a man would draw an answer by letter back again or when it may serve for a man s justification afterwards to produce his own letter or where it may be danger to be interrupted or heard by pieces To deal in person is good when a man s face breedeth regard as commonly with inferiors or in tender cases where a man s eye upon the countenance of him with whom he speaketh may give him a direction how far to go and generally where a man will reserve to himself liberty either to disavow or to expound In choice of instruments it is better to choose men of a plainer sort that are like to do that that is committed to them and to report back again faithfully the success than those that are cunning to contrive out of other men s business somewhat to grace themselves and will help the matter in report for satisfaction s sake Use also such persons as affect the business wherein they are employed for that quickeneth much and such as are fit for the matter as bold men for expostulation fair spoken men for persuasion crafty men for inquiry and observation froward and absurd men for business that doth not well bear out itself Use also such as have been lucky and prevailed before in things wherein you have employed them for that breeds confidence and they will strive to maintain their prescription It is better to sound a person with whom one deals afar off than to fall upon the point at first except you mean to surprise him by some short question It is better dealing with men in appetite than with those that are where they would be If a man deal with another upon conditions the start or first performance is all which a man cannot reasonably demand except either the nature of the thing be such which must go before or else a man can persuade the other party that he shall still need him in some other thing or else that he be counted the honester man All practice is to discover or to work Men discover themselves in trust in passion at unawares and of necessity when they would have somewhat done and cannot find an apt pretext If you would work any man you must either know his nature and fashions and so lead him or his ends and so persuade him or his weakness and disadvantages and so awe him or those that have interest in him and so govern him In dealing with cunning persons we must ever consider their ends to interpret their speeches and it is good to say little to them and that which they least look for In all negotiations of difficulty a man may not look to sow and reap at once but must prepare business and so ripen it by degrees Of Followers And Friends COSTLY followers are not to be liked lest while a man maketh his train longer he make his wings shorter I reckon to be costly not them alone which charge the purse but which are wearisome and importune in suits Ordinary followers ought to challenge no higher conditions than countenance recommendation and protection from wrongs Factious followers are worse to be liked which follow not upon affection to him with whom they range themselves but upon discontentment conceived against some other whereupon commonly ensueth that ill intelligence that we many times see between great personages Likewise glorious followers who make themselves as trumpets of the commendation of those they follow are full of inconvenience for they taint business through want of secrecy and they export honor from a man and make him a return in envy There is a kind of followers likewise which are dangerous being indeed espials which inquire the secrets of the house and bear tales of them to others Yet such men many times are in great favor for they are officious and commonly exchange tales The following by certain estates of men answerable to that which a great person himself professeth as of soldiers to him that hath been employed in the wars and the like hath ever been a thing civil and well taken even in monarchies so it be without too much pomp or popularity But the most honorable kind of following is to be followed as one that apprehendeth to advance virtue and desert in all sorts of persons And yet where there is no eminent odds in sufficiency it is better to take with the more passable than with the more able And besides to speak truth in base times active men are of more use than virtuous It is true that in government it is good to use men of one rank equally for to countenance some extraordinarily is to make them insolent and the rest discontent because they may claim a due But contrariwise in favor to use men with much difference and election is good for it maketh the persons preferred more thankful and the rest more officious because all is of favor It is good discretion not to make too much of any man at the first because one cannot hold out that proportion To be governed as we call it by one is not safe for it shows softness and gives a freedom to scandal and disreputation for those that would not censure or speak ill of a man immediately will talk more boldly of those that are so great with them and thereby wound their honor Yet to be distracted with many is worse for it makes men to be of the last impression and full of change To take advice of some few friends is ever honorable for lookers on many times see more than gamesters and the vale best discovereth the hill There is little friendship in the world and least of all between equals which was wont to be magnified That that is is between superior and inferior whose fortunes may comprehend the one the other Of Suitors MANY ill matters and projects are undertaken and private suits do putrefy the public good Many good matters are undertaken with bad minds I mean not only corrupt minds but crafty minds that intend not performance Some embrace suits which never mean to deal effectually in them but if they see there may be life in the matter by some other mean they will be content to win a thank or take a second reward or at least to make use in the meantime of the suitor s hopes Some take hold of suits only for an occasion to cross some other or to make an information whereof they could not otherwise have apt pretext without care what become of the suit when that turn is served or generally to make other men s business a kind of entertainment to bring in their own Nay some undertake suits with a full purpose to let them fall to the end to gratify the adverse party or competitor Surely there is in some sort a right in every suit either a right of equity if it be a suit of controversy or a right of desert if it be a suit of petition If affection lead a man to favor the wrong side in justice let him rather use his countenance to compound the matter than to carry it If affection lead a man to favor the less worthy in desert let him do it without depraving or disabling the better deserver In suits which a man doth not well understand it is good to refer them to some friend of trust and judgment that may report whether he may deal in them with honor but let him choose well his referendaries for else he may be led by the nose Suitors are so distasted with delays and abuses that plain dealing in denying to deal in suits at first and reporting the success barely and in challenging no more thanks than one hath deserved is grown not only honorable but also gracious In suits of favor the first coming ought to take little place so far forth consideration may be had of his trust that if intelligence of the matter could not otherwise have been had but by him advantage be not taken of the note but the party left to his other means and in some sort recompensed for his discovery To be ignorant of the value of a suit is simplicity as well as to be ignorant of the right thereof is want of conscience Secrecy in suits is a great mean of obtaining for voicing them to be in forwardness may discourage some kind of suitors but doth quicken and awake others But timing of the suit is the principal Timing I say not only in respect of the person that should grant it but in respect of those which are like to cross it Let a man in the choice of his mean rather choose the fittest mean than the greatest mean and rather them that deal in certain things than those that are general The reparation of a denial is sometimes equal to the first grant if a man show himself neither dejected nor discontented Iniquum petas ut aequum feras is a good rule where a man hath strength of favor but otherwise a man were better rise in his suit for he that would have ventured at first to have lost the suitor will not in the conclusion lose both the suitor and his own former favor Nothing is thought so easy a request to a great person as his letter and yet if it be not in a good cause it is so much out of his reputation There are no worse instruments than these general contrivers of suits for they are but a kind of poison and infection to public proceedings Of Studies STUDIES serve for delight for ornament and for ability Their chief use for delight is in privateness and retiring for ornament is in discourse and for ability is in the judgment and disposition of business For expert men can execute and perhaps judge of particulars one by one but the general counsels and the plots and marshalling of affairs come best from those that are learned To spend too much time in studies is sloth to use them too much for ornament is affectation to make judgment wholly by their rules is the humor of a scholar They perfect nature and are perfected by experience for natural abilities are like natural plants that need proyning by study and studies themselves do give forth directions too much at large except they be bounded in by experience Crafty men contemn studies simple men admire them and wise men use them for they teach not their own use but that is a wisdom without them and above them won by observation Read not to contradict and confute nor to believe and take for granted nor to find talk and discourse but to weigh and consider Some books are to be tasted others to be swallowed and some few to be chewed and digested that is some books are to be read only in parts others to be read but not curiously and some few to be read wholly and with diligence and attention Some books also may be read by deputy and extracts made of them by others but that would be only in the less important arguments and the meaner sort of books else distilled books are like common distilled waters flashy things Reading maketh a full man conference a ready man and writing an exact man And therefore if a man write little he had need have a great memory if he confer little he had need have a present wit and if he read little he had need have much cunning to seem to know that he doth not Histories make men wise poets witty the mathematics subtile natural philosophy deep moral grave logic and rhetoric able to contend Abeunt studia in mores Nay there is no stond or impediment in the wit but may be wrought out by fit studies like as diseases of the body may have appropriate exercises Bowling is good for the stone and reins shooting for the lungs and breast gentle walking for the stomach riding for the head and the like So if a man s wit be wandering let him study the mathematics for in demonstrations if his wit be called away never so little he must begin again If his wit be not apt to distinguish or find differences let him study the Schoolmen for they are cymini sectores If he be not apt to beat over matters and to call up one thing to prove and illustrate another let him study the lawyers cases So every defect of the mind may have a special receipt Of Faction MANY have an opinion not wise that for a prince to govern his estate or for a great person to govern his proceedings according to the respect of factions is a principal part of policy whereas contrariwise the chiefest wisdom is either in ordering those things which are general and wherein men of several factions do nevertheless agree or in dealing with correspondence to particular persons one by one But I say not that the considerations of factions is to be neglected Mean men in their rising must adhere but great men that have strength in themselves were better to maintain themselves indifferent and neutral Yet even in beginners to adhere so moderately as he be a man of the one faction which is most passable with the other commonly giveth best way The lower and weaker faction is the firmer in conjunction and it is often seen that a few that are stiff do tire out a greater number that are more moderate When one of the factions is extinguished the remaining subdivideth as the faction between Lucullus and the rest of the nobles of the senate which they called Optimates held out awhile against the faction of Pompey and Caesar but when the senate s authority was pulled down Caesar and Pompey soon after brake The faction or party of Antonius and Octavianus Caesar against Brutus and Cassius held out likewise for a time but when Brutus and Cassius were overthrown then soon after Antonius and Octavianus brake and subdivided These examples are of wars but the same holdeth in private factions And therefore those that are seconds in factions do many times when the faction subdivideth prove principals but many times also they prove ciphers and cashiered for many a man s strength is in opposition and when that faileth he groweth out of use It is commonly seen that men once placed take in with the contrary faction to that by which they enter thinking belike that they have the first sure and now are ready for a new purchase The traitor in faction lightly goeth away with it for when matters have stuck long in balancing the winning of some one man casteth them and he getteth all the thanks The even carriage between two factions proceedeth not always of moderation but of a trueness to a man s self with end to make use of both Certainly in Italy they hold it a little suspect in popes when they have often in their mouth Padre commune and take it to be a sign of one that meaneth to refer all to the greatness of his own house Kings had need beware how they side themselves and make themselves as of a faction or party for leagues within the state are ever pernicious to monarchies for they raise an obligation paramount to obligation of sovereignty and make the king tanquam unus ex nobis as was to be seen in the League of France When factions are carried too high and too violently it is a sign of weakness in princes and much to the prejudice both of their authority and business The motions of factions under kings ought to be like the motions as the astronomers speak of the inferior orbs which may have their proper motions but yet still are quietly carried by the higher motion of primum mobile Of Ceremonies And Respects HE THAT is only real had need have exceeding great parts of virtue as the stone had need to be rich that is set without foil But if a man mark it well it is in praise and commendation of men as it is in gettings and gains for the proverb is true That light gains make heavy purses for light gains come thick whereas great come but now and then So it is true that small matters win great commendation because they are continually in use and in note whereas the occasion of any great virtue cometh but on festivals Therefore it doth much add to a man s reputation and is as Queen Isabella said like perpetual letters commendatory to have good forms To attain them it almost sufficeth not to despise them for so shall a man observe them in others and let him trust himself with the rest For if he labor too much to express them he shall lose their grace which is to be natural and unaffected Some men s behavior is like a verse wherein every syllable is measured how can a man comprehend great matters that breaketh his mind too much to small observations Not to use ceremonies at all is to teach others not to use them again and so diminisheth respect to himself especially they be not to be omitted to strangers and formal natures but the dwelling upon them and exalting them above the moon is not only tedious but doth diminish the faith and credit of him that speaks And certainly there is a kind of conveying of effectual and imprinting passages amongst compliments which is of singular use if a man can hit upon it Amongst a man s peers a man shall be sure of familiarity and therefore it is good a little to keep state Amongst a man s inferiors one shall be sure of reverence and therefore it is good a little to be familiar He that is too much in anything so that he giveth another occasion of satiety maketh himself cheap To apply one s self to others is good so it be with demonstration that a man doth it upon regard and not upon facility It is a good precept generally in seconding another yet to add somewhat of one s own as if you will grant his opinion let it be with some distinction if you will follow his motion let it be with condition if you allow his counsel let it be with alleging further reason Men had need beware how they be too perfect in compliments for be they never so sufficient otherwise their enviers will be sure to give them that attribute to the disadvantage of their greater virtues It is loss also in business to be too full of respects or to be curious in observing times and opportunities Solomon saith He that considereth the wind shall not sow and he that looketh to the clouds shall not reap A wise man will make more opportunities than he finds Men s behavior should be like their apparel not too strait or point device but free for exercise or motion Of Praise PRAISE is the reflection of virtue but it is as the glass or body which giveth the reflection If it be from the common people it is commonly false and naught and rather followeth vain persons than virtuous For the common people understand not many excellent virtues The lowest virtues draw praise from them the middle virtues work in them astonishment or admiration but of the highest virtues they have no sense of perceiving at all But shows and species virtutibus similes serve best with them Certainly fame is like a river that beareth up things light and swoln and drowns things weighty and solid But if persons of quality and judgment concur then it is as the Scripture saith nomen bonum instar unguenti fragrantis It fireth all round about and will not easily away For the odors of ointments are more durable than those of flowers There be so many false points of praise that a man may justly hold it a suspect Some praises proceed merely of flattery and if he be an ordinary flatterer he will have certain common attributes which may serve every man if he be a cunning flatterer he will follow the archflatterer which is a man s self and wherein a man thinketh best of himself therein the flatterer will uphold him most but if he be an impudent flatterer look wherein a man is conscious to himself that he is most defective and is most out of countenance in himself that will the flatterer entitle him to perforce spreta conscientia Some praises come of good wishes and respects which is a form due in civility to kings and great persons laudando praecipere when by telling men what they are they represent to them what they should be Some men are praised maliciously to their hurt thereby to stir envy and jealousy towards them pessimum genus inimicorum laudantium insomuch as it was a proverb amongst the Grecians that he that was praised to his hurt should have a push rise upon his nose as we say that a blister will rise upon one s tongue that tells a lie Certainly moderate praise used with opportunity and not vulgar is that which doth the good Solomon saith He that praiseth his friend aloud rising early it shall be to him no better than a curse Too much magnifying of man or matter doth irritate contradiction and procure envy and scorn To praise a man s self cannot be decent except it be in rare cases but to praise a man s office or profession he may do it with good grace and with a kind of magnanimity The cardinals of Rome which are theologues and friars and Schoolmen have a phrase of notable contempt and scorn towards civil business for they call all temporal business of wars embassages judicature and other employments sbirrerie which is under sheriffries as if they were but matters for under sheriffs and catchpoles though many times those under sheriffries do more good than their high speculations saint Paul when he boasts of himself he doth oft interlace I speak like a fool but speaking of his calling he saith magnificabo apostolatum meum Of Vain glory IT WAS prettily devised of AEsop The fly sat upon the axle tree of the chariot wheel and said What a dust do I raise So are there some vain persons that whatsoever goeth alone or moveth upon greater means if they have never so little hand in it they think it is they that carry it They that are glorious must needs be factious for all bravery stands upon comparisons They must needs be violent to make good their own vaunts Neither can they be secret and therefore not effectual but according to the French proverb Beaucoup de bruit peu de fruit Much bruit little fruit Yet certainly there is use of this quality in civil affairs Where there is an opinion and fame to be created either of virtue or greatness these men are good trumpeters Again as Titus Livius noteth in the case of Antiochus and the AEtolians There are sometimes great effects of cross lies as if a man that negotiates between two princes to draw them to join in a war against the third doth extol the forces of either of them above measure the one to the other and sometimes he that deals between man and man raiseth his own credit with both by pretending greater interest than he hath in either And in these and the like kinds it often falls out that somewhat is produced of nothing for lies are sufficient to breed opinion and opinion brings on substance In militar commanders and soldiers vain glory is an essential point for as iron sharpens iron so by glory one courage sharpeneth another In cases of great enterprise upon charge and adventure a composition of glorious natures doth put life into business and those that are of solid and sober natures have more of the ballast than of the sail In fame of learning the flight will be slow without some feathers of ostentation Qui de contemnenda gloria libros scribunt nomen suum inscribunt Socrates Aristotle Galen were men full of ostentation Certainly vain glory helpeth to perpetuate a man s memory and virtue was never so beholding to human nature as it received his due at the second hand Neither had the fame of Cicero Seneca Plinius Secundus borne her age so well if it had not been joined with some vanity in themselves like unto varnish that makes ceilings not only shine but last But all this while when I speak of vain glory I mean not of that property that Tacitus doth attribute to Mucianus Omnium quae dixerat feceratque arte quadam ostentator for that proceeds not of vanity but of natural magnanimity and discretion and in some persons is not only comely but gracious For excusations cessions modesty itself well governed are but arts of ostentation And amongst those arts there is none better than that which Plinius Secundus speaketh of which is to be liberal of praise and commendation to others in that wherein a man s self hath any perfection For saith Pliny very wittily In commending another you do yourself right for he that you commend is either superior to you in that you commend or inferior If he be inferior if he be to be commended you much more if he be superior if he be not to be commended you much less Glorious men are the scorn of wise men the admiration of fools the idols of parasites and the slaves of their own vaunts Of Honor And Reputation THE winning of honor is but the revealing of a man s virtue and worth without disadvantage For some in their actions do woo and effect honor and reputation which sort of men are commonly much talked of but inwardly little admired And some contrariwise darken their virtue in the show of it so as they be undervalued in opinion If a man perform that which hath not been attempted before or attempted and given over or hath been achieved but not with so good circumstance he shall purchase more honor than by effecting a matter of greater difficulty or virtue wherein he is but a follower If a man so temper his actions as in some one of them he doth content every faction or combination of people the music will be the fuller A man is an ill husband of his honor that entereth into any action the failing wherein may disgrace him more than the carrying of it through can honor him Honor that is gained and broken upon another hath the quickest reflection like diamonds cut with facets And therefore let a man contend to excel any competitors of his in honor in outshooting them if he can in their own bow Discreet followers and servants help much to reputation Omnis fama a domesticis emanat Envy which is the canker of honor is best extinguished by declaring a man s self in his ends rather to seek merit than fame and by attributing a man s successes rather to divine Providence and felicity than to his own virtue or policy The true marshalling of the degrees of sovereign honor are these In the first place are conditores imperiorum founders of states and commonwealths such as were Romulus Cyrus Caesar Ottoman Ismael In the second place are legislatores lawgivers which are also called second founders or perpetui principes because they govern by their ordinances after they are gone such were Lycurgus Solon Justinian Eadgar Alphonsus of Castile the Wise that made the Siete Partidas In the third place are liberatores or salvatores such as compound the long miseries of civil wars or deliver their countries from servitude of strangers or tyrants as Augustus Caesar Vespasianus Aurelianus Theodoricus King Henry the Seventh of England King Henry the Fourth of France In the fourth place are propagatores or propugnatores imperii such as in honorable wars enlarge their territories or make noble defence against invaders And in the last place are patres patriae which reign justly and make the times good wherein they live Both which last kinds need no examples they are in such number Degrees of honor in subjects are first participes curarum those upon whom princes do discharge the greatest weight of their affairs their right hands as we call them The next are duces belli great leaders in war such as are princes lieutenants and do them notable services in the wars The third are gratiosi favorites such as exceed not this scantling to be solace to the sovereign and harmless to the people And the fourth negotiis pares such as have great places under princes and execute their places with sufficiency There is an honor likewise which may be ranked amongst the greatest which happeneth rarely that is of such as sacrifice themselves to death or danger for the good of their country as was M Regulus and the two Decii Of Judicature JUDGES ought to remember that their office is jus dicere and not jus dare to interpret law and not to make law or give law Else will it be like the authority claimed by the Church of Rome which under pretext of exposition of Scripture doth not stick to add and alter and to pronounce that which they do not find and by show of antiquity to introduce novelty Judges ought to be more learned than witty more reverend than plausible and more advised than confident Above all things integrity is their portion and proper virtue Cursed saith the law is he that removeth the landmark The mislayer of a mere stone is to blame But it is the unjust judge that is the capital remover of landmarks when he defineth amiss of lands and property One foul sentence doth more hurt than many foul examples For these do but corrupt the stream the other corrupteth the fountain So with Solomon Fons turbatus et vena corrupta est justus cadens in causa sua coram adversario The office of judges may have reference unto the parties that use unto the advocates that plead unto the clerks and ministers of justice underneath them and to the sovereign or state above them First for the causes or parties that sue There be saith the Scripture that turn judgment into wormwood and surely there be also that turn it into vinegar for injustice maketh it bitter and delays make it sour The principal duty of a judge is to suppress force and fraud whereof force is the more pernicious when it is open and fraud when it is close and disguised Add thereto contentious suits which ought to be spewed out as the surfeit of courts A judge ought to prepare his way to a just sentence as God useth to prepare his way by raising valleys and taking down hills so when there appeareth on either side an high hand violent prosecution cunning advantages taken combination power great counsel then is the virtue of a judge seen to make inequality equal that he may plant his judgment as upon an even ground Qui fortiter emungit elicit sanguinem and where the wine press is hard wrought it yields a harsh wine that tastes of the grape stone Judges must beware of hard constructions and strained inferences for there is no worse torture than the torture of laws Specially in case of laws penal they ought to have care that that which was meant for terror be not turned into rigor and that they bring not upon the people that shower whereof the Scripture speaketh Pluet super eos laqueos for penal laws pressed are a shower of snares upon the people Therefore let penal laws if they have been sleepers of long or if they be grown unfit for the present time be by wise judges confined in the execution Judicis officium est ut res ita tempora rerum et cetera In causes of life and death judges ought as far as the law permitteth in justice to remember mercy and to cast a severe eye upon the example but a merciful eye upon the person Secondly for the advocates and counsel that plead Patience and gravity of hearing is an essential part of justice and an overspeaking judge is no well tuned cymbal It is no grace to a judge first to find that which he might have heard in due time from the bar or to show quickness of conceit in cutting off evidence or counsel too short or to prevent information by questions though pertinent The parts of a judge in hearing are four to direct the evidence to moderate length repetition or impertinency of speech to recapitulate select and collate the material points of that which hath been said and to give the rule or sentence Whatsoever is above these is too much and proceedeth either of glory and willingness to speak or of impatience to hear or of shortness of memory or of want of a staid and equal attention It is a strange thing to see that the boldness of advocates should prevail with judges whereas they should imitate God in whose seat they sit who represseth the presumptuous and giveth grace to the modest But it is more strange that judges should have noted favorites which cannot but cause multiplication of fees and suspicion of by ways There is due from the judge to the advocate some commendation and gracing where causes are well handled and fair pleaded especially towards the side which obtaineth not for that upholds in the client the reputation of his counsel and beats down in him the conceit of his cause There is likewise due to the public a civil reprehension of advocates where there appeareth cunning counsel gross neglect slight information indiscreet pressing or an overbold defence And let not the counsel at the bar chop with the judge nor wind himself into the handling of the cause anew after the judge hath declared his sentence but on the other side let not the judge meet the cause half way nor give occasion to the party to say his counsel or proofs were not heard Thirdly for that that concerns clerks and ministers The place of justice is an hallowed place and therefore not only the bench but the foot place and precincts and purprise thereof ought to be preserved without scandal and corruption For certainly grapes as the Scripture saith will not be gathered of thorns or thistles neither can justice yield her fruit with sweetness amongst the briars and brambles of catching and polling clerks and ministers The attendance of courts is subject to four bad instruments First certain persons that are sowers of suits which make the court swell and the country pine The second sort is of those that engage courts in quarrels of jurisdiction and are not truly amici curiae but parasiti curiae in puffing a court up beyond her bounds for their own scraps and advantage The third sort is of those that may be accounted the left hands of courts persons that are full of nimble and sinister tricks and shifts whereby they pervert the plain and direct courses of courts and bring justice into oblique lines and labyrinths And the fourth is the poller and exacter of fees which justifies the common resemblance of the courts of justice to the bush whereunto while the sheep flies for defence in weather he is sure to lose part of his fleece On the other side an ancient clerk skilful in precedents wary in proceeding and understanding in the business of the court is an excellent finger of a court and doth many times point the way to the judge himself Fourthly for that which may concern the sovereign and estate Judges ought above all to remember the conclusion of the Roman Twelve Tables Salus populi suprema lex and to know that laws except they be in order to that end are but things captious and oracles not well inspired Therefore it is an happy thing in a state when kings and states do often consult with judges and again when judges do often consult with the king and state the one when there is matter of law intervenient in business of state the other when there is some consideration of state intervenient in matter of law For many times the things deduced to judgment may be meum and tuum when the reason and consequence thereof may trench to point of estate I call matter of estate not only the parts of sovereignty but whatsoever introduceth any great alteration or dangerous precedent or concerneth manifestly any great portion of people And let no man weakly conceive that just laws and true policy have any antipathy for they are like the spirits and sinews that one moves with the other Let judges also remember that Solomon s throne was supported by lions on both sides let them be lions but yet lions under the throne being circumspect that they do not check or oppose any points of sovereignty Let not judges also be ignorant of their own right as to think there is not left to them as a principal part of their office a wise use and application of laws For they may remember what the apostle saith of a greater law than theirs Nos scimus quia lex bona est modo quis ea utatur legitime Of Anger TO SEEK to extinguish anger utterly is but a bravery of the Stoics We have better oracles Be angry but sin not Let not the sun go down upon your anger Anger must be limited and confined both in race and in time We will first speak how the natural inclination and habit to be angry may be attempted and calmed Secondly how the particular motions of anger may be repressed or at least refrained from doing mischief Thirdly how to raise anger or appease anger in another For the first there is no other way but to meditate and ruminate well upon the effects of anger how it troubles man s life And the best time to do this is to look back upon anger when the fit is thoroughly over Seneca saith well That anger is like ruin which breaks itself upon that it falls The Scripture exhorteth us to possess our souls in patience Whosoever is out of patience is out of possession of his soul Men must not turn bees animasque in vulnere ponunt Anger is certainly a kind of baseness as it appears well in the weakness of those subjects in whom it reigns children women old folks sick folks Only men must beware that they carry their anger rather with scorn than with fear so that they may seem rather to be above the injury than below it which is a thing easily done if a man will give law to himself in it For the second point the causes and motives of anger are chiefly three First to be too sensible of hurt for no man is angry that feels not himself hurt and therefore tender and delicate persons must needs be oft angry they have so many things to trouble them which more robust natures have little sense of The next is the apprehension and construction of the injury offered to be in the circumstances thereof full of contempt for contempt is that which putteth an edge upon anger as much or more than the hurt itself And therefore when men are ingenious in picking out circumstances of contempt they do kindle their anger much Lastly opinion of the touch of a man s reputation doth multiply and sharpen anger Wherein the remedy is that a man should have as Consalvo was wont to say telam honoris crassiorem But in all refrainings of anger it is the best remedy to win time and to make a man s self believe that the opportunity of his revenge is not yet come but that he foresees a time for it and so to still himself in the meantime and reserve it To contain anger from mischief though it take hold of a man there be two things whereof you must have special caution The one of extreme bitterness of words especially if they be aculeate and proper for cummunia maledicta are nothing so much and again that in anger a man reveal no secrets for that makes him not fit for society The other that you do not peremptorily break off in any business in a fit of anger but howsoever you show bitterness do not act anything that is not revocable For raising and appeasing anger in another it is done chiefly by choosing of times when men are frowardest and worst disposed to incense them Again by gathering as was touched before all that you can find out to aggravate the contempt And the two remedies are by the contraries The former to take good times when first to relate to a man an angry business for the first impression is much and the other is to sever as much as may be the construction of the injury from the point of contempt imputing it to misunderstanding fear passion or what you will Of Vicissitude Of Things SOLOMON saith There is no new thing upon the earth So that as Plato had an imagination That all knowledge was but remembrance so Solomon giveth his sentence That all novelty is but oblivion Whereby you may see that the river of Lethe runneth as well above ground as below There is an abstruse astrologer that saith If it were not for two things that are constant the one is that the fixed stars ever stand a like distance one from another and never come nearer together nor go further asunder the other that the diurnal motion perpetually keepeth time no individual would last one moment Certain it is that the matter is in a perpetual flux and never at a stay The great winding sheets that bury all things in oblivion are two deluges and earthquakes As for conflagrations and great droughts they do not merely dispeople and destroy Phaeton s car went but a day And the three years drought in the time of Elias was but particular and left people alive As for the great burnings by lightnings which are often in the West Indies they are but narrow But in the other two destructions by deluge and earthquake it is further to be noted that the remnant of people which hap to be reserved are commonly ignorant and mountainous people that can give no account of the time past so that the oblivion is all one as if none had been left If you consider well of the people of the West Indies it is very probable that they are a newer or a younger people than the people of the Old World And it is much more likely that the destruction that hath heretofore been there was not by earthquakes as the Egyptian priest told Solon concerning the island of Atlantis that it was swallowed by an earthquake but rather that it was desolated by a particular deluge For earthquakes are seldom in those parts But on the other side they have such pouring rivers as the rivers of Asia and Africk and Europe are but brooks to them Their Andes likewise or mountains are far higher than those with us whereby it seems that the remnants of generation of men were in such a particular deluge saved As for the observation that Machiavel hath that the jealousy of sects doth much extinguish the memory of things traducing Gregory the Great that he did what in him lay to extinguish all heathen antiquities I do not find that those zeals do any great effects nor last long as it appeared in the succession of Sabinian who did revive the former antiquities The vicissitude of mutations in the superior globe are no fit matter for this present argument It may be Plato s great year if the world should last so long would have some effect not in renewing the state of like individuals for that is the fume of those that conceive the celestial bodies have more accurate influences upon these things below than indeed they have but in gross Comets out of question have likewise power and effect over the gross and mass of things but they are rather gazed upon and waited upon in their journey than wisely observed in their effects specially in their respective effects that is what kind of comet for magnitude color version of the beams placing in the reign of heaven or lasting produceth what kind of effects There is a toy which I have heard and I would not have it given over but waited upon a little They say it is observed in the Low Countries I know not in what part that every five and thirty years the same kind and suit of years and weathers come about again as great frosts great wet great droughts warm winters summers with little heat and the like and they call it the Prime It is a thing I do the rather mention because computing backwards I have found some concurrence But to leave these points of nature and to come to men The greatest vicissitude of things amongst men is the vicissitude of sects and religions For those orbs rule in men s minds most The true religion is built upon the rock the rest are tossed upon the waves of time To speak therefore of the causes of new sects and to give some counsel concerning them as far as the weakness of human judgment can give stay to so great revolutions When the religion formerly received is rent by discords and when the holiness of the professors of religion is decayed and full of scandal and withal the times be stupid ignorant and barbarous you may doubt the springing up of a new sect if then also there should arise any extravagant and strange spirit to make himself author thereof All which points held when Mahomet published his law If a new sect have not two properties fear it not for it will not spread The one is the supplanting or the opposing of authority established for nothing is more popular than that The other is the giving license to pleasures and a voluptuous life For as for speculative heresies such as were in ancient times the Arians and now the Arminians though they work mightily upon men s wits yet they do not produce any great alterations in states except it be by the help of civil occasions There be three manner of plantations of new sects By the power of signs and miracles by the eloquence and wisdom of speech and persuasion and by the sword For martyrdoms I reckon them amongst miracles because they seem to exceed the strength of human nature and I may do the like of superlative and admirable holiness of life Surely there is no better way to stop the rising of new sects and schisms than to reform abuses to compound the smaller differences to proceed mildly and not with sanguinary persecutions and rather to take off the principal authors by winning and advancing them than to enrage them by violence and bitterness The changes and vicissitude in wars are many but chiefly in three things in the seats or stages of the war in the weapons and in the manner of the conduct Wars in ancient time seemed more to move from east to west for the Persians Assyrians Arabians Tartars which were the invaders were all eastern people It is true the Gauls were western but we read but of two incursions of theirs the one to Gallo Grecia the other to Rome But east and west have no certain points of heaven and no more have the wars either from the east or west any certainty of observation But north and south are fixed and it hath seldom or never been seen that the far southern people have invaded the northern but contrariwise Whereby it is manifest that the northern tract of the world is in nature the more martial region be it in respect of the stars of that hemisphere or of the great continents that are upon the north whereas the south part for aught that is known is almost all sea or which is most apparent of the cold of the northern parts which is that which without aid of discipline doth make the bodies hardest and the courages warmest Upon the breaking and shivering of a great state and empire you may be sure to have wars For great empires while they stand do enervate and destroy the forces of the natives which they have subdued resting upon their own protecting forces and then when they fail also all goes to ruin and they become a prey So was it in the decay of the Roman empire and likewise in the empire of Almaigne after Charles the Great every bird taking a feather and were not unlike to befall to Spain if it should break The great accessions and unions of kingdoms do likewise stir up wars for when a state grows to an over power it is like a great flood that will be sure to overflow As it hath been seen in the states of Rome Turkey Spain and others Look when the world hath fewest barbarous peoples but such as commonly will not marry or generate except they know means to live as it is almost everywhere at this day except Tartary there is no danger of inundations of people but when there be great shoals of people which go on to populate without foreseeing means of life and sustentation it is of necessity that once in an age or two they discharge a portion of their people upon other nations which the ancient northern people were wont to do by lot casting lots what part should stay at home and what should seek their fortunes When a warlike state grows soft and effeminate they may be sure of a war For commonly such states are grown rich in the time of their degenerating and so the prey inviteth and their decay in valor encourageth a war As for the weapons it hardly falleth under rule and observation yet we see even they have returns and vicissitudes For certain it is that ordnance was known in the city of the Oxidrakes in India and was that which the Macedonians called thunder and lightning and magic And it is well known that the use of ordnance hath been in China above two thousand years The conditions of weapons and their improvement are First the fetching afar off for that outruns the danger as it is seen in ordnance and muskets Secondly the strength of the percussion wherein likewise ordnance do exceed all arietations and ancient inventions The third is the commodious use of them as that they may serve in all weathers that the carriage may be light and manageable and the like For the conduct of the war at the first men rested extremely upon number they did put the wars likewise upon main force and valor pointing days for pitched fields and so trying it out upon an even match and they were more ignorant in ranging and arraying their battles After they grew to rest upon number rather competent than vast they grew to advantages of place cunning diversions and the like and they grew more skilful in the ordering of their battles In the youth of a state arms do flourish in the middle age of a state learning and then both of them together for a time in the declining age of a state mechanical arts and merchandize Learning hath his infancy when it is but beginning and almost childish then his youth when it is luxuriant and juvenile then his strength of years when it is solid and reduced and lastly his old age when it waxeth dry and exhaust But it is not good to look too long upon these turning wheels of vicissitude lest we become giddy As for the philology of them that is but a circle of tales and therefore not fit for this writing Of Fame THE poets make Fame a monster They describe her in part finely and elegantly and in part gravely and sententiously They say look how many feathers she hath so many eyes she hath underneath so many tongues so many voices she pricks up so many ears This is a flourish There follow excellent parables as that she gathereth strength in going that she goeth upon the ground and yet hideth her head in the clouds that in the daytime she sitteth in a watch tower and flieth most by night that she mingleth things done with things not done and that she is a terror to great cities But that which passeth all the rest is They do recount that the Earth mother of the giants that made war against Jupiter and were by him destroyed thereupon in an anger brought forth Fame For certain it is that rebels figured by the giants and seditious fames and libels are but brothers and sisters masculine and feminine But now if a man can tame this monster and bring her to feed at the hand and govern her and with her fly other ravening fowl and kill them it is somewhat worth But we are infected with the style of the poets To speak now in a sad and serious manner There is not in all the politics a place less handled and more worthy to be handled than this of fame We will therefore speak of these points What are false fames and what are true fames and how they may be best discerned how fames may be sown and raised how they may be spread and multiplied and how they may be checked and laid dead And other things concerning the nature of fame Fame is of that force as there is scarcely any great action wherein it hath not a great part especially in the war Mucianus undid Vitellius by a fame that he scattered that Vitellius had in purpose to remove the legions of Syria into Germany and the legions of Germany into Syria whereupon the legions of Syria were infinitely inflamed Julius Caesar took Pompey unprovided and laid asleep his industry and preparations by a fame that he cunningly gave out Caesar s own soldiers loved him not and being wearied with the wars and laden with the spoils of Gaul would forsake him as soon as he came into Italy Livia settled all things for the succession of her son Tiberius by continual giving out that her husband Augustus was upon recovery and amendment and it is an usual thing with the pashas to conceal the death of the Great Turk from the janizaries and men of war to save the sacking of Constantinople and other towns as their manner is Themistocles made Xerxes king of Persia post apace out of Grecia by giving out that the Grecians had a purpose to break his bridge of ships which he had made athwart Hellespont There be a thousand such like examples and the more they are the less they need to be repeated because a man meeteth with them everywhere Therefore let all wise governors have as great a watch and care over fames as they have of the actions and designs themselves This essay was not
