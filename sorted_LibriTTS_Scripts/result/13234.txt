3157_168062_000014_000000	train-clean-360	She did not look very much as if she were asleep nor acted as though she expected to get a chance to be very soon 
3157_168062_000014_000001	train-clean-360	There was no end to the things which she had to do for the kitchen was long and wide and took many steps to set it in order and it was drawing toward tea time of a Tuesday evening and there were fifteen boarders who were most of them punctual to a minute 
none	none	Sadie the next oldest sister was still at the academy as also were Alfred and Julia while little Minnie the pet and darling most certainly was not She was around in the way putting little fingers into every possible place where little fingers ought not to be It was well for her that no matter how warm and vexed and out of order Ester might be she never reached the point in which her voice could take other than a loving tone in speaking to Minnie for Minnie besides being a precious little blessing in herself was the child of Ester s oldest sister whose home was far away in a Western graveyard and the little girl had been with them since her early babyhood three years before 
3157_168062_000016_000000	train-clean-360	So Ester hurried to and from the pantry with quick nervous movements as the sun went toward the west saying to Maggie who was ironing with all possible speed 
none	none	Maggie do hurry and get ready to help me or I shall never have tea ready Saying it in a sharp fretful tone 
3157_168062_000017_000001	train-clean-360	Then No no Birdie don t touch in quite a different tone to Minnie who laid loving hands on a box of raisins 
none	none	I am hurrying as fast as I can Maggie made answer But such an ironing as I have every week can t be finished in a minute Well well Don t talk that won t hurry matters any 
3157_168062_000020_000000	train-clean-360	Sadie Ried opened the door that led from the dining room to the kitchen and peeped in a thoughtless young head covered with bright brown curls 
3157_168062_000021_000000	train-clean-360	 How are you Ester 
3157_168062_000022_000000	train-clean-360	And she emerged fully into the great warm kitchen looking like a bright flower picked from the garden and put out of place 
3157_168062_000022_000001	train-clean-360	Her pink gingham dress and white ruffled apron yes and the very school books which she swung by their strap waking a smothered sigh in Ester s heart 
3157_168062_000023_000000	train-clean-360	 O my patience was her greeting 
none	none	Are you home 
3157_168062_000024_000001	train-clean-360	Then school is out 
none	none	I guess it is said Sadie
3157_168062_000025_000001	train-clean-360	 We ve been down to the river since school 
3157_168062_000026_000000	train-clean-360	 Sadie won t you come and cut the beef and cake and make the tea 
3157_168062_000026_000001	train-clean-360	I did not know it was so late and I m nearly tired to death 
3157_168062_000027_000000	train-clean-360	Sadie looked sober 
none	none	I would in a minute Ester only I ve brought Florence Vane home with me and I should not know what to do with her in the meantime 
3157_168062_000027_000002	train-clean-360	Besides mister Hammond said he would show me about my algebra if I d go out on the piazza this minute 
none	none	Well go then and tell mister Hammond to wait for his tea until he gets it Ester answered crossly
3157_168062_000029_000000	train-clean-360	 Here Julia to the ten year old newcomer Go away from that raisin box this minute 
3157_168062_000029_000001	train-clean-360	Go up stairs out of my way and Alfred too Sadie take Minnie with you I can t have her here another instant You can afford to do that much perhaps 
3157_168062_000030_000000	train-clean-360	 O Ester you re cross said Sadie in a good humored tone coming forward after the little girl 
3157_168062_000031_000000	train-clean-360	 Come Birdie Auntie Essie s cross isn t she 
none	none	Come with Aunt Sadie We ll go to the piazza and make mister Hammond tell us a story 
3157_168062_000032_000000	train-clean-360	And Minnie Ester s darling who never received other than loving words from her went gleefully off leaving another heartburn to the weary girl 
none	none	They stung her those words Auntie Essie s cross isn t she 
3157_168062_000033_000000	train-clean-360	Back and forth from dining room to pantry from pantry to dining room went the quick feet At last she spoke 
none	none	Maggie leave the ironing and help me it is time tea was ready
3157_168062_000035_000000	train-clean-360	 I m just ironing mister Holland s shirt objected Maggie 
none	none	Well I don t care if mister Holland never has another shirt ironed I want you to go to the spring for water and fill the table pitchers and do a dozen other things 
3157_168062_000037_000000	train-clean-360	The tall clock in the dining room struck five and the dining bell pealed out its prompt summons through the house 
none	none	The family gathered promptly and noisily school girls half a dozen or more mister Hammond the principal of the academy Miss Molten the preceptress missus Brookley the music teacher doctor Van Anden the new physician mister and missus Holland and mister Arnett mister Holland s clerk 
3157_168062_000037_000002	train-clean-360	There was a moment s hush while mister Hammond asked a blessing on the food then the merry talk went on 
none	none	For them all Maggie poured cups of tea and Ester passed bread and butter and beef and cheese and Sadie gave overflowing dishes of blackberries and chattered like a magpie which last she did everywhere and always
3157_168062_000038_000000	train-clean-360	 This has been one of the scorching days mister Holland said 
3157_168062_000038_000001	train-clean-360	 It was as much as I could do to keep cool in the store and we generally ARE well off for a breeze there 
none	none	It has been more than I could do to keep cool anywhere missus Holland answered
3157_168062_000039_000001	train-clean-360	 I gave it up long ago in despair 
3157_168062_000040_000000	train-clean-360	Ester s lip curled a little 
3157_168062_000040_000001	train-clean-360	missus Holland had nothing in the world to do from morning until night but to keep herself cool 
none	none	She wondered what the lady would have said to the glowing kitchen where she had passed most of the day
3157_168062_000041_000000	train-clean-360	 Miss Ester looks as though the heat had been too much for her cheeks missus Brookley said laughing 
none	none	What have you been doing
3157_168062_000042_000000	train-clean-360	 Something besides keeping cool Ester answered soberly 
3157_168062_000043_000000	train-clean-360	 Which is a difficult thing to do however doctor Van Anden said speaking soberly too 
3157_168062_000044_000000	train-clean-360	 I don t know sir if I had nothing to do but that I think I could manage it 
3157_168062_000045_000000	train-clean-360	 I have found trouble sometimes in keeping myself at the right temperature even in January 
3157_168062_000046_000000	train-clean-360	Ester s cheeks glowed yet more 
3157_168062_000046_000001	train-clean-360	She understood doctor Van Anden and she knew her face did not look very self controlled 
3157_168062_000046_000002	train-clean-360	No one knows what prompted Minnie to speak just then 
none	none	Aunt Sadie said Auntie Essie was cross 
3157_168062_000047_000001	train-clean-360	Were you Auntie Essie 
3157_168062_000048_000000	train-clean-360	The household laughed and Sadie came to the rescue 
3157_168062_000049_000000	train-clean-360	 Why Minnie you must not tell what Aunt Sadie says 
none	none	It is just as sure to be nonsense as it is that you are a chatter box Ester thought that they would never all finish their supper and depart but the latest comer strolled away at last and she hurried to toast a slice of bread make a fresh cup of tea and send Julia after missus Ried 
3157_168062_000051_000000	train-clean-360	Sadie hovered around the pale sad faced woman while she ate 
none	none	Are you truly better mother 
3157_168062_000052_000001	train-clean-360	I ve been worried half to pieces about you all day 
3157_168062_000053_000000	train-clean-360	 O yes I m better 
3157_168062_000053_000001	train-clean-360	Ester you look dreadfully tired 
3157_168062_000053_000002	train-clean-360	Have you much more to do 
3157_168062_000054_000000	train-clean-360	 Only to trim the lamps and make three beds that I had not time for this morning and get things ready for breakfast and finish Sadie s dress 
3157_168062_000055_000000	train-clean-360	 Can t Maggie do any of these things 
3157_168062_000056_000000	train-clean-360	 Maggie is ironing 
3157_168062_000057_000000	train-clean-360	missus Ried sighed 
none	none	It is a good thing that I don t have the sick headache very often she said sadly or you would soon wear yourself out 
3157_168062_000057_000002	train-clean-360	Sadie are you going to the lyceum tonight 
3157_168062_000058_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes ma am 
none	none	Your worthy daughter has the honor of being editress you know to night 
3157_168062_000058_000002	train-clean-360	Ester can t you go down 
3157_168062_000058_000003	train-clean-360	Never mind that dress let it go to Guinea 
3157_168062_000059_000000	train-clean-360	 You wouldn t think so by to morrow evening Ester said shortly No I can t go 
3157_168062_000060_000000	train-clean-360	The work was all done at last and Ester betook herself to her room How tired she was 
3157_168062_000060_000001	train-clean-360	Every nerve seemed to quiver with weariness 
3157_168062_000061_000000	train-clean-360	It was a pleasant little room this one which she entered with its low windows looking out toward the river and its cosy furniture all neatly arranged by Sadie s tasteful fingers 
none	none	Ester seated herself by the open window and looked down on the group who lingered on the piazza below looked down on them with her eyes and with her heart yet envied while she looked envied their free and easy life without a care to harass them so she thought envied Sadie her daily attendance at the academy a matter which she so early in life had been obliged to have done with envied missus Holland the very ribbons and laces which fluttered in the evening air It had grown cooler now a strong breeze blew up from the river and freshened the air and as they sat below there enjoying it the sound of their gay voices came up to her What do they know about heat or care or trouble she said scornfully thinking over all the weight of her eighteen years of life she hated it this life of hers just hated it the sweeping dusting making beds trimming lamps working from morning till night no time for reading or study or pleasure Sadie had said she was cross and Sadie had told the truth she was cross most of the time fretted with her every day petty cares and fatigues O she said over and over if something would only happen if I could have one day just one day different from the others but no it s the same old thing sweep and dust and clear up and eat and sleep I hate it all Yet had Ester nothing for which to be thankful that the group on the piazza had not If she had but thought she had a robe and a crown and a harp and a place waiting for her up before the throne of God and all they had not Ester did not think of this so much asleep was she that she did not even know that none of those gay hearts down there below her had been given up to Christ Not one of them for the academy teachers and doctor Van Anden were not among them O Ester was asleep She went to church on the Sabbath and to preparatory lecture on a week day she read a few verses in her Bible frequently not every day she knelt at her bedside every night and said a few words of prayer and this was all She lay at night side by side with a young sister who had no claim to a home in heaven and never spoke to her of Jesus She worked daily side by side with a mother who through many trials and discouragements was living a Christian life and never talked with her of their future rest She met daily sometimes almost hourly a large household and never so much as thought of asking them if they too were going some day home to God She helped her young brother and sister with their geography lessons and never mentioned to them the heavenly country whither they themselves might journey She took the darling of the family often in her arms and told her stories of Bo Peep and the Babes in the Wood and Robin Redbreast and never one of Jesus and his call for the tender lambs This was Ester and this was Ester s home CHAPTER II WHAT SADIE THOUGHT Sadie Ried was the merriest most thoughtless young creature of sixteen years that ever brightened and bothered a home Merry from morning until night with scarcely ever a pause in her constant flow of fun thoughtless nearly always selfish too as the constantly thoughtless always are Not sullenly and crossly selfish by any means only so used to think of self so taught to consider herself utterly useless as regarded home and home cares and duties that she opened her bright brown eyes in wonder whenever she was called upon for help It was a very bright and very busy Saturday morning Sadie missus Ried called can t you come and wash up these baking dishes Maggie is mopping and Ester has her hands full with the cake Yes ma am said Sadie appearing promptly from the dining room with Minnie perched triumphantly on her shoulder Here I am at your service Where are they Ester glanced up I d go and put on my white dress first if I were you she said significantly And Sadie looked down on her pink gingham ruffled apron shining cuffs and laughed O I ll take off my cuffs and put on this distressingly big apron of yours which hangs behind the door then I ll do That s my clean apron I don t wash dishes in it O bless your careful heart I won t hurt it the least speck in the world Will I Birdie And she proceeded to wrap her tiny self in the long wide apron Not that pan child exclaimed her mother That s a milk pan O said Sadie I thought it was pretty shiny My what a great pan Don t you come near me Birdie or you ll tumble in and drown yourself before I could fish you out with the dish cloth Where is that article Ester it needs a patch on it there s a great hole in the middle and it twists every way Patch it then said Ester dryly Well now I m ready here goes Do you want these washed And she seized upon a stack of tins which stood on Ester s table Do let things alone said Ester Those are my baking tins ready for use now you ve got them wet and I shall have to go all over them again How will you go Ester On foot They look pretty greasy you ll slip I wish you would go up stairs I d rather wash dishes all the forenoon than have you in the way Birdie said Sadie gravely you and I musn t go near Auntie Essie again She s a bowwow and I m afraid she ll bite missus Ried laughed She had no idea how sharply Ester had been tried with petty vexations all that morning nor how bitter those words sounded to her Come Sadie she said what a silly child you are Can t you do any thing soberly I should think I might ma am when I have such a sober and solemn employment on hand as dish washing Does it require a great deal of gravity mother Here Robin Redbreast keep your beak out of my dish pan Minnie in the mean time had been seated on the table directly in front of the dish pan missus Ried looked around O Sadie what possessed you to put her up there To keep her out of mischief mother She s Jack Horner s little sister and would have had every plum in your pie down her throat by this time if she could have got to them See here pussy if you don t keep your feet still I ll tie them fast to the pan with this long towel when you ll have to go around all the days of your life with a dish pan clattering after you But Minnie was bent on a frolic This time the tiny feet kicked a little too hard and the pan being drawn too near the edge in order to be out of her reach lost its balance over it went O my patience screamed Sadie as the water splashed over her even down to the white stockings and daintily slippered feet Minnie lifted up her voice and added to the general uproar Ester left the eggs she was beating and picked up broken dishes missus Ried s voice arose above the din Sadie take Minnie and go up stairs You re too full of play to be in the kitchen Mother I m real sorry said Sadie shaking herself out of the great wet apron laughing even then at the plight she was in Pet don t cry We didn t drown after all Well Miss Sadie mister Hammond said as he met them in the hall What have you been up to now Why mister Hammond there s been another deluge this time of dish water and Birdie and I are escaping for our lives If there is one class of people in this world more disagreeable than all the rest it is people who call themselves Christians This remark mister Harry Arnett made that same Saturday evening as he stood on the piazza waiting for missus Holland s letters And he made it to Sadie Ried Why Harry she answered in a shocked tone It s a fact Sadie You just think a bit and you ll see it is They re no better nor pleasanter than other people and all the while they think they re about right What has put you into that state of mind Harry O some things which happened at the store to day suggested this matter to me Never mind that part Isn t it so There s my mother Sadie said thoughtfully She is good Not because she s a Christian though it s because she s your mother You d have to look till you were gray to find a better mother than I ve got and she isn t a Christian either Well I m sure mister Hammond is a good man Not a whit better or pleasanter than mister Holland as far as I can see I don t like him half so well And Holland don t pretend to be any better than the rest of us Well said Sadie gleefully I dont know many good people Miss Molton is a Christian but I guess she is no better than missus Brookley and she isn t There s Ester she s a member of the church And do you see as she gets on any better with her religion than you do without it For my part I think you are considerably pleasanter to deal with Sadie laughed We re no more alike than a bee and a butterfly or any other useless little thing she said brightly But you re very much mistaken if you think I m the best Mother would lie down in despair and die and this house would come to naught at once if it were not for Ester mister Arnett shrugged his shoulders I always liked butterflies better than bees he said Bees sting Harry said Sadie speaking more gravely I m afraid you re almost an infidel If I m not I can tell you one thing it s not the fault of Christians missus Holland tossed her letters down to him from the piazza above and mister Arnett went away Florence Vane came over from the cottage across the way came with slow feeble steps and sat down in the door beside her friend Presently Ester came out to them Sadie can t you go to the office for me I forgot to send this letter with the rest Yes said Sadie That is if you think you can go that little bit Florence I shall think for her doctor Van Anden said coming down the stairs Florence out here to night with the dew falling and not even any thing to protect your head I am surprised Oh Doctor do let me enjoy this soft air for a few minutes Positively no Either come in the house or go home directly You are very imprudent Miss Ester I ll mail your letters for you What does doctor Van Anden want to act like a simpleton about Florence Vane for Ester asked this question late in the evening when the sisters were alone in their room Sadie paused in her merry chatter Why Ester what do you mean About her being out to night Why you know she ought to be very careful and I m afraid she isn t The doctor told her father this morning he was afraid she would not live through the season unless she was more careful Fudge said Ester He thinks he is a wise man he wants to make her out very sick so that he may have the honor of helping her I don t see as she looks any worse than she did a year ago Sadie turned slowly around toward her sister Ester I don t know what is the matter with you to night You know that Florence Vane has the consumption and you know that she is my dear friend Ester did not know what was the matter with herself save that this had been the hardest day from first to last that she had ever known and she was rasped until there was no good feeling left in her heart to touch Little Minnie had given her the last hardening touch of the day by exclaiming as she was being hugged and kissed with eager passionate kisses Oh Auntie Essie You ve cried tears on my white apron and put out all the starch Ester set her down hastily and went away Certainly Ester was cross and miserable doctor Van Anden was one of her thorns He crossed her path quite often either with close searching words about self control or grave silence She disliked him Sadie as from her pillow she watched her sister in the moonlight kneel down hastily and knew that she was repeating a few words of prayer thought of mister Arnett s words spoken that evening and with her heart throbbing still under the sharp tones concerning Florence sighed a little and said within herself I should not wonder if Harry were right And Ester was so much asleep that she did not know at least did not realize that she had dishonored her Master all that day CHAPTER III FLORENCE VANE Of the same opinion concerning Florence was Ester a few weeks later when one evening as she was hurrying past him doctor Van Anden detained her I want to see you a moment Miss Ester During these weeks Ester had been roused Sadie was sick had been sick enough to awaken many anxious fears sick enough for Ester to discover what a desolate house theirs would have been supposing her merry music had been hushed forever She discovered too how very much she loved her bright young sister She had been very kind and attentive but the fever was gone now and Sadie was well enough to rove around the house again and Ester began to think that it couldn t be so very hard to have loving hands ministering to one s simplest want to be cared for and watched over and petted every hour in the day She was returning to her impatient irritable life She forgot how high the fever had been at night and how the young head had ached and only remembered how thoroughly tired she was watching and ministering day and night So when she followed doctor Van Anden to the sitting room in answer to his I want to see you Miss Ester it was a very sober not altogether pleasant face which listened to his words Florence Vane is very sick to night Some one should be with her besides the housekeeper I thought of you Will you watch with her If any reasonable excuse could have been found Ester would surely have said No so foolish did this seem to her Why only yesterday she had seen Florence sitting beside the open window looking very well but then she was Sadie s friend and it had been more than two weeks since Sadie had needed watching with at night So Ester could not plead fatigue I suppose so she answered slowly to the waiting doctor hearing which he wheeled and left her turning back though to say Do not mention this to Sadie in her present state of body I don t care to have her excited Very careful you are of everybody muttered Ester as he hastened away Tell her what I wonder That you are making much ado about nothing for the sake of showing your astonishing skill In precisely this state of mind she went a few hours later over to the cottage into the quiet room where Florence lay asleep and for aught she could see sleeping as quietly as young fresh life ever did What do you think of her whispered the old lady who acted as housekeeper nurse and mother to the orphaned Florence I think I haven t seen her look better this great while Ester answered abruptly Well I can t say as she looks any worse to me either but doctor Van Anden is in a fidget and I suppose he knows what he s about The doctor came in at eleven o clock stood for a moment by the bedside glanced at the old lady who was dozing in her rocking chair then came over to Ester and spoke low I can t trust the nurse She has been broken of her rest and is weary I want you to keep awake If she nodding toward Florence stirs give her a spoonful from that tumbler on the stand I shall be back at twelve If she wakens you may call her father and send John for me he s in the kitchen I shall be around the corner at Vinton s Then he went away softly as he had come The lamp burned low over by the window the nurse slept on in her arm chair and Ester sat with wide open eyes fixed on Florence And all this time she thought that the doctor was engaged in getting up a scene the story of which should go forth next day in honor of his skill and faithfulness yet having come to watch she would not sleep at her post even though she believed in her heart that were she sleeping by Sadie s side and the doctor quiet in his own room all would go on well until the morning But the doctor s evident anxiety had driven sleep from the eyes of the gray haired old man whose one darling lay quiet on the bed He came in very soon after the doctor had departed I can t sleep he said in explanation to Ester Some way I feel worried Does she seem worse to you Not a bit Ester said promptly I think she looks better than usual Yes mister Vane answered in an encouraged tone and she has been quite bright all day but the doctor is all down about her He won t say a single cheering word Ester s indignation grew upon her He might at least have let this old man sleep in peace she said sharply in her heart At twelve precisely the doctor returned He went directly to the bedside How has she been he asked of Ester in passing Just as she is now Ester s voice was not only dry but sarcastic mister Vane scanned the doctor s face eagerly but it was grave and sad Quiet reigned in the room The two men at Florence s side neither spoke nor stirred Ester kept her seat across from them and grew every moment more sure that she was right and more provoked Suddenly the silence was broken doctor Van Anden bent low over the sleeper and spoke in a gentle anxious tone Florence But she neither stirred nor heeded He spoke again Florence and the blue eyes unclosed slowly and wearily The doctor drew back quickly and motioned her father forward Speak to her mister Vane Florence my darling the old man said with inexpressible love and tenderness sounding in his voice His fair young daughter turned her eyes on him but the words she spoke were not of him or of aught around her So clear and sweet they sounded that Ester sitting quite across the room from her heard them distinctly I saw mother and I saw my Savior doctor Van Anden sank upon his knees as the drooping lids closed again and his voice was low and tremulous Father into thy hands we commit this spirit Thy will be done In a moment more all was bustle and confusion The nurse was thoroughly awakened the doctor cared for the poor childless father with the tenderness of a son then came back to send John for help and to give directions concerning what was to be done Through it all Ester sat motionless petrified with solemn astonishment Then the angel of death had really been there in that very room and she had been so wise in her own conceit that she did not know it until he had departed with the freed spirit Florence really was sick then dangerously sick The doctor had not deceived them had not magnified the trouble as she supposed but it could not be that she was dead Dead Why only a few minutes ago she was sleeping so quietly Well she was very quiet now Could the heart have ceased its beating Sadie s Florence dead Poor Sadie What would they say to her How could they tell her Sitting there Ester had some of the most solemn self reproachful thoughts that she had ever known God s angel had been present in that room and in what a spirit had he found this watcher doctor Van Anden went quietly promptly from room to room until every thing in the suddenly stricken household was as it should be then he came to Ester I will go over home with you now he said speaking low and kindly He seemed to under stand just how shocked she felt They went in the night and darkness across the street saying nothing As the doctor applied his key to the door Ester spoke in low distressed tones Doctor Van Anden I did not think I did not dream Then she stopped I know he said kindly It was unexpected I thought she would linger until morning perhaps through the day Indeed I was so sure that I ventured to keep my worst fears from mister Vane I wanted him to rest to night I am sorry it would have been better to have prepared him but At even or at midnight or at the cock crowing or in the morning you see we know not which I thank God that to Florence it did not matter Those days which followed were days of great opportunity to Ester if she had but known how to use them Sadie s sad softened heart into which grief had entered might have been turned by a few kind skillful words from thoughts of Florence to Florence s Savior Ester did try she was kinder more gentle with the young sister than was her wont to be and once when Sadie was lingering fondly over memories of her friend she said in an awkward blundering way something about Florence having been prepared to die and hoping that Sadie would follow her example Sadie looked surprised but answered gravely I never expect to be like Florence She was perfect or at least I m sure I could never see any thing about her that wasn t perfection You know Ester she never did any thing wrong And Ester unused to it and confused with her own attempt kept silence and let poor Sadie rest upon the thought that it was Florence s goodness which made her ready to die instead of the blood of Jesus So the time passed the grass grew green over Florence s grave and Sadie missed her indeed Yet the serious thoughts grew daily fainter and Ester s golden opportunity for leading her to Christ was lost CHAPTER IV THE SUNDAY LESSON Alfred and Julia Ried were in the sitting room studying their Sabbath school lessons Those two were generally to be found together being twins they had commenced life together and had thus far gone side by side It was a quiet October Sabbath afternoon The twins had a great deal of business on hand during the week and the Sabbath school lesson used to stand a fair chance of being forgotten so missus Ried had made a law that half an hour of every Sabbath afternoon should be spent in studying the lesson for the coming Sabbath Ester sat in the same room by the window she had been reading but her book had fallen idly in her lap and she seemed lost in thought Sadie too was there carrying on a whispered conversation with Minnie who was snugged close in her arms and merry bursts of laughter came every few minutes from the little girl The idea of Sadie keeping quiet herself or of keeping any body else quiet was simply absurd But I say unto you that ye resist not evil but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek turn to him the other also read Julia slowly and thoughtfully Alfred what do you suppose that can mean Don t know I m sure Alfred said The next one is just as queer And if any man will sue thee at the law and take away thy coat let him have thy cloak also I d like to see me doing that I d fight for it I reckon Oh Alfred you wouldn t if the Bible said you mustn t would you I don t suppose this means us at all said Alfred using unconsciously the well known argument of all who have tried to slip away from gospel teaching since Adam s time I suppose it s talking to those wicked old fellows who lived before the flood or some such time Well any how said Julia I should like to know what it all means I wish mother would come home I wonder how missus Vincent is Do you suppose she will die Alfred Don t know just hear this Julia But I say unto you Love your enemies bless them that curse you do good to them that hate you and pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute you Wouldn t you like to see anybody who did all that Sadie said Julia rising suddenly and moving over to where the frolic was going on won t you tell us about our lesson We don t understand a bit about it and I can t learn any thing that I don t understand Bless your heart child I suspect you know more about the Bible this minute than I do Mother was too busy taking care of you two when I was a little chicken to teach me as she has you Well but what can that mean If a man strikes you on one cheek let him strike the other too Yes said Alfred chiming in and If anybody takes your coat away give him your cloak too I suppose it means just that said Sadie If anybody steals your mittens as that Bush girl did yours last winter Julia you are to take your hood right off and give it to her Oh Sadie you don t ever mean that And then continued Sadie gravely if that shouldn t satisfy her you had better take off your shoes and stockings and give her them Sadie said Ester how can you teach those children such nonsense She isn t teaching me any thing interrupted Alfred I guess I ain t such a dunce as to swallow all that stuff Well said Sadie meekly I m sure I m doing the best I can and you are all finding fault I ve explained to the best of my abilities Julia I ll tell you the truth and for a moment her laughing face grew sober I don t know the least thing about it don t pretend to Why don t you ask Ester She can tell you more about the Bible in a minute I presume than I could in a year Ester laid her book on the window Julia bring your Bible here she said gravely Now what is the matter I never heard you make such a commotion over your lesson Mother always explains it said Alfred and she hasn t got back from missus Vincent s and I don t believe anyone else in this house can do it Alfred said Ester don t be impertinent Julia what is that you want to know About the man being struck on one cheek how he must let them strike the other too What does it mean It means just that when girls are cross and ugly to you you must be good and kind to them and when a boy knocks down another he must forgive him instead of getting angry and knocking back Ho said Alfred contemptuously I never saw the boy yet who would do it That only proves that boys are naughty quarrelsome fellows who don t obey what the Bible teaches But Ester interrupted Julia anxiously was that true what Sadie said about me giving my shoes and stockings and my hood to folks who stole something from me Of course not Sadie shouldn t talk such nonsense to you That is about men going to law Mother will explain it when she goes over the lesson with you Julia was only half satisfied What does that verse mean about doing good to them that Here I ll read it said Alfred But I say unto you Love your enemies bless them that curse you do good to them that hate you and pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute you Why that is plain enough It means just what it says When people are ugly to you and act as though they hated you you must be very good and kind to them and pray for them and love them Ester does God really mean for us to love people who are ugly to us and to be good to them Of course Well then why don t we if God says so Ester why don t you That s the point exclaimed Sadie in her most roguish tone I m glad you ve made the application Julia Now Ester s heart had been softening under the influence of these peaceful Bible words She believed them and in her heart was a real earnest desire to teach her brother and sister Bible truths Left alone she would have explained that those who loved Jesus were struggling in a weak feeble way to obey these directions that she herself was trying trying hard sometimes that they ought to But there was this against Ester her whole life was so at variance with those plain searching Bible rules that the youngest child could not but see it and Sadie s mischievous tones and evident relish of her embarrassment at Julia s question destroyed the self searching thoughts She answered with severe dignity Sadie if I were you I wouldn t try to make the children as irreverent as I was myself Then she went dignifiedly from the room doctor Van Anden paused for a moment before Sadie as she sat alone in the sitting room that same Sabbath evening Sadie said he is there one verse in the Bible which you have never read Plenty of them Doctor I commenced reading the Bible through once but I stopped at some chapter in Numbers the thirtieth I think it is isn t it or somewhere along there where all those hard names are you know But why do you ask The doctor opened a large Bible which lay on the stand before them and read aloud Ye have perverted the words of the living God Sadie looked puzzled Now Doctor what ever possessed you to think that I had never read that verse God counts that a solemn thing Sadie Very likely what then I was reading on the piazza when the children came to you for an explanation of their lesson Sadie laughed Did you hear that conversation Doctor I hope you were benefited Then more gravely doctor Van Anden do you really mean me to think that I was perverting Scripture I certainly think so Sadie Were you not giving the children wrong ideas concerning the teachings of our Savior Sadie was quite sober now I told the truth at last Doctor I don t know any thing about these matters People who profess to be Christians do not live according to our Savior s teaching At least I don t see any who do and it sometimes seems to me that those verses which the children were studying can not mean what they say or Christian people would surely try to follow them For an answer doctor Van Anden turned the Bible leaves again and pointed with his finger to this verse which Sadie read But as he which has called you is holy so be ye holy in all manner of conversation After that he went out of the room And Sadie reading the verse over again could not but understand that she might have a perfect pattern if she would CHAPTER V THE POOR LITTLE FISH Mother said Sadie appearing in the dining room one morning holding Julia by the hand did you ever hear of the fish who fell out of the frying pan into the fire Which question her mother answered by asking without turning her eyes from the great batch of bread which she was molding What mischief are you up to now Sadie Why nothing said Sadie only here is the very fish so renowned in ancient history and I ve brought her for your inspection This answer brought missus Ried s eyes around from the dough and fixed them upon Julia and she said as soon as she caught a glimpse of the forlorn little maiden O my patience A specimen requiring great patience from any one coming in contact with her was this same Julia The pretty blue dress and white apron were covered with great patches of mud morocco boots and neat white stockings were in the same direful plight and down her face the salt and muddy tears were running for her handkerchief was also streaked with mud I should think so laughed Sadie in answer to her mother s exclamation The history of the poor little fish in brief is this She started immaculate in white apron white stockings and the like for the post office with Ester s letter She met with temptation in the shape of a little girl with paper dolls and while admiring them the letter had the meanness to slip out of her hand into the mud That you understand was the frying pan Much horrified with this state of things the two wise young heads were put together and the brilliant idea conceived of giving the muddy letter a thorough washing in the creek So to the creek they went and while they stood ankle deep in the mud vigorously carrying their idea into effect the vicious little thing hopped out of Julia s hand and sailed merrily away down stream So there she was Out of the frying pan into the fire sure enough And the letter has sailed for Uncle Ralph s by a different route than that which is usually taken Sadie s nonsense was interrupted at this point by Ester who had listened with darkening face to the rapidly told story She ought to be thoroughly whipped the careless little goose Mother if you don t punish her now I never would again Then Julia s tearful sorrow blazed into sudden anger I oughtn t to be whipped you re an ugly mean sister to say so I tumbled down and hurt my arm dreadfully trying to catch your old hateful letter and you re just as mean as you can be Between tears and loud tones and Sadie s laughter Julia had managed to burst forth these angry sentences before her mother s voice reached her when it did she was silenced Julia I am astonished Is that the way to speak to your sister Go up to my room directly and when you have put on dry clothes sit down there and stay until you are ready to tell Ester that you are sorry and ask her to forgive you Really mother Sadie said as the little girl went stamping up the stairs her face buried in her muddy handkerchief I m not sure but you have made a mistake and Ester is the one to be sent to her room until she can behave better I don t pretend to be good myself but I must say it seems ridiculous to speak in the way she did to a sorry frightened child I never saw a more woeful figure in my life and Sadie laughed again at the recollection Yes said Ester you uphold her in all sorts of mischief and insolence that is the reason she is so troublesome to manage missus Ried looked distressed Don t Ester she said don t speak in that loud sharp tone Sadie you should not encourage Julia in speaking improperly to her sister I think myself that Ester was hard with her The poor child did not mean any harm but she must not be rude to anybody Oh yes Ester said speaking bitterly of course I am the one to blame I always am No one in this house ever does any thing wrong except me missus Ried sighed heavily and Sadie turned away and ran up stairs humming Oh would I were a buttercup A blossom in the meadow And Julia in her mother s room exchanged her wet and muddy garments for clean ones and cried washed her face in the clear pure water until it was fresh and clean and cried again louder and harder her heart was all bruised and bleeding She had not meant to be careless She had been carefully dressed that morning to spend the long bright Saturday with Vesta Griswold She had intended to go swiftly and safely to the post office with the small white treasure intrusted to her care but those paper dolls were so pretty and of course there was no harm in walking along with Addie and looking at them How could she know that the hateful letter was going to tumble out of her apron pocket Right there too the only place along the road where there was the least bit of mud to be seen Then she had honestly supposed that a little clean water from the creek applied with her smooth white handkerchief would take the stains right out of the envelope and the sun would dry it and it would go safely to Uncle Ralph s after all but instead of that the hateful hateful thing slipped right out of her hand and went floating down the stream and at this point Julia s sobs burst forth afresh Presently she took up her broken thread of thought and went on How very very ugly Ester was if she hadn t been there her mother would have listened kindly to her story of how very sorry she was and how she meant to do just right Then she would have forgiven her and she would have been freshly dressed in her clean blue dress instead of her pink one and would have had her happy day after all and now she would have to spend this bright day all alone and at this point her tears rolled down in torrents Jule called a familiar voice under her window where are you Come down and mend my sail for me won t you Julia went to the window and poured into Alfred s sympathetic ears the story of her grief and her wrongs Just exactly like her was his comment on Ester s share in the tragedy She grows crosser every day I guess if I were you I d let her wait a spell before I asked her forgiveness I guess I shall sputtered Julia She was meaner than any thing and I d tell her so this minute if I saw her that s all the sorry I am So the talk went on and when Alfred was called to get Ester a pail of water and left Julia in solitude she found her heart very much strengthened in its purpose to tire everybody out in waiting for her apology The long warm busy day moved on and the overworked and wearied mother found time to toil up two flights of stairs in search of her young daughter in the hope of soothing and helping her but Julia was in no mood to be helped She hated to stay up there alone she wanted to go down in the garden with Alfred she wanted to go to the arbor and read her new book she wanted to take a walk down by the river she wanted her dinner exceedingly but to ask Ester s forgiveness was the one thing that she did not want to do No not if she staid there alone for a week not if she starved she said aloud stamping her foot and growing indignant over the thought Alfred came as often as his Saturday occupations would admit and held emphatic talks with the little prisoner above admiring her pluck and assuring her that he wouldn t give in not he You see I can t do it said Julia with a gleam of satisfaction in her eyes because it wouldn t be true I m not sorry and mother wouldn t have me tell a lie for anybody So the sun went toward the west and Julia at the window watched the academy girls moving homeward from their afternoon ramble listened to the preparations for tea which were being made among the dishes in the dining room and having no more tears to shed sighed wearily and wished the miserable day were quite done and she was sound asleep Only a few moments before she had received a third visit from her mother and turning to her fresh from a talk with Alfred she had answered her mother s question as to whether she were not now ready to ask Ester s forgiveness with quite as sober and determined a No ma am as she had given that day and her mother had gravely and sadly answered I am very sorry Julia I can t come up here again I am too tired for that You may come to me if you wish to see me any time before seven o clock After that you must go to your room And with this Julia had let her depart only saying as the door closed Then I can be asleep before Ester comes up I m glad of that I wouldn t look at her again to day for anything And then Julia was once more summoned to the window Jule Alfred said with less decision in his voice than there had been before mother looked awful tired when she came down stairs just now and there was a tear rolling down her cheek There was said Julia in a shocked and troubled tone And I guess Alfred continued she s had a time of it to day Ester is too cross even to look at and they ve been working pell mell all day and Minnie tumbled over the ice box and got hurt and mother held her most an hour and I guess she feels real bad about this She told Sadie she felt sorry for you Silence for a little while at the window above and from the boy below then he broke forth suddenly I say Jule hadn t you better do it after all not for Ester but there s mother you know But Alfred interrupted the truthful and puzzled Julia what can I do about it You know I m to tell Ester that I m sorry and that will not be true This question also troubled Alfred It did not seem to occur to these two foolish young heads that she ought to be sorry for her own angry words no matter how much in the wrong another had been So they stood with grave faces and thought about it Alfred found a way out of the mist at last See here aren t you sorry that you couldn t go to Vesta s and had to stay up there alone all day and that it bothered mother Of course said Julia I m real sorry about mother Alfred did I honestly make her cry Yes you did Alfred answered earnestly I saw that tear as plain as day Now you see you can tell Ester you re sorry just as well as not because if you hadn t said any thing to her mother could have made it all right so of course you re sorry Well said Julia slowly rather bewildered still that sounds as if it was right and yet somehow Well Alfred you wait for me and I ll be down right away So it happened that a very penitent little face stood at her mother s elbow a few moments after this and Julia s voice was very earnest Mother I m so sorry I made you such a great deal of trouble to day And the patient mother turned and kissed the flushed cheek and answered kindly Mother will forgive you Have you seen Ester my daughter No ma am spoken more faintly but I m going to find her right away And Ester answered the troubled little voice with a cold Actions speak louder than words I hope you will show how sorry you are by behaving better in future Stand out of my way Is it all done up Alfred asked a moment later as she joined him on the piazza to take a last look at the beauty of this day which had opened so brightly for her Yes with a relieved sigh and Alfred I never mean to be such a woman as Ester is when I grow up I wouldn t for the world I mean to be nice and good and kind like sister Sadie CHAPTER VI SOMETHING HAPPENS Now the letter which had caused so much trouble in the Ried family and especially in Ester s heart was in one sense not an ordinary letter It had been written to Ester s cousin Abbie her one intimate friend Uncle Ralph s only daughter These two of the same age had been correspondents almost from their babyhood and yet they had never seen each other s faces To go to New York to her uncle s house to see and be with Cousin Abbie had been the one great dream of Ester s heart as likely to be realized she could not help acknowledging as a journey to the moon and no more so New York was at least five hundred miles away and the money necessary to carry her there seemed like a small fortune to Ester to say nothing of the endless additions to her wardrobe which would have to be made before she would account herself ready So she contented herself or perhaps it would be more truthful to say she made herself discontented with ceaseless dreams over what New York and her uncle s family and above all Cousin Abbie were like and whether she would ever see them and why it had always happened that something was sure to prevent Abbie s visits to herself and whether she should like her as well if she could be with her as she did now and a hundred other confused and disconnected thoughts about them all Ester had no idea what this miserable restless dreaming of hers was doing for her She did not see that her very desires after a better life which were sometimes strong upon her were colored with impatience and envy Cousin Abbie was a Christian and wrote her some earnest letters but to Ester it seemed a very easy matter indeed for one who was surrounded as she imagined Abbie to be by luxury and love to be a joyous eager Christian Into this very letter that poor Julia had sent sailing down the stream some of her inmost feelings had been poured Don t think me devoid of all aspirations after something higher so the letter ran Dear Abbie you in your sunny home can never imagine how wildly I long sometimes to be free from my surroundings free from petty cares and trials and vexations which I feel are eating out my very life Oh to be free for one hour to feel myself at liberty for just one day to follow my own tastes and inclinations to be the person I believe God designed me to be to fill the niche I believe He designed me to fill Abbie I hate my life I have not a happy moment It is all rasped and warped and unlovely I am nothing and I know it and I had rather for my own comfort be like the most of those who surround me nothing and not know it Sometimes I can not help asking myself why I was made as I am Why can t I be a clod a plodder and drag my way with stupid good nature through this miserable world instead of chafing and bruising myself at every step Now it would be very natural to suppose that a young lady with a grain of sense left in her brains would in cooler moments have been rather glad than otherwise to have such a restless unhappy unchristianlike letter hopelessly lost But Ester felt as has been seen thoroughly angry that so much lofty sentiment which she mistook for religion was entirely lost Yet let it not be supposed that one word of this rebellious outbreak was written simply for effect Ester when she wrote that she hated her life was thoroughly and miserably in earnest When in the solitude of her own room she paced her floor that evening and murmured despairingly Oh if something would only happen to rest me for just a little while she was more thoroughly in earnest than any human being who feels that Christ has died to save her and that she has an eternal resting place prepared for her and waiting to receive her has any right to feel on such a subject Yet though the letter had never reached its destination the pitying Savior looking down upon his poor foolish lamb in tender love made haste to prepare an answer to her wild rebellious cry for help even though she cried blindly without a thought of the Helper who is sufficient for all human needs Long looked for come at last and Sadie s clear voice rang through the dining room and a moment after that young lady herself reached the pump room holding up for Ester s view a dainty envelope directed in a yet more dainty hand to Miss Ester Ried Here s that wonderful letter from Cousin Abbie which you have sent me to the post office after three times a day for as many weeks It reached here by the way of Cape Horn I should say by its appearance It has been remailed twice Ester set her pail down hastily seized the letter and retired to the privacy of the pantry to devour it and for once was oblivious to the fact that Sadie lunched on bits of cake broken from the smooth square loaf while she waited to hear the news Anything special missus Ried asked pausing in the doorway which question Ester answered by turning a flushed and eager face toward them as she passed the letter to Sadie with permission to read it aloud Surprised into silence by the unusual confidence Sadie read the dainty epistle without comment MY DEAR ESTER I m in a grand flurry and shall therefore not stop for long stories to day but come at the pith of the matter immediately We want you That is nothing new you are aware as we have been wanting you for many a day But there is new decision in my plans and new inducements this time We not only want but must have you Please don t say No to me this once We are going to have a wedding in our house and we need your presence and wisdom and taste Father says you can t be your mother s daughter if you haven t exquisite taste I am very busy helping to get the bride in order which is a work of time and patience and I do so much need your aid besides the bride is your Uncle Ralph s only daughter so of course you ought to be interested in her Ester do come Father says the inclosed fifty dollars is a present from him which you must honor by letting it pay your fare to New York just as soon as possible The wedding is fixed for the twenty second and we want you here at least three weeks before that Brother Ralph is to be first groomsman and he especially needs your assistance as the bride has named you for her first bridesmaid I m to dress I mean the bride is to dress in white and mother has a dress prepared for the bridesmaid to match hers so that matter need not delay or cause you anxiety This letter is getting too long I meant it to be very brief and pointed I designed every other word to be come but after all I do not believe you will need so much urging to be with us at this time I flatter myself that you love me enough to come to me if you can So leaving Ralph to write directions concerning route and trains I will run and try on the bride s bonnet which has just come home P S There is to be a groom as well as a bride though I see I have said nothing concerning him Never mind you shall see him when you come Dear Ester there isn t a word of tense in this letter I know but I haven t time to put any in Really laughed Sadie as she concluded the reading this is almost foolish enough to have been written by me Isn t it splendid though Ester I m glad you are you I wish I had corresponded with Cousin Abbie myself A wedding of any kind is a delicious novelty but a real New York wedding and a bridesmaid besides my I ve a mind to clap my hands for you seeing you are too dignified to do it yourself Oh said Ester from whose face the flush had faded leaving it actually pale with excitement and expected disappointment you don t suppose I am foolish enough to think I can go do you Of course you will go when Uncle Ralph has paid your fare and more too Fifty dollars will buy a good deal besides a ticket to New York Mother don t you ever think of saying that she can t go there is nothing to hinder her She is to go isn t she Why I don t know answered this perplexed mother I want her to I am sure yet I don t see how she can be spared She will need a great many things besides a ticket and fifty dollars do not go as far as you imagine besides Ester you know I depend on you so much Ester s lips parted to speak and had the words come forth which were in her heart they would have been sharp and bitter ones about never expecting to go anywhere never being able to do any thing but work but Sadie s eager voice was quicker than hers Oh now mother it is no use to talk in that way I ve quite set my heart on Ester s going I never expect to have an invitation there myself so I must take my honors secondhand Mother it is time you learned to depend on me a little I m two inches taller than Ester and I ve no doubt I shall develop into a remarkable person when she is where we can t all lean upon her School closes this very week you know and we have vacation until October Abbie couldn t have chosen a better time Whom do you suppose she is to marry What a queer creature not to tell us Say she can go mother quick Sadie s last point was a good one in missus Ried s opinion Perhaps the giddy Sadie at once her pride and her anxiety might learn a little self reliance by feeling a shadow of the weight of care which rested continually on Ester You certainly need the change she said her eyes resting pityingly on the young careworn face of her eldest daughter But how could we manage about your wardrobe Your black silk is nice to be sure but you would need one bright evening dress at least and you know we haven t the money to spare Then Sadie thoughtless selfish Sadie who was never supposed to have one care for others and very little for herself Sadie who vexed Ester nearly every hour in the day by what at the time always seemed some especially selfish heedless act suddenly shone out gloriously She stood still and actually seemed to think for a full minute while Ester jerked a pan of potatoes toward her and commenced peeling vigorously then she clapped her hands and gave vent to little gleeful shouts before she exclaimed Oh mother mother I have it exactly I wonder we didn t think of it before There s my blue silk just the thing I am tall and she is short so it will make her a beautiful train dress Won t that do splendidly The magnitude of this proposal awed even Ester into silence To be appreciated it must be understood that Sadie Ried had never in her life possessed a silk dress missus Ried s best black silk had long ago been cut over for Ester so had her brown and white plaid so there had been nothing of the sort to remodel for Sadie and this elegant sky blue silk had been lying in its satin paper covering for more than two years It was the gift of a dear friend of missus Ried s girlhood to the young beauty who bore her name and had been waiting all this time for Sadie to attain proper growth to admit of its being cut into for her Meantime she had feasted her eyes upon it and gloried in the prospect of that wonderful day when she should sweep across the platform of Music Hall with this same silk falling in beautiful blue waves around her for it had long been settled that it was to be worn first on that day when she should graduate No wonder then that Ester stood in mute astonishment while missus Ried commented Why Sadie my dear child is it possible you are willing to give up your blue silk Not a bit of it mother I don t intend to give it up the least bit in the world I m merely going to lend it It s too pretty to stay poked up in that drawer by itself any longer I ve set my heart on its coming out this very season Just as likely as not it will learn to put on airs for me when I graduate I m not at all satisfied with my attainments in that line so Ester shall take it to New York and if she sits down or stands up or turns around or has one minute s peace while she has it on for fear lest she should spot it or tear it or get it stepped on I ll never forgive her And at this harangue Ester laughed a free glad laugh such as was seldom heard from her Some way it began to seem as if she were really to go Sadie had such a brisk business like way of saying Ester shall take it to New York Oh if she only only could go she would be willing to do any thing after that but one peep one little peep into the beautiful magic world that lay outside of that dining room and kitchen she felt as if she must have Perhaps that laugh did as much for her as any thing It almost startled missus Ried with its sweetness and rarity What if the change would freshen and brighten her and bring her back to them with some of the sparkles that continually danced in Sadie s eyes but what on the other hand if she should grow utterly disgusted with the monotony of their very quiet very busy life and refuse to work in that most necessary treadmill any longer So the mother argued and hesitated and the decision which was to mean so much more than any of those knew trembled in the balance for let missus Ried once find voice to say Oh Ester I don t see but what you will have to give it up and Ester would have turned quickly and with curling lip to that pan of potatoes and have sharply forbidden any one to mention the subject to her again Once more Sadie dear merry silly Sadie came to the rescue Mother oh mother what an endless time you are in coming to a decision I could plan an expedition to the North Pole in less time than this I m just wild to have her go I want to hear how a genuine New York bride looks besides you know dear mother I want to stay in the kitchen with you Ester does every thing and I don t have any chance I perfectly long to bake and boil and broil and brew things Say yes there s a darling And missus Ried looked at the bright flushed face and thought how little the dear child knew about all these matters and how little patience poor Ester who was so competent herself would have with Sadie s ignorance and said slowly and hesitatingly but yet actually said Well Ester my daughter I really think we must try to get along without you for a little while And these three people really seemed to think that they had decided the matter Though two of them were at least theoretical believers in a special providence it never once occurred to them that this little thing in all its details had been settled for ages CHAPTER VII JOURNEYING Twenty minutes here for refreshments Passengers for New York take south track New York daily papers here Sweet oranges here And amid all these yells of discordant tongues and the screeching of engines and the ringing of bells and the intolerable din of a merciless gong Ester pushed and elbowed her way through the crowd almost panting with her efforts to keep pace with her traveling companion a nervous country merchant on his way to New York to buy goods He hurried her through the crowd and the noise into the dining saloon stood by her side while obedient to his orders she poured down her throat a cup of almost boiling coffee then seating her in the ladies room charged her on no account to stir from that point while he was gone he had just time to run around to the post office and mail a forgotten letter then he vanished and in the confusion and the crowd Ester was alone She did not feel in the least flurried or nervous on the contrary she liked it this first experience of hers in a city depot she would not have had it made known to one of the groups of fashionably attired and very much at ease travelers who thronged past her for the world but the truth was Ester had been having her very first ride in the cars Sadie had made various little trips in company with school friends to adjoining towns after school books or music or to attend a concert or for pure fun but though Ester had spent her eighteen years of life in a town which had long been an Express Station yet want of time or of money or of inclination to take the bits of journeys which alone were within her reach had kept her at home Now she glanced at herself at her faultlessly neat and ladylike traveling suit She could get a full view of it in an opposite mirror and it was becoming from the dainty vail which fluttered over her hat to the shining tip of her walking boots and she gave a complacent little sigh as she said to herself I don t see but I look as much like a traveler as any of them I m sure I don t feel in the least confused I m glad I m not as ridiculously dressed as that pert looking girl in brown I should call it in very bad taste to wear such a rich silk as that for traveling She doesn t look as though she had a single idea beyond dress probably that is what is occupying her thoughts at this very moment and Ester s speaking face betrayed contempt and conscious superiority as she watched the fluttering bit of silk and ribbons opposite Ester had a very mistaken opinion of herself in this respect probably she would have been startled and indignant had any one told her that her supposed contempt for the rich and elegant attire displayed all around her was really the outgrowth of envy that when she told herself she wouldn t lavish so much time and thought and above all money on mere outside show it was mere nonsense that she already spent all the time at her disposal and all the money she could possibly spare on the very things which she was condemning The truth was Ester had a perfectly royal taste in all these matters Give her but the wherewithal and she would speedily have glistened in silk and sparkled with jewels yet she honestly thought that her bitter denunciation of fashion and folly in this form was outward evidence of a mind elevated far above such trivial subjects and looked down accordingly with cool contempt on those whom she was pleased to denominate butterflies of fashion And in her flights into a higher sphere of thought this absurdly inconsistent Ester never once remembered how just exactly a week ago that day she had gone around like a storm king in her own otherwise peaceful home almost wearing out the long suffering patience of her weary mother rendered the house intolerable to Sadie and actually boxed Julia s ears and all because she saw with her own common sense eyes that she really could not have her blue silk or rather Sadie s blue silk trimmed with netted fringe at twelve shillings a yard but must do with simple folds and a seventy five cent heading Such a two weeks as the last had been in the Ried family The entire household had joined in the commotion produced by Ester s projected visit It was marvelous how much there was to do missus Ried toiled early and late and made many quiet little sacrifices in order that her daughter might not feel too keenly the difference between her own and her cousin s wardrobe Sadie emptied what she denominated her finery box and donated every article in it delivering comic little lectures to each bit of lace and ribbon as she smoothed them and patted them and told them they were going to New York Julia hemmed pocket handkerchiefs and pricked her poor little fingers unmercifully and uncomplainingly Alfred ran of errands with remarkable promptness but confessed to Julia privately that it was because he was in such a hurry to have Ester gone so he could see how it would seem for everybody to be good natured Little Minie got in everybody s way as much as such a tiny creature could and finally brought the tears to Ester s eyes and set every one else into bursts of laughter by bringing a very smooth little handkerchief about six inches square and offering it as her contribution toward the traveler s outfit As for Ester she was hurried and nervous and almost unendurably cross through the whole of it wanting a hundred things which it was impossible for her to have and scorning not a few little trifles that had been prepared for her by patient toil worn fingers Ester I do hope New York or Cousin Abbie or somebody will have a soothing and improving effect upon you Sadie had said with a sort of good humored impatience only the night before her departure Now that you have reached the summit of your hopes you seem more uncomfortable about it than you were even to stay at home Do let us see you look pleasant for just five minutes that we may have something good to remember you by My dear missus Ried had interposed rebukingly Ester is hurried and tired remember and has had a great many things to try her to day I don t think it is a good plan just as a family are about to separate to say any careless or foolish words that we don t mean Mother has a great many hard days of toil which Ester has given to remember her by Oh the patient tender forgiving mother Ester being asleep to her own faults never once thought of the sharp fretful half disgusted way in which much of her work had been performed but only remembered with a little sigh of satisfaction the many loaves of cake and the rows of pies which she had baked that very morning in order to save her mother s steps This was all she thought of now but there came days when she was wide awake Meantime the New York train after panting and snorting several times to give notice that the twenty minutes were about up suddenly puffed and rumbled its way out from the depot and left Ester obeying orders that is sitting in the corner where she had been placed by mister Newton being still outwardly but there was in her heart a perfect storm of vexation This comes of mother s absurd fussiness in insisting upon putting me in mister Newton s care instead of letting me travel alone as I wanted to she fumed to herself Now we shall not get into New York until after six o clock How provoking How provoking this is mister Newton exclaimed re echoing her thoughts as he bustled in red with haste and heat and stood penitently before her I hadn t the least idea it would take so long to go to the post office I am very sorry Well he continued recovering his good humor notwithstanding Ester s provoking silence what can t be cured must be endured Miss Ester and it isn t as bad as it might be either We ve only to wait an hour and a quarter I ve some errands to do and I ll show you the city with pleasure or would you prefer sitting here and looking around you I should decidedly prefer not running the chance of missing the next train Ester answered very shortly So I think it will be wiser to stay where I am In truth mister Newton endured the results of his own carelessness with too much complacency to suit Ester s state of mind but he took no notice of her broadly given hint further than to assure her that she need give herself no uneasiness on that score he should certainly be on time Then he went off looking immensely relieved for mister Newton frankly confessed to himself that he did not know how to take care of a lady If she were a parcel of goods now that one could get stored or checked and knew that she would come on all right why but a lady I m not used to it How easily I could have caught that train if I hadn t been obliged to run back after her but bless me I wouldn t have her know that for the world This he said meditatively as he walked down South Street The New York train had carried away the greater portion of the throng at the depot so that Ester and the dozen or twenty people who occupied the great sitting room with her had comparative quiet The wearer of the condemned brown silk and blue ribbons was still there and awoke Ester s vexation still further by seeming utterly unable to keep herself quiet she fluttered from seat to seat and from window to window like an uneasy bird in a cage Presently she addressed Ester in a bright little tone Doesn t it bore you dreadfully to wait in a depot Yes said Ester briefly and truthfully notwithstanding the fact that she was having her first experience in that boredom Are you going to New York I hope so she answered with energy I expected to have been almost there by this time but the gentleman who is supposed to be taking care of me had to rush off and stay just long enough to miss the train How annoying answered the blue ribbons with a soft laugh I missed it too in such a silly way I just ran around the corner to get some chocolate drops and a little matter detained me a few moments and when I came back the train had gone I was so sorry for I m in such a hurry to get home Do you live in New York Ester shook her head and thought within herself That is just as much sense as I should suppose you to have risk the chance of missing a train for the sake of a paper of candy Of course Ester could not be expected to know that the chocolate drops were for the wee sister at home whose heart would be nearly broken if sister Fanny came home after an absence of twenty four hours without bringing her any thing and the little matter which detained her a few moments was joining the search after a twenty five cent bill which the ruthless wind had snatched from the hand of a barefooted bareheaded and almost forlorn little girl who cried as violently as though her last hope in life had been blown away with it nor how failing in finding the treasure the gold clasped purse had been opened and a crisp new bill had been taken out to fill its place neither am I at all certain as to whether it would have made any difference at all in Ester s verdict if she had known all the circumstances The side door opened quietly just at this point and a middle aged man came in carrying in one hand a tool box and in the other a two story tin pail Both girls watched him curiously as he set these down on the floor and taking tacks from his pocket and a hammer from his box he proceeded to tack a piece of paper to the wall Ester from where she sat could see that the paper was small and that something was printed on it in close fine type It didn t look in the least like a handbill or indeed like a notice of any sort Her desire to know what it could be grew strong two tiny tacks held it firmly in its place Then the man turned and eyed the inmates of the room who were by this time giving undivided attention to him and his bit of paper Presently he spoke in a quiet respectful tone I ve tacked up a nice little tract I thought maybe while you was waiting you might like something to read If one of you would read it aloud all the rest could hear it So saying the man stooped and took up his tool box and his tin pail and went away leaving the influences connected with those two or three strokes of his hammer to work for him through all time and meet him at the judgment But if a bomb shell had suddenly come down and laid itself in ruins it their feet it could not have made a much more startled company than the tract tacker left behind him A tract actually tacked up on the wall and waiting for some human voice to give it utterance A tract in a railroad depot How queer how singular how almost improper Why Oh Ester didn t know it was so unusual Yes but then that didn t make it improper No but then she it Well it was fanatical Oh yes that was it She knew it was improper in some way It was strange that that very convenient word should have escaped her for a little This talk Ester held hurriedly with her conscience It was asleep you know but just then it nestled as in a dream and gave her a little prick but that industrious important word fanatical lulled it back to its rest Meantime there hung the tract and fluttered a little in the summer air as the door opened and closed Was no one to give it voice I d like dreadful well to hear it an old lady said nodding her gray head toward the little leaf on the wall but I ve packed up my specs and might just as well have no eyes at all as far as readin goes when I haven t got my specs on There s some young eyes round here though one would think she added looking inquiringly around You won t need glasses I should say now for a spell of years This remark or hint or inquiry was directed squarely at Ester and received no other answer than a shrug of the shoulder and an impatient tapping of her heels on the bare floor Under her breath Ester muttered Disagreeable old woman The brown silk rustled and the blue ribbons fluttered restlessly for a minute then their owner s clear voice suddenly broke the silence I ll read it for you ma am if you really would like to hear it The wrinkled homely happy old face broke into a beaming smile as she turned toward the pink cheeked blue eyed maiden That I would she answered heartily dreadful well I ain t heard nothing good pears to me since I started and I ve come two hundred miles It seems as if it might kind of lift me up and rest me like to hear something real good again With the flush on her face a little hightened the young girl promptly crossed to where the tract hung and a strange stillness settled over the listeners as her clear voice sounded distinctly down the long room This was what she read SOLEMN QUESTIONS Dear Friend Are you a Christian What have you done to day for Christ Are the friends with whom you have been talking traveling toward the New Jerusalem Did you compare notes with them as to how you were all prospering on the way Is that stranger by your side a fellow pilgrim Did you ask him if he would be Have you been careful to recommend the religion of Jesus Christ by your words by your acts by your looks this day If danger comes to you have you this day asked Christ to be your helper If death comes to you this night are you prepared to give up your account What would your record of this last day be A blank What Have you done nothing for the Master Then what have you done against Him Nothing Nay verily Is not the Bible doctrine He that is not for me is against me Remember that every neglected opportunity every idle word every wrong thought of yours has been written down this day You can not take back the thoughts or words you can not recall the opportunity This day with all its mistakes and blots and mars you can never live over again It must go up to the judgment just as it is Have you begged the blood of Jesus to be spread over it all Have you resolved that no other day shall witness a repeatal of the same mistakes Have you resolved in your own strength or in His During the reading of the tract a young man had entered paused a moment in surprise at the unwonted scene then moved with very quiet tread across the room and took the vacant seat near Ester As the reader came back to her former seat with the pink on her cheek deepened into warm crimson the new comer greeted her with Good evening Miss Fannie Have you been finding work to do for the Master Only a very little thing she answered with a voice in which there was a slight tremble I don t know about that my dear This was the old woman s voice I m sure I thank you a great deal They re kind of startling questions like enough to most scare a body unless you was trying pretty hard now ain t they Very solemn questions indeed answered the gentleman to whom this question seemed to be addressed I wonder if we were each obliged to write truthful answers to each one of them how many we should be ashamed to have each other see How many would be ashamed to have Him see The old woman spoke with an emphatic shake of her gray head and a reverent touch of he pronoun That is the vital point he said Yet how much more ashamed we often seem to be of man s judgment than of God s Then he turned suddenly to Ester and spoke in a quiet respectful tone Is the stranger by my side a fellow pilgrim Ester was startled and confused The whole scene had been a very strange one to her She tried to think the blue ribboned girl was dreadfully out of her sphere but the questions following each other in such quick succession were so very solemn and personal and searching and now this one She hesitated and stammered and flushed like a school girl as at last she faltered I I think I believe I am Then I trust you are wide awake and a faithful worker in the vineyard he said earnestly These are times when the Master needs true and faithful workmen He s a minister said Ester positively to herself when she had recovered from her confusion sufficiently to observe him closely as he carefully folded the old woman s shawl for her took her box and basket in his care and courteously offered his hand to assist her into the cars for the New York train thundered in at last and mister Newton presented himself and they rushed and jostled each other out of the depot and into the train And the little tract hung quietly in its corner and the carpenter who had left it there hammered and sawed and planed yes and prayed that God would use it and knew not then nor afterward that it had already awakened thoughts that would tell for eternity CHAPTER VIII THE JOURNEY S END Yes he s a minister Ester repeated even more decidedly as being seated in the swift moving train directly behind the old lady and the young gentleman who had become the subject of her thoughts she found leisure to observe him more closely mister Newton was absorbed in the Tribune so she gave her undivided attention to the two and could hear snatches of the conversation which passed between them as well as note the courteous care with which he brought her a cup of water and attended to all her simple wants During the stopping of the train at a station their talk became distinct And I haven t seen my boy don t you think in ten years the old lady was saying Won t he be glad though to see his mother once more And he s got children two of them one is named after me Sabrina It s an awful homely name I think don t you But then you see it was grandma s And that makes all the difference in the world her companion answered So the old home is broken up and you are going to make a new one Yes and I ll show you every thing I ve got to remember my old garden by With eager trembling fingers she untied the string which held down the cover of her basket and rummaging within brought to light a withered bouquet of the very commonest and perhaps the very homeliest flowers that grew if there are any homely flowers There she said holding it tenderly and speaking with quivering lip and trembling voice I picked em the very last thing I did out in my own little garden patch by the backdoor Oh times and times I ve sat and weeded and dug around them with him sitting on the stoop and reading out loud to me I thought all about just how it was while I was picking these I didn t stay no longer and I didn t go back to the house after that I couldn t I just pulled my sun bonnet over my eyes and went across lots to where I was going to get my breakfast Ester felt very sorry for the poor homeless friendless old woman felt as though she would have been willing to do a good deal just then to make her comfortable yet it must be confessed that that awkward bunch of faded flowers arranged without the slightest regard to colors looked rather ridiculous and she felt surprised and not a little puzzled to see actual tears standing in the eyes of her companion as he handled the bouquet with gentle care Well he said after a moment of quiet you are not leaving your best friend after all Does it comfort your heart very much to remember that in all your partings and trials you are never called upon to bid Jesus good by What a way he has of bringing that subject into every conversation commented Ester who was now sure that he was a minister Someway Ester had fallen into a way of thinking that every one who spoke freely concerning these matters must be either a fanatic or a minister Oh that s about all the comfort I ve got left This answer came forth from a full heart and eyes brimming with tears And I don t s pose I need any other if I ve got Jesus left I oughtn t to need any thing else but sometimes I get impatient it seems to me I ve been here long enough and it s time I got home How is it with the boy who is expecting you has he this same friend The gray head was slowly and sorrowfully shaken Oh I m afraid he don t know nothing about Him Ah then you have work to do you can t be spared to rest yet I presume the Master is waiting for you to lead that son to himself I mean to I mean to sir she said earnestly but sometimes I think maybe my coffin could do it better than I but God knows and I m trying to be patient Then the train whirred on again and Ester missed the rest but one sentence thrilled her Maybe my coffin could do it better than I How earnestly she spoke as if she were willing to die at once if by that she could save her son How earnest they both were anyway the wrinkled homely ignorant old woman and the cultivated courtly gentleman Ester was ill at ease conscience was arousing her to unwonted thought These two were different from her She was a Christian at least she supposed so hoped so but she was not like them There was a very decided difference Were they right and was she all wrong wasn t she a Christian after all and at this thought she actually shivered She was not willing to give up her title weak though it might be Oh well she decided after a little she is an old woman almost through with life Of course she looks at everything through a different aspect from what a young girl like me naturally would and as for him ministers always are different from other people of course Foolish Ester Did she suppose that ministers have a private Bible of their own with rules of life set down therein for them quite different from those written for her And as for the old woman almost through with life how near might Ester be to the edge of her own life at that very moment When the train stopped again the two were still talking I just hope my boy will look like you the old lady said suddenly fixing admiring eyes on the tall form that stood beside her patiently waiting for the cup from which she was drinking the tea which he had procured for her Ester followed the glance of her eye and laughed softly at the extreme improbability of her hope being realized while he answered gravely I hope he will be a noble boy and love his mother as she deserves then it will matter very little who he looks like While the cup was being returned there was a bit of toilet making going on the gray hair was smoothed back under the plain cap and the faded twisted shawl rearranged and carefully pinned Meantime her thoughts seemed troubled and she looked up anxiously into the face of her comforter as he again took his seat beside her I m just thinking I m such a homely old thing and New York is such a grand place I ve heard them say I do hope he won t be ashamed of his mother No danger was the hearty answer he ll think you are the most beautiful woman he has seen in ten years There is no way to describe the happy look which shone in the faded blue eyes at this answer and she laughed a softly pleased laugh as she said Maybe he ll be like the man I read about the other day Some mean old scamp told him how homely his mother was and he said says he Yes she s a homely woman sure enough but oh she s such a beautiful mother What ever will I do when I get in New York she added quickly seized with a sudden anxiety Just as like as not now he never got a bit of my letter and won t be there to get me Do you know where your son lives Oh yes I ve got it on a piece of paper the street and the number but bless your heart I shouldn t know whether to go up or down or across Just the shadow of a smile flitted over her friend s face as the thought of the poor old lady trying to make her way through the city came to him Then he hastened to reassure her Then we are all right whether he meets you or not we can take a carriage and drive there I will see you safe at home before I leave you This crowning act of kindness brought the tears I don t know why you are so good to me she said simply unless you are the friend I prayed for to help me through this journey If you are it s all right God will see that you are paid for it And before Ester had done wondering over the singular quaintness of this last remark there was a sudden triumphant shriek from the engine and a tremendous din made up of a confusion of more sounds than she had ever heard in her life before then all was hurry and bustle around her and she suddenly awakened to the fact that as soon as they had crossed the ferry she would actually be in New York Even then she bethought herself to take a curious parting look at the oddly matched couple who were carefully making their way through the crowd and wonder if she would ever see them again The next hour was made up of bewilderment to Ester She had a confused remembrance afterward of floating across a silver river in a palace of reaching a place where everybody screamed instead of talked and where all the bells were ringing for fire or something else She looked eagerly about for her uncle and saw at least fifty men who resembled him as she saw him last about ten years ago She fumbled nervously for his address in her pocket book and gave mister Newton a recipe for making mince pies instead finally she found herself tumbled in among cushions and driving right into carriages and carts and people who all got themselves mysteriously out of the way down streets that she thought must surely be the ones that the bells were ringing for as they were all ablaze It had been arranged that Ester s escort should see her safely set down at her uncle s door as she had been unable to state the precise time of her arrival and besides as she was an entire stranger to her uncle s family they could not determine any convenient plan for meeting each other at the depot So Ester was whirled through the streets at a dizzying rate and with eyes and ears filled with bewildering sights and sounds was finally deposited before a great building aglow with gas and gleaming with marble mister Newton rang the bell and Ester making confused adieus to him was meantime ushered into a hall looking not unlike Judge Warren s best parlor A sense of awe not unmixed with loneliness and almost terror stole over her as the man who opened the door stood waiting after a civil Whom do you wish to see and what name shall I send up Whom did she wish to see and what was her name anyway Could this be her uncle s house Did she want to see any of them She felt half afraid of them all Suddenly the dignity and grandeur seemed to melt into gentleness before her as the tiniest of little women appeared and a bright young voice broke into hearty welcome Is this really my cousin Ester And so you have come How perfectly splendid Where is mister Newton Gone Why John you ought to have smuggled him in to dinner We are so much obliged to him for taking care of you John send those trunks up to my room You ll room with me Ester won t you Mother thought I ought to put you in solitary state in a spare chamber but I couldn t You see I have been so many years waiting for you that now I want you every bit of the time All this while she was giving her loving little pats and kisses on their way up stairs whither she at once carried the traveler Such a perfect gem of a room as that was into which she was ushered Ester s love of beauty seemed likely to be fully gratified she cast one eager glance around her took in all the charming little details in a second of time and then gave her undivided attention to this wonderful person before her who certainly was in veritable flesh and blood the much dreamed over much longed for Cousin Abbie A hundred times had Ester painted her portrait tall and dark and grand with a perfectly regal form and queenly air hair black as midnight coiled in heavy masses around her head eyes blacker if possible than her hair As to dress it was very difficult to determine sometimes it was velvet and diamonds or if the season would not possibly admit of that then a rich dark silk never by any chance a material lighter than silk This had been her picture Now she could not suppress a laugh as she noted the contrast between it and the original She was even two inches shorter than Ester herself with a manner much more like a fairy s than a queen s instead of heavy coils of black hair there were little rings of brown curls clustering around a fair pale forehead and continually peeping over into the bluest of eyes then her dress was the softest and quietest of muslins with a pale blue tint Ester s softly laugh chimed merrily she turned quickly Now have you found something to laugh at in me already she said gleefully Why said Ester forgetting to be startled over the idea that she should laugh at Cousin Abbie I m only laughing to think how totally different you are from your picture From my picture Yes the one which I had drawn of you in my own mind I thought you were tall and had black hair and dressed in silks like a grand lady Abbie laughed again Don t condemn me to silks in such weather as this at least she said gaily Mother thinks I am barbarous to summon friends to the city in August but the circumstances are such that it could not well be avoided So put on your coolest dress and be as comfortable as possible This question of how she should appear on this first evening had been one of Ester s puzzles it would hardly do to don her blue silk at once and she had almost decided to choose the black one but Abbie s laugh and shrug of the shoulder had settled the question of silks So now she stood in confused indecision before her open trunk Abbie came to the rescue Shall I help you she said coming forward I ll not ring for Maggie to night but be waiting maid myself Suppose I hang up some of these dresses And which shall I leave for you This looks the coolest and she held up to Ester s view the pink and white muslin which did duty as an afternoon dress at home Well said Ester with a relieved smile I ll take that And she thought within her heart They are not so grand after all Presently they went down to dinner and in view of the splendor of the dining room and sparkle of gas and the glitter of silver she changed her mind again and thought them very grand indeed Her uncle s greeting was very cordial and though Ester found it impossible to realize that her Aunt Helen was actually three years older than her own mother or indeed that she was a middle aged lady at all so very bright and gay and altogether unsuitable did her attire appear yet on the whole she enjoyed the first two hours of her visit very much and surprised and delighted herself at the ease with which she slipped into the many new ways which she saw around her Only once did she find herself very much confused to her great astonishment and dismay she was served with a glass of wine Now Ester among the stanch temperance friends with whom she had hitherto passed her life had met with no such trial of her temperance principles which she supposed were sound and strong yet here she was at her uncle s table sitting near her aunt who was contentedly sipping from her glass Would it be proper under the circumstances to refuse Yet would it be proper to do violence to her sense of right Ester had no pledge to break except the pledge with her own conscience and it is most sadly true that that sort of pledge does not seem to be so very binding in the estimation of some people So Ester sat and toyed with hers and came to the very unwarrantable conclusion that what her uncle offered for her entertainment it must be proper for her to take Do Ester s good sense the justice of understanding that she didn t believe any such thing that she knew it was her own conscience by which she was to be judged not her uncle s that such smooth sounding arguments honestly meant that whatever her uncle offered for her entertainment she had not the moral courage to refuse So she raised the dainty wine glass to her lips and never once bethought herself to look at Abbie and notice how the color mounted and deepened on her face nor how her glass remained untouched beside her plate On the whole Ester was glad when all the bewildering ceremony of the dinner was concluded and she on the strength of her being wearied with her journey was permitted to retire with Abbie to their room CHAPTER IX COUSIN ABBIE Now I have you all to myself that young lady said with a happy smile as she turned the key on the retreating Maggie and wheeled an ottoman to Ester s side Where shall we commence I have so very much to say and hear I want to know all about Aunt Laura and Sadie and the twins Oh Ester you have a little brother aren t you so glad he is a little boy Why I don t know Ester said hesitatingly then more decidedly No I am always thinking how glad I should be if he were a young man old enough to go out with me and be company for me I know that is pleasant but there are very serious drawbacks Now there s our Ralph it is very pleasant to have him for company and yet Well Ester he isn t a Christian and it seems all the time to me that he is walking on quicksands I am in one continual tremble for him and I wish so often that he was just a little boy no older than your brother Alfred then I could learn his tastes and indeed mold them in a measure by having him with me a great deal and it does seem to me that I could make religion appear such a pleasant thing to him that he couldn t help seeking Jesus for himself Don t you enjoy teaching Alfred Poor puzzled Ester With what a matter of course air her cousin asked this question Could she possibly tell her that she sometimes never gave Alfred a thought from one week s end to another and that she never in her life thought of teaching him a single thing I am not his teacher she said at length I have no time for any such thing he goes to school you know and mother helps him Well said Abbie with a thoughtful air I don t quite mean teaching either at least not lessons and things of that sort though I think I should enjoy having him depend on me in all his needs but I was thinking more especially of winning him to Jesus it seems so much easier to do it while one is young Perhaps he is a Christian now is he Ester merely shook her head in answer She could not look in those earnest blue eyes and say that she had never by word or act asked him to come to Jesus Well that is what I mean you have so much more chance than I it seems to me Oh my heart is so heavy for Ralph I am all alone Ester do you know that neither my mother nor my father are Christians and our home influence is well is not what a young man needs He is very gay they call it There are his friends here in the city and his friends in college none of them the style of people that I like him to be with and only poor little me to stem the tide of worldliness all around him There is one thing in particular that troubles me he is or rather he is not and here poor Abbie stopped and a little silence followed After a moment she spoke again Oh Ester you will learn what I mean without my telling you it is something in which I greatly need your help I depend upon you I have looked forward to your coming on his account as well as on my own I know it will be better for him Ester longed to ask what the something was and what was expected of her but the pained look on Abbie s face deterred her and she contented herself by saying Where is he now In college coming next week I long on his account to have a home of my own I believe I can show him a style of life which will appear better to him than the one he is leading now This led to a long talk on the coming wedding Mother is very much disturbed that it should occur in August Abbie said and of course it is not pleasant as it would be later but the trouble is mister Foster is obliged to go abroad in September Who is mister Foster Can t you be married if he isn t here Not very well Abbie said with a bright little laugh You see he is the one who has asked me to marry him Why is he and Ester laughed at her former question then as a sudden thought occurred to her she asked Is he a minister Oh dear no he is only a merchant Is he a a Christian was her next query and so utterly unused was she to conversation on this subject that she actually stammered over the simple sentence Such a bright earnest face as was turned toward her at this question Ester said Abbie quickly I couldn t marry a man who was not a Christian Why Ester asked startled a little at the energy of her tone do you think it is wrong Perhaps not for every one I think one s own carefully enlightened conscience should prayerfully decide the question but it would be wrong for me I am too weak it would hinder my own growth in grace I feel that I need all the human helps I can get Yes mister Foster is an earnest Christian Do you suppose said Ester growing metaphysical that if mister Foster were not a Christian you would marry him A little shiver quivered through Abbie s frame as she answered I hope I should have strength to do what I thought right and I believe I should Yes you think so now persisted Ester because there is no danger of any such trial but I tell you I don t believe if you were brought to the test that you would do any such thing Abbie s tone in reply was very humble Perhaps not I might miserably fail and yet Ester He has said My grace is sufficient for thee Then after a little silence the bright look returned to her face as she added I am very glad that I am not to be tried in that furnace and do you know Ester I never believed in making myself a martyr to what might have been or even what may be in the future sufficient unto the day is my motto If it should ever be my duty to burn at the stake I believe I should go to my Savior and plead for the sufficient grace but as long as I have no such known trial before me I don t know why I should be asking for what I do not need or grow unhappy over improbabilities though I do pray every day to be prepared for whatever the future has for me Then the talk drifted back again to the various details connected with the wedding until suddenly Abbie came to her feet with a spring Why Ester she exclaimed penitently What a thoughtless wretch I am Here have I been chattering you fairly into midnight without a thought of your tired body and brain This session must adjourn immediately Shall you and I have prayers together to night Will it seem homelike to you Can you play I am Sadie for just a little while I should like it Ester answered faintly Shall I read as you are so weary and without waiting for a reply she unclasped the lids of her little Bible Are you reading the Bible by course Where do you like best to read for devotional reading I mean I don t know that I have any choice Ester s voice was fainter still Haven t you I have my special verses that I turn to in my various needs Where are you and Sadie reading No where said Ester desperately Abbie s face expressed only innocent surprise Don t you read together You are roommates aren t you Now I always thought it would be so delightful to have a nice little time like family worship in one s own room Sadie doesn t care anything about these things she isn t a Christian Ester said at length Oh dear isn t she What a very sad and troubled tone it was in which Abbie spoke Then you know something of my anxiety and yet it is different She is younger than you and you can have her so much under your influence At least it seems different to me How prone we are to consider our own anxieties peculiarly trying Ester never remembered giving a half hour s anxious thought to this which was supposed to be an anxiety with her in all her life but she did not say so and Abbie continued Who is your particular Christian friend then What an exceedingly trying and troublesome talk this was to Ester What was she to say Clearly nothing but the truth Abbie I haven t a friend in the world You poor dear child then we are situated very much alike after all though I have dear friends outside of my own family but what a heavy responsibility you must feel in your large household and you the only Christian Do you shrink from responsibility of that kind Ester Does it seem sometimes as if it would almost rush you Oh there are some Christians in the family Ester answered preferring to avoid the last part of the sentence but then They are half way Christians perhaps I understand how that is it really seems sadder to me than even thoughtless neglect Be it recorded that Ester s conscience pricked her This supposition on Abbie s part was not true doctor Van Anden for instance always had seemed to her most horribly and fanatically in earnest But in what rank should she place this young and beautiful and wealthy city lady Surely she could not be a fanatic Ester was troubled Well said Abbie suppose I read you some of my sweet verses Do you know I always feel a temptation to read in John There is so much in that book about Jesus and John seemed to love him so Ester almost laughed What an exceedingly queer idea a temptation to read in any part of the Bible What a strange girl her cousin was Now the reading began This is my verse when I am discouraged Wait on the Lord be of good courage and he shall strengthen thine heart wait I say on the Lord Isn t that reassuring And then these two Oh Ester these are wonderful I have blotted out as a thick cloud thy transgressions and as a cloud thy sins return unto me for I have redeemed thee Sing O ye heavens for the Lord hath done it shout ye lower parts of the earth break forth in singing ye mountains O forest and every tree therein for the Lord hath redeemed Jacob and glorified himself in Israel And in that glorious old prophet s book is my jubilant verse And the ransomed of the Lord shall return and come to Zion with songs and everlasting joy upon their heads they shall obtain joy and gladness and sorrow and sighing shall flee away Now Ester you are very tired aren t you and I keep dipping into my treasure like a thoughtless selfish girl as I am You and I will have some precious readings out of this book shall we not Now I ll read you my sweet good night Psalm Don t you think the Psalms are wonderful Ester And without waiting for reply the low toned musical voice read on through that marvel of simplicity and grandeur the one hundred and twenty first Psalm I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills from whence cometh my help My help cometh from the Lord which made heaven and earth He will not suffer thy foot to be moved he that keepeth thee will not slumber Behold he that keepeth Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep The Lord is thy keeper the Lord is thy shade upon thy right hand The sun shall not smite thee by day nor the moon by night The Lord shall preserve thee from all evil he shall preserve thy soul The Lord shall preserve thy going out and thy coming in from this time forth and even for evermore Ester will you pray questioned her cousin as the reading ceased and she softly closed her tiny book Ester gave her head a nervous hurried shake Then shall I or dear Ester would you prefer to be alone No said Ester I should like to hear you And so they knelt and Abbie s simple earnest tender prayer Ester carried with her for many a day After both heads were resting on their pillows and quiet reigned in the room Ester s eyes were wide open Her Cousin Abbie had astonished her she was totally unlike the Cousin Abbie of her dreams in every particular in nothing more so than the strangely childlike matter of course way in which she talked about this matter of religion Ester had never in her life heard any one talk like that except perhaps that minister who had spoken to her in the depot His religion seemed not unlike Abbie s Thinking of him she suddenly addressed Abbie again There was a minister in the depot to day and he spoke to me then the entire story of the man with his tract and the girl with blue ribbons and the old lady and the young minister and bits of the conversation were gone over for Abbie s benefit And Abbie listened and commented and enjoyed every word of it until the little clock on the mantel spoke in silver tones and said one two Then Abbie grew penitent again Positively Ester I won t speak again you will be sleepy all day to morrow and you needn t think I shall give you a chance even to wink Good night Good night repeated Ester but she still kept her eyes wide open Her journey and her arrival and Abbie and the newness and strangeness of everything around her had banished all thought of sleep So she went over in detail everything which had occurred that day but persistently her thoughts returned to the question which had so startled her coming from the lips of a stranger and to the singleness of heart which seemed to possess her Cousin Abbie Was she a fellow pilgrim after all she queried If so what caused the difference between Abbie and herself It was but a few hours since she first beheld her cousin and yet she distinctly felt the difference between them in that matter We are as unlike thought Ester turning restlessly on her pillow Well as unlike as two people can be What would Abbie say could she know that it was actually months since Ester had read as much connectedly in her Bible as she had heard read that evening Yes Ester had gone backward even as far as that Farther What would Abbie say to the fact that there were many many prayerless days in her life Not very many perhaps in which she had not used a form of prayer but their names were legion in which she had risen from her knees unhelped and unrefreshed in which she knew that she had not prayed a single one of the sentences which she had been repeating And just at this point she was stunned with a sudden thought a thought which too often escapes us all She would not for the world it seemed to her have made known to Abbie just how matters stood with her and yet and yet Christ knew it all She lay very still and breathed heavily It came to her with all the thrill of an entirely new idea Then that unwearied and ever watchful Satan came to her aid Oh well said he your Cousin Abbie s surroundings are very different from yours Give you all the time which she has at her disposal and I dare say you would be quite as familiar with your Bible as she is with hers What does she know about the petty vexations and temptations and bewildering ever pressing duties which every hour of every day beset your path The circumstances are very different Her life is in the sunshine yours in the shadow Besides you do not know her it is easy enough to talk very easy to read a chapter in the Bible but after all there are other things quite as important and it is more than likely that your cousin is not quite perfect yet Ester did not know that this was the soothing lullaby of the old Serpent Well for her if she had and had answered it with that solemn all powerful Get thee behind me Satan But she gave her own poor brain the benefit of every thought and having thus lulled and patted and coaxed her half roused and startled conscience into quiet rest again she turned on her pillow and went to sleep CHAPTER X ESTER S MINISTER Ester was dreaming that the old lady on the cars had become a fairy and that her voice sounded like a silver bell when she suddenly opened her eyes and found that it was either the voice of the marble clock on the mantel or of her Cousin Abbie who was bending over her Do you feel able to get up to breakfast Ester dear or had you rather lie and rest Breakfast echoed Ester in a sleepy bewilderment raising herself on one elbow and gazing at her cousin Yes breakfast this with a merry laugh Did you suppose that people in New York lived without such inconveniences Oh to be sure she was in New York and Ester repeated the laugh it had sounded so queerly to hear any one talk to her about getting up to breakfast it had not seemed possible that that meal could be prepared without her assistance Yes certainly I ll get up at once Have I kept you waiting Abbie Oh no not at all generally we breakfast at nine but mother gave orders last night to delay until half past nine this morning Ester turned to the little clock in great amazement it was actually ten minutes to nine What an idea She never remembered sleeping so late in her life before Why at home the work in the dining room and kitchen must all be done by this time and Sadie was probably making beds Poor Sadie What a time she would have She will learn a little about life while I am away thought Ester complacently as she stood before the mirror and pinned the dainty frill on her new pink cambric wrapper which Sadie s deft fingers had fashioned for her Ester had declined the assistance of Maggie feeling that though she knew perfectly well how to make her own toilet she did not know how to receive assistance in the matter Now I will leave you for a little Abbie said taking up her tiny Bible Ester where is your Bible I suppose you have it with you Ester looked annoyed I don t believe I have she said hurriedly I packed in such haste you see and I don t remember putting it in at all Oh I am sorry you will miss it so much Do you have a thousand little private marks in your Bible that nobody else understands I have a great habit of reading in that way Well I ll bring you one from the library that you may mark just as much as you please Ester sat herself down with a very complacent air beside the open window with the Bible which had just been brought her in her lap Clearly she had been left alone that she might have opportunity for private devotion and she liked the idea very much to be sure she had not been in the habit of reading in the Bible in the morning but that she told herself was simply because she never had time hardly to breathe in the mornings at home there she had beefsteak to cook and breakfast rolls to attend to she said disdainfully as if beefsteak and breakfast rolls were the most contemptible articles in the world entirely beneath the notice of a rational being but now she was in a very different atmosphere and at nine o clock of a summer morning was attired in a very becoming pink wrapper finished with the whitest of frills and sat at her window a young lady of elegant leisure waiting for the breakfast bell Of course she could read a chapter in the Bible now and should enjoy it quite as much as Abbie did She had never learned that happy little habit of having a much used much worn much loved Bible for her own personal and private use full of pencil marks and sacred meanings grown dear from association and teeming with memories of precious communings She had one of course a nice proper looking Bible and if it chanced to be convenient when she was ready to read she used it if not she took Sadie s or picked up Julia s from under the table or the old one on a shelf in the corner with one cover and part of Revelation missing it mattered not one whit to her which for there were no pencil marks and no leaves turned down and no special verses to find She thought the idea of marking certain verses an excellent one and deciding to commence doing so at once cast about her for a pencil There was one on the round table by the other window but there were also many other things Abbie s watch lay ticking softly in its marble and velvet bed and had to be examined and sighed over and Abbie s diamond pin in the jewel case also demanded attention then there were some blue and gold volumes to be peeped at and Longfellow received more than a peep then most witching of all Say and Seal in two volumes the very books Sadie had borrowed once and returned before Ester had a chance to discover how Faith managed about the ring Longfellow and the Bible slid on the table together and Say and Seal was eagerly seized upon just to be glanced over and the glances continued until there pealed a bell through the house and with a start and a confused sense of having neglected her opportunities this Christian young lady followed her cousin down stairs to meet all the temptations and bewilderments of a new day unstrengthened by communion with either her Bible or her Savior That breakfast in all its details was a most bewitching affair Ester felt that she could never enjoy that meal again at a table that was not small and round and covered with damask nor drink coffee that had not first flowed gracefully down from a silver urn As for Aunt Helen she could have dispensed with her she even caught herself drawing unfavorable comparisons between her and the patient hardworking mother far away Where is Uncle Ralph she asked suddenly becoming conscious that there were only three when last evening there were four Gone down town some hours ago Abbie answered He is a business man you know and can not keep such late hours But does he go without breakfast No takes it at seven instead of nine like our lazy selves He used to breakfast at a restaurant down town like other business men further explained Aunt Helen observing the bewildered look of this novice in city life But it is one of Abbie s recent whims that she can make him more comfortable at home so they rehearse the interesting scene of breakfast by gas light every morning Abbie s clear laugh rang out merrily at this My dear mother don t I beg of you insult the sun in that manner Ester fancy gas light at seven o clock on an August morning Do you get down stairs at seven o clock was Ester s only reply Yes at six or at most half past You see if I am to make father as comfortable at home as he would be at a restaurant I must flutter around a little Burns her cheeks and her fingers over the stove continued Aunt Helen in a disgusted tone in order that her father may have burnt toast prepared by her hands You ve blundered in one item mother was Abbie s good humored reply My toast is never burnt and only this morning father pronounced it perfect Oh she is developing answered missus Ried with a curious mixture of annoyance and amusement in look and tone If mister Foster fails in business soon as I presume he will judging from his present rate of proceeding we shall find her advertising for the position of first class cook in a small family If Abbie felt wounded or vexed over this thrust at mister Foster it showed itself only by a slight deepening of the pink on her cheek as she answered in the brightest of tones If I do mother and you engage me I ll promise you that the eggs shall not be boiled as hard as these are All this impressed two thoughts on Ester s mind one that Abbie for some great reason unknown to and unimagined by herself actually of her own free will arose early every morning and busied herself over preparations for her father s breakfast the other that Abbie s mother said some disagreeable things to her in a disagreeable way a way that would exceedingly provoke her and that she wouldn t endure she said to herself with energy These two thoughts so impressed themselves that when she and Abbie were alone again they led her to ask two questions Why do you get breakfast at home for your father Abbie Is it necessary No only I like it and he likes it You see he has very little time to spend at home and I like that little to be homelike besides Ester it is my one hour of opportunity with my father I almost never see him alone at any other time and I am constantly praying that the Spirit will make use of some little word or act of mine to lead him to the cross There was no reply to be made to this so Ester turned to the other question What does your mother mean by her reference to mister Foster She thinks some of his schemes of benevolence are on too large a scale to be prudent But he is a very prudent man and doesn t seem to think so at all Doesn t it annoy you to have her speak in that manner about him The ever ready color flushed into Abbie s cheeks again and after a moment s hesitation she answered gently I think it would Ester if she were not my own mother you know Another rebuke Ester felt vexed anyway This new strange cousin of hers was going to prove painfully good But her first day in New York despite the strangeness of everything was full of delight to her They did not go out as Ester was supposed to be wearied from her journey though in reality she never felt better and she reveled all day in a sense of freedom of doing exactly what she pleased and indeed of doing nothing this last was an experience so new and strange to her that it seemed delightful Ester s round of home duties had been so constant and pressing the rebound was extreme it seemed to her that she could never bake any more pies and cakes in that great oven and she actually shuddered over the thought that if she were at home she would probably be engaged in ironing while Maggie did the heavier work She went to fanning most vigorously as this occurred to her and sank back among the luxurious cushions of Abbie s easy chair as if exhausted then she pitied herself most industriously and envied Abbie more than ever and gave no thought at all to mother and Sadie who were working so much harder than usual in order that she might sit here at ease At last she decided to dismiss every one of these uncomfortable thoughts to forget that she had ever spent an hour of her life in a miserable hot kitchen but to give herself entirely and unreservedly to the charmed life which stretched out before her for three beautiful weeks Three weeks is quite a little time after all she told herself hopefully Three weeks ago I hadn t the least idea of being here and who knows what may happen in the next three weeks Ah sure enough Ester who knows When am I to see mister Foster she inquired of Abbie as they came up together from the dining room after lunch Why you will see him to night if you are not too tired to go out with me I was going to ask about that I m ready for anything don t feel as if I ever experienced the meaning of that word said Ester briskly rejoiced at the prospect of going anywhere Well then I shall carry you off to our Thursday evening prayer meeting it s just our meeting you see we teachers in the mission there are fifty of us and we do have the most delightful times It is like a family rather a large family perhaps you think but it doesn t seem so when we come on Sabbath from the great congregation and gather in our dear little chapel we seem like a company of brothers and sisters shutting ourselves in at home to talk and pray together for a little before we go out into the world again Is Thursday your regular prayer meeting evening Ester Now it would have been very difficult for Ester to tell when her regular prayer meeting evening was as it was so long ago that she grew out of the habit of regularly attending that now she scarcely ever gave it a thought But she had sufficient conscience left to be ashamed of this state of things and to understand that Abbie referred to the church prayer meeting so she answered simply No Wednesday That is our church prayer meeting night I missed it last evening because I wanted to welcome you And Tuesday is our Bible class night Do you give three evenings a week to religious meetings Abbie Yes said Abbie with softly glee isn t it splendid I appreciate my privileges I assure you so many people could not do it And so many people would not Ester thought So they were not in to dinner with the family but took theirs an hour earlier and with David whom Abbie called her body guard for escort made their way to Abbie s dear little chapel which proved to be a good sized church very prettily finished and furnished That meeting from first to last was a succession of surprises to Ester commencing with the leader and being announced to Abbie in undertone Your minister is the very man who spoke to me yesterday in the depot Abbie nodded and smiled her surprise at this information and Ester looked about her Presently another whisper Why Abbie there is the blue ribboned girl I told you about sitting in the third seat from the front That said Abbie looking and whispering back is Fanny Ames one of our teachers Presently Ester set to work to select mister Foster from the rows of young men who were rapidly filling the front seats in the left aisle I believe that one in glasses and brown kids is he she said to herself regarding him curiously and as if to reward her penetration he rose suddenly and came over book in hand to the seat directly in front of where they were sitting Good evening Abbie was his greeting We want to sing this hymn and have not the tune Can you lead it without the notes Why yes answered Abbie slowly and with a little hesitation That is if you will help me We ll all help he said smiling and returning to his seat Yes I m sure that is he commented Ester Then the meeting commenced it was a novel one One person at least had never attended any just like it Instead of the chapter of proper length which Ester thought all ministers selected for public reading this reader read just three verses and he did not even rise from his seat to do it nor use the pulpit Bible but read from a bit of a book which he took from his pocket Then the man in spectacles started a hymn which Ester judged was the one which had no notes attached from the prompt manner in which Abbie took up the very first word Now said the leader briskly before we pray let us have requests And almost before he had concluded the sentence a young man responded Remember especially a boy in my class who seems disposed to turn every serious word into ridicule What a queer subject for prayer Ester thought Remember my little brother who is thinking earnestly of those things another gentleman said speaking quickly as if he realized that he must hasten or lose his chance Pray for every one of my class I want them all And at this Esther actually started for the petition came from the lips of the blue ribboned Fanny in the corner A lady actually taking part in a prayer meeting when gentlemen were present How very improper She glanced around her nervously but no one else seemed in the least surprised or disturbed and indeed another young lady immediately followed her with a similar request Now said the leader let us pray And that prayer was so strange in its sounding to Ester It did not commence by reminding God that he was the maker and ruler of the universe or that he was omnipotent and omnipresent and eternal or any of the solemn forms of prayer to which her ears were used but simply Oh dear Savior receive these petitions which we bring Turn to thyself the heart of the lad who ridicules the efforts of his teacher lead the little brother into the strait and narrow way gather that entire class into thy heart of love and thus for each separate request a separate petition and as the meeting progressed it grew more strange every moment to Ester Each one seemed to have a word that he was eager to utter and the prayers while very brief were so pointed as to be almost startling They sang too a great deal only a verse at a time and whenever they seemed to feel like it Her amazement reached its hight when she felt a little rustle beside her and turned in time to see the eager light in Abbie s eyes as she said One of my class has decided for Christ Good news responded the leader Don t let us forget this item of thanksgiving when we pray As for Ester she was almost inclined not to believe her ears Had her cousin Abbie actually spoken in meeting She was about to sink into a reverie over this but hadn t time for at this point the leader arose I am sorry said he to cut the thread that binds us but the hour is gone Another week will soon pass though and God willing we shall take up the story sing And a soft sweet chant stole through the room Let my prayer be set forth before thee as incense and the lifting of my hands as evening sacrifice Then the little company moved with a quiet cheerfulness toward the door Have you enjoyed the evening Abbie asked in an eager tone as they passed down the aisle Why yes I believe so only it was rather queer Queer was it How Oh I ll tell you when we get home Your minister is exactly behind us Abbie and I guess he wants to speak with you There was a bright flush on Abbie s face and a little sparkle in her eye as she turned and gave her hand to the minister and then said in a demure and softly tone Cousin Ester let me make you acquainted with my friend mister Foster CHAPTER XI THE NEW BOARDER I don t know what to decide really missus Ried said thoughtfully standing with an irresolute air beside the pantry door Sadie hadn t I better make these pies Is that the momentous question which you can t decide mother missus Ried laughed Not quite it is about the new boarder We have room enough for another certainly and seven dollars a week is quite an item just now If Ester were at home I shouldn t hesitate Mother if I weren t the meekest and most enduring of mortals I should be hopelessly vexed by this time at the constancy with which your thoughts turn to Ester it is positively insulting as if I were not doing remarkably Do you put anything else in apple pies I never mean to have one by the way in my house I think they re horrid crust apples nutmeg little lumps of butter all over it Is there anything else mother before I put the top on Sometimes I sweeten mine a little missus Ried answered demurely Oh sure enough it was that new boarder that took all thoughts of sweetness out of me How much sugar mother Do let him come We are such a stupid family now it is time we had a new element in it besides you know I broke the largest platter yesterday and his seven dollars will help buy another I wish he was anything but a doctor though one ingredient of that kind is enough in a family especially of the stamp which we have at present Sadie said missus Ried gravely and reprovingly I never knew a young man for whom I have a greater respect than I have for doctor Van Anden Yes ma am answered Sadie with equal gravity I have an immense respect for him I assure you and so I have for the President and I feel about as intimate with the one as the other I hope doctor Douglass will be delightfully wild and wicked How will doctor Van Anden enjoy the idea of a rival I spoke of it to him yesterday I told him we would t give the matter another thought if it would be in any way unpleasant to him I thought we owed him that consideration in return for all his kindness to us but he assured me that it could make not the slightest difference to him Do let him come then I believe I need another bed to make I m growing thin for want of exercise and by the way that suggests an item in his favor being a doctor he will be out all night occasionally perhaps and the bed won t need making so often Mother I do believe I didn t put a speck of soda in that cake I made this morning What will that do to it or more properly speaking what will it not do inasmuch as it is not there to do As for Ester I shall consider it a personal insult if you refer to her again when I am so magnificently filling her place And this much enduring mother laughed and groaned at nearly the same time Poor Ester never forgot the soda nor indeed anything else in her life but then Sadie was so overflowing with sparkle and good humor Finally the question was decided and the new boarder came and was duly installed in the family and thence commenced a new era in Sadie s life Merry clerks and schoolboys she counted among her acquaintances by the score Grave dignified slightly taciturn men of the doctor Van Anden stamp she numbered also among her friends but never one quite like doctor Douglass This easy graceful courteous gentleman who seemed always to have just the right thing to say or do at just the right moment who was neither wild nor sober who seemed the furthest possible remove from wicked yet who was never by any chance disagreeably good His acquaintance with Sadie progressed rapidly A new element had come to mix in with her life The golden days wherein the two sisters had been much together wherein the Christian sister might have planted much seed for the Master in Sadie s bright young heart had all gone by Perchance that sleeping Christian nestled so cosily among the cushions in Cousin Abbie s morning room might have been startled and aroused could she have realized that days like those would never come back to her that being misspent they had passed away that a new worker had come to drop seed into the unoccupied heart that never again would Sadie be as fresh and as guileless and as easily won as in those days which she had let slip in idle aye worse than idle slumber Sadie sealed and directed a letter to Ester and ran with it down stairs doctor Douglass stood in the doorway hat in hand Shall I have the pleasure of being your carrier he said courteously Do you suppose you are to be trusted Sadie questioned as she quietly deposited the letter in his hat That depends in a great measure on whether you repose trust in me The world is safer in general than we are inclined to think it Who lives in that little birdsnest of a cottage just across the way A dear old gentleman mister Vane Sadie answered her voice taking a tender tone as it always did when any chance word reminded her of Florence That is he standing in the gateway Doesn t he look like a grand old patriarch As they looked doctor Van Anden drove suddenly from around the corner and reined in his horses in front of the opposite gateway They could hear his words distinctly mister Vane let me advise you to avoid this evening breeze it is blowing up strongly from the river Is doctor Van Anden the old gentleman s nurse or guardian or what questioned Sadie s companion Physician was her brief reply Then after a moment she laughed mischievously You don t like doctor Van Anden doctor Douglass I Oh yes I like him the trouble is he doesn t like me for which he is not to blame to be sure Probably he can not help it I have in some way succeeded in gaining his ill will Why do you think I am not one of his admirers Oh answered this rude and lawless girl I thought it would be very natural for you to be slightly jealous of him professionally you know If her object was to embarrass or annoy doctor Douglass apparently she did not gain her point He laughed good humoredly as he replied Professionally he is certainly worthy of envy I regard him as a very skillful physician Miss Ried Ere Sadie could reply the horses were stopped before the door and doctor Van Anden addressed her Sadie do you want to take a ride Now although Sadie had no special interest in or friendship for doctor Van Anden she did exceedingly like his horses and cultivated their acquaintance whenever she had an opportunity So within five minutes after this invitation was received she was skimming over the road in a high state of glee Sadie marked that night afterward as the last one in which she rode after those black ponies for many a day The Doctor seemed more at leisure than usual and in a much more talkative mood so it was quite a merry ride until he broke a moment s silence by an abrupt question Sadie haven t your mother and you always considered me a sincere friend to your family Sadie s reply was prompt and to the point Certainly doctor Van Anden I assure you I have as much respect for and confidence in you as I should have had for my grandfather if I had ever known him That being the case continued the Doctor gravely you will give me credit for sincerity and earnestness in what I am about to say I want to give you a word of warning concerning doctor Douglass He is not a man whom I can respect not a man with whom I should like to see my sister on terms of friendship I have known him well and long Sadie therefore I speak Sadie Ried was never fretful never petulant and very rarely angry but when she was it was a genuine case of unrestrained rage and woe to the individual who fell a victim to her blazing eyes and sarcastic tongue To night doctor Van Anden was that victim What right had he to arraign her before him and say with whom she should or should not associate as if he were indeed her very grandfather What business had he to think that she was too friendly with doctor Douglass With the usual honesty belonging to very angry people it had not once occurred to her that doctor Van Anden had said and done none of these things When she felt that her voice was sufficiently steady she spoke I am happy to be able to reassure you doctor Van Anden you are very kind extremely so but as yet I really feel myself in no danger from doctor Douglass fascinations however remarkable they may be My mother and I enjoy excellent health at present so you need have no anxiety as regards our choice of physicians although it is but natural that you should feel nervous perhaps but you will pardon me for saying that I consider your interference with my affairs unwarrantable and uncalled for If doctor Van Anden desired to reply to this insulting harangue there was no opportunity for at this moment they whirled around the corner and were at home Sadie flung aside her hat with an angry vehemence and seating herself at the piano literally stormed the keys while the Doctor re entered his carriage and quietly proceeded to his evening round of calls What a whirlwind of rage there was in Sadie s heart What earthly right had this man whom she detested to give her advice Was she a child to be commanded by any one What right had any one to speak in that way of doctor Douglass He was a gentleman certainly much more of a one than doctor Van Anden had shown himself to be and she liked him yes and she would like him in spite of a whole legion of envious doctors A light step crossed the hall and entered the parlor Sadie merely raised her eyes long enough to be certain that doctor Douglass stood beside her and continued her playing He leaned over the piano and listened Had you a pleasant ride he asked as the tone of the music lulled a little Charming Sadie s voice was full of emphasis and sarcasm I judged by the style of music which you were playing that there must have been a hurricane Nothing of the sort only a little paternal advice Indeed Have you been taken into his kindly care I congratulate you Sadie was still very angry or she would never have been guilty of the shocking impropriety of her next remark But it is a lamentable fact that people will say and do very strange things when they are angry things of which they have occasion to repent in cooler moments Fixing her bright eyes full and searchingly on doctor Douglass she said abruptly He was warning me against the impropriety of associating with your dangerous self A look as of sadness and deep pain crossed doctor Douglass face and he thought aloud rather than said Is that man determined I shall have no friends Sadie was touched she struck soft sweet chords with a slow and gentle movement as she asked What is your offense in his eyes doctor Douglass Then indeed doctor Douglass seemed embarrassed maintaining though a sort of hesitating dignity as he attempted a reply Why I he I would rather not tell you Miss Ried it sounds badly Then with a little slightly mournful laugh And that half admission sounds badly too worse than the simple truth perhaps Well then I had the misfortune to cross his path professionally once a little matter a slight mistake not worth repeating neither would I repeat it if it were in honor to him He is a man of skill and since then has risen high one would not suppose that he would give that little incident of the past a thought now but he seems never to have forgiven me The music stopped entirely and Sadie s great truthful eyes were fixed in horror on his face Is it possible she said at length that that is all and he can bear such determined ill will toward you and they call him an earnest Christian At which remark doctor Douglass laughed a low quick laugh as if he found it quite impossible to restrain his mirth and then became instantly grave and said I beg your pardon For what doctor Douglass and why did you laugh For laughing and I laughed because I could not restrain a feeling of amusement at your innocently connecting his unpleasant state of mind with his professions of Christianity Should they not be connected Well that depends upon how much importance you attach to them doctor Douglass what do you mean Treason I suspect viewed from your standpoint and therefore it would be much more proper for me not to talk about it But I want you to talk about it Do you mean to say that you have no faith in any one s religion How much have you doctor Douglass that is a very Yankee way of answering a question I know but it is the easiest way of reaching my point so I repeat How much faith have you in these Christian professions or in other words how many professing Christians do you know who are particularly improved in your estimation by their professions The old questioning of Sadie s own heart brought before her again Oh Christian sister with whom so many years of her life had been spent with whom she had been so closely connected if she could but have turned to you and remembering your earnest life your honest endeavors toward the right your earnest struggles with sin and self the evident marks of the Lord Jesus all about you and remembering this have quelled the tempter in human form who stood waiting for a verdict with a determined I have known one what might not have been gained for your side that night CHAPTER XII THREE PEOPLE As it was she hesitated and thought not of Ester her life had not been such as to be counted for a moment of her mother Well missus Ried s religion had been of a negative rather than of a positive sort at least outwardly She never spoke much of these matters and Sadie positively did not know whether she ever prayed or not How was she to decide whether the gentle patient life was the outgrowth of religion in her heart or whether it was a natural sweetness of disposition and tenderness of feeling Then there was doctor Van Anden an hour ago she would surely have said him but now it was impossible so as the silence and the peculiar smile on doctor Douglass face grew uncomfortable she answered hurriedly I don t know many Christian people Doctor And then more truthfully But I don t consider those with whom I am acquainted in any degree remarkable yet at the same time I don t choose to set down the entire Christian world as a company of miserable hypocrites Not at all the Doctor answered quickly I assure you I have many friends among that class of people whom I respect and esteem but since you have pressed me to continue this conversation I must frankly confess to you that my esteem is not based on the fact that they are called Christians I but Miss Ried this is entirely unlike and beneath me to interfere with and shake your innocent trusting faith I would not do it for the world Sadie interrupted him with an impatient shake of her head Don t talk nonsense doctor Douglass if you can help it I don t feel innocent at all just now at least and I have no particular faith to shake if I had I hope you would not consider it such a flimsy material as to be shaken by any thing which you have said as yet I certainly have heard no arguments Occasionally I think of these matters and I have been surprised and not a little puzzled to note the strange inconsistency existing between the profession and practice of these people If you have any explanation I should like to hear it that is all Clearly this man must use at least the semblance of sense if he were going to continue the conversation His answer was grave and guarded I have offered no arguments nor do I mean to I was apologizing for having touched upon this matter at all I am unfortunate in my belief or rather disbelief but it is no part of my intention to press it upon others I incline to the opinion that there are some very good nice pleasant people in the world whom the accidents of birth and education have taught to believe that they are aided in this goodness and pleasantness by a more than human power and this belief rather helps than otherwise to mature their naturally sweet pure lives My explanation of their seeming inconsistencies is that they have never realized the full moral force of the rules which they profess to follow I divide the world into two distinct classes the so called Christian world I mean Those whom I have just named constitute one class and the other is composed of unmitigated hypocrites Now my friend I have talked longer on this subject than I like or than I ought I beg you will forget all I have said and give me some music to close the scene Sadie laughed and ran her fingers lightly over the keys but she asked In which class do you place your brother in the profession Doctor doctor Douglass drew his shoulder into a very slight though expressive shrug as he answered It is exceedingly proper and also rather rare for a physician to be eminent not only for skill but piety and my brother practitioner is a wise and wary man who and here he paused abruptly Miss Ried he added after a moment in an entirely changed tone Which of us is at fault to night you or myself that I seem bent on making uncharitable remarks I really did not imagine myself so totally depraved And to be serious I am very sorry that this style of conversation was ever commenced I did not intend it I do not believe in interfering with the beliefs or controverting the opinions of others Apparently Sadie had recovered her good humor for her laugh was as light and careless as usual when she made answer Don t distress yourself unnecessarily doctor Douglass you haven t done me the least harm I assure you I don t believe a word you say and I do you the honor of believing that you don t credit more than two thirds of it yourself Now I m going to play you the stormiest piece of music you ever heard in your life And the keys rattled and rang under her touch and drew half a dozen loungers from the halls to the parlor and effectually ended the conversation Three people belonging to that household held each a conversation with their own thoughts that night which to finite eyes would have aided the right wonderfully had it been said before the assembled three instead of in the quiet and privacy of their own rooms Sadie had calmed down and as a natural consequence was somewhat ashamed of herself and as she rolled up and pinned and otherwise snugged her curls into order for the night scolded herself after this fashion Sadie Ried you made a simpleton of yourself in that speech which you made to doctor Van Anden to night because you think a man interferes with what doesn t concern him is no reason why you should grow flushed and angry and forget that you re a lady You said some very rude and insulting words and you know your poor dear mother would tell you so if she knew any thing about it which she won t that s one comfort and besides you have probably offended those delightful black ponies and it will be forever before they will take you another ride and that s worse than all the rest But who would think of doctor Van Anden being such a man I wish doctor Douglass had gone to Europe before he told me it was rather pleasant to believe in the extreme goodness of somebody I wonder how much of that nonsense which doctor Douglass talks he believes any way Perhaps he is half right only I m not going to think any such thing because it would be wicked and I m good And because in a graver tone and with a little reverent touch of an old worn book which lay on her bureau this is my father s Bible and he lived and died by its precepts Up another flight of stairs in his own room doctor Douglass lighted his cigar fixed himself comfortably in his arm chair with his feet on the dressing table and between the puffs talked after this fashion Sorry we ran into this miserable train of talk to night but that young witch leads a man on so I m glad she has a decided mind of her own one feels less conscience stricken I m what they call a skeptic myself but after all I don t quite like to see a lady become one I shan t lead her astray I wouldn t have said any thing to night if it hadn t been for that miserable hypocrite of a Van Anden the fellow must learn not to pitch into me if he wants to be let alone but I doubt if he accomplished much this time What a witch she is And doctor Douglass removed his cigar long enough to give vent to a hearty laugh in remembrance of some of Sadie s remarks Just across the hall doctor Van Anden sat before his table one hand partly shading his eyes from the gaslight while he read And the words which he read were these O let not the oppressed returned ashamed let the poor and needy praise thy name Arise O God plead thine own cause remember how the foolish man reproacheth thee daily Forget not the voice of thine enemies the tumult of those that rise up against thee increaseth continually Something troubled the Doctor to night his usually grave face was tinged with sadness Presently he arose and paced with slow measured tread up and down the room I ought to have done it he said at last I ought to have told her mother that he was in many ways an unsafe companion for Sadie especially in this matter he is a very cautious guarded fascinating skeptic all the more fascinating because he will be careful not to shock her taste with any boldly spoken errors I should have warned them how came I to shrink so miserably from my duty What mattered it that they would be likely to ascribe a wrong motive to my caution It was none the less my duty on that account And the sad look deepened on his face as he marched slowly back and forth but he was nearer a solution of his difficulties than was either of those others for at last he came over to his chair again and sank before it on his knees Now let us understand these three people each of them in their separate ways were making mistakes Sadie had said that she was not going to believe any of the nonsense which doctor Douglass talked she honestly supposed that she was not influenced in the least And yet she was mistaken the poison had entered her soul As the days passed on she found herself more frequently caviling over the shortcomings of professing Christians more quick to detect their mistakes and failures more willing to admit the half uttered thought that this entire matter might be a smooth sounding fable Sadie was the child of many prayers and her father s much used Bible lay on her dressing table speaking for him now that his tongue was silent in the grave so she did not quite yield to the enemy but she was walking in the way of temptation and the Christian tongues around her which the grave had not silenced yet remained as mute as though their lips were already sealed and so the path in which Sadie walked grew daily broader and more dangerous Then there was doctor Douglass not by any means the worst man that the world can produce He was or fancied himself to be a skeptic Like many a young man wise in his own conceit he had no very distinct idea of what he was skeptical about nor to what hights of illogical nonsense his own supposed views carried out would lead him like many another too he had studied rhetoric and logic and mathematics and medicine thoroughly and well he would have hesitated long and studied hard and pondered deeply before he had ventured to dispute an established point in surgery And yet with the inconsistent folly of the age he had absurdly set his seal to the falsity of the Bible after giving it at most but a careless reading here and there and without having ever once honestly made use of the means by which God has promised to enlighten the seekers after knowledge And yet his eyes being blinded he did not realize how absurd and unreasonable how utterly foolish was his conduct He thought himself sincere he had no desire to lead Sadie astray from her early education and like most skeptical natures he quite prided himself upon the care with which he guarded his peculiar views although I could never see why that was being any other than miserably selfish or inconsistent for it is saying in effect one of two things either My belief is sacred to myself alone and nobody else shall have the benefit of it if I can help it or else I am very much ashamed of my position as a skeptic and I shall keep it to myself as much as possible Be that as it may doctor Douglass so thought and was sincere in his intentions to do Sadie no harm yet as the days came and went he was continually doing her injury They were much in each other s society and the subject which he meant should be avoided was constantly intruding Both were so constantly on the alert to see and hear the unwise and inconsistent and unchristian acts and words and also alas there were so many to be seen and heard that these two made rapid strides in the broad road Finally there was doctor Van Anden carrying about with him a sad and heavy heart He could but feel that he had shrunken from his duty hidden behind that most miserable of all excuses What will people think If doctor Douglass had had any title but that particular one prefixed to his name he would not have hesitated to have advised missus Ried concerning him but how could he endure the suspicion that he was jealous of doctor Douglass Then in trying to right the wrong by warning Sadie he was made to realize as many a poor Christian has realized before him that he was making the sacrifice too late and in vain There was yet another thing doctor Douglass statements to Sadie had been colored with truth Among his other honest mistakes was the belief that doctor Van Anden was a hypocrite They had clashed in former years doctor Douglass had been most in the wrong though what man unhelped by Christ was ever known to believe this of himself But there had been wrong also on the other side hasty words spoken words which rankled and were rankling still after the lapse of years doctor Van Anden had never said I should not have spoken thus I am sorry He had taught himself to believe that it would be an unnecessary humiliation for him to say this to a man who had so deeply wronged him But to do our doctor justice time had healed the wound with him it was not personal enmity which prompted his warning neither had he any idea of the injury which those sharp words of his were doing in the unsanctified heart And when he dropped upon his knees that night he prayed earnestly for the conversion of Sadie and doctor Douglass So these three lived their lives under that same roof and guessed not what the end might be CHAPTER XIII THE STRANGE CHRISTIAN Abbie said Ester wriggling herself around from before an open trunk and letting a mass of collars and cuffs slide to the floor in her earnestness do you know I think you re the very strangest girl I ever knew in my life I m sure I did not Abbie answered gaily If it s a nice strange do tell me about it I like to be nice ever so much Well but I am in earnest Abbie you certainly are These very collars made me think of it Oh dear me they are all on the floor And she reached after the shining sliding things Abbie came and sat down beside her presently with a mass of puffy lace in her hands which she was putting into shape Suppose we have a little talk all about myself she said gently and seriously And please tell me Ester plainly and simply what you mean by the term strange Do you know I have heard it so often that sometimes I fear I really am painfully unlike other people You are just the one to enlighten me Ester laughed a little as she answered You are taking the matter very seriously I did not mean any thing dreadful Ah but you are not to be excused in that way my dear Ester I look to you for information Mother has made the remark a great many times but it is generally connected in some way with religious topics and mother you know is not a Christian therefore I have thought that perhaps some things seemed strange to her which would not to you for instance But since you have been here you have spoken your surprise concerning me several times and looked it oftener and to day I find that even my stiff and glossy and every way proper collars and cuffs excite it So do please tell me ought I to be in a lunatic asylum somewhere instead of preparing to go to Europe Now although Ester laughed again at the mixture of comic and pathetic in Abbie s tone yet something in the words had evidently embarrassed her There was a little struggle in her mind and then she came boldly forth with her honest thoughts Well the strangeness is connected with religious topics in my mind also even though I am a professing Christian I do not understand you I am an economist in dress you know Abbie I don t care for these things in the least but if I had the money as you have there are a great many things which I should certainly have You see there is no earthly sense in your economy and yet you hesitate over expenses almost as much as I do There was a little gleam of mischief in Abbie s eyes as she answered Will you tell me Ester why you would take the trouble to get these things if you do not care for them in the least Why because because they would be proper and befitting my station in life Do I dress in a manner unbecoming to my station in life No said Ester promptly admiring even then the crimson finishings of her cousin s morning robe But then Well Abbie do you think it is wicked to like nice things No Abbie answered very gently but I think it is wrong to school ourselves into believing that we do not care for any thing of the kind when in reality it is a higher better motive which deters us from having many things Forgive me Ester but I think you are unjust sometimes to your better self in this very way Ester gave a little start and realized for the first time in her life that truth loving girl though she was she had been practicing a pretty little deception of this kind and actually palming it off on herself In a moment however she returned to the charge But Abbie did Aunt Helen really want you to have that pearl velvet we saw at Stewart s She really did And you refused it And I refused it Well is that to be set down as a matter of religion too This question was asked with very much of Ester s old sharpness of tone Abbie answered her with a look of amazement I think we don t understand each other she said at length with the gentlest of tones That dress Ester with all its belongings could not have cost less than seven hundred dollars Could I a follower of the meek and lowly Jesus living in a world where so many of his poor are suffering have been guilty of wearing such a dress as that My dear I don t think you sustain the charge against me thus far I see now how these pretty little collar and by the way Ester you are crushing one of them against that green box suggested the thought but you surely do not consider it strange when I have such an array of collars already that I did not pay thirty dollars for that bit of a cobweb which we saw yesterday But Aunt Helen wanted you to A sad and troubled look stole over Abbie s face as she answered My mother remember dear Ester does not realize that she is not her own but has been bought with a price You and I know and feel that we must give an account of our stewardship Ester do you see how people who ask God to help them in every little thing which they have to decide in the least expenditure of money can after that deliberately fritter it away Do you ask God s help in these matters Why certainly with the wondering look in her eyes which Ester had learned to know and dislike Whatsoever therefore ye do you know But Abbie going out shopping to buy handkerchiefs for instance that seems to me a very small thing to pray about Even the purchase of handkerchiefs may involve a question of conscience my dear Ester as you would realize if you had seen the wicked purchases that I have in that line and some way I never can feel that any thing that has to do with me is of less importance than a tiny sparrow and yet you know He looks after them Abbie do you mean to say that in every little thing that you buy you weigh the subject and discuss the right and wrong of it I certainly do try to find out just exactly what is right and then do it and it seems to me there is no act in this world so small as to be neither right nor wrong Then said Ester with an impatient twitch of her dress from under Abbie s rocker I don t see the use in being rich Nobody is rich Ester only God but I m so glad sometimes that he has trusted me with so much of his wealth that I feel like praying a prayer about that one thing a thanksgiving What else am I strange about Ester Everything with growing impatience I think it was as queer in you as possible not to go to the concert last evening with Uncle Ralph But Ester it was prayer meeting evening Well suppose it was There is prayer meeting every week and there isn t this particular singer very often and Uncle Ralph was disappointed I thought you believed in honoring your parents You forget dear Ester that father said he was particularly anxious that I should do as I thought right and that he should not have purchased the tickets if he had remembered the meeting Father likes consistency Well that is just the point I want to know if you call it inconsistent to leave your prayer meeting for just one evening no matter for what reason Abbie laughed in answer Do you know Ester you wouldn t make a good lawyer you don t stick to the point It isn t a great many reasons that might be suggested that we are talking about it is simply a concert Then more gravely I try to be very careful about this matter So many detentions are constantly occurring in the city that unless the line were very closely drawn I should not get to prayer meeting at all There are occasions of course when I must be detained but under ordinary circumstances it must be more than a concert that detains me I don t believe in making religion such a very solemn matter as that all amounts to it has a tendency to drive people away from it The look on Abbie s face in answer to this testily spoken sentence was a mixture of bewilderment and pain I don t understand she said at length How is that a solemn matter If we really expect to meet our Savior at a prayer meeting isn t it a delightful thought I am very happy when I can go to the place of prayer Ester s voice savored decidedly of the one which she was wont to use in her very worst moods in that long dining room at home Of course I should have remembered that mister Foster would be at the prayer meeting and not at the concert that was reason enough for your enjoyment The rich blood surged in waves over Abbie s face during this rude address but she said not a single word in answer After a little silence she spoke in a voice that trembled with feeling Ester there is one thought in connection with this subject that troubles me very much Do you really think as you have intimated that I am selfish that I consult my own tastes and desires too much and so do injury to the cause For instance do you think I prejudiced my father What a sweet humble even tearful face it was And what a question to ask of Ester What had developed this disagreeable state of mind save the confused upbraidings of her hitherto quiet conscience over the contrast between Cousin Abbie s life and hers Here in the very face of her theories to the contrary in very defiance to her belief in the folly and fashion and worldliness that prevailed in the city in the very heart of this great city set down in the midst of wealth and temptation had she found this young lady daughter of one of the merchant princes the almost bride of one of the brightest stars in the New York galaxy on the eve of a brilliant departure for foreign shores with a whirl of preparation and excitement about her enough to dizzy the brain of a dozen ordinary mortals yet moving sweetly brightly quietly through it all and manifestly finding her highest source of enjoyment in the presence of and daily communion with her Savior All Ester s speculations concerning her had come to naught She had planned the wardrobe of the bride over and over again for days before she saw her and while she had prepared proper little lectures for her on the folly and sinfulness of fashionable attire had yet delighted in the prospect of the beauty and elegance around her How had her prospects been blighted Beauty there certainly was in everything but it was the beauty of simplicity not at all such a display of silks and velvets and jewels as Ester had planned It certainly could not be wealth which made Abbie s life such a happy one for she regulated her expenses with a care and forethought such as Ester had never even dreamed of It could not be a life of ease a freedom from annoyance which kept her bright and sparkling for it had only taken a week s sojourn in her Aunt Helen s home to discover to Ester the fact that all wealthy people were not necessarily amiable and delightful Abbie was evidently rasped and thwarted in a hundred little ways having a hundred little trials which she had never been called upon to endure In short Ester had discovered that the mere fact of living in a great city was not in itself calculated to make the Christian race more easy or more pleasant She had begun to suspect that it might not even be quite so easy as it was in a quiet country home and so one by one all her explanations of Abbie s peculiar character had become bubbles and had vanished as bubbles do What then sustained and guided her cousin Clearly Ester was shut up to this one conclusion it was an ever abiding all pervading Christian faith and trust But then had not she this same faith And yet could any contrast be greater than was Abbie s life contrasted with hers There was no use in denying it no use in lulling and coaxing her conscience any longer it had been for one whole week in a new atmosphere it had roused itself it was not thoroughly awake as yet but restless and nervous and on the alert and would not be hushed back into its lethargic state This it was which made Ester the uncomfortable companion which she was this morning She was not willing to be shaken and roused she had been saying very unkind rude things to Abbie and now instead of flouncing off in an uncontrollable fit of indignation which course Ester could but think would be the most comfortable thing which could happen next so far as she was concerned Abbie sat still with that look of meek inquiry on her face humbly awaiting her verdict How Ester wished she had never asked that last question How ridiculous it would make her appear after all that had been said to admit that her cousin s life had been one continual reproach of her own that concerning this very matter of the concert she had heard Uncle Ralph remark that if all the world matched what they did with what they said as well as Abbie did he was not sure but he might be a Christian himself Then suppose she should add that this very pointed remark had been made to her when they were on their way to the concert in question Altogether Ester was disgusted and wished she could get back to where the conversation commenced feeling certain now that she would leave a great many things unsaid I do not know how the conversation would have ended whether Ester could have brought herself to the plain truth and been led on and on to explain the unrest and dissatisfaction of her own heart and thus have saved herself much of the sharp future in store for her but one of those unfortunate interruptions which seem to finite eyes to be constantly occurring now came to them There was an unusual bang to the front door the sound of strange footsteps in the hall the echo of a strange voice floated up to her and Abbie with a sudden flinging of thimble and scissors and an exclamation of Ralph has come vanished CHAPTER XIV THE LITTLE CARD Left to herself Ester found her train of thought so thoroughly disagreeable that she hastened to rid herself of it and seized upon the new comer to afford her a substitute This cousin whom she had expected to influence for good had at last arrived Ester s interest in him had been very strong ever since that evening of her arrival when she had been appealed to to use her influence on him just in what way she hadn t an idea Abbie had never spoken of it since and seemed to have lost much of her eager desire that the cousins should meet Ester mused about all this now she wished she knew just in what way she was expected to be of benefit Abbie was evidently troubled about him Perhaps he was rough and awkward school boys often were even those born in a city Very much of Ralph s life had been spent away from home she knew and she had often heard that boys away from home influences grew rude and coarse oftentimes Yes that was undoubtedly it Shy too he was of course he was of about the age to be that She could imagine just how he looked he felt out of place in the grand mansion which he called home but where he had passed so small a portion of his time Probably he didn t know what to do with his hands nor his feet and just as likely as not he sat on the edge of his chair and ate with his knife school was a horrid place for picking up all sorts of ill manners Of course all these things must annoy Abbie very much especially at this time when he must necessarily come so often in contact with that perfection of gentlemanliness mister Foster I wish thought Ester at this point growing a little anxious I wish there was more than a week before the wedding however I ll do my best Abbie shall see I m good for something Although I do differ with her somewhat in her peculiar views I believe I know how to conduct myself with ease in almost any position if I have been brought up in the country And by the time the lunch bell rang a girl more thoroughly satisfied with herself and her benevolent intentions than was this same Ester could hardly have been found She stood before the glass smoothing the shining bands of hair preparatory to tying a blue satin ribbon over them when Abbie fluttered in Forgive me a great many times for rushing off in the flutter I did and leaving you behind and staying away so long You see I haven t seen Ralph in quite a little time and I forgot everything else Your hair doesn t need another bit of brushing Ester it s as smooth as velvet they are all waiting for us in the dining room and I want to show you to Ralph And before the blue satin ribbon was tied quite to her satisfaction Ester was hurried to the dining room to take up her new role of guide and general assistant to the awkward youth I suppose he hasn t an idea what to say to me was her last compassionate thought as Abbie s hand rested on the knob I hope he won t be hopelessly quiet but I ll manage in some way At first he was nowhere to be seen but as Abbie said eagerly Ralph here is Cousin Ester the door swung back into its place and revealed a tall well proportioned young man with a full bearded face and the brightest of dancing eyes He came forward immediately extending both hands and speaking in a rapid voice Long hoped for come at last I don t refer to myself you understand but to this much waited for eagerly looked forward to prospect of greeting my Cousin Ester Ought I to welcome you or you me which is it I m somewhat bewildered as to proprieties This fearfully near approach to a wedding has confused my brain Sis turning suddenly to Abbie Have you prepared Ester for her fate Does she fully understand that she and I are to officiate that is if we don t evaporate before the eventful day Sis how could you have the conscience to perpetrate a wedding in August Whatever takes Foster abroad just now any way And without waiting for answer to his ceaseless questions he ran gaily on Clearly whatever might be his shortcomings inability to talk was not one of them And Ester confused bewildered utterly thrown out of her prepared part in the entertainment was more silent and awkward than she had ever known herself to be provoked too with Abbie with Ralph with herself How could I have been such a simpleton she asked herself as seated opposite her cousin at table she had opportunity to watch the handsome face with its changeful play of expression and note the air of pleased attention with which even her Uncle Ralph listened to his ceaseless flow of words I knew he was older than Abbie and that this was his third year in college What could I have expected from Uncle Ralph s son A pretty dunce he must think me blushing and stammering like an awkward country girl What on earth could Abbie mean about needing my help for him and being troubled about him It is some of her ridiculous fanatical nonsense I suppose I wish she could ever talk or act like anybody else I don t know that such is the case however Ralph was saying when Ester returned from this rehearsal of her own thoughts I can simply guess at it which is as near an approach to an exertion as a fellow ought to be obliged to make in this weather John you may fill my glass if you please Father this is even better wine than your cellar usually affords and that is saying a great deal Sis has Foster made a temperance man of you entirely I see you are devoted to ice water Oh certainly missus Ried answered for her in the half contemptuous tone she was wont to assume on such occasions I warn you Ralph to get all the enjoyment you can out of the present for Abbie intends to keep you with her entirely after she has a home of her own out of the reach of temptation Ester glanced hurriedly and anxiously toward her cousin How did this pet scheme of hers become known to missus Ried and how could Abbie possibly retain her habitual self control under this sarcastic ridicule which was so apparent in her mother s voice The pink on her cheek did deepen perceptibly but she answered with the most perfect good humor Ralph don t be frightened please I shall let you out once in a long while if you are very good Ralph bent loving eyes on the young sweet face and made prompt reply I don t know that I shall care for even that reprieve since you re to be jailer What could there be in this young man to cause anxiety or to wish changed Yet even while Ester queried he passed his glass for a third filling and taking note just then of Abbie s quick pained look then downcast eyes and deeply flushing face the knowledge came suddenly that in that wine glass the mischief lay Abbie thought him in danger and this was the meaning of her unfinished sentence on that first evening and her embarrassed silence since for Ester with her filled glass always beside her plate untouched indeed sometimes but oftener sipped from in response to her uncle s invitation was not the one from whom help could be expected in this matter And Ester wondered if the handsome face opposite her could really be in absolute danger or whether this was another of Abbie s whims at least it wasn t pleasant to be drinking wine before him and she left her glass untouched that day and felt thoroughly troubled about that and everything The next morning there was a shopping excursion and Ralph was smuggled in as an attendant Abbie turned over the endless sets of handkerchiefs in bewildering indecision Take this box do Abbie Ester urged This monogram in the corner is lovely and that is the dearest little sprig in the world Which is precisely what troubles me laughed Abbie It is entirely too dear Think of paying such an enormous sum for just handkerchiefs Ralph who was lounging near her trying hard not to look bored elevated his eyebrows as his ear caught the sentence and addressed her in undertone Is Foster hard up If he is you are not on his hands yet Sis and I m inclined to think father is good for all the finery you may happen to fancy That only shows your ignorance of the subject or your high opinion of me I assure you were I so disposed I could bring father s affairs into a fearful tangle this very day just by indulging a fancy for finery Are his affairs precarious Abbie or is finery prodigious Abbie laid her hand on a square of cobwebby lace That is seventy five dollars Ralph What of that Do you want it And Ralph s hand was in his pocket Abbie turned with almost a shiver from the counter I hope not Ralph she said with sudden energy I hope I may never be so unworthy of my trust as to make such a wicked use of money Then more lightly You are worse than Queen Ester here and her advice is bewildering enough But Abbie how can you be so absurd said that young lady returning to the charge Those are not very expensive I am sure at least not for you and you certainly want some very nice ones I m sure if I had one third of your spending money I shouldn t need to hesitate Abbie s voice was very low and sweet and reached only her cousin s ear Ester the silver and the gold are His and I have asked Him this very morning to help me in every little item to be careful of His trust Now do you think But Ester had turned away in a vexed uncomfortable state of mind and walked quite to the other end of the store leaving Abbie to complete her purchases as she might see fit She leaned against the door tapping her fingers in a very softly but very nervous manner against the glass How queer it was that in the smallest matters she and Abbie could not agree How was it possible that the same set of rules could govern them both And the old ever recurring question came up to be thought over afresh Clearly they were unlike utterly unlike Now was Abbie right and she wrong or was Abbie no not wrong the word would certainly not apply there absolutely could be no wrong connected with Abbie s way Well then queer unlike other people unnecessarily precise studying the right and wrong of matters which she had been wont to suppose had no moral bearing of any sort rather which she had never given any attention to While she waited and queried her eye caught a neat little card receiver hanging near her apparently filled with cards and bearing in gilt lettering just above them the winning words FREE TO ALL TAKE ONE This was certainly a kindly invitation and Ester s curiosity being aroused as to what all this might be for she availed herself of the invitation and drew with dainty fingers a small neat card from the case and read I SOLEMNLY AGREE As God Shall Help Me one To observe regular seasons of secret prayer it least in the morning and evening of each day two To read daily at least a small portion of the Bible three To attend at one or more prayer meetings every week if I have strength to get there four To stand up for Jesus always and everywhere five To try to save at least one soul each year six To engage in no amusement where my Savior could not be a guest Had the small bit of card board been a coal of fire it could not have been more suddenly dropped upon the marble before her than was this as Ester s startled eyes took in its meaning Who could have written those sentences and to be placed there in a conspicuous corner of a fashionable store Was she never to be at peace again Had the world gone wild Was this an emanation from Cousin Abbie s brain or were there many more Cousin Abbies in what she had supposed was a wicked city or oh painful question which came back hourly nowadays and seemed fairly to chill her blood was this religion and had she none of it Was her profession a mockery her life a miserably acted lie Is that thing hot It was Ralph s amused voice which asked this question close beside her What Where And Ester turned in dire confusion Why that bit of paper or is it a ghostly communication from the world of spirits You look startled enough for me to suppose anything and it spun away from your grasp very suddenly Oh he added as he glanced it through rather ghostly I must confess or would be if one were inclined that way but I imagined your nerves were stronger Did the pronoun startle you How Why I thought perhaps you considered yourself committed to all this solemnity before your time or willy nilly as the children say What a comical idea to hang one s self up in a store in this fashion I must have one of these Are you going to keep yours And as he spoke he reached forward and possessed himself of one of the cards Rather odd things to be found in our possession wouldn t they be Abbie now would be just one of this sort That cold shiver trembled again through Ester s frame as she listened Clearly he did not reckon her one of that sort He had known her but one day and yet he seemed positive that she stood on an equal footing with himself Oh why was it How did he know Was her manner then utterly unlike that of a Christian so much so that this young man saw it already or was it that glass of wine from which she had sipped last evening and at this moment she would have given much to be back where she thought herself two weeks ago on the wine question but she stood silent and let him talk on not once attempting to define her position partly because there had crept into her mind this fearful doubt unaccompanied by the prayer If I ve never loved before Help me to begin to day and partly oh poor Ester because she was utterly unused to confessing her Savior and though not exactly ashamed of him at least she would have indignantly denied the charge yet it was much less confusing to keep silence and let others think as they would this had been her rule she followed it now and Ralph continued Queer world this Isn t it How do you imagine our army would have prospered if one fourth of the soldiers had been detailed for the purpose of coaxing the rest to follow their leader and obey orders That s what it seems to me the so called Christian world is up to Does the comical side of it ever strike you Ester Positively I can hardly keep from laughing now and then to hear the way in which doctor Downing pitches into his church members and they sit and take it as meekly as lambs brought to the slaughter It does them about as much good apparently as it does me no not so much for it amuses me and serves to make me good natured on good terms with myself for half an hour or so I m so thoroughly rejoiced you see to think that I don t belong to that set of miserable sinners doctor Downing does preach very sharp harsh sermons Ester said at last feeling the necessity of saying something I have often wondered at it I think them calculated to do more harm than good Oh I don t wonder at it in the least I d make it sharper yet if I were he the necessity exists evidently The wonder lies in that to my mind If a fellow really means to do a thing what does he wait to be punched up about it everlastingly for Hang me if I don t like to see people act as though they meant it even if the question is a religious one Ester how many times ought I to beg your pardon for using an unknown tongue in other words slang phrases I fancied myself talking to my chum delivering a lecture on theology which is somewhat out of my sphere as you have doubtless observed Yet such people as you and I can t help having eyes and ears and using them now and then can we Still silence on Ester s part so far as defining her position was concerned She was not ashamed of her Savior now but of herself If this gay cousin s eyes were critical she knew she could not bear the test Yet she rallied sufficiently to condemn within her own mind the poor little cards They will do more harm than good she told herself positively To such young men as Ralph for instance what could he possibly want with one of them save to make it a subject of ridicule when he got with some of his wild companions But it transpired that his designs were not so very wicked after all for as they left the store he took the little card from his pocket and handed it to Abbie with a quiet Sis here is something that you will like And Abbie read it and said How solemn that is Did you get it for me Ralph Thank you And Ralph bowed and smiled on her a kind almost tender smile very unlike the roguish twinkle that had shone in his eyes while he talked with Ester All through the busy day that silent solemn card haunted Ester It pertinaciously refused to be lost She dropped it twice in their transit from store to store but Ralph promptly returned it to her At home she laid it on her dressing table but piled scarfs and handkerchiefs and gloves over it as high as she might it was sure to flutter to the floor at her feet as she sought hurriedly in the mass of confusion for some missing article Once she seized and flung it from the window in dire vexation and was rewarded by having Maggie present it to her about two minutes thereafter as a something that landed square on my head ma am as I was coming around the corner At last she actually grew nervous over it felt almost afraid to touch it so thoroughly had it fastened itself on her conscience These great black letters in that first sentence seemed burned into her brain I solemnly agree as God shall help me At last she deposited the unwelcome little monitor at the very bottom of her collar box under some unused collars telling herself that it was for safe keeping that she might not lose it again not letting her conscience say for a moment that it was because she wanted to bury the haunting words out of her sight CHAPTER XV WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE Ester stood before her mirror arranging some disordered braids of hair She had come up from the dining room for that purpose It was just after dinner The family with the addition of mister Foster were gathered in the back parlor whither she was in haste to join them How things do conspire to hinder me she exclaimed impatiently as one loose hair pin after another slid softly and silently out of place This horrid ribbon doesn t shade with the trimming on my dress either I wonder what can have become of that blue one With a jerk Sadie s finery box was produced and the contents tumbled over The methodical and orderly Ester was in nervous haste to get down to that fascinating family group but the blue ribbon with the total depravity of all ribbons remained a silent and indifferent spectator of her trials snugged back in the corner of a half open drawer Ester had set her heart on finding it and the green collar box came next under inspection and being impatiently shoved back toward its corner when the quest proved vain took that opportunity for tumbling over the floor and showering its contents right and left What next I wonder Ester muttered as she stooped to scoop up the disordered mass of collars ruffles cuffs laces and the like and with them came face up and bright black letters scorching into her very soul the little card with its I solemnly agree as God shall help me Ester paused in her work and stood upright with a strange beating at her heart What did this mean Was it merely chance that this sentence had so persistently met her eye all this day put the card where she would And what was the matter with her anyway Why should those words have such strange power over her why had she tried to rid herself of the sight of them She read each sentence aloud slowly and carefully Now she said decisively half irritated that she was allowing herself to be hindered it is time to put an end to this nonsense I am sick and tired of feeling as I have of late these are all very reasonable and proper pledges at least the most of them are I believe I ll adopt this card Yes I will that is what has been the trouble with me I ve neglected my duty rather I have so much care and work at home that I haven t time to attend to it properly but here it is different It is quite time I commenced right in these things To night when I come to my room I will begin No I can not do that either for Abbie will be with me Well the first opportunity then that I have or no I ll stop now this minute and read a chapter in the Bible and pray there is nothing like the present moment for keeping a good resolution I like decision in everything and I dare say Abbie will be very willing to have a quiet talk with mister Foster before I come down And sincerely desirous to be at peace with her newly troubled conscience and sincerely sure that she was in the right way for securing that peace Ester closed and locked her door and sat herself down by the open window in a thoroughly self satisfied state of mind to read the Bible and to pray Poor human heart so utterly unconscious of its own deep sickness so willing to plaster over the unhealed wound Where should she read She was at all times a random reader of the Bible but now with this new era it was important that there should be a more definite aim in her reading She turned the leaves rapidly eager to find a book which looked inviting for the occasion and finally seized upon the Gospel of John as entirely proper and appropriate and industriously commenced In the beginning was the Word and the Word was with God and the Word was God The same was in the beginning with God Now that wretched hair pin is falling out again as sure as I live I don t see what is the matter with my hair to day I never had so much trouble with it All things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made In him was life and the life was the light of men There are mister and Miss Hastings I wonder if they are going to call here I wish they would I should like to get a nearer view of that trimming around her sack it is lovely whatever it is And the light shineth in darkness and the darkness comprehended it not Now it was doubtful if it had once occurred to Ester who this glorious Word was or that He had aught to do with her Certainly the wonderful and gracious truths embodied in these precious verses truths which had to do with every hour of her life had not this evening so much as made an entrance into her busy brain and yet she actually thought herself in the way of getting rid of the troublesome thoughts that had haunted her the days just past The verses were being read aloud the thoughts about the troublesome hair and the trimmings on Miss Hastings sack were suffered to remain thoughts not to put into words had they been perhaps even Ester would have noticed the glaring incongruity As it was she continued her two occupations reading the verses thinking the thoughts until at last she came to a sudden pause and silence reigned in the room for several minutes then there flushed over Ester s face a sudden glow as she realized that she sat Bible in hand one corner of the solemnly worded card marking the verse at which she had paused and that verse was He came unto his own and his own received him not And she realized that her thoughts during the silence had been Suppose Miss Hastings should call and should inquire for her and she should go with Aunt Helen to return the call should she wear mother s black lace shawl with her blue silk dress or simply the little ruffled cape which matched the dress She read that last verse over again with an uncomfortable consciousness that she was not getting on very well but try as she would Ester s thoughts seemed resolved not to stay with that first chapter of John they roved all over New York visited all the places that she had seen and a great many that she wanted to see and that seemed beyond her grasp going on meantime with the verses and keeping up a disagreeable undercurrent of disgust Over those same restless thoughts there came a tap at the door and Maggie s voice outside Miss Ried Miss Abbie sent me to say that there was company waiting to see you and if you please would you come down as soon as you could Ester sprang up Very well she responded to Maggie I ll be down immediately Then she waited to shut the card into her Bible to keep the place took a parting peep in the mirror to see that the brown hair and blue ribbon were in order wondered if it were really the Hastings who called on her unlocked her door and made a rapid passage down the stairs most unpleasantly conscious however at that very moment that her intentions of setting herself right had not been carried out and also that so far as she had gone it had been a failure Truly after the lapse of so many years the light was still shining in darkness In the parlor after the other company had departed Ester found herself the sole companion of mister Foster at the further end of the long room Abbie half sitting half kneeling on an ottoman near her father seemed to be engaged in a very earnest conversation with him in which her mother occasionally joined and at which Ralph appeared occasionally to laugh but what was the subject of debate they at their distance were unable to determine and at last mister Foster turned to his nearest neighbor And so Miss Ester you manufactured me into a minister at our first meeting In view of their nearness to cousinship the ceremony of surname had been promptly discarded by mister Foster but Ester was unable to recover from a sort of awe with which he had at first inspired her and this opening sentence appeared to be a confusing one for she flushed deeply and only bowed her answer I don t know but it is a most unworthy curiosity on my part continued mister Foster but I have an overwhelming desire to know why or rather to know in what respect I am ministerial Won t you enlighten me Miss Ester Why said Ester growing still more confused I thought I said I No I mean I heard your talk with that queer old woman some of it and some things that you said made me think you must be a minister What things Miss Ester Everything said Ester desperately You talked you know about about religion nearly all the time A look of absolute pain rested for a moment on mister Foster s face as he said Is it possible that your experience with Christian men has been so unfortunate that you believe none but ministers ever converse on that subject I never hear any Ester answered positively But your example as a Christian lady I trust is such that it puts to shame your experience among gentlemen Oh but said Ester still in great confusion I didn t mean to confine my statement to gentlemen I never hear anything of the sort from ladies Not from that dear old friend of ours on the cars Oh yes she was different from other people too I thought she had a very queer way of speaking but then she was old and ignorant I don t suppose she knew how to talk about any thing else and she is my one exception mister Foster glanced in the direction of the golden brown head that was still in eager debate at the other end of the room before he asked his next question How is it with your cousin Oh she said Ester brought suddenly and painfully back to all her troublesome thoughts and then after a moment s hesitation taking a quick resolution to probe this matter to its foundation if it had one mister Foster don t you think she is very peculiar At which question mister Foster laughed then answered good humoredly Do you think me a competent witness in that matter Yes Ester answered gravely too thoroughly in earnest to be amused now she is entirely different from any person that I ever saw in my life She don t seem to think about any thing else at least she thinks more about this matter than any other And that is being peculiar Why I think so unnatural I mean unlike other people Well let us see Do you call it being peculiarly good or peculiarly bad Why said Ester in great perplexity it isn t bad of course But she no she is very good the best person I ever knew but it is being like nobody else and nobody can be like her Don t you think so I certainly do he answered with the utmost gravity and then he laughed again but presently noting her perplexed look he grew sober and spoke with quiet gravity I think I understand you Miss Ester If you mean Do I not think Abbie has attained to a rare growth in spirituality for one of her age I most certainly do but if you mean Do I not think it almost impossible for people in general to reach as high a foothold on the rock as she has gained I certainly do not I believe it is within the power and not only that but it is the blessed privilege and not only that but it is the sacred duty of every follower of the cross to cling as close and climb as high as she has I don t think so Ester said with a decided shake of the head It is much easier for some people to be good Christians than it is for others Granted that is there is a difference of temperament certainly But do you rank Abbie among those for whom it was naturally easy I think so This time mister Foster s head was very gravely shaken If you had known her when I did you would not think so It was very hard for her to yield Her natural temperament her former life her circle of friends her home influences were all against her and yet Christ triumphed Yes but having once decided the matter it is smooth sailing with her now Do you think so Has Abbie no trials to meet no battles with Satan to fight so far as you can discover Only trifles said Ester thinking of Aunt Helen and Ralph but deciding that Abbie had luxuries enough to offset both these anxieties I believe you will find that it needs precisely the same help to meet trifles that it does to conquer mountains of difficulty The difference is in degree not in kind But I happen to know that some of Abbie s trifles have been very heavy and hard to bear However the matter rests just here Miss Ester I believe we are all too willing to be conquered too willing to be martyrs not willing to reach after and obtain the settled and ever growing joys of the Christian Ester was thoroughly ill at ease all this condemned her and at last resolved to escape from this net work of her awakening conscience she pushed boldly on People have different views on this subject as well as on all others Now Abbie and I do not agree in our opinions There are things which she thinks right that seem to me quite out of place and improper Yes he said inquiringly and with the most quiet and courteous air would you object to mentioning some of those things Well as an instance it seemed to me very queer indeed to hear her and other young ladies speaking in your teachers prayer meeting I never heard of such a thing at least not among cultivated people And you thought it improper Almost yes quite perhaps At least I should never do it Were you at missus Burton s on the evening in which our society met This to Ester s surprise was her companion s next very wide of the mark question She opened her eyes inquiringly then concluding that he was absent minded or else had no reply to make and was weary of the subject answered simply and briefly in the affirmative I was detained that night Were there many out Quite a full society Abbie said The rooms were almost crowded Pleasant Oh very I hardly wished to go as they were strangers to me but I was very happily disappointed and enjoyed the evening exceedingly Were there reports Very full ones and missus Burton was particularly interesting She had forgotten her notes but gave her reports from memory very beautifully Ah I am sorry for that It must have destroyed the pleasure of the evening for you I don t understand mister Foster Why you remarked that you considered it improper for ladies to take part in such matters and of course what is an impropriety you can not have enjoyed Oh that is a very different matter It was not a prayer meeting I beg pardon I did not understand It is only at prayer meetings that it is improper for ladies to speak May I ask why Ester was growing vexed mister Foster she said sharply you know that it is quite another thing There are gentlemen enough present or ought to be to do the talking in a prayer meeting There is generally a large proportion of gentlemen at the society I presume there were those present capable of giving missus Burton s report Well I consider a society a very different thing from a gathering in a church Ah then it s the church that is at fault If that is the case I should propose holding prayer meetings in private parlors Would that obviate your difficulty No said Ester sharply not if there were gentlemen present It is their business to conduct a religious meeting Then after all it is religion that is at the foundation of this trouble Pray Miss Ester was missus Burton s report irreligious mister Foster said Ester with flushing cheeks and in a whirl of vexation don t you understand me I think I do Miss Ester The question is do you understand yourself Let me state the case You are decidedly not a woman s rights lady I am decidedly not a woman s rights gentleman that is in the general acceptation of that term You would think for instance that Abbie was out of her sphere in the pulpit or pleading a case at the bar So should I In fact there are many public places in which you and I for what we consider good and sufficient reasons would not like to see her But on the other hand we both enjoy missus Burton s reports either verbal or written as she may choose We in company with many other ladies and gentlemen listen respectfully we both greatly enjoy hearing Miss Ames sing we both consider it perfectly proper that she should so entertain us at our social gatherings At our literary society we have both enjoyed to the utmost Miss Hanley s exquisite recitation from Kathrina I am sure not a thought of impropriety occurred to either of us We both enjoyed the familiar talk on the subject for the evening after the society proper had adjourned So the question resolves itself into this It seems that it is pleasant and proper for fifty or more of us to hear missus Burton s report in missus Burton s parlor to hear ladies sing to hear ladies recite in their own parlors or in those of their friends to converse familiarly on any sensible topic but the moment the very same company are gathered in our chapel and missus Burton says Pray for my class and Miss Ames says I love Jesus and Miss Hanley says The Lord is the strength of my heart and my portion forever it becomes improper Will you pardon my obtuseness and explain to me the wherefore But Ester was not in a mood to explain if indeed she had aught to say and she only answered with great decision and emphasis I have never been accustomed to it No I think you told me that you were unaccustomed to hearing poetical recitations from young ladies Does that condemn them To which question Ester made no sort of answer but sat looking confused ashamed and annoyed all in one Her companion roused himself from his half reclining attitude on the sofa and gave her the benefit of a very searching look then he came to an erect posture and spoke with entire change of tone Miss Ester forgive me if I have seemed severe in my questionings and sarcastic in my replies I am afraid I have The subject is one which awakens sarcasm in me It is so persistently twisted and befogged and misunderstood some of the very best people seem inclined to make our prayer meetings into formidable church meetings for the purpose of hearing a succession of not very short sermons rather than a social gathering of Christians to sympathize with and pray for and help each other as I believe the Master intended them to be But may I say a word to you personally Are you quite happy as a Christian Do you find your love growing stronger and your hopes brighter from day to day Ester struggled with herself tore bits of down from the edge of her fan tried to regain her composure and her voice but the tender gentle yet searching tone seemed to have probed her very soul and the eyes that at last were raised to meet his were melting into tears and the voice which answered him quivered perceptibly No mister Foster I am not happy Why May I ask you Is the Savior untrue to his promises or is his professed servant untrue to him Ester s heart was giving heavy throbs of pain and her conscience was whispering loudly untrue untrue but she had made no answer when Ralph came with brisk step toward where they sat Two against one isn t fair play he said with a mixture of mischief and vexation in his tone Foster don t shirk you have taught Abbie now go and help her fight it out like a man Come take yourself over there and get her out of this scrape I ll take care of Ester she looks as though she had been to camp meeting And mister Foster with a wondering look for Ralph and a troubled one for Ester moved slowly toward that end of the long parlor where the voices were growing louder and one of them excited CHAPTER XVI A VICTORY This is really the most absurd of all your late absurdities missus Ried was saying in rather a loud tone and with a look of dignified disgust bestowed upon Abbie as mister Foster joined the group Will you receive me into this circle and enlighten me as regards this particular absurdity he said seating himself near missus Ried Oh it was nothing remarkable that lady replied in her most sarcastic tone At least it is quite time we were growing accustomed to this new order of things Abbie is trying to enlighten her father on the new and interesting question of temperance especially as it is connected with wedding parties in which she is particularly interested just at present Abbie bestowed an appealing glance on mister Foster and remained entirely silent I believe I can claim equal interest then in the matter he answered brightly And will petition you missus Ried to explain the point at issue Indeed mister Foster I m not a temperance lecturer and do not consider myself competent to perform the awful task I refer you to Abbie who seems to be thoroughly posted and very desirous of displaying her argumentative powers Still silence on Abbie s part and only a little tremble of the lip told a close observer how deeply she felt the sharp tones and unmotherly words missus Ried spoke at last in calm measured accents My daughter and I mister Foster differ somewhat in regard to the duties and privileges of a host I claim the right to set before my guests whatever I consider proper She objects to the use of wine as perhaps you are aware Indeed I believe she has imbibed her very peculiar views from you but I say to her that as I have always been in the habit of entertaining my guests with that beverage I presume I shall continue to do so mister Foster did not seem in the mood to argue the question but responded with genial good humor Ah but missus Ried you ought to gratify your daughter in her parting request That is only natural and courteous is it not missus Ried felt called upon to reply We have gratified so many of her requests already that the whole thing bids fair to be the most ridiculous proceeding that New York has ever witnessed Fancy a dozen rough boys banging and shouting through my house eating cake enough to make them sick for a month to say nothing of the quantity which they will stamp into my carpets and all because they chance to belong to Abbie s mission class Ralph and Ester had joined the group in the meantime and the former here interposed That last argument isn t valid mother Haven t I promised to hoe out the rooms myself immediately after the conclusion of the solemn services And mister Foster bestowed a sudden troubled look on Abbie which she answered by saying in a low voice I should recall my invitations to them under such circumstances You will do no such thing her father replied sharply The invitations are issued in your parents names and we shall have no such senseless proceedings connected with them When you are in your own house you will doubtless be at liberty to do as you please but in the meantime it would be well to remember that you belong to your father s family at present Ralph was watching the flushing cheek and quivering lip of his young sister and at this point flung down the book with which he had been idly playing with an impatient exclamation It strikes me father that you are making a tremendous din about a little matter I don t object to a glass of wine myself almost under any circumstances and I think this excruciating sensitiveness on the subject is absurd and ridiculous and all that sort of thing but at the same time I should be willing to undertake the job of smashing every wine bottle there is in the cellar at this moment if I thought that Sis last hours in the body or at least in the paternal mansion would be made any more peaceful thereby During this harangue the elder mister Ried had time to grow ashamed of his sharpness and answered in his natural tone I am precisely of your opinion my son We are making much ado about nothing We certainly have often entertained company before and Abbie has sipped her wine with the rest of us without sustaining very material injury thereby so far as I can see And here is Ester as stanch a church member as any of you I believe but that doesn t seem to forbid her behaving in a rational manner and partaking of whatever her friends provide for her entertainment Why can not the rest of you be equally sensible During the swift second of time which intervened between that sentence and her reply Ester had three hard things to endure a sting from her restless conscience a look of mingled pain and anxiety from mister Foster and one of open eyed and mischievous surprise from Ralph Then she spoke rapidly and earnestly Indeed Uncle Ralph I beg you will not judge of any other person by my conduct in this matter I am very sorry and very much ashamed that I have been so weak and wicked I think just as Abbie does only I am not like her and have been tempted to do wrong for fear you would think me foolish No one but Ester knew how much these sentences cost her but the swift bright look telegraphed her from Abbie s eyes seemed to repay her Ralph laughed outright Four against one he said gaily I ve gone over to the enemy s side myself you see on account of the pressure Father I advise you to yield while you can do it gracefully and also to save me the trouble of smashing the aforesaid bottles But persisted mister Ried I haven t heard an argument this evening What is there so shocking in a quiet glass of wine enjoyed with a select gathering of one s friends John now presented himself at the door with a respectful If you please sir there is a person in the hall who persists in seeing mister Foster Show him in then was mister Ried s prompt reply John hesitated and then added He is a very common looking person sir and I said show him in I believe interrupted the gentleman of the house in a tone which plainly indicated that he was expending on John the irritation which he did not like to bestow further on either his children or his guests John vanished and mister Ried added You can take your friend into the library mister Foster if it proves to be a private matter There was a marked emphasis on the word friend in this sentence but mister Foster only bowed his reply and presently John returned ushering in a short stout man dressed in a rough working suit twirling his hat in his hand and looking extremely embarrassed and out of place in the elegant parlor mister Foster turned toward him immediately and gave him a greeting both prompt and cordial Ah mister Jones good evening I have been in search of you today but some way managed to miss you At this point Abbie advanced and placed a small white hand in mister Jones great hard brown one as she repeated the friendly greeting and inquired at once How is Sallie to night mister Jones Well ma am it is about her that I m come and I beg your pardon sir turning to mister Foster for making so bold as to come up here after you but she is just that bad to night that I could not find it in me to deny her any thing and she is in a real taking to see you She has sighed and cried about it most of this day and to night we felt her mother and me that we couldn t stand it any longer and I said I d not come home till I found you and told you how much she wanted to see you It s asking a good deal sir but she is going fast she is and Here mister Jones voice choked and he rubbed his hard hand across his eyes I will be down immediately was mister Foster s prompt reply Certainly you should have come for me I should have been very sorry indeed to disappoint Sallie Tell her I will be there in half an hour mister Jones And with a few added words of kindness from Abbie mister Jones departed looking relieved and thankful That man said mister Foster turning to Ester as the door closed after him is the son of our old lady don t you think You remember I engaged to see her conveyed to his home in safety and my anxiety for her future welfare was such that my pleasure was very great in discovering that the son was a faithful member of our mission Sabbath school and a thoroughly good man And who is Sallie Ester inquired very much interested mister Foster s face grew graver Sallie is his one treasure a dear little girl one of our mission scholars and a beautiful example of how faithful Christ can be to his little lambs What is supposed to be the matter with Sallie This question came from Ralph who had been half amused half interested with the entire scene The gravity on mister Foster s face deepened into sternness as he answered Sallie is only one of the many victims of our beautiful system of public poisoning The son of her mother s employer in a fit of drunken rage threw her from the very top of a long flight of stairs and now she lies warped and misshapen mourning her life away By the way he continued turning suddenly toward mister Ried I believe you were asking for arguments to sustain my peculiar views Here is one of them This man of whom I speak whose crazed brain has this young sad life and death to answer for I chance to know to a certainty commenced his downward career in a certain pleasant parlor in this city among a select gathering of friends taking a quiet glass of wine And mister Foster made his adieus very brief and departed Ralph s laugh was just a little nervous as he said when the family were alone Foster is very fortunate in having an incident come to our very door with which to point his theories Abbie had deserted her ottoman and taken one close by her father s side Now she laid her bright head lovingly against his breast and looked with eager coaxing eyes into his stern gray ones Father she said softly you ll let your little curly have her own way just this time won t you I will promise not to coax you again until I want something very bad indeed mister Ried had decided his plan of action some moments before He was prepared to remind his daughter in tones of haughty dignity that he was not in the habit of playing the part of a despot in his own family and that as she and her future husband were so very positive in their very singular opinions and so entirely regardless of his wishes or feelings he should of course not force his hospitalities on her guests He made one mistake For just a moment he allowed his eyes to meet the sweet blue ones looking lovingly and trustingly into his and whatever it was whether the remembrance that his one daughter was so soon to go out from her home or the thought of all the tender and patient love and care which she had bestowed on him in those early morning hours the stern gray eyes grew tender the haughty lines about the mouth relaxed and with a sudden caressing movement of his hand among the brown curls he said in a half moved half playful tone Did you ever ask any thing of anybody in your life that you didn t get Then more gravely You shall have your way once more Abbie it would be a pity to despoil you of your scepter at this late day Fiddlesticks ejaculated missus Ried Before she had added anything to that original sentiment Abbie was behind her chair both arms wound around her neck and then came soft quick loving kisses on her cheeks on her lips on her chin and even on her nose Nonsense added her mother Then she laughed Your father would consent to have the ceremony performed in the attic if you should take a fancy that the parlors are too nicely furnished to suit your puritanic views and I don t know but I should be just as foolish That man has gained complete control over her missus Ried said looking after Abbie with a little sigh and addressing her remarks to Ester as they stood together for a moment in the further parlor He is a first class fanatic grows wilder and more incomprehensible in his whims every day and bends Abbie to his slightest wish My only consolation is that he is a man of wealth and culture and indeed in every other respect entirely unexceptionable A new light dawned upon Ester This was the secret of Abbie s strangeness mister Foster was one of those rare and wonderful men about whom one occasionally reads but almost never meets and of course Abbie being so constantly under his influence was constantly led by him Very few could expect to attain to such a hight certainly she with her social disadvantages and unhelpful surroundings must not hope for it She was rapidly returning to her former state of self satisfaction There were certain things to be done For instance that first chapter of John should receive more close attention at her next reading and there were various other duties which should be taken up and carefully observed But on the whole Ester felt that she had been rather unnecessarily exercised and that she must not expect to be perfect And so once more there was raised a flag of truce between her conscience and her life CHAPTER XVII STEPPING BETWEEN They lingered together for a few minutes in the sitting room Abbie Ester Ralph and mister Foster They had been having a half sad half merry talk It was the evening before the wedding Ere this time to morrow Abbie would have left them and in just a little while the ocean would roll between them Ester drew a heavy sigh as she thought of it all This magic three weeks which had glowed in beauty for her such as she told herself her life would never see again were just on the eve of departure only two days now before she would carry that same restless unhappy heart back among the clattering dishes in that pantry and dining room at home Ralph broke the little moment of silence which had fallen between them Foster listen to the sweet tones of that distant clock It is the last time that you being a free man will hear it strike five Unless I prove to be an early riser on the morrow which necessity will compel me to become if I tarry longer here at present Abbie I must be busy this entire evening That funeral obliged me to defer some important business matters that I meant should have been dispatched early in the day It isn t possible that you have been to a funeral to day How you do mix things Ralph uttered this sentence in real or pretended horror Why not mister Foster answered gently and added It is true though life and death are very strangely mixed It was our little Sabbath school girl Sallie whom we laid to rest to day It didn t jar as some funerals would have done one had simply to remember that she had reached home Miss Ester if you will get that package for me I will execute your commission with pleasure Ester went away to do his bidding and Ralph promising to meet him at the store in an hour sauntered away and for a few moments Abbie and mister Foster talked together alone Good by all of you he said smiling as he glanced back at the two girls a few moments later Take care of her Ester until I relieve you It will not be long now Take care Ester answered gaily you have forgotten the slip that there may be between the cup and the lip But he answered her with an almost solemn gravity I never forget that more worthy expression of the same idea we know not what a day may bring forth but I always remember with exceeding joy that God knows and will lead us He is graver than ten ministers Ester said as they turned from the window Come Abbie let us go up stairs It was two hours later when Abbie entered the sitting room where Ester awaited her and curled herself into a small heap of white muslin at Ester s feet There said she with a musical little laugh mother has sent me away The measure of her disgust is complete now doctor Downing is in the sitting room and I have been guilty of going in to see him Imagine such a fearful breach of etiquette taking place in the house of Ried Do you know I don t quite know what to do with myself There is really nothing more to busy myself about unless I eat the wedding cake You don t act in the least like a young lady who is to be married to morrow was Ester s answer as she regarded her cousin with a half amused half puzzled air Don t I said Abbie trying to look alarmed What have I done now I m forever treading on bits of propriety and crushing them It will be a real relief to me when I am safely married and can relapse into a common mortal again Why Ester what have I been guilty of just now You are not a bit sentimental are you Abbie And at this gravely put question Abbie s laugh rang out again Now don t please add that item to the list she said merrily Ester is it very important that one should be sentimental on such an occasion I wish you were married I really do so that I might be told just how to conduct my self How can you and mother be so unreasonable as to expect perfection when it is all new and I really never practiced in my life Then a change as sudden as it was sweet flushed over Abbie s face The merry look died out and in its place a gentle tender softness rested in the bright blue eyes and her voice was low and quiet You think my mood a strange one I fancy dear Ester almost unbecoming in its gayety Perhaps it is and yet I feel it bright and glad and happy The change is a solemn one but it seems to me that I have considered it long and well I remember that my new home is to be very near my old one that my brother will have a patient faithful life long friend in mister Foster and this makes me feel more hopeful for him and indeed it seems to me that I feel like repeating The lines have fallen unto me in pleasant places I do not therefore affect a gravity that I do not feel I am gloriously happy to night and the strongest feeling in my heart is thankfulness My Heavenly Father has brimmed my earthly cup so that it seems to me there is not room in my heart for another throb of joy and so you see Ester what on earth can be going on down stairs Have you noticed the banging of doors and the general confusion that reigns through the house Positively if I wasn t afraid of shocking mother into a fainting fit I would start on a voyage of discovery Suppose I go Ester answered laughing Inasmuch as I am not going to be married there can be no harm in seeing what new developments there are below stairs I mean to go I ll send you word if it is any thing very amazing And with a laughing adieu Ester closed the door on the young bride elect and ran swiftly down stairs There did seem to be a good deal of confusion in the orderly household and the very air of the hall seemed to be pervaded with a singular subdued excitement voices of suppressed loudness issued from the front parlor and as Ester knocked she heard a half scream from missus Ried mingled with cries of Don t let her in Growing thoroughly alarmed Ester now abruptly pushed open the door and entered Oh for mercy s sake don t let her come almost screamed missus Ried starting wildly forward Mother hush said Ralph s voice in solemn sternness It is only Ester Where is Abbie In her room What is the matter Why do you all act so strangely I came to see what caused so much noise And then her eyes and voice were arrested by a group around the sofa mister Ried and doctor Downing and stooping over some object which was hidden from her was the man who had been pointed out to her as the great doctor Archer As she looked in terrified amazement he raised his head and spoke It is as I feared mister Ried The pulse has ceased It is not possible And the hollow awestruck tone in which mister Ried spoke can not be described And then Ester saw stretched on that sofa a perfectly motionless form a perfectly pale and quiet face rapidly settling into the strange solemn calm of death and that face and form were mister Foster s And she stood as if riveted to the spot stood in speechless moveless horror and amaze and then the swift coming thoughts shaped themselves into two woe charged words Oh Abbie What a household was this into which death had so swiftly and silently entered The very rooms in which the quiet form lay sleeping all decked in festive beauty in honor of the bridal morning but oh there was to come no bridal Ester shrank back in awful terror from the petition that she would go to Abbie I can not I can not she repeated again and again It will kill her and oh it would kill me to tell her missus Ried was even more hopeless a dependence than Ester and mister Ried cried out in the very agony of despair What shall we do Is there nobody to help us Then Ralph came forward grave almost to sternness but very calm doctor Downing he said addressing the gentleman who had withdrawn a little from the family group It seems to me that you are our only hope in this time of trial My sister and you are sustained I verily believe by the same power The rest of us seem to have no sustaining power Would you go to my sister sir doctor Downing turned his eyes slowly away from the calm moveless face which seemed to have fascinated him and said simply I will do what I can for Abbie It is blessed to think what a Helper she has One who never faileth God pity those who have no such friend So they showed him up to the brightly lighted library and sent a message to the unconscious Abbie doctor Downing she said turning briskly from the window in answer to Maggie s summons Whatever does he want of me do you suppose Maggie I m half afraid of him tonight However I ll endeavor to brave the ordeal Tell Miss Ester to come up to me as soon as she can and be ready to defend me if I am to receive a lecture This as she flitted by toward the door and a pitying cloud just then hid the face of the August moon and vailed from the glance of the poor young creature the white frightened face of Maggie With what unutterable agony of fear did the family below wait and long for and dread the return of doctor Downing or some message from that dreadful room The moments that seemed hours to them dragged on and no sound came to them She has not fainted then muttered Ralph at last or he would have rung Ester you know what Maggie said Could you not go to her Ester cowered and shrunk Oh Ralph don t ask me I can not Then they waited again in silence and at last shivered with fear as doctor Downing softly opened the door There were traces of deep emotion on his face but just now it was wonderful for its calmness She knows all he said addressing mister Ried And the widow s God is hers missus Ried she makes special request that she need see no living soul to night and indeed I think it will be best And now my friends may I pray with you in this hour of trial So while quick skillful fingers prepared the sleeper in that front parlor for his long long rest a group such as had never bowed the knee together before knelt in the room just across the hall and amid tears and moans they were commended to the care of Him who waits to help us all By and by a solemn quiet settled down upon that strangely stricken household In the front parlor the folding doors were closed and the angel of death kept guard over his quiet victim From the chamber overhead came forth no sound and none knew save God how fared the struggle between despair and submission in that young heart In the sitting room Ester waited breathlessly while Ralph gave the particulars which she had not until now been able to hear We were crossing just above the store had nearly got across he was just saying that his preparations were entirely perfected for a long absence It is a long journey he added and if I never come back I have the satisfaction of thinking that I have left everything ready even for that It is well to be ready even for death Ralph he said with one of his glorious smiles it makes life pleasanter I don t know how I can tell you the rest And Ralph s lips grew white and tremulous Indeed I hardly know how it was There was an old bent woman crossing just behind us and there was a carriage and a wretch of a drunken driver pushing his way through I don t know how Foster came to look around but he did and said There is my dear old lady behind us Ralph she ought not to be out with a mere child for a companion And then he uttered an exclamation of terror and sprang forward and I know nothing clearly that followed I saw him drag that old woman fairly from under the horses feet I heard the driver curse and saw him strike his frightened horses and they reared and plunged and I saw him fall but it all seemed to happen in one second of time and how I got him home and got doctor Archer and kept it from Abbie I don t seem to know Oh God help my poor little fair darling And Ralph choked and stopped and wiped from his eyes great burning tears Oh Ralph said Ester as soon as she could speak Then all this misery comes because that driver was intoxicated Yes said Ralph with compressed lips and flashing eyes And that knowing the time that now it is high time to awake out of sleep for now is our salvation nearer than when we believed Rom thirteen eleven CHAPTER XVIII LIGHT OUT OF DARKNESS Slowly slowly the night wore away and the eastern sky grew rosy with the blush of a new morning the bridal morning How strangely unreal how even impossible did it seem to Ester as she raised the curtains and looked drearily out upon the dawn that this was actually the day upon which her thoughts had centered during the last three weeks What a sudden shutting down had there been to all their plans and preparations How strangely the house looked here a room bedecked in festive beauty for the wedding there one with shrouded mirrors and floating folds of crape Life and death a wedding and a funeral they had never either of them touched so close to her before and now the one had suddenly glided backward and left her heart heavy with the coming of the other Mechanically she turned to look upon the silvery garment gleaming among the white furnishings of the bed for she was that very morning to have assisted in arraying the bride in those robes of beauty Her own careful fingers had laid out all the bewildering paraphernalia of the dressing room sash and gloves and handkerchief and laces Just in that very spot had she stood only yesterday and talking the while with Abbie had altered a knot of ribbons and given the ends a more graceful droop and just at that moment Abbie had been summoned below stairs to see mister Foster and now he was waiting down there not for Abbie but for the coffin and the grave and Abbie was And here Ester gave a low shuddering moan and covered her eyes with her hands Why had she come into that room at all And why was all this fearful time allowed to come to Abbie Poor poor Abbie she had been so bright and so good and mister Foster had been so entirely her guide how could she ever endure it Ester doubted much whether Abbie could ever bear to see her again she had been so closely connected with all these bright days over which so fearful a pall had fallen It would be very natural if she should refuse even to see her and indeed Ester almost hoped she would It seemed to her that this was a woe too deep to be spoken of or endured only she said with a kind of desperation Things must be endured and there was a wild thought in her heart that if she could but have the ordering of events all this bitter sorrow should never be There came a low tremulous knock as an interruption to her thoughts and Maggie s swollen eyes and tear stained face appeared at the door with a message If you please Miss Ester she wants you Who asked Ester with trembling lips and a sinking at her heart Miss Abbie ma am she asked for you and said would you come to her as soon as you could But it was hours after that before Ester brought herself to feel that she could go to her Nothing had ever seemed so hard to her to do How to look how to act what to say and above all what not to say to this poor widowed bride These questions were by no means answered when she suddenly in desperate haste decided that if it must be done the sooner it was over the better and she made all speed to prepare herself for the visit and yet there was enough of Ester s personal self left even on that morning to send a little quiver of complacency through her veins as she bathed her tear stained face and smoothed her disordered hair Abbie had sent for her Abbie wanted her she had sent twice Evidently she had turned to her for help Miserably unable as she felt herself to give it still it was a comfort to feel that she was the one selected from the household for companionship Ester knew that missus Ried had been with her daughter for a few moments and that Ralph had rushed in and out again too overcome to stay but Ester had asked no questions and received no information concerning her She pictured her lying on the bed with disordered hair and swollen eyes given over to the abandonment of grief or else the image of stony despair and it was with a very trembling hand that at last she softly turned the knob and let herself into the morning room which she and Abbie had enjoyed together and just as she pushed open the door a neighboring clock counted out twelve strokes and it was at twelve o clock that Abbie was to become a wife Midway in the room Ester paused and as her eyes rested on Abbie a look of bewildering astonishment gathered on her face In the little easy chair by the open window one hand keeping the place in the partly closed book sat the young creature whose life had so suddenly darkened around her The morning robe of soft pure white was perfect in its neatness and simplicity the brown curls clustered around her brow with their wonted grace and beauty and while under her eyes indeed there were heavy rings of black yet the eyes themselves were large and full and tender As she held out the disengaged hand there came the soft and gentle likeness of a smile over her face and Ester bewildered amazed frightened stood almost as transfixed as if she had been one of those who saw the angel sitting at the door of the empty tomb Stood a moment then a sudden revulsion of feeling overcoming her hurried forward and dropping on her knees bowed her head over the white hand and the half open Bible and burst into a passion of tears Dear Ester This said Abbie in the softest most soothing of tones The mourner turned comforter Oh Abbie Abbie how can you bear it how can you live burst forth from the heart of this friend who had come to comfort this afflicted one There was a little bit of silence now and a touching tremble to the voice when it was heard again The Lord knoweth them that are his I try to remember that Christ knows it all and he loves me and he is all powerful and yet he leads me through this dark road therefore it must be right But said Ester raising her eyes and staying her tears for very amazement I do not understand I do not see How can you be so calm so submissive at least just now so soon and you were to have been married to day The blood rolled in great purple waves over neck and cheek and brow and then receded leaving a strange almost death like pallor behind it The small hands were tightly clasped with a strange mixture of pain and devotion in the movement and the white lips moved for a moment forming words that met no mortal ear then the sweet low tender voice sounded again Dear Ester I pray There is no other way I pray all the time I keep right by my Savior There is just a little oh a very little vale of flesh between him and between my my husband and myself Jesus loves me Ester I know it now just as well as I did yesterday I do not and can not doubt him A mixture of awe and pain and astonishment kept Ester moveless and silent and Abbie spoke no more for some moments Then it was a changed almost bright voice Ester do you remember we stood together alone for a moment yesterday I will tell you what he said the last words that were intended for just me only that I shall hear for a little while they are my words you know but I shall tell them to you so you may see how tender Christ is even in his most solemn chastenings See here he said I will give you a word to keep until we meet in the morning The Lord watch between thee and me while we are absent one from another I have been thinking while I sat here this morning watching the coming of this new day which you know is his first day in heaven that perhaps it will be on some such morning of beauty as this that my long long day will dawn and that I will say to him as soon as ever I see his face again The word was a good one the Lord has watched between us and the night is gone Think of it Ester I shall surely say that some day some summer morning The essence of sweetness and the sublimity of faith which this young Christian threw into these jubilant words can not be repeated on paper but thank God they can in the heart they are but the echo of those sure and everlasting words My grace is sufficient for thee As for Ester who had spent her years groveling in the dust of earth it was the recital of such an experience as she had not deemed it possible for humanity to reach And still she knelt immovable and silent and Abbie broke the silence yet again Dear Ester do you know I have not seen him yet and I want to Mother does not understand and she would not give her consent but she thinks me safe while you are with me Would you mind going down with me just to look at his face again Oh Ester would mind it dreadfully She was actually afraid of death She was afraid of the effect of such a scene upon this strange Abbie She raised her head shivering with pain and apprehension and looked a volume of petition and remonstrance but ere she spoke Abbie s hand rested lovingly on her arm and her low sweet voice continued the pleading You do not quite understand my mood Ester I am not unlike others I have wept bitter tears this past night I have groaned in agony of spirit I have moaned in the very dust I shall doubtless have such struggles again This is earth and the flesh is weak but now is my hour of exaltation and while it is given me now to feel a faint overshadowing of the very glory which surrounds him I want to go and look my last upon the dear clay which is to stay here on earth with me And Ester rose up and wound her arm about the tiny frame which held this brave true heart and without another spoken word the two went swiftly down the stairs and entered the silent solemn parlor Yet even while she went a fierce throb of pain shook Ester s heart as she remembered how they had arranged to descend the staircase on this very day in what a different manner and for what a different purpose Apparently no such thought as this touched Abbie She went softly and yet swiftly forward to the still form while Ester waited in almost breathless agony to see what would result from this trial of faith and nerve but what a face it was upon which death had left its seal No sculptured marble was ever so grand in its solemn beauty as was this clay molded face upon which the glorious smile born not of earth rested in full sweetness Abbie with clasped hands and slightly parted lips stood and almost literally drank in the smile then sweet and low and musical there broke the sound of her voice in that great solemn room So he giveth his beloved sleep Not another word or sound disturbed the silence And still Abbie stood and gazed on the dear dead face And still Ester stood near the door and watched with alternations of anxiety and awe the changeful expressions on the scarcely less white face of the living until at last without sound or word she dropped upon her knees a cloud of white drapery floating around her and clasped her hands over the lifeless breast Then on Ester s face the anxiety gave place to awe and with softly moving fingers she opened the door and with noiseless tread went out into the hall and left the living and the dead alone together There was one more scene for Ester to endure that day Late in the afternoon as she went to the closed room there was bending over the manly form a gray haired old woman By whose friendly hands she had been permitted to enter Ester did not stop to wonder She had seen her but once before but she knew at a glance the worn wrinkled face and as if a picture of the scene hung before her she saw that old queer form leaning trustfully on the strong arm lying nerveless now being carefully helped through the pushing throng being reverently cared for as if she had been his mother and she looking after the two had wondered if she should ever see them again Now she stood in the presence of them both yet what an unmeasurable ocean rolled between them The faded tearful eyes were raised to her face after a moment and a quivering voice spoke her thoughts aloud rather than addressed any body He gave his life for poor old useless me and it was such a beautiful life and was needed oh so much but what am I saying God let it be him instead of me who wanted so to go and after trusting him all along am I at my time of life going to murmur at him now He came to see me only yesterday this in a more natural tone of voice addressed to Ester he told me good by He said he was going a long journey with his wife and now may the dear Savior help the poor darling for he has gone his long journey without her Ester waited to hear not another word The heavy sense of pain because of Abbie which she had carried about with her through all that weary day had reached its height with that last sentence He has gone his long journey without her She fled from the room up the stairs to the quiet little chamber which had been given to her for her hours of retirement locked and bolted the door and commenced pacing up and down the room in agony of soul It was not all because of Abbie that this pain knocked so steadily at her heart at least not all out of sympathy with her bitter sorrow There was a fearful tumult raging in her own soul her last stronghold had been shattered Of late she had come to think that Abbie s Christian life was but a sweet reflection of mister Foster s strong true soul that she leaned not on Christ but on the arm of flesh She had told herself very confidently that if she had such a friend as he had been to Abbie she should be like her In her hours of rebellion she had almost angrily reminded herself that it was not strange that Abbie s life could be so free from blame she had some one to turn to in her needs It was a very easy matter for Abbie to slip lightly over the petty trials of her life so long as she was surrounded and shielded by that strong true love But now ah now the arm of flesh had faltered the strong staff had broken and broken too only a moment as it were before it was to have been hers in name as well as in spirit Naturally Ester had expected that the young creature so suddenly shorn of her best and dearest would falter and faint and utterly fail And when looking on she saw the triumph of the Christian s faith rising even over death sustained by no human arm and yet wonderfully triumphantly sustained even while she bent for the last time over that which was to have been her earthly all looking and wondering there suddenly fell away from her the stupor of years and Ester saw with wide open eyes and thoroughly awakened soul that there was a something in this Christian religion that Abbie had and she had not And thus it was that she paced her room in that strange agony that was worse than grief and more sharp than despair No use now to try to lull her conscience back to quiet sleep again that time was past it was thoroughly and sharply awake the same All wise hand which had tenderly freed one soul from its bonds of clay and called it home had as tenderly and as wisely with the same stroke cut the cords that bound this other soul to earth loosed the scales from her long closed eyes broke the sleep that had well nigh lulled her to ruin and now heart and brain and conscience were thoroughly and forever awake When at last from sheer exhaustion she ceased her excited pacing up and down the room and sank into a chair her heart was not more stilled It seemed to her long after in thinking of this hour that it was given to her to see deeper into the recesses of her own depravity than ever mortal had seen before She began years back at that time when she thought she had given her heart to Christ and reviewed step by step all the weary way up to this present time and she found nothing but backslidings and inconsistencies and confusion denials of her Savior a closed Bible a neglected closet a forgotten cross Oh the bitterness the unutterable agony of that hour Surely Abbie on her knees struggling with her bleeding heart and yet feeling all around and underneath her the everlasting arms knew nothing of desolation such as this Fiercer and fiercer waged the warfare until at last every root of pride or self complacence or self excuse was utterly cast out Yet did not Satan despair Oh he meant to have this poor sick weak lamb if he could get her no effort should be left unmade And when he found that she could be no more coaxed and lulled and petted into peace he tried that darker heavier temptation tried to stupefy her into absolute despair No she said within her heart I am not a Christian I never have been one I never can be one I ve been a miserable self deceived hypocrite all my life I have had a name to live and am dead I would not let myself be awakened I have struggled against it I have been only too glad to stop myself from thinking about it I have been just a miserable stumbling block with no excuse to offer and now I feel myself deserted justly so There can be no rest for such as I I have no Savior I have insulted and denied him I have crucified him again and now he has left me to myself Thus did that father of lies continue to pour into this weary soul the same old story which he has repeated for so many hundred years with the same old foundation I I I And strange to say this poor girl repeated the experience which has so many times been lived during these past hundreds of years in the very face of that other glorious pronoun in very defiance it would seem to that old old explanation Surely he hath borne our griefs and carried our sorrows He was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities The chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed Yes Ester knew those two verses She knew yet another which said All we like sheep have gone astray We have turned every one to his own way and the Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all And yet she dared to sit with hopeless folded hand with heavy despairing eyes and repeat that sentence I have no Savior now And many a wandering sheep has dared even in its repenting hour to insult the great Shepherd thus Ester s Bible lay on the window seat the large somewhat worn Bible which Abbie had lent her to mark just as much as she pleased it lay open as if it had opened of itself to a familiar spot There were heavy markings around several of the verses markings that had not been made by Ester s pencil Some power far removed from that which had been guiding her despairing thoughts prompted her to reach forth her hand for the book and fix her attention on those marked verses and the words were these For thus saith the high and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity whose name is Holy I dwell in the high and holy place with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit to revive the spirit of the humble and to revive the heart of the contrite ones For I will not contend forever neither will I be always wroth for the spirit should fail before me and the souls which I have made For the iniquity of his covetousness was I wroth and smote him I hid me and was wroth and he went on frowardly in the way of his heart I have seen his ways and will heal him I will lead him also and restore comforts unto him and to his mourners I create the fruit of the lips Peace peace to him that is afar off and to him that is near saith the Lord and I will heal him Had an angel spoken to Ester or was it the dear voice of the Lord himself She did not know She only knew that there rang through her very soul two sentences as the climax of all these wonderful words Peace peace to him that is afar off and I will heal him A moment more and with the very promise of the Crucified spread out before her Ester was on her knees and at first with bursts of passionate tearful pleading and later with low humble contrite tones and finally with the sound in her voice of that peace which comes only to those to whom Christ is repeating I have blotted out as a cloud thy transgressions and as a thick cloud thy sins did Ester pray Do you know dear Ester there must have been two new joys in heaven to day First they had a new comer among those who walk with him in white for they are worthy and then they had that shout of triumph over another soul for whom Satan has struggled fiercely and whom he has forever lost This said Abbie as they nestled close together that evening in the purple twilight And Ester answered simply and softly Amen CHAPTER XIX SUNDRIES Meanwhile the days moved on the time fixed for Ester s return home had long passed and yet she tarried in New York Abbie clung to her wanted her for various reasons and the unselfish pitying mother far away full of tender sympathy for the stricken bride smothered a sigh of weariness buried in her heart the thought of her own need of her eldest daughter s presence and help and wrote a long loving letter jointly to the daughter and niece wherein she gave her full consent to Ester s remaining away so long as she could be a comfort to her cousin Two items worthy of record occurred during these days The first time the family gathered at the dinner table after the one who had been so nearly a son of the house had been carried to his rest in that wonderful and treasured city of Greenwood Ralph being helped by John as usual to his glass of wine refused it with a short sharp almost angry No Take it away and never offer me the accursed stuff again We should have had him with us to day but for that I ll never touch another drop of it as long as I live Which startling words mister and missus Ried listened to without comment other than a half frightened look bestowed on Abbie to see how she would bear this mention of her dead and she bore it this way Turning her eyes glistening with tears full on her brother s face she said with a little quiver of tender gladness in her voice Oh Ralph I knew it had a silver lining but I did not think God would let me see it so soon Then mister and missus Ried concluded that both their children were queer and that they did not understand them The other item was productive of a dissertation on propriety from missus Ried Ralph and his father were in the back parlor the former standing with one arm resting on the mantel while he talked with his father who was half buried in a great easy chair that easy chair in his own elegant parlor and his handsome son standing before him in that graceful attitude were mister Ried s synonyms for perfect satisfaction and his face took on a little frown of disappointment as the door opened somewhat noisily and missus Ried came in wearing a look expressive of thoroughly defined vexation Ralph paused in the midst of his sentence and wheeled forward a second easy chair for his mother then returned to his former position and waited patiently for the gathered frown to break into words which event instantly occurred I really do not think mister Ried that this nonsense ought to be allowed besides being a very strange unfeeling thing to do it is in my opinion positively indecent and I do think mister Ried that you ought to exercise your authority for once If you would kindly inform me what you are supposed to be talking about and where my authority is specially needed at this time I might be induced to consider the matter This from the depths of the easy chair in its owner s most provokingly indifferent tone which fortunately missus Ried was too much preoccupied to take special note of and continued her storm of words Here it is not actually quite a week since he was buried and Abbie must needs make herself and her family appear perfectly ridiculous by making her advent in public mister Ried came to an upright posture and even Ralph asked a startled question Where is she going Why where do you suppose but to that absurd little prayer meeting where she always would insist upon going every Thursday evening I used to think it was for the pleasure of a walk home with mister Foster but why she should go to night is incomprehensible to me Nonsense said mister Ried settling back into the cushions A large public that will be I thought at the very least she was going to the opera If the child finds any comfort in such an atmosphere where s the harm Let her go Where s the harm Now mister Ried that is just as much as you care for appearances sometimes and at other times you can be quite as particular as I am though I certainly believe there is nothing that Abbie might take a fancy to do that you would not uphold her in mister Ried s reply was uttered in a tone that impressed one with the belief that he was uttering a deliberate conviction You are quite right as regards that I suspect At least I find myself quite unable to conceive of any thing connected with her that could by any twisting be made other than just the thing missus Ried s exasperated answer was cut short by the entrance of Abbie attired as for a walk or ride the extreme pallor of her face and the largeness of her soft eyes enhanced by the deep mourning robes which fell around her like the night Now Abbie said missus Ried turning promptly to her I did hope you had given up this strangest of all your strange whims What will people think People are quite accustomed to see me there dear mother at least all the people who will see me to night and if ever I needed help I do just now I should think it would be much more appropriate to stay at home and find help in the society of your own family That is the way other people do who are in affliction missus Ried had the benefit of a full steady look from Abbie s great solemn eyes now as she said Mother I want God s help No other will do me any good Well answered missus Ried after just a moment of rather awe struck silence can t you find that help any where but in that plain common little meeting house I thought people with your peculiar views believed that God was every where An expression not unlike that of a hunted deer shone for a moment in Abbie s eyes Then she spoke in tones almost despairing O mother mother you can not understand Tone or words or both vexed missus Ried afresh and she spoke with added sharpness At least I can understand this much that my daughter is very anxious to do a thing utterly unheard of in its propriety and I am thoroughly ashamed of you If I were Ester I should not like to uphold you in such a singularly conspicuous parade Remember you have no one now but John to depend upon as an escort Ralph had remained a silent immovable listener to this strange sad conversation up to this moment Now he came suddenly forward with a quick firm tread and encircled Abbie s trembling form with his arm while with eyes and voice he addressed his mother In that last proposition you are quite mistaken my dear mother Abbie chances to have a brother who considers himself honored by being permitted to accompany her any where she may choose to go missus Ried looked up at her tall haughty son in unfeigned astonishment and for an instant was silent Oh she said at last if you have chosen to rank yourself on this ridiculous fanatical side I have nothing more to say As for mister Ried he had long before this shadded his eyes with his hand and was looking through half closed fingers with mournful eyes at the sable robes and pallid face of his golden haired darling apparently utterly unconscious of or indifferent to the talk that was going on But will Ralph ever forget the little sweet smile which illumined for a moment the pure young face as she turned confiding eyes on him Thenceforth there dawned a new era in Abbie s life Ralph for reasons best known to himself chose to be released from his vacation engagements in a neighboring city and remained closely at home And Abbie went as usual to her mission class to her Bible class to the teacher s prayer meeting to the regular church prayer meeting every where she had been wont to go and she was always and every where accompanied and sustained by her brother As for Ester these were days of great opportunity and spiritual growth to her So we bridge the weeks between and reach the afternoon of a September day bright and beautiful as the month draws toward its closing and Ester is sitting alone in her room in the low easy chair by the open window and in her lap lies an open letter while she with thoughtful earnest eyes seems reading not it but the future or else her own heart The letter is from Sadie and she has written thus MY DEAR CITY SISTER Mother said to night as we were promenading the dining room for the sake of exercise and also to clear off the table Maggie had the toothache and was off duty Sadie my dear child haven t you written to Ester yet Do you think it is quite right to neglect her so when she must be very anxious to hear from home Now you know when mother says Sadie my dear child and looks at me from out those reproachful eyes of hers there is nothing short of mixing a mess of bread that I would not do for her So here I am place third story front time eleven thirty P M position foot of the bed Julia being soundly sleeping at the head one gaiter off and one gaiter on somewhat after the manner of my son John so renowned in history Speaking of bread how abominably that article can act I had a solemn conflict with a batch of it this morning Firstly you must know I forgot it Mother assured me it was ready to be mixed before I awakened so it must have been before that event took place that the forgetfulness occurred however be that as it may after I was thoroughly awake and up and down I still forgot it The fried potatoes were frying themselves fast to that abominable black dish in which they are put to sizzle and which by the way is the most nefarious article in the entire kitchen list to get clean save and excepting the dish cloth Well as I was saying they burned themselves and I ran to the rescue Then Minie wanted me to go to the yard with her to see a dear cunning little brown and gray thing with some greenish spots that walked and spoke to her The interesting stranger proved to be a fair sized frog While examining into and explaining minutely the nature and character and occupations of the entire frog family the mixture in the tin pail behind the kitchen stove took that opportunity to sour My what a bubble it was in and what an interesting odor it emitted when at last I returned from frogdom to the ordinary walks of life and gave it my attention Maggie was above her elbows in the wash tub so I seized the pail and in dire haste and dismay ran up two flights of stairs in search of mother I suppose you know what followed I assure you I think mothers and soda are splendid What a remarkable institution that ingredient is While I made sour into sweet with the aid of its soothing proclivities I moralized the result of which was that after I had squeezed and mushed and rolled over and thumped and patted my dough the requisite number of times I tucked it away under blankets in a corner and went out to the piazza to ask doctor Douglass if he knew of an article in the entire round of Materia Medica which could be given to human beings when they were sour and disagreeable and which after the manner of soda in dough would immediately work a reform On his acknowledging his utter ignorance of any such principle I advanced the idea that cooking was a much more developed science than medicine thence followed an animated discussion But in the meantime what do you suppose that bread was doing Just spreading itself in the most remarkable manner over the nice blanket under which I had cuddled it Then I had an amazing time Mother said the patting process must all be done over again and there was abundant opportunity for more moralizing That bread developed the most remarkable stick to a tive ness that I ever beheld I assure you if total depravity is a mark of humanity then I believe my dough is human Well we are all still alive though poor mister Holland is I fear very little more than that He was thrown from his carriage one evening last week and brought home insensible He is now in a raging fever and very ill indeed For once in their lives both doctors agree He is delirious most of the time and his delirium takes the very trying form which leads him to imagine that only mother can do any thing for him The doctors think he fancies she is his own mother and that he is a boy again All this makes matters rather hard on mother She is frequently with him half the night and often Maggie and I are left to reign supreme in the kitchen for the entire day Those are the days that try men s souls especially women s I am sometimes tempted to think that all the book knowledge the world contains is not to be compared to knowing just what and how and when to do in the kitchen I quite think so for a few hours when mother after a night of watching in a sick room comes down to undo some of my blundering She is the patientest dearest lovingest kindest mother that ever a mortal had and just because she is so patient shall I rejoice over the day when she can give a little sigh of relief and leave the kitchen calm in the assurance that it will be right side up when she returns Ester how did you make things go right I m sure I try harder than I ever knew you to and yet salt will get into cakes and puddings and sugar into potatoes Just here I m conscience smitten I beg you will not construe one of the above sentences as having the remotest allusion to your being sadly missed at home Mother said I was not even to hint such a thing and I m sure I haven t I m a remarkable housekeeper The fall term at the academy opened week before last I have hidden my school books behind that old barrel in the north east corner of the attic I thought they would be safer there than below stairs At least I was sure the bread would do better in the oven because of their ascent To return to the scene of our present trials mister Holland is I suppose very dangerously sick and poor missus Holland is the very embodiment of despair When I look at her in prospective misery I am reminded of poor dear cousin Abbie to whom I would write if it didn t seem a sacrilege and I conclude there is really more misery in this world of ours than I had any idea of I ve discovered why the world was made round It must be to typify our lives sort of a tread mill existence you know coming constantly around to the things which you thought you had done yesterday and put away living over again to day the sorrows which you thought were vanquished last week I m sleepy and it is nearly time to bake cakes for breakfast The tip of the morning to you as Patrick O Brien greets Maggie Yours nonsensically SADIE CHAPTER XX AT HOME Over this letter Ester had laughed and cried and finally settled as we found her into quiet thought When Abbie came in after a little and nestled on an ottoman in front of her with an inquiring look Ester placed the letter in her hands without note or comment and Abbie read and laughed considerably then grew more sober and at last folded the letter with a very thoughtful face Well said Ester at last smiling a little And Abbie answered Oh Ester Yes said Ester you see they need me Then followed a somewhat eager somewhat sorrowful talk and then a moment of silence fell between them which Abbie broke by a sudden question Ester isn t this doctor Douglass gaining some influence over Sadie Have I imagined it or does she speak of him frequently in her letters in a way that gives me an idea that his influence is not for good I m afraid it is very true his influence over her seems to be great and it certainly is not for good The man is an infidel I think At least he is very far indeed from being a Christian Do you know I read a verse in my Bible this morning which when I think of my past influence over Sadie reminds me bitterly of myself It was like this While men slept his enemy came and sowed tares If I had not been asleep I might have won Sadie for the Savior before this enemy came Well Abbie answered gently not in the least contradicting this sad statement but yet speaking hopefully you will try to undo all this now Oh Abbie I don t know I am so weak like a child just beginning to take little steps alone instead of being the strong disciple that I might have been I distrust myself I am afraid I m not afraid for you Abbie said speaking very earnestly Because in the first place you are unlike the little child in that you must never even try to take one step alone And besides there are more verses in the Bible than that one See here let me show you mine And Abbie produced her little pocket Bible and pointed with her finger while Ester read When I am weak then am I strong Then turning the leaves rapidly as one familiar with the strongholds of that tower of safety she pointed again and Ester read What time I am afraid I will trust in thee Almost five o clock of a sultry October day one of those days which come to us sometimes during that golden month like a regretful turning back of the departing summer A day which coming to people who have much hard pressing work and who are wearied and almost stifled with the summer s heat makes them thoroughly uncomfortable not to say cross Almost five o clock and in the great dining room of the Rieds Sadie was rushing nervously back and forth very much in the same manner that Ester was doing on that first evening of our acquaintance only there was not so much method in her rushing The curtains were raised as high as the tapes would take them and the slant rays of the yellow sun were streaming boldly in doing their bravest to melt into oil the balls of butter on the table for poor tired bewildered Sadie had forgotten to let down the shades and forgotten the ice for the butter and had laid the table cloth crookedly and had no time to straighten it This had been one of her trying days The last fierce look of summer had parched anew the fevered limbs of the sufferer up stairs and roused to sharper conflict the bewildered brain missus Ried s care had been earnest and unremitting and Sadie in her unaccustomed position of mistress below stairs had reached the very verge of bewildered weariness She gave nervous glances at the inexorable clock as she flew back and forth There were those among missus Ried s boarders whose business made it almost a necessity that they should be promptly served at five o clock Maggie had been hurriedly summoned to do an imperative errand connected with the sick room and this inexperienced butterfly with her wings sadly drooping was trying to gather her scattered wits together sufficiently to get that dreadful tea table ready for the thirteen boarders who were already waiting the summons What did I come after she asked herself impatiently as she pressed her hand to her frowning forehead and stared about the pantry in a vain attempt to decide what had brought her there in such hot haste Oh a spoon no a fork I guess it was Why I don t remember the forks at all As sure as I m here I believe they are too instead of being on the table and Oh my patience I believe those biscuits are burning I wonder if they are done Oh dear me And the young lady who was mister Hammond s star scholar bent with puzzled burning face and received hot whiffs of breath from the indignant oven while she tried to discover whether the biscuits were ready to be devoured It was an engrossing employment She did not hear the sound of carriage wheels near the door nor the banging of trunks on the side piazza She was half way across the dining room with her tin of puffy biscuits in her hands with the puzzled doubtful look still on her face before she felt the touch of two soft loving arms around her neck and turning quickly she screamed rather than said Oh Ester And suddenly seating her tin of biscuit on one chair and herself on another Sadie covered her face with both hands and actually cried Why Sadie you poor dear child what can be the matter And Ester s voice was full of anxiety for it was almost the first time that she had ever seen tears on that bright young face Sadie s first remark caused a sudden revulsion of feeling Springing suddenly to her feet she bent anxious eyes on the chair full of biscuit Oh Ester she said are these biscuits done or will they be sticky and hateful in the middle How Ester laughed Then she came to the rescue Done of course they are and beautifully too Did you make them Here I ll take them out Sadie where is mother In mister Holland s room She has been there nearly all day mister Holland is no better and Maggie has gone on an errand for them Why have you come Did the fairies send you And where are the children They have gone to walk Minie wanted mother every other minute so Alfred and Julia have carried her off with them Say you dear Ester how did you happen to come How shall I be glad enough to see you Ester laughed Then I can t see any of them she said by way of answer Never mind then we ll have some tea You poor child how very tired you look Just seat yourself in that chair and see if I have forgotten how to work And Sadie who was thoroughly tired and more nervous than she had any idea she could be leaned luxuriously back in her mother s chair with a delicious sense of unresponsibility about her and watched a magic spell come over the room Down came the shades in a twinkling and the low red sun looked in on them no more the table cloth straightened itself pickles and cheese and cake got out of their confused proximity and marched each to their appropriate niche on the well ordered table a flying visit into well remembered regions returned hard sparkling ice crowned butter And when at last the fragrant tea stood ready to be served and Ester bright and smiling stationed herself behind her mother s chair Sadie gave a little relieved sigh and then she laughed You re straight from fairy land Ester I know it now That table cloth has been crooked in spite of me for a week Maggie lays it and I can not straighten it I don t get to it I travel five hundred miles every night to get this supper ready and it s never ready I have to bob up for a fork or a spoon or I put on four plates of butter and none of bread Oh there is witch work about it and none but thoroughbred witches can get every thing every little insignificant indispensable thing on a table I can t keep house You poor kitten said Ester filled with very tender sympathy for this pretty young sister and feeling very glad indeed that she had come home Who would think of expecting a butterfly to spin You shall bring those dear books down from the attic to morrow In the meantime where is the tea bell Oh we don t ring said Sadie rising as she spoke The noise disturbs mister Holland Here comes my first lieutenant who takes charge of that matter My sister Miss Ried doctor Douglass And Ester as she returned the low deferential bow bestowed upon her felt anew the thrill of anxiety which had come to her of late when she thought of this dangerous stranger in connection with her beautiful giddy unchristian sister On the whole Ester s home coming was pleasant To be sure it was a wonderful change from her late life and there was perhaps just the faintest bit of a sigh as she drew off her dainty cuffs and prepared to wipe the dishes which Sadie washed while Maggie finished her interrupted ironing What would John the stylish waiter at Uncle Ralph s think if he could see her now and how funny Abbie would look engaged in such employment but Sadie looked so bright and relieved and rested and chatted so gayly that presently Ester gave another little sigh and said Poor Abbie how very very lonely she must be to night I wish she were here for you to cheer her Sadie Later while she dipped into the flour preparatory to relieving Sadie of her fearful task of sponge setting the kitchen clock struck seven This time she laughed at the contrast They were just going down to dinner now at Uncle Ralph s Only night before last she was there herself She had been out that day with Aunt Helen and so was attired in the lovely blue silk and the real laces which were Aunt Helen s gift fastened at the throat by a tiny pearl Abbie s last offering Now they were sitting down to dinner without her and she was in the great pantry five hundred miles away a long wide calico apron quite covering up her traveling dress sleeves rolled above her elbows and engaged in scooping flour out of the barrel into her great wooden bowl But then how her mother s weary careworn face had brightened and glowed into pleased surprise as she caught the first glimpse of her how lovingly she had folded her in those dear motherly arms and said actually with lips all a tremble My dear daughter what an unexpected blessing and what a kind providence that you have come just now Then Alfred and Julia had been as eager and jubilant in their greeting as though Ester had been always to them the very perfection of a sister and hadn t little Minie crumpled her dainty collar into an unsightly rag and given her Scotch kisses and Dutch kisses and Yankee kisses and genuine sweet baby kisses in her uncontrollable glee over dear Auntie Essie And besides oh besides this Ester Ried who had come home was not the Ester Ried who had gone out from them only two months ago A whole lifetime of experience and discipline seemed to her to have been crowded into those two months Nothing of her past awakened more keen regret in this young girl s heart than the thought of her undutiful unsisterly life It was all to be different now She thanked God that he had let her come back to that very kitchen and dining room to undo her former work The old sluggish selfish spirit had gone from her Before this every thing had been done for Ester Ried now it was to be done for Christ every thing even the mixing up of that flour and water for was not the word given Whatsoever ye do do all to the glory of God How broad that word was whatsoever Why that covered every movement yes and every word How could life have seemed to her dull and uninteresting and profitless Sadie hushed her busy tongue that evening as she saw in the moonlight Ester kneeling to pray and a kind of awe stole over her for a moment as she saw that the kneeler seemed unconscious of any earthly presence Somehow it struck Sadie as a different matter from any kneeling which she had ever watched in the moonlight before And Ester as she rested her tired happy head upon her own pillow felt this word ringing sweetly in her heart And ye are Christ s and Christ is God s CHAPTER XXI TESTED Ester was winding the last smooth coil of hair around her head when Sadie opened her eyes the next morning My she said Do you know Ester it is perfectly delightful to me to lie here and look at you and remember that I shall not be responsible for those cakes this morning They shall want a pint of soda added to them for all that I shall need to know or care Ester laughed You will surely have your pantry well stocked with soda she said gayly It seems to have made a very strong impression on your mind But the greeting had chimed with her previous thoughts and sounded pleasant to her She had come home to be the helper her mother and Sadie should feel and realize after this how very much of a helper she could be That very day should be the commencement of her old new life It was baking day her detestation heretofore her pleasure now No more useful day could be chosen How she would dispatch the pies and cakes and biscuits to say nothing of the wonderful loaves of bread She smiled brightly on her young sister as she realized in a measure the weight of care which she was about to lift from her shoulders and by the time she was ready for the duties of the day she had lived over in imagination the entire routine of duties connected with that busy useful happy day She went out from her little clothes press wrapped in armor the pantry and kitchen were to be her battle field and a whole host of old temptations and trials were there to be met and vanquished So Ester planned and yet it so happened that she did not once enter the kitchen during all that long busy day and Sadie s young shoulders bore more of the hundred little burdens of life that Saturday than they had ever felt before Descending the stairs Ester met doctor Van Anden for the first time since her return He greeted her with a hurried good morning quite as if he had seen her only the day before and at once pressed her into service Miss Ester will you go to mister Holland immediately I can not find your mother Send missus Holland from the room she excites him Tell her I say she must come immediately to the sitting room I wish to see her Give mister Holland a half teaspoonful of the mixture in the wine glass every ten minutes and on no account leave him until I return which will be as soon as possible And seeming to be certain that his directions would be followed the doctor vanished For only about a quarter of a minute did Ester stand irresolute doctor Van Anden s tone and manner were full of his usual authority a habit with him which had always annoyed her She shrank with a feeling amounting almost to terror from a dark quiet room and the position of nurse Her base of operations according to her own arrangements had been the light airy kitchen where she felt herself needed at this very moment But one can think of several things in a quarter of a minute Ester had very lately taken up the habit of securing one Bible verse as part of her armor to go with her through the day On this particular morning the verse was Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do do it with thy might Now if her hands had found work waiting for her down this first flight of stairs instead of down two as she had planned what was that to her Ester turned and went swiftly to the sick room dispatched the almost frantic wife according to the doctor s peremptory orders gave the mixture as directed waited patiently for the doctor s return only to hear herself installed as head nurse for the day given just time enough to take a very hurried second table meal with Sadie listen to her half pitiful half comic complainings and learn that her mother was down with sick headache So it was that this first day at home drew toward its closing and not one single thing that Ester had planned to do and do so well had she been able to accomplish It had been very hard to sit patiently there and watch the low breathings of that almost motionless man on the bed before her to rouse him at set intervals sufficiently to pour some mixture down his unwilling lips to fan him occasionally and that was all It had been hard but Ester had not chafed under it she had recognized the necessity no nurse to be found her mother sick and the young frightened as well as worn out wife not to be trusted Clearly she was at the post of duty So as the red sun peeped in a good night from a little corner of the closed curtain it found Ester not angry but very sad Such a weary day And this man on the bed was dying both doctors had looked that at each other at least a dozen times that day How her life of late was being mixed up with death She had just passed through one sharp lesson and here at the threshold awaited another Different from that last though oh very different and herein lay some of the sadness mister Foster had said every thing was ready for the long journey even should there be no return Then she went back for a minute to the look of glory on that marble face and heard again that wonderful sentence So he giveth his beloved sleep But this man here every thing had not been made ready by him So at least she feared Yet she was conscious professed Christian though she had been living in the same house with him for so many years that she knew very little about him She had seen much of him had talked much with him but she had never mentioned to him the name of Christ the name after which she called herself The sun sank lower it was almost gone this weary day was nearly done and very sad and heavy hearted felt this young watcher the day begun in brightness was closing in gloom It was not all so clear a path as she had thought there were some things that she could not undo Those days of opportunity in which she might at least have invited this man to Jesus were gone it seemed altogether probable that there would never come another There was a little rustle of the drapery about the bed and she turned suddenly to meet the great searching eyes of the sick man bent full upon her Then he spoke in low but wonderfully distinct and solemn tones And the words he slowly uttered were yet more startling Am I going to die Oh what was Ester to say How those great bright eyes searched her soul Looking into them feeling the awful solemnity of the question she could not answer No and it seemed almost equally impossible to tell him Yes So the silence was unbroken while she trembled in every nerve and felt her face blanch before the continued gaze of those mournful eyes At length the silence seemed to answer him for he turned his head suddenly from her and half buried it in the pillow and neither spoke nor moved That awful silence That moment of opportunity perhaps the last of earth for him perhaps it was given to her to speak to him the last words that he would ever hear from mortal lips What could she say If she only knew how only had words Yet something must be said Then there came to Ester one of those marked Bible verses which had of late grown so precious and her voice low and clear filled the blank in the room God is our refuge and strength a very present help in trouble No sound from the quiet figure on the bed She could not even tell if he had heard yet perhaps he might and so she gathered them a little string of wondrous pearls and let them fall with soft and gentle cadence from her lips Commit thy way unto the Lord trust also in him and he shall bring it to pass The Lord is nigh unto all them that call upon him the Lord is gracious and full of compassion Thus saith the Lord your Redeemer the Holy One of Israel I even I am he that blotteth out thy transgressions for mine own sake and will not remember thy sins Look unto me and be ye saved all ye ends of the earth for I am God and there is none else Incline your ear and come unto me hear and your soul shall live Silence for a moment and then Ester repeated in tones that were full of sweetness that one little verse which had become the embodiment to her of all that was tender and soothing and wonderful What time I am afraid I will trust in thee Was this man moving toward the very verge of the river afraid Ester did not know was not to know whether those gracious invitations from the Redeemer of the world had fallen once more on unheeding ears or not for with a little sigh born partly of relief and partly of sorrow that the opportunity was gone she turned to meet doctor Van Anden and was sent for a few moments out into the light and glory of the departing day to catch a bit of its freshness It was as the last midnight stroke of that long long day was being given that they were gathered about the dying bed Sadie was there solemn and awe stricken missus Ried had arisen from her couch of suffering and nerved herself to be a support to the poor young wife doctor Douglass at the side of the sick man kept anxious watch over the fluttering pulse Ester on the other side looked on in helpless pity and other friends of the Hollands were grouped about the room So they watched and waited for the swift down coming of the angel of death The death damp had gathered on his brow the pulse seemed but a faint tremble now and then and those whose eyes were used to death thought that his lips would never frame mortal sound again when suddenly the eyelids raised and mister Holland fixing a steady gaze upon the eyes bent on him from the foot of the bed whither Ester had slipped to make more room for her mother and missus Holland said in a clear distinct tone one unmistakable word Pray Will Ester ever forget the start of terror which thrilled her frame as she felt that look and heard that word She cast a quick frightened glance around her of inquiry and appeal but her mother and herself were the only ones present whom she had reason to think ever prayed Could she would she that gentle timid shrinking mother But missus Ried was supporting the now almost fainting form of missus Holland and giving anxious attention to her He says pray Sadie murmured in low frightened tones Oh where is doctor Van Anden Ester knew he had been called in great haste to the house across the way and ere he could return this waiting spirit might be gone gone without a word of prayer Would Ester want to die so with no voice to cry for her to that listening Savior But then no human being had ever heard her pray Could she must she Oh for doctor Van Anden a Christian doctor Oh if that infidel stood anywhere but there with his steady hand clasping the fluttering pulse with his cool calm eyes bent curiously on her but mister Holland was dying perhaps the everlasting arms were not underneath him and at this fearful thought Ester dropped upon her knees giving utterance to her deepest need in the first uttered words Oh Holy Spirit teach me just what to say Her mother listening with startled senses as the familiar voice fell on her ear could but think that that petition was answered and Ester felt it in her very soul doctor Douglass her mother Sadie all of them were as nothing there was only this dying man and Christ and she pleading that the passing soul might be met even now by the Angel of the covenant There were those in the room who never forgot that prayer of Ester s doctor Van Anden entering hastily paused midway in the room taking in the scene in an instant of time and then was on his knees uniting his silent petitions with hers So fervent and persistent was the cry for help that even the sobs of the stricken wife were hushed in awe and only the watching doctor with his finger on the pulse knew when the last fluttering beat died out and the death angel pressed his triumphant seal on pallid lip and brow doctor Van Anden Ester said as they stood together for a moment the next morning waiting in the chamber of death for missus Ried s directions Was Did he with an inclination of her head toward the silent occupant of the couch Did he ever think he was a Christian The doctor bent on her a grave sad look and slowly shook his head Oh Doctor you can not think that he and Ester stopped her face blanching with the fearfulness of her thought Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right This was the doctor s solemn answer After a moment he added Perhaps that one eagerly spoken word Pray said as much to the ears of Him whose thoughts are not as our thoughts as did that old time petition Remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom Ester never forgot that and the following day while the corpse of one whom she had known so well lay in the house and when she followed him to the quiet grave and watched the red and yellow autumn leaves flutter down around his coffin dead leaves dead flowers dead hopes death every where not just a going up higher as mister Foster s death had been this was solemn and inexorable death More than ever she felt how impossible it was to call back the days that had slipped away while she slept and do their neglected duties She had come for this full of hope and now one of those whom she had met many times each day for years and never said Jesus to was at this moment being lowered into his narrow house and though God had graciously given her an inch of time and strength to use it it was as nothing compared with those wasted years and she could never know at least never until the call came for her whether or not at the eleventh hour this poor man cried and the Lord heard him and received him into Paradise doctor Van Anden moved around to where she was standing with tightly clasped hands and colorless lips He had been watching her and this was what he said Ester shall you and I ever stand again beside a new made grave receiving one whom we have known ever so slightly and have to settle with our consciences and our Savior because we have not invited that one to come to Jesus And Ester answered with firmly drawn lips As that Savior hears me and will help me never CHAPTER XXII LITTLE PLUM PIES Ester was in the kitchen trimming off the puffy crusts of endless pies the old brown calico morning dress the same huge bib apron which had been through endless similar scrapes with her every thing about her looking exactly as it had three months ago and yet so far as Ester and her future yes and the future of every one about her was concerned things were very different Perhaps Sadie had a glimmering of some strange change as she eyed her sister curiously and took note that there was a different light in her eye and a sort of smoothness on the quiet face that she had never noticed before In fact Sadie missed some wrinkles which she had supposed were part and parcel of Ester s self How I did hate that part of it she remarked watching the fingers that moved deftly around each completed sphere Mother said my edges always looked as if a mouse had marched around them nibbling all the way My how thoroughly I hate housekeeping I pity the one who takes me for better or worse always provided there exists such a poor victim on the face of the earth I don t think you hate it half so much as you imagine Ester answered kindly Any way you did nicely Mother says you were a great comfort to her There was a sudden mist before Sadie s eyes Did mother say that she queried The blessed woman what a very little it takes to make a comfort for her Ester I declare to you if ever angels get into kitchens and pantries and the like mother is one of them The way she bore with my endless blunderings was perfectly angelic I m glad though that her day of martyrdom is over and mine too for that matter And Sadie who had returned to the kingdom of spotless dresses and snowy cuffs and above all to the dear books and the academy caught at that moment the sound of the academy bell and flitted away Ester filled the oven with pies then went to the side doorway to get a peep at the glowing world It was the very perfection of a day autumn meant to die in wondrous beauty that year Ester folded her bare arms and gazed She felt little thrills of a new kind of restlessness all about her this morning She wanted to do something grand something splendidly good It was all very well to make good pies she had done that given them the benefit of her highest skill in that line now they were being perfected in the oven and she waited for something If ever a girl longed for an opportunity to show her colors to honor her leader it was our Ester Oh yes she meant to do the duty that lay next her but she perfectly ached to have that next duty something grand something that would show all about her what a new life she had taken on doctor Van Anden was tramping about in his room over the side piazza a very unusual proceeding with him at that hour of the day his windows were open and he was singing and the fresh lake wind brought tune and words right down to Ester s ear I would not have the restless will That hurries to and fro Seeking for some great thing to do Or wondrous thing to know I would be guided as a child And led where er I go I ask thee for the daily strength To none that ask denied A mind to blend with outward life While keeping at thy side Content to fill a little space If thou be glorified Of course doctor Van Anden did not know that Ester Ried stood in the doorway below and was at that precise moment in need of just such help as this but then what mattered that so long as the Master did Just then another sense belonging to Ester did its duty and gave notice that the pies in the oven were burning and she ran to their rescue humming meantime Content to fill a little space If thou be glorified Eleven o clock found her busily paring potatoes hurrying a little for in spite of swift busy fingers their work was getting a little the best of Maggie and her and one pair of very helpful hands was missing Alfred and Julia appeared from somewhere in the outer regions and Ester was too busy to see that they both carried rather woe begone faces Hasn t mother got back yet queried Alfred Why no said Ester She will not be back until to night perhaps not then Didn t you know missus Carleton was worse Alfred kicked his heels against the kitchen door in a most disconsolate manner Somebody s always sick he grumbled out at last A fellow might as well not have a mother I never saw the beat nobody for miles around here can have the toothache without borrowing mother I m just sick and tired of it Ester had nearly laughed but catching a glimpse of the forlorn face she thought better of it and said Something is awry now I know You never want mother in such a hopeless way as that unless you re in trouble so you see you are just like the rest of them every body wants mother when they are in any difficulty But she is my mother and I have a right to her and the rest of em haven t Well said Ester soothingly suppose I be mother this time Tell me what s the matter and I ll act as much like her as possible You And thereupon Alfred gave a most uncomplimentary sniff Queer work you d make of it Try me was the good natured reply I ain t going to I know well enough you d say fiddlesticks or nonsense or some such word and finish up with Just get out of my way Now although Ester s cheeks were pretty red over this exact imitation of her former ungracious self she still answered briskly Very well suppose I should make such a very rude and unmotherlike reply fiddlesticks and nonsense would not shoot you would they At which sentence Alfred stopped kicking his heels against the door and laughed Tell us all about it continued Ester following up her advantage Nothing to tell much only all the folks are going a sail on the lake this afternoon and going to have a picnic in the grove the very last one before snow and I meant to ask mother to let us go only how was I going to know that missus Carleton would get sick and come away down here after her before daylight and I know she would have let me go too and they re going to take things a basketful each one of em and they wanted me to bring little bits of pies such as mother bakes in little round tins you know plum pies and she would have made me some I know she always does but now she s gone and it s all up and I shall have to stay at home like I always do just for sick folks It s mean any how Ester smothered a laugh over this curious jumble and asked a humble question Is there really nothing that would do for your basket but little bits of plum pies No Alfred explained earnestly Because you see they ve got plenty of cake and such stuff the girls bring that and they do like my pies awfully I most always take em mister Hammond likes them too he s going along to take care of us and I shouldn t like to go without the little pies because they depend upon them Oh said Ester girls go too do they And she looked for the first time at the long sad face of Julia in the corner Yes and Jule is in just as much trouble as I am cause they are all going to wear white dresses and she s tore hers and she says she can t wear it till it s ironed cause it looks like a rope and Maggie says she can t and won t iron it to day so and mother was going to mend it this very morning and Oh fudge it s no use talking we ve got to stay at home Jule so now And the kicking heels commenced again Ester pared her last potato with a half troubled half amused face She was thoroughly tired of baking for that day and felt like saying fiddlesticks to the little plum pies and that white dress was torn cris cross and every way and ironing was always hateful besides it did seem strange that when she wanted to do some great nice thing so much plum pies and torn dresses should step right into her path Then unconsciously she repeated Content to fill a little space If Thou art glorified Could He be glorified though by such very little things Yet hadn t she wanted to gain an influence over Alfred and Julia and wasn t this her first opportunity besides there was that verse Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do At that point her thoughts took shape in words Well sir we ll see whether mother is the only woman in this world after all You tramp down cellar and bring me up that stone jar on the second shelf and we ll have those pies in the oven in a twinkling and that little woman in the corner with two tears rolling down her cheeks may bring her white dress and my work box and thimble and put two irons on the stove and my word for it you shall both be ready by three o clock spry and span pies and all By three o clock on the afternoon in question Ester was thoroughly tired but little plum pies by the dozen were cuddling among snowy napkins in the willow basket and Alfred s face was radiant as he expressed his satisfaction after this fashion You re just jolly Ester I didn t know you could be so good Won t the boys chuckle over these pies though Ester there s just seven more than mother ever made me Very well answered Ester gayly then there will be just seven more chuckles this time than usual Julia expressed her thoughts in a way more like her She surveyed her skillfully mended and beautifully smooth white dress with smiling eyes and as Ester tied the blue sash in a dainty knot and stepped back to see that all was as it should be she was suddenly confronted with this question Ester what does make you so nice to day you didn t ever used to be so How the blood rushed into Ester s cheeks as she struggled with her desire to either laugh or cry she hardly knew which These were very little things which she had done and it was shameful that in all the years of her elder sisterhood she had never sacrificed even so little of her own pleasure before yet it was true and it made her feel like crying and yet there was rather a ludicrous side to the question to think that all her beautiful plans for the day had culminated in plum pies and ironing She stooped and kissed Julia on the rosy cheek and answered gently moved by some inward impulse I am trying to do all my work for Jesus nowadays You didn t mend my dress and iron it and curl my hair and fix my sash for him did you Yes every little thing Why I don t see how I thought you did them for me I did Julia to please you and make you happy but Jesus says that that is just the same as doing it for him Julia s next question was very searching But Ester I thought you had been a member of the church a good many years Sadie said so Didn t you ever try to do things for Jesus before A burning blush of genuine shame mantled Ester s face but she answered quickly No I don t think I ever really did Julia eyed her for a moment with a look of grave wonderment then suddenly stood on tiptoe to return the kiss as she said Well I think it is nice anyway If Jesus likes to have you be so kind and take so much trouble for me why then he must love me and I mean to thank him this very night when I say my prayers And as Ester rested for a moment in the arm chair on the piazza and watched her little brother and sister move briskly off she hummed again those two lines that had been making unconscious music in her heart all day Content to fill a little space If Thou be glorified CHAPTER XXIII CROSSES The large church was very full there seemed not to be another space for a human being People who were not much given to frequenting the house of God on a week day evening had certainly been drawn thither at this time Sadie Ried sat beside Ester in their mother s pew and Harry Arnett with a sober look on his boyish face sat bolt upright in the end of the pew while even doctor Douglass leaned forward with graceful nonchalance from the seat behind them and now and then addressed a word to Sadie These people had been listening to such a sermon as is very seldom heard that blessed man of God whose name is dear to hundreds and thousands of people whose hair is whitened with the frosts of many a year spent in the Master s service whose voice and brain and heart are yet strong and powerful and mighty through God the reverend mister Parker had been speaking to them and his theme had been the soul and his text had been What shall it profit a man if he gain the whole world and lose his own soul I hope I am writing for many who have had the honor of hearing that appeal fresh from the great brain and greater heart of mister Parker Such will understand the spell under which his congregation sat even after the prayer and hymn had died into silence Now the gray haired veteran stood bending over the pulpit waiting for the Christian witnesses to the truth of his solemn messages and for that he seemed likely to wait A few earnest men veterans too in the cause gave in their testimony and then occurred one of those miserable disheartening disgraceful pauses which are met with nowhere on earth among a company of intelligent men and women with liberty given them to talk save in a prayer meeting Still silence and still the aged servant stood with one arm resting on the Bible and looked down almost beseechingly upon that crowd of dumb Christians Ye are my witnesses saith the Lord he repeated in earnest pleading tones Miserable witnesses they Was not the Lord ashamed of them all I wonder Something like this flitted through Ester s brain as she looked around upon that faithless company and noted here and there one who certainly ought to take up his cross Then some slight idea of the folly of that expression struck her What a fearful cross it was to be sure What a strange idea to use the same word in describing it that was used for that blood stained nail pierced cross on Calvary Then a thought very startling in its significance came to her Was that cross borne only for men were they the only ones who had a thank offering because of Calvary Surely her Savior hung there and bled and groaned and died for HER Why should not she say By his stripes I am healed What if she should What would people think No not that either What would Jesus think that after all was the important question Did she really believe that if she should say in the hearing of that assembled company I love Jesus that Jesus looking down upon her and hearing how her timid voice broke the dishonoring silence would be displeased would set it down among the long list of ought not to have dones She tried to imagine herself speaking to him in her closet after this manner Dear Savior I confess with shame that I have brought reproach upon thy name this day for I said in the presence of a great company of witnesses that I loved thee In defiance of her education and former belief upon this subject Ester was obliged to confess then and there that all this was extremely ridiculous Oh well said Satan it s not exactly wrong of course but then it isn t very modest or ladylike and besides it is unnecessary There are plenty of men to do the talking But said common sense I don t see why it s a bit more unladylike than the ladies colloquy at the lyceum was last evening There were more people present than are here tonight and as for the men they are perfectly mum There seems to be plenty of opportunity for somebody Well said Satan it isn t customary at least and people will think strangely of you Doubtless it would do more harm than good This most potent argument People will think strangely of you smothered common sense at once as it is apt to do and Ester raised her head from the bowed position which it had occupied during this whirl of thought and considered the question settled Some one began to sing and of all the words that could have been chosen came the most unfortunate ones for this decision On my head he poured his blessing Long time ago Now he calls me to confess him Before I go My past life all vile and hateful He saved from sin I should be the most ungrateful Not to own him Death and hell he bade defiance Bore cross and pain Shame my tongue this guilty silence And speak his name This at once renewed the struggle but in a different form She no longer said Ought I but Can I Still the spell of silence seemed unbroken save by here and there a voice and still Ester parleyed with her conscience getting as far now as to say When mister Jones sits down if there is another silence I will try to say something not quite meaning though to do any such thing and proving her word false by sitting very still after mister Jones sat down though there was plenty of silence Then when mister Smith said a few words Ester whispered the same assurance to herself with exactly the same result The something decided for which she had been longing the opportunity to show the world just where she stood had come at last and this was the way in which she was meeting it At last she knew by the heavy thuds which her heart began to give that the question was decided that the very moment Deacon Graves sat down she would rise whether she would say any thing or not would depend upon whether God gave her any thing to say but at least she could stand up for Jesus But mister Parker s voice followed Deacon Graves and this was what he said Am I to understand by your silence that there is not a Christian man or woman in all this company who has an unconverted friend whom he or she would like to have us pray for Then the watching Angel of the Covenant came to the help of this trembling struggling Ester and there entered into her heart such a sudden and overwhelming sense of longing for Sadie s conversion that all thought of what she would say and how she would say it and what people would think passed utterly out of her mind and rising suddenly she spoke in clear and wonderfully earnest tones Will you pray for a dear dear friend God sometimes uses very humble means with which to break the spell of silence which Satan so often weaves around Christians it was as if they had all suddenly awakened to a sense of their privileges doctor Van Anden said in a voice which quivered with feeling I have a brother in the profession for whom I ask your prayers that he may become acquainted with the great Physician Request followed request for husbands and wives mothers and fathers and children Even timid meek faced low voiced missus Ried murmured a request for her children who were out of Christ And when at last Harry Arnett suddenly lifted his handsome boyish head from its bowed position and said in tones which conveyed the sense of a decision Pray for me the last film of worldliness vanished and there are those living to day who have reason never to forget that meeting Is it your private opinion that our good doctor got up a streak of disinterested enthusiasm over my unworthy self this evening This question doctor Douglass asked of Sadie as they lingered on the piazza in the moonlight Sadie laughed gleefully I am sure I don t know I m prepared for any thing strange that can possibly happen Mother and Ester between them have turned the world upside down for me to night In case you are the happy man I hope you are grateful Extremely Should be more so perhaps if people would be just to me in private and not so alarmingly generous in public How bitter you are against doctor Van Anden Sadie said watching the lowering brow and sarcastic curve of the lip with curious eyes How much I should like to know precisely what is the trouble between you doctor Douglass instantly recovered his suavity Do I appear bitter I beg your pardon for exhibiting so ungentlemanly a phase of human nature yet hypocrisy does move me to And then occurred one of those sudden periods with which doctor Douglass always seemed to stop himself when any thing not quite courteous was being said Just forget that last sentence he added It was unwise and unkind the trouble between us is not worthy of a thought of yours I wish I could forget it I believe I could if he would allow me At this particular moment the subject of the above conversation appeared in the door Sadie gave a slight start the thought that doctor Van Anden had heard the talk was not pleasant She need not have feared he had just come from his room and from his knees He spoke abruptly and with a touch of nervousness doctor Douglass may I have a few words with you in private doctor Douglass Certainly if Miss Sadie will excuse us was both prompt and courteous apparently though the tone said almost as plainly as words could have done To what can I be indebted for this honor doctor Van Anden led the way into the brightly lighted vacant parlor and there doctor Douglass stationed himself directly under the gas light where he could command a full view of the pale somewhat anxious face of his companion and waited with that indescribable air made up of nonchalance and insolence doctor Van Anden dashed into his subject doctor Douglass ten years ago you did what you could to injure me I thought then purposely I think now that perhaps you were sincere Be that as it may I used language to you then which I as a Christian man ought never to have used I have repented it long ago but in my blindness I have never seen that I ought to apologize to you for it until this evening God has shown me my duty doctor Douglass I ask your pardon for the angry words I spoke to you that day The gentleman addressed kept his full bright eyes fixed on doctor Van Anden and answered him in the quietest and at the same time iciest of tones You are certainly very kind now that your anger has had time to cool during these ten years to accord to me the merit of being possibly sincere Now I was more Christian in my conclusions I set you down as an honest blunderer That I have had occasion since to change my opinion is nothing to the purpose but it would be pleasanter for both of us if apologies could restore our friend missus Lyons to life During this response doctor Van Anden s face was a study It had passed in quick succession through so many shades of feeling anxiety anger disgust and finally surprise and apparently a dawning sense of a new development for he made the apparently irrelevant reply Do you think I administered that chloroform doctor Douglass coolness forsook him for a moment Who did he queried with flashing eyes doctor Gilbert doctor Gilbert Yes sir How does it happen that I never knew it I am sure I do not know doctor Van Anden passed his hand across his eyes and spoke in sadness and weariness I had no conception that you were not aware of it until this moment It explains in part what was strangely mysterious to me but even in that case it would have been as you said a blunder not a criminal act However we can not undo that past I desire above all other things to set myself right in your eyes as a Christian man I think I may have been a stumbling block to you God only knows how bitter is the thought I have done wrong I should have acknowledged it years ago I can only do it now Again I ask you doctor Douglass will you pardon those bitterly spoken words of mine doctor Douglass bowed stiffly with an increase of hauteur visible in every line of his face Give yourself no uneasiness on that score doctor Van Anden nor on any other I beg you so far as I am concerned My opinion of Christianity is peculiar perhaps but has not altered of late nor is it likely to do so Of course every gentleman is bound to accept the apology of another however tardily it may be offered Shall I bid you good evening sir And with a very low very dignified bow doctor Douglass went back to the piazza and Sadie And groaning in spirit over the tardiness of his effort doctor Van Anden returned to his room and prayed that he might renew his zeal and his longing for the conversion of that man s soul Have you been receiving a little fraternal advice queried Sadie her mischievous eyes dancing with fun over the supposed discomfiture of one of the two gentlemen she cared very little which Not at all On the contrary I have been giving a little of that mixture in a rather unpalatable form I fear I haven t a very high opinion of the world Miss Sadie Including yourself do you mean was Sadie s demure reply doctor Douglass looked the least bit annoyed then he laughed and answered with quiet grace Yes including even such an important individual as myself However I have one merit which I consider very rare sincerity Sadie s face assumed a half puzzled half amused expression as she tried by the moonlight to give a searching look at the handsome form leaning against the pillar opposite her I wonder if you are as sincere as you pretend to be was her next complimentary sentence And also I wonder if the rest of the world are as unlimited a set of humbugs as you suppose How do you fancy you happened to escape getting mixed up with the general humbugism of the world This mister Parker now talks as though he felt it and meant it He is a first class fanatic of the most outrageous sort There ought to be a law forbidding such ranters to hold forth on pain of imprisonment for life doctor Douglass said Sadie speaking with grave dignity I would rather not hear you speak of that old gentleman in such a manner He may be a fanatic and a ranter but I believe he means it and I can t help respecting him more than any cold blooded moralist that I ever met Besides I can not forget that my honored father was among the despised class of whom you speak so scornfully My dear friend and doctor Douglass tone was as gentle as her mother s could have been forgive me if I have pained you it was not intentional I do not know what I have been saying some unkind things perhaps and that is always ungentlemanly but I have been greatly disturbed this evening and that must be my apology Pardon me for detaining you so long in the evening air May I advise you professionally to go in immediately May I advise you unselfishly to get into a better humor with the world in general and doctor Van Anden in particular before you undertake to talk with a lady again Sadie answered in her usual tones of raillery all her dignity had departed Meantime if you would like to have unmolested possession of this piazza to assist you in tramping off your evil spirit you shall be indulged I m going to the west side The evening air and I are excellent friends And with a mocking laugh and bow Sadie departed I wonder she soliloquized returning to gravity the moment she was alone I wonder what that man has been saying to him now How unhappy these two gentlemen make themselves It would be a consolation to know right from wrong I just wish I believed in everybody as I used to The idea of this gray headed minister being a hypocrite that s absurd But then the idea of doctor Van Anden being what he is Well it s a queer world I believe I ll go to bed CHAPTER XXIV GOD S WAY Be it understood that doctor Douglass was very much astonished and not a little disgusted with himself As he marched defiantly up and down the long piazza he tried to analyze his state of mind He had always supposed himself to be a man possessed of keen powers of discernment and yet withal exercising considerable charity toward his erring fellow men willing to overlook faults and mistakes priding himself not a little on the kind and gentlemanly way in which he could meet ruffled human nature of any sort In fact he dwelt on a sort of pedestal from the hight of which he looked calmly and excusingly down on weaker mortals This until to night now he realized in a confused blundering sort of way that his pedestal had crumbled or that he had tumbled from its hight or at least that something new and strange had happened For instance what had become of his powers of discernment Here was this miserable doctor who had been one of the thorns of his life whom he had looked down upon as a canting hypocrite Was he after all mistaken The explanation of to night looked like it he had been deceived in that matter which had years ago come between them he could see it very plainly now In spite of himself the doctor s earnest manly apology would come back and repeat itself to his brain and demand admiration Now doctor Douglass was honestly amazed at himself because he was not pleased with this state of things Why was he not glad to discover that doctor Van Anden was more of a man than he had ever supposed This would certainly be in keeping with the character of the courteous unprejudiced gentleman that he had hitherto considered himself to be but there was no avoiding the fact that the very thought of doctor Van Anden was exasperating more so this evening than ever before And the more his judgment became convinced that he had blundered the more vexed did he become Confound everybody he exclaimed at length in utter disgust What on earth do I care for the contemptible puppy that I should waste thought on him What possessed the fellow to come whining around me to night and set me in a whirl of disagreeable thought I ought to have knocked him down for his insufferable impudence in dragging me out publicly in that meeting This he said aloud but something made answer down in his heart Oh it s very silly of you to talk in this way You know perfectly well that doctor Van Anden is not a contemptible puppy at all He is a thoroughly educated talented physician a formidable rival and you know it and he didn t whine in the least this evening he made a very manly apology for what was not so very bad after all and you more than half suspect yourself of admiring him Fiddlesticks said doctor Douglass aloud to all this information and went off to his room in high dudgeon The next two days seemed to be very busy ones to one member of the Ried family doctor Douglass sometimes appeared at meal time and sometimes not but the parlor and the piazza were quite deserted and even his own room saw little of him Sadie when she chanced by accident to meet him on the stairs stopped to inquire if the village was given over to small pox or any other dire disease which required his constant attention and he answered her in tones short and sharp enough to have been doctor Van Anden himself It is given over to madness and moved rapidly on This encounter served to send him on a long tramp into the woods that very afternoon In truth doctor Douglass was overwhelmed with astonishment at himself Two such days and nights as the last had been he hoped never to see again It was as if all his pet theories had deserted him at a moment s warning and the very spirit of darkness taken up his abode in their place Go whither he would do what he would he was haunted by these new strange thoughts Sometimes he actually feared that he at least was losing his mind whether the rest of the world were or not Being an utter unbeliever in the power of prayer knowing indeed nothing at all about it he would have scoffed at the idea that doctor Van Anden s impassioned oft repeated petitions had aught to do with him at this time Had he known that at the very time in which he was marching through the dreary woods kicking the red and yellow leaves from his path in sullen gloom Ester in her little clothes press on her knees was pleading with God for his soul and that through him Sadie might be reached I presume he would have laughed The result of this long communion with himself was as follows That he had overworked and underslept that his nervous system was disordered that in the meantime he had been fool enough to attend that abominable sensation meeting and the man actually had wonderful power over the common mind and used his eloquence in a way that was quite calculated to confuse a not perfectly balanced brain It was no wonder then in his state of bodily disorder that the sympathetic mind should take the alarm So much for the disease now for the remedy He would study less at least he would stop reading half the night away he would begin to practice some of his own preaching and learn to be more systematic more careful of this wonderful body which could cause so much suffering he would ride fast and long above all he would keep away from that church and that man with his fanciful pictures and skillfully woven words Having determined his plan of action he felt better There was no sense he told himself in yielding to the sickly sentimentalism which had bewitched him for the past few days he was ashamed of it and would have no more of it He was master of his own mind he guessed always had been and always would be And he started on his homeward walk with a good deal of alacrity and much of his usual composure settling on his face Oh would the gracious Spirit which had been struggling with him leave him indeed to himself O God pleaded Ester give me this one soul in answer to my prayer For the sake of Sadie bring this strong pillar obstructing her way to thyself For the sake of Jesus who died for them both bring them both to yield to him doctor Douglass paused at the place where two roads forked and mused and the subject of his musing was no more important than this Should he go home by the river path or through the village The river path was the longer and it was growing late nearly tea time but if he took the main road he would pass his office where he was supposed to be as well as several houses where he ought to have been besides meeting probably several people whom he would rather not see just at present On the whole he decided to take the river road and walked briskly along quite in harmony with himself once more and enjoying the autumn beauty spread around him A little white speck attracted his attention he almost stopped to examine into it then smiled at his curiosity and moved on A bit of waste paper probably he said to himself Yet what a curious shape it was as if it had been carefully folded and hidden under that stone Suppose I see what it is Who knows but I shall find a fortune hidden in it He turned back a step or two and stooped for the little white speck One corner of it was nestled under a stone It was a ragged rumpled muddy fragment of a letter or an essay which rain and wind and water had done their best to annihilate and finally seeming to become weary of their plaything had tossed it contemptuously on the shore and a pitying stone had rolled down and covered and preserved a tiny corner doctor Douglass eyed it curiously trying to decipher the mud stained lines and being in a dreamy mood wondered meanwhile what young fair hand had penned the words and what of joy or sadness filled them Scarcely a word was readable at least nothing that would gratify his curiosity until he turned the bit of leaf and the first line which the stone had hidden shone out distinctly Sometimes I can not help asking myself why I was made Here the corner was torn off and whether that was the end of the original sentence or not it was the end to him God sometimes uses very simple means with which to confound the wisdom of this world Such a sudden and extraordinary revulsion of feeling as swept over doctor Douglass he had never dreamed of before He did not stop to question the strangeness of his state of mind nor why that bit of soiled torn paper should possess so fearful a power over him He did not even realize at the moment that it was connected with this bewilderment he only knew that the foundation upon which he had been building for years seemed suddenly to have been torn from under him by invisible hands and left his feet sinking slowly down on nothing and his inmost soul took suddenly up that solemn question with which he had never before troubled his logical brain I can not help asking myself why I was made There was only one other readable word on that paper turn it whichever way he would and that word was God and he started and shivered when his eye met this as if some awful voice had spoken it to his ear What unaccountable witchcraft has taken possession of me he muttered at length And turning suddenly he sat himself down on an old decaying log by the river side and gave himself up to real honest solemn thought Where is doctor Douglass queried Julia appearing at the dining room door just at tea time There is a boy at the door says they want him at Judge Beldon s this very instant He s nowhere answered Sadie solemnly pausing in the work of arranging cups and saucers It s my private opinion that he has been and gone and hung himself He passed the window about one o clock looking precisely as I should suppose a man would who was about to commit that interesting act since which time I ve answered the bell seventeen times to give the same melancholy story of his whereabouts My exclaimed the literal Julia hurrying back to the boy at the door She comprehended her sister sufficiently to have no faith in the hanging statement but honestly believed in the seventeen sick people who were waiting for the doctor The church was very full again that evening Sadie had at first declared herself utterly unequal to another meeting that week but had finally allowed herself to be persuaded into going and had nearly been the cause of poor Julia s disgrace because of the astonished look which she assumed as doctor Douglass came down the aisle with his usual quiet composure of manner and took the seat directly in front of them The sermon was concluded The text See I have set before thee this day life and good death and evil had been dwelt upon in such a manner that it seemed to some as if the aged servant of God had verily been shown a glimpse of the two unseen worlds waiting for every soul and was painting from actual memory the picture for them to look upon That most solemn of all solemn hymns had just been sung There is a time we know not when A point we know not where That marks the destiny of men Twixt glory and despair There is a line by us unseen That crosses every path The hidden boundary between God s mercy and his wrath Silence had but fairly settled on the waiting congregation when a strong firm voice broke in upon it and the speaker said I believe in my soul that I have met that point and crossed that line this day I surely met God s mercy and his wrath face to face and struggled in their power Your hymn says To cross that boundary is to die but I thank God that there are two sides to it I feel that I have been standing on the very line that my feet had well nigh slipped To night I step over on to mercy s side Reckon me henceforth among those who have chosen life Amen said the veteran minister with radiant face Thank God said the earnest pastor with quivering lip Two heads were suddenly bowed in the silent ecstasy of prayer they were Ester s and doctor Van Anden s As for Sadie she sat straight and still as if petrified with amazement as she well nigh felt herself to be for the strong firm voice belonged to doctor Douglass An hour later doctor Van Anden was pacing up and down the long parlor with quick excited steps waiting for he hardly knew what when a shadow fell between him and the gaslight He glanced up suddenly and his eyes met doctor Douglass who had placed himself in precisely the same position in which he had stood when they had met there before doctor Van Anden started forward and the two gentlemen clasped hands as they had never in their lives done before doctor Douglass broke the beautiful silence first with earnestly spoken words Doctor will you forgive all the past And doctor Van Anden answered Oh my brother in Christ As for Ester she prayed in her clothes press thankfully for doctor Douglass more hopefully for Sadie and knew not that a corner of the poor little letter which had slipped from Julia s hand and floated down the stream one summer morning thereby causing her such a miserable miserable day was lying at that moment in doctor Douglass note book counted as the most precious of all his precious bits of paper Verily His ways are not as our ways CHAPTER XXV SADIE SURROUNDED Oh said Sadie with a merry toss of her brown curls don t waste any more precious breath over me I beg I m an unfortunate case not worth struggling for Just let me have a few hours of peace once more If you ll promise not to say meeting again to me I ll promise not to laugh at you once after this long drawn out spasm of goodness has quieted and you have each descended to your usual level once more Sadie said Ester in a low shocked tone do you think we are all hypocrites and mean not a bit of this By no means my dear sister of charity at least not all of you I m a firm believer in diseases of all sorts This is one of the violent kind of highly contagious diseases they must run their course you know I have not lived in the house with two learned physicians all this time without learning that fact but I consider this very nearly at its height and live in hourly expectation of the turn But my dear I don t think you need worry about me in the least I don t believe I m a fit subject for such trouble You know I never took whooping cough nor measles though I have been exposed a great many times To this Ester only replied by a low tremulous Don t Sadie please Sadie turned a pair of mirthful eyes upon her for a moment and noting with wonder the pale anxious face and quivering lip of her sister seemed suddenly sobered Ester she said quietly I don t think you are playing good I don t positively I believe you are thoroughly in earnest but I think you have been through some very severe scenes of late sickness and watching and death and your nerves are completely unstrung I don t wonder at your state of feeling but you will get over it in a little while and be yourself again Oh said Ester tremulously I pray God I may never be myself again not the old self that you mean You will Sadie answered with roguish positiveness Things will go cross wise the fire won t burn and the kettle won t boil and the milk pitcher will tip over and all sorts of mischievous things will go on happening after a little bit just as usual and you will feel like having a general smash up of every thing in spite of all these meetings Ester sighed heavily The old difficulty again things would not be undone The weeds which she had been carelessly sowing during all these past years had taken deep root and would not give place After a moment s silence she spoke again Sadie answer me just one question What do you think of doctor Douglass Sadie s face darkened ominously Never mind what I think of him she answered in short sharp tones and abruptly left the room What she did think of him was this That he had become that which he had affected to consider the most despicable thing on earth a hypocrite Remember she had no personal knowledge of the power of the Spirit of God over a human soul She had no conception of how so mighty a change could be wrought in the space of a few hours so her only solution of the mystery was that to serve some end which he had in view doctor Douglass had chosen to assume a new character Later on that same day Sadie encountered doctor Douglass rather she went to the side piazza equipped for a walk and he came eagerly from the west end to speak with her Miss Sadie I have been watching for you I have a few words that are burning to be said Proceed said Sadie standing with demurely folded hands and a mock gravity in her roguish eyes I want to do justice at this late day to doctor Van Anden I misjudged him wronged him perhaps prejudiced you against him I want to undo my work Some things can be done more easily than they can be undone was Sadie s grave and dignified reply You certainly have done your best to prejudice me against doctor Van Anden not only but against all other persons who hold his peculiar views and you have succeeded splendidly I congratulate you That look of absolute pain which she had seen once or twice on this man s face swept over it now as he answered her I know I have been blind and stupid wicked any thing you will Most bitterly do I regret it now most eager am I to make reparation Sadie s only answer was What a capital actor you would make doctor Douglass Are you sure you have not mistaken your vocation I know what you think of me This with an almost quivering lip and a voice strangely humble and as unlike as possible to any which she had ever heard from doctor Douglass before You think I am playing a part Though what my motive could be I can not imagine can you But I do solemnly assure you that if ever I was sincere in any thing in all my life I am now concerning this matter There is a most unfortunate if in the way Doctor You see the trouble is I have very serious doubts as to whether you ever were sincere in any thing in your life As to motives a first class anybody likes to try his power You will observe that I have a very poor opinion of the world The Doctor did not notice the quotation of his favorite expression but answered with a touch of his accustomed dignity I may have deserved this treatment at your hands Miss Sadie Doubtless I have although I am not conscious of ever having said to you any thing which I did not think I meant I have been a fool I am willing yes and anxious to own it But there are surely some among your acquaintances whom you can trust if you can not me I Sadie interrupted him For instance that first class fanatic of the most objectionable stamp the man who doctor Douglass thought not three days ago ought to be bound by law to keep the peace I suppose you would have me unhesitatingly receive every word he says doctor Douglass face brightened instantly and he spoke eagerly I remember those words Miss Sadie and just how honestly I spoke them and just how bitterly I felt when I spoke them and I have no more sure proof that this thing is of God than I have in noting the wonderful change which has come over my feelings in regard to that blessed man I pray God that he may be permitted to speak to your soul with the tremendous power that he has to mine Oh Sadie I have led you astray may I not help you back I am not a weather vane doctor Douglass to be whirled about by every wind of expediency besides I am familiar with one verse in the Bible of which you seem never to have heard Whatsoever a man soweth that shall he also reap You have sowed well and faithfully be content with your harvest I do not know what the pale grave lips would have answered to this mocking spirit for at that moment doctor Van Anden and the black ponies whizzed around the corner and halted before the gate Sadie said the doctor are you in the mood for a ride I have five miles to drive doctor Van Anden answered Sadie promptly the last time you and I took a ride together we quarreled Precisely said the Doctor bowing low Let us take another now and make up Very well was the gleeful answer which he received and in another minute they were off For the first mile or two he kept a tight rein and let the ponies skim over the ground in the liveliest fashion during which time very little talking was done After that he slackened his speed and leaning back in the carriage addressed himself to Sadie Now we are ready to make up How shall we commence asked Sadie gravely Who quarreled answered the Doctor sententiously Well said Sadie I understand what you are waiting for You think I was very rude and unladylike in my replies to you during that last interesting ride we took You think I jumped at unwarrantable conclusions and used some unnecessarily sharp words I think so myself and if it will be of any service to you to know it I don t mind telling you in the least That is a very excellent beginning answered the Doctor heartily I think we shall have no difficulty in getting the matter all settled Now for my part it won t sound as well as yours because however blunderingly I may have said what I did I said it honestly in good faith and with a good and pure motive But I am glad to be able to say in equal honesty that I believe I was over cautious that doctor Douglass was never so little worthy of regard as I supposed him to be and that nothing could have more rejoiced my heart than the noble stand which he has so recently taken Indeed his conduct has been so noble that I feel honored by his acquaintance He was interrupted by a mischievous laugh A mutual admiration society said Sadie in her most mocking tone Did you and doctor Douglass have a private rehearsal You interrupted him in a similar rhapsody over your perfections Instead of seeming annoyed doctor Van Anden s face glowed with pleasure Did he explain to you our misunderstanding he asked eagerly That was very noble in him Of course He is the soul of nobility a villain yesterday and a saint to day I don t understand such marvelously rapid changes Doctor I know you don t the Doctor answered quietly Although you have exaggerated both terms yet there is a great and marvelous change which must be experienced to be understood Will you never seek it for yourself Sadie I presume I never shall as I very much doubt the existence of any such phenomenon The Doctor appeared neither shocked nor surprised but favored her with a cool and quiet reply Oh no you don t doubt it in the least Don t try to make yourself out that foolish and unreasonable creature an unbeliever in what is as clear to a thinking mind as is the sun at noonday You and I have no need to enter into an argument concerning this matter You have seen some unwise and inconsistent acts in many who are called by the name of Christian You imagine that they have staggered your belief in the verity of the thing itself Yet it is not so You had a dear father who lived and died in the faith and you no more doubt the fact that he is in heaven to day brought there by the power of the Savior in whom he trusted than you doubt your own existence at this moment Sadie sat silenced and grave she was very rarely either perhaps doctor Van Anden was the one person who could have thus subdued her but in her inmost heart she felt his words to be true that dear dear father whose weary suffering life had been one long evidence to the truth of the religion which he professed yes it was so she no more doubted that he was at this moment in that blessed heaven toward which his hopes had so constantly tended than she doubted the shining of that day s sun so he being dead yet spoke to her Besides her keen judgment had of late settled back upon the belief that doctor Van Anden lived a life that would bear watching a true earnest manly life also that he was a man not likely to be deceived So sitting back there in the carriage and appearing to look at nothing and be interested in nothing she allowed herself to take in again the firm conviction that whatever most lives were there was always that father safe safe in the Christian s heaven and there were besides some few a very few she thought but there were some still living whom she knew yes actually knew were fitting for that same far away safe place No Sadie had stood upon the brink was standing there still indeed but reason and the long buried father still kept her from toppling over into the chasm of settled unbelief Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord from henceforth Yea saith the Spirit that they may rest from their labors and their works do follow them But something must be said Sadie was not going to sit there and allow doctor Van Anden to imagine that she was utterly quieted and conquered she would rather quarrel with him than have that He had espoused doctor Douglass cause so emphatically let him argue for him now there was nothing like a good sharp argument to destroy the effect of unpleasant personal questions so she blazed into sudden indignation I think doctor Douglass is a hypocrite Nothing could have been more composed than the tone in which she was answered Very well What then This question was difficult to answer and Sadie remaining silent her companion continued mister Smith is a drunkard therefore I will be a thief Is that Miss Sadie Ried s logic I don t see the point Don t you Wasn t that exclamation concerning doctor Douglass a bit of hiding behind the supposed sin of another a sort of a reason why you were not a Christian because somebody else pretended to be Is that sound logic Sadie When your next neighbor in class peeps in her book and thereby disgraces herself and becomes a hypocrite do you straightway declare that you will study no more You see it is fashionable in talking of this matter of religion to drag out the shortcomings and inconsistencies of others and try to make of them a garment to covet our own sins but it is very senseless after all and you will observe is never done in the discussion of any other question Clearly Sadie must talk in a common sense way with this straightforward man if she talked at all Her resolution was suddenly taken to say for once just what she meant and a very grave and thoughtful pair of eyes were raised to meet the doctor s when next she spoke I think of these things sometimes doctor and though a great deal of it seems to be humbug it is as you say I know some are sincere and I know there is a right way I have been more than half tempted many times during the last few weeks to discover for myself the secret of power but I am deterred by certain considerations which you would doubtless think very absurd but which joined with the inspiration which I receive from the ridiculous inconsistencies of others have been sufficient to deter me hitherto Would you mind telling me some of the considerations And the moment Sadie began to talk honestly the doctor s tones lost their half indifferent coolness and expressed a kind and thoughtful interest No she said hesitatingly I don t know that I need but you will not understand them for instance if I were a Christian I should have to give up one of my favorite amusements almost a passion you know dancing is with me and I am not ready to yield it Why should you feel obliged to do so if you were a Christian Sadie gave him the benefit of a very searching look Don t you think I would be she queried after a moment s silence I haven t said what I thought on that subject but I feel sure that it is not the question for you to decide at present first settle the all important one of your personal acceptation of Christ and then it will be time to decide the other matter for or against as your conscience may dictate Oh but said Sadie positively I know very well what my conscience would dictate and I am not ready for it Isn t dancing an innocent amusement For me yes but not for a Christian Does the Bible lay down one code of laws for you and another for Christians I think so it says Be not conformed to the world Granted but does it anywhere say to those who are of the world You have a right to do just what you like that direction does not apply to you at all it is all intended for those poor Christians doctor Van Anden said Sadie with dignity don t you think there should be a difference between Christians and those who are not Undoubtedly I do Do you think that every person ought or ought not to be a Christian Sadie was silent and a little indignant After a moment she spoke again this time with a touch of hauteur I think you understand what I mean Doctor though you would not admit it for the world I don t suppose I feel very deeply on the subject else I would not advance so trivial an excuse but this is honestly my state of mind Whenever I think about the matter at all this thing comes up for consideration I think it would be very foolish for me to argue against dancing for I don t know much about the arguments and care less I know only this much that there is a very distinctly defined inconsistency between a profession of religion and dancing visible very generally to the eyes of those who make no profession the other class don t seem so able to see it but there exists very generally among us worldlings a disposition to laugh a little over dancing Christians Whether this is a well founded inconsistency or only a foolish prejudice on our part I have never taken the trouble to try to determine and it would make little material difference which it was it is enough for me that such is the case and it makes it very plain to me that if I were an honest professor of that religion which leads one of its teachers to say He will eat no meat while the world stands if it makes his brother to offend I should be obliged to give up my dancing But since I am not one of that class and thus have no such influence I can see no possible harm in my favorite amusement and am not ready to give it up and that is what I mean by its being innocent for me and not innocent for professing Christians doctor Van Anden made no sort of reply if Sadie could judge from his face he seemed to have grown weary of the whole subject he leaned back in his carriage and let the reins fall loosely and carelessly His next proceeding was most astounding coolly possessing himself of one of the small gloved hands that lay idly in Sadie s lap he said in a quiet matter of fact tone Sadie would you allow me to put my arm around you In an instant the indignant blood surged in waves over Sadie s face the hand was angrily withdrawn and the graceful form drawn to an erect hight and it is impossible to describe the freezing tone of astonished indignation in which she ejaculated doctor Van Anden Just what I expected returned that gentleman in a composed manner bestowing a look of entire satisfaction upon his irate companion And yet Sadie I hope you will pardon my obtuseness but I positively can not see why if it is proper and courteous and all that sort of thing I who am a friend of ten years standing should not enjoy the same privilege which you accord to Fred Kenmore to whom you were introduced last week and with whom I heard you say you danced five times Sadie looked confused and annoyed but finally she laughed for she had the good sense to see the folly of doing any thing else under existing circumstances That is the point which puzzles me at present continued the Doctor in a kind grave tone I do not understand how young ladies of refinement can permit under certain circumstances and often from comparative strangers attentions which under other circumstances they repel with becoming indignation Won t you consider the apparent inconsistency a little It is the only suggestion which I wish to offer on the question at present When you have settled that other important matter this thing will present itself to your clear seeing eyes in other and more startling aspects Meantime this is the house at which I must call Will you hold my horses Miss Sadie while I dispatch matters within CHAPTER XXVI CONFUSION CROSS BEARING CONSEQUENCE But the autumn days were not all bright and glowing and glorious One morning it rained not a soft silent and warm rain but a gusty windy turbulent one a rain that drove into windows ever so slightly raised and hurled itself angrily into your face whenever you ventured to open a door It was a day in which fires didn t like to burn but smoldered and sizzled and smoked and people went around shivering their shoulders shrugged up under little dingy unbecoming shawls and the clouds were low and gray and heavy and every thing and every body seemed generally out of sorts Ester was no exception the toothache had kept her awake during the night and one cheek was puffy and stiff in the morning and one tooth still snarled threateningly whenever the slightest whisper of a draught came to it The high toned exalted views of life and duty which had held possession of her during the past few weeks seemed suddenly to have deserted her In short her body had gained that mortifying ascendency over the soul which it will sometimes accomplish and all her hopes and aims and enthusiasms seemed blotted out Things in the kitchen were uncomfortable Maggie had seized on this occasion for having the mumps and acting upon the advice of her sympathizing mistress had pinned a hot flannel around her face and gone to bed The same unselfish counsel had been given to Ester but she had just grace enough left to refuse to desert the camp when dinner must be in readiness for twenty four people in spite of nerves and teeth Just here however the supply failed her and she worked in ominous gloom Julia had been pressed into service and was stoning raisins or eating them a close observer would have found it difficult to discover which She was certainly rasping the nerves of her sister in a variety of those endless ways by which a thoughtless restless questioning child can almost distract a troubled brain Ester endured with what patience she could the ceaseless drafts upon her and worked at the interminable cookies with commendable zeal Alfred came with a bang and a whistle and held open the side door while he talked In rushed the spiteful wind and all the teeth in sympathy with the aching one set up an immediate growl Mother I don t see any Why where is mother questioned Alfred and was answered with an emphatic Shut that door Well but said Alfred I want mother I say Ester will you give me a cookie No answered Ester with energy Did you hear me tell you to shut that door this instant Well now don t bite a fellow And Alfred looked curiously at his sister Meantime the door closed with a heavy bang Mother say mother he continued as his mother emerged from the pantry I don t see any thing of that hammer I ve looked every where Mother can t I have one of Ester s cookies I m awful hungry Why I guess so if you are really suffering Try again for the hammer my boy don t let a poor little hammer get the better of you Well said Alfred I won t meaning that it should answer the latter part of the sentence and seizing a cookie he bestowed a triumphant look upon Ester and a loving one upon his mother and vanished amid a renewal of the whistle and bang This little scene did not serve to help Ester she rolled away vigorously at the dough but felt some way disturbed and outraged and finally gave vent to her feeling in a peremptory order Julia don t eat another raisin you ve made away with about half of them now Julia looked aggrieved Mother lets me eat raisins when I pick them over for her was her defense to which she received no other reply than Keep your elbows off the table Then there was silence and industry for some minutes Presently Julia recovered her composure and commenced with Say Ester what makes you prick little holes all over your biscuits To make them rise better Does every thing rise better after it is pricked Sadie was paring apples at the end table and interposed at this point If you find that to be the case Julia you must be very careful after this or we shall have Ester pricking you when you don t rise in time for breakfast in the morning Julia suspected that she was being made a dupe of and appealed to her older sister Honestly Ester do you prick them so they will rise better Of course I told you so didn t I Well but why does that help them any Can t they get up unless you make holes in them and what is all the reason for it Now these were not easy questions to answer especially to a girl with the toothache and Ester s answer was not much to the point Julia I declare you are enough to distract one If you ask any more questions I shall certainly send you up stairs out of the way Her scientific investigations thus nipped in the bud Julia returned again to silence and raisins until the vigorous beating of some eggs roused anew the spirit of inquiry She leaned eagerly forward with a Say Ester please tell me why the whites all foam and get thick when you stir them just like beautiful white soapsuds And she rested her elbow covered with its blue sleeve plump into the platter containing the beaten yolks You must remember Ester s face ache but even then I regret to say that this disaster culminated in a decided box on the ear for poor Julia and in her being sent weeping up stairs Sadie looked up with a wicked laugh in her bright eyes and said demurely You didn t keep your promise Ester and let me live in peace so I needn t keep mine and I consider you pretty well out of the spasm which has lasted for so many days Sadie I am really ashamed of you This was missus Ried s grave reproving voice and she added kindly Ester poor child I wish you would wrap your face up in something warm and lie down awhile I am afraid you are suffering a great deal Poor Ester It had been a hard day Late in the afternoon as she stood at the table and cut the bread and cake and cheese and cold meat for tea when the sun had made a rift in the clouds and was peeping in for good night when the throbbing nerves had grown quiet once more she looked back upon this weary day in shame and pain How very little her noble resolves and efforts and advances had been worth after all How far back she seemed to have gone in that one day not strength enough to bear even the little crosses that befell in an ordinarily quiet life How she had lost the so lately gained influence over Alfred and Julia by a few cross words How much reason she had given Sadie to think that her attempts at following the Master were after all only spasmodic and visionary But Ester had been to that little clothes press up stairs in search of help and forgiveness and now she clearly saw there was something to do besides mourn over her failures It was hard to do it too Ester s spirit was proud and it was very humbling to confess herself in the wrong She hesitated and shrank from the work until she finally grew ashamed of herself for that and at last without turning her head from her work or giving her resolve time to falter she called to the twins who were occupying seats in one of the dining room windows and talking low and soberly to each other Children come here a moment will you The two had been very shy of Ester since the morning s trials and were at that moment sympathizing with each other in a manner uncomplimentary to her However they slid down from their perch and slowly answered her call Ester glanced up as they entered the storeroom and then went on cutting her cheese but speaking in low gentle tones I want to tell you two how sorry I am that I spoke so crossly and unkindly to you this morning It was very wrong in me I thought I never should displease Jesus so again but I did you see and now I am very sorry indeed and I want you to forgive me Alfred looked aghast This was an Ester that he had never seen before and he didn t know what to say He wriggled the toes of his boots together and looked down at them in puzzled wonder At last he faltered out I didn t know your cheek ached till mother told me or else I d have shut the door right straight I d ought to any how cheek or no cheek This last in a lower tone and more looking down at his boots It was new work for Alfred this voluntarily owning himself in the wrong Julia burst forth eagerly And I was very careless and naughty to keep putting my elbows on the table after you had told me not to and I am ever so sorry that I made you such a lot of trouble Well then said Ester we ll all forgive each other shall we and begin over again And children I want you to understand that I am trying to please Jesus and when I fail it is because of my own wicked heart not because there is any need of it if I tried harder and I want you to know how anxious I am that you should love this same Jesus now while you are young and get him to help you Their mother called the children at this moment and Ester dismissed them each with a kiss There was a little rustle in the flour room and Sadie whom nobody knew was down stairs emerged therefrom with suspiciously red eyes but a laughing face and approached her sister Ester said she I m positively afraid that you are growing into a saint and I know that I m a sinner I consider myself mistaken about the spasm it is evidently a settled disease While the bell tolled for evening service Ester stood in the front doorway and looked doubtfully up and down the damp pavements and muddy streets and felt of her stiff cheek How much she seemed to need the rest and help of God s house to night and yet Julia s little hand stole softly into hers We ve been talking about what you said you wanted us to do Alfred and I have We ve talked about it a good deal lately We most wish so too Ere Ester could reply other than by an eager grasp of the small hand doctor Douglass came out His horses and carriage were in waiting Miss Ried he said pausing irresolutely with his foot on the carriage step and finally turning back I am going to drive down to church this evening as I have a call to make afterward Will you not ride down with me it is unpleasant walking Ester s grave face brightened I m so glad she answered eagerly I did want to go to church to night and I was afraid it would be imprudent on account of my tooth Alfred and Julia sat right before them in church and Ester watched them with a prayerful and yet a sad heart What right had she to expect an answer to her petitions when her life had been working against them all that day And yet the blood of Christ was all powerful and there was always his righteousness to plead and she bent her head in renewed supplications for these two And it shall come to pass that before they call I will answer and while they are yet speaking I will hear Into one of the breathless stillnesses that came while beating hearts were waiting for the requests that they hoped would be made broke Julia s low trembling yet singularly clear voice Please pray for me There was a little choking in Alfred s throat and a good deal of shuffling done with his boots It was so much more of a struggle for the sturdy boy than the gentle little girl but he stood manfully on his feet at last and his words though few were fraught with as much meaning as any which had been spoken there that evening for they were distinct and decided Me too CHAPTER XXVII THE TIME TO SLEEP Life went swiftly and busily on With the close of December the blessed daily meetings closed rather they closed with the first week of the new year which the church kept as a sort of jubilee week in honor of the glorious things that had been done for them The new year opened in joy for Ester many things were different The honest straightforward little Julia carried all her earnestness of purpose into this new life which had possessed her soul and the sturdy brother had naturally too decided a nature to do any thing half way so Ester was sure of this young sister and brother Besides there was a new order of things between her mother and herself each had discovered that the other was bound on the same journey and that there were delightful resting places by the way For herself she was slowly but surely gaining Little crosses that she stooped and resolutely took up grew to be less and less until they some of them merged into positive pleasures There were many things that cast rays of joy all about her path but there was still one heavy abiding sorrow Sadie went giddily and gleefully on her downward way If she perchance seemed to have a serious thought at night it vanished with the next morning s sunshine and day by day Ester realized more fully how many tares the enemy had sown while she was sleeping Sometimes the burden grew almost too heavy to be borne and again she would take heart of grace and bravely renew her efforts and her prayers It was about this time that she began to recognize a new feeling She was not sick exactly and yet not quite well She discovered considerably to her surprise that she was falling into the habit of sitting down on a stair to rest ere she had reached the top of the first flight also that she was sometimes obliged to stay her sweeping and clasp her hands suddenly over a strange beating in her heart But she laughed at her mother s anxious face and pronounced herself quite well quite well only perhaps a little tired Meantime all sorts of plans for usefulness ran riot in her brain She could not go away on a mission because her mission had come to her For a wonder she realized that her mother needed her She took up bravely and eagerly so far as she could see it the work that lay around her but her restless heart craved more more She must do something outside of this narrow circle for the Master One evening her enthusiasm which had been fed for several days on a new scheme that was afloat in the town reached its hight Ester remembered afterward every little incident connected with that evening just how cozy the little family sitting room looked with her for its only occupant just how brightly the coals glowed in the open grate just what a brilliant color they flashed over the crimson cushioned rocker which she had vacated when she heard doctor Van Anden s step in the hall and went to speak to him She was engaged in writing a letter to Abbie full of eager schemes and busy bright work I am astonished that I ever thought there was nothing worth living for so she wrote Why life isn t half long enough for the things that I want to do This new idea just fills me with delight I am so eager to get to work Thus far when she heard that step and springing up went with eagerness to the door Doctor are you in haste Haven t you just five minutes for me Ten answered the Doctor promptly stepping into the bright little room In her haste not even waiting to offer him a seat Ester plunged at once into her subject Aren t you the chairman of that committee to secure teachers for the evening school I am Have you all the help you want Not by any means Volunteers for such a self denying employment as teaching factory girls are not easy to find Well Doctor do you think would you be willing to propose my name as one of the teachers I should so like to be counted among them Instead of the prompt thanks which she expected to her dismay doctor Van Anden s face looked grave and troubled Finally he slowly shook his head with a troubled I don t think I can Ester Such an amazed grieved hurt look as swept over Ester s face It is no matter she said at last speaking with an effort Of course I know little of teaching and perhaps could do no good but I thought if help was scarce you might well never mind And here the Doctor interposed It is not that Ester with the troubled look deepening on his face I assure you we would be glad of your help but and he broke off abruptly and commenced a sudden pacing up and down the room Then stopped before her with these mysterious words I don t know how to tell you Ester Ester s look now was one of annoyance and she spoke quickly Why Doctor you need tell me nothing I am not a child to have the truth sugar coated If my help is not needed that is sufficient Your help is exactly what we need Ester but your health is not sufficient for the work And now Ester laughed Why Doctor what an absurd idea In a week I shall be as well as ever If that is all you may surely count me as one of your teachers The Doctor smiled faintly and then asked Do you never feel any desire to know what may be the cause of this strange lassitude which is creeping over you and the sudden flutterings of heart accompanied by pain and faintness which take you unawares Ester s face paled a little but she asked quietly enough How do you know all this I am a physician Ester Do you think it is kindness to keep a friend in ignorance of what very nearly concerns him simply to spare his feelings for a little Why doctor Van Anden you do not think you do not mean that tell me exactly what you mean But the Doctor s answer was grave anxious absolute silence Perhaps the silence answered her perhaps her own heart told the secret to her for a sudden gray palor overspread her face For an instant the room darkened and whirled around her then she staggered as if she would have fallen then she reached forward and caught hold of the little red rocker and sank into it and leaning both elbows on the writing table before her buried her face in her hands Afterward Ester called to mind the strange whirl of thoughts which thrilled her brain at that time Life in all the various phases that she had thought it would wear for her all the endless plans that she had made all the things that she had meant to do and be came and stared her in the face Nowhere in all her plannings crossed by that strange creature Death someway she had never planned for that Could it be possible that he was to come for her so soon before any of these things were done Was it possible that she must leave Sadie bright brilliant unsafe Sadie and go away where she could work for her no more Then like a picture spread before her there came back that day in the cars on her way to New York the Christian stranger who was not a stranger now but her friend and was it heaven the earnest little old woman with her thoughtful face and that strange sentence on her lips Maybe my coffin will do it better than I can Well maybe her coffin could do it for Sadie Oh the blessed thought Plans YES but perhaps God had plans too What mattered hers compared to HIS If he would that she should do her earthly work by lying down very soon in the unbroken calm of the rest that remaineth what was that to her Presently she spoke without raising her head Are you very certain of this thing Doctor and is it to come to me soon That last we can not tell dear friend You may be with us years yet and it may be swift and sudden I think it is worse than mistaken kindness it is foolish wickedness to treat a Christian woman like a little child I wanted to tell you before the shock would be dangerous to you I understand When she spoke again it was in a more hesitating tone Does doctor Douglass agree with you And the quick pained way in which the Doctor answered showed her that he understood doctor Douglass will not let himself believe it Then a long silence fell between them The Doctor kept his position leaning against the mantel but never for a moment allowed his eyes to turn away from that motionless figure before him Only the loving pitying Savior knew what was passing in that young heart At last she arose and came toward the Doctor with a strange sweetness playing about her mouth and a strange calm in her voice doctor Van Anden I am so much obliged to you Don t be afraid to leave me now I think I need to be quite alone And the Doctor feeling that all words were vain and useless silently bowed and softly let himself out of the room The first thing upon which Ester s eye alighted when she turned again to the table was the letter in which she had been writing those last words Why life isn t half long enough for the things that I want to do Very quietly she picked up the letter and committed it to the glowing coals upon the grate Her mood had changed By degrees very quietly and very gradually as such bitter things do creep in upon a family it grew to be an acknowledged fact that Ester was an invalid Little by little her circle of duties narrowed one by one her various plans were silently given up the dear mother first and then Sadie and finally the children grew into the habit of watching her footsteps and saving her from the stairs from the lifting from every possible burden Once in a long while and then as the weeks passed more frequently there would come a day in which she did not get down further than the little sitting room but was established amid pillows on the couch enjoying poor health as she playfully phrased it So softly and silently and surely the shadow crept and crept until when June brought roses and Abbie Ester received her in her own room propped up among the pillows in her bed Gradually they grew accustomed to that also as God in his infinite mercy has planned that human hearts shall grow used to the inevitable They even told each other hopefully that the warm weather was what depressed her so much and as the summer heat cooled into autumn she would grow stronger And she had bright days in which she really seemed to grow strong and which deceived every body save doctor Van Anden and herself During one of those bright days Sadie came from school full of a new idea and curled herself in front of Ester s couch to entertain her with it mister Hammond s last she said Such a curious idea as like him as possible and like nobody else You know that our class will graduate in just two years from this time and there are fourteen of us an even number which is lucky for mister Hammond Well we are each don t you think to write a letter as sensible honest and piquant as we can make it historic sentimental poetic or otherwise as we please so that it be the honest exponent of our views Then we are to make a grand exchange of letters among the class and the young lady who receives my letter for instance is to keep it sealed and under lock and key until graduation day when it is to be read before scholars faculty and trustees and my full name announced as the signature and all the rest of us are to perform in like manner What is supposed to be the object queried Abbie Precisely the point which oppressed us until mister Hammond complimented us by announcing that it was for the purpose of discovering how many of us after making use of our highest skill in that line could write a letter that after two years we should be willing to acknowledge as ours Ester sat up flushed and eager That is a very nice idea she said brightly I m so glad you told me of it Sadie I ll write you a letter for that day I ll write it to morrow and you are to keep it sealed until the evening of that day on which you graduate Then when you have come up to your room and are quite alone you are to read it Will you promise Sadie But Sadie only laughed merrily and said You are growing sentimental Ester as sure is the world How can I make any such promise as that I shall probably chatter to you like a magpie instead of reading any thing This young girl utterly ignored so far as was possible the fact of Ester s illness never allowing it to be admitted in her presence that there were any fears as to the result Ester had ceased trying to convince her so now she only smiled quietly and repeated her petition Will you promise Sadie Oh yes I ll promise to go to the mountains of the moon on foot and alone across lots any thing to amuse you You re to be pitied you see until you get over this absurd habit of cuddling down among the pillows So a few days thereafter she received with much apparent glee the dainty sealed letter addressed to herself and dropped it in her writing desk but ere she turned the key there dropped a tear or two on the shining lid Well as the long hot summer days grew longer and fiercer the invalid drooped and drooped and the home faces grew sadder Yet there still came from time to time those rallying days wherein Sadie confidently pronounced her to be improving rapidly And so it came to pass that so sweet was the final message that the words of the wonderful old poem proved a Siting description of it all They thought her dying when she slept And sleeping when she died Into the brightness of the September days there intruded one wherein all the house was still with that strange solemn stillness that comes only to those homes where death has left a seal From the doors floated the long crape signals and in the great parlors were gathering those who had come to take their parting look at the white quiet face ESTER RIED aged nineteen so the coffin plate told them Thus early had the story of her life been finished Only one arrangement had Ester made for this last scene in her life drama I am going to preach my own funeral sermon she had said pleasantly to Abbie one day I want every one to know what seemed to me the most important thing in life And I want them to understand that when I came just to the end of my life it stood out the most important thing still for Christians I mean My sermon is to be preached for them No it isn t either it applies equally to all The last time I went to the city I found in a bookstore just the kind of sermon I want preached I bought it You will find the package in my upper bureau drawer Abbie I leave it to you to see that they are so arranged that every one who comes to look at me will be sure to see them So on this day amid the wilderness of flowers and vines and mosses that had possession of the rooms ranged along the mantel hanging in clusters on the walls were beautifully illuminated texts and these were some of the words that they spoke to those who silently gathered in the parlors And that knowing the time that now it is high time to awake out of sleep But wilt thou know O vain man that faith without works is dead What shall we do that we might work the works of God Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do do it with thy might for there is no work nor device nor knowledge nor wisdom in the grave whither thou goest I must work the work of him that sent me while it is day the night cometh when no man can work Awake to righteousness and sin not Awake thou that sleepest and arise from the dead and Christ shall give thee light Redeeming the time because the days are evil Let us not sleep as do others but let us watch and be sober Chiming in with the thoughts of those who knew by whose direction the illuminated texts were hung came the voice of the minister reading And I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me Write Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord from henceforth Yea saith the Spirit that they may rest from their labors and their works do follow them So it was that Ester Ried lying quiet in her coffin was reckoned among that number who being dead yet speaketh CHAPTER XXVIII AT LAST The busy exciting triumphant day was done Sadie Ried was no longer a school girl she had graduated And although a dress of the softest purest white had been substituted for the blue silk in which she had so long ago planned to appear its simple folds had swept the platform of Music Hall in as triumphant a way as ever she had planned for the other More so for Sadie s wildest flights of fancy had never made her valedictorian of her class yet that she certainly was In some respects it had been a merry day the long sealed letters had been opened and read by their respective holders that morning and the young ladies had discovered amid much laughter and many blushes that they were ready to pronounce many of the expressions which they had carefully made only two years before ridiculously out of place or absurdly sentimental Progress said mister Hammond turning for a moment to Sadie after he had watched with an amused smile the varying play of expression on her speaking face while she listened to the reading of her letter You were not aware that you had improved so much in two years now were you I was not aware that I ever was such a simpleton was her half provoked half amused reply To night she loitered strangely in the parlors in the halls on the stairs talking aimlessly with any one who would stop it was growing late missus Ried and the children had long ago departed doctor Van Anden had not yet returned from his evening round of calls Every body in and about the house was quiet ere Sadie with slow reluctant steps finally ascended the stairs and sought her room Arrived there she seemed in no haste to light the gas moonlight was streaming into the room and she put herself down in front of one of the low windows to enjoy it But it gave her a view of the not far distant cemetery and gleamed on a marble slab the lettering of which she knew perfectly well was Ester daughter of Alfred and Laura Ried died Sept four eighteen aged nineteen Asleep in Jesus Awake to everlasting life And that reminded her as she had no need to be reminded of a letter with the seal unbroken lying in her writing desk a letter which she had promised to read this evening promised the one who wrote it for her and over whose grave the moonlight was now wrapping its silver robe Sadie felt strangely averse to reading that letter in part she could imagine its contents and for the very reason that she was still halting between two opinions almost persuaded and still on that often fatal almost side instead of the altogether did she wait and linger and fritter away the evening as best she could rather than face that solemn letter Even when she turned resolutely from the window and lighted the gas and drew down the shade she waited to put every thing tidy on her writing table and then when she had finally turned the key in her writing desk to read over half a dozen old letters and bits of essays and scraps of poetry ere she reached down for that little white envelope with her name traced by the dear familiar hand that wrote her name no more At last the seal was broken and Sadie read My Darling Sister I am sitting to day in our little room yours and mine I have been taking in the picture of it every thing about it is dear to me from our father s face smiling down on me from the wall to the little red rocker in which he sat and wrote in which I sit now and in which you will doubtless sit when I have gone to him I want to speak to you about that time When you read this I shall have been gone a long long time and the bitterness of the parting will all be past you will be able to read calmly what I am writing I will tell you a little of the struggle For the first few moments after I knew that I was soon to die my brain fairly reeled It seemed to me that I could not I had so much to live for there was so much that I wanted to do and most of all other things I wanted to see you a Christian I wanted to live for that to work for it to undo if I could some of the evil that I knew my miserable life had wrought in your heart Then suddenly there came to me the thought that perhaps what my life could not do my coffin would accomplish perhaps that was to be God s way of calling you to himself perhaps he meant to answer my pleading in that way to let my grave speak for me as my crooked marred sinful living might never be able to do My darling then I was content it came to me so suddenly as that almost the certainty that God meant to use me thus and I love you so and I long so to see you come to him that I am more than willing to give up all that this life seemed to have for me and go away if by that you would be called to Christ And Sadie dear you will know before you read this how much I had to give up You will know very soon all that doctor Douglass and I looked forward to being to each other but I give it up give him up more than willingly joyfully glad that my Father will accept the sacrifice and make you his child Oh my darling what a life I have lived before you I do not wonder that looking at me you have grown into the habit of thinking that there is nothing in religion you have looked at me not at Jesus and there has been no reflection of his beauty in me as there should have been and the result is not strange Knowing this I am the more thankful that God will forgive me and use me as a means to bring you home at last I speak confidently I am sure you see that it will be the burden the fearful burden that I have carried about with me so long has gone away My Redeemer and yours has taken it from me I shall see you in heaven Father is there and I am going oh so fast and mother will not be long behind and Alfred and Julia have started on the journey and you will start Oh I know it we shall all be there I told my Savior I was willing to do any thing any thing so my awful mockery of a Christian life that I wore so long might not be the means of your eternal death And he has heard my prayer I do not know when it will be perhaps you will still be undecided when you sit in our room and read these words Oh I hope I hope you will not waste two years more of your life but if you do if as you read these last lines that I shall ever write the question is unsettled I charge you by the memory of your sister by the love you bear her not to wait another moment not one Oh my darling let me beg this at your hands take it as my dying petition renewed after two years of waiting Come to Jesus now That question settled then let me give you one word of warning Do not live as I have done my life has been a failure five years of stupid sleep while the enemy waked and worked Oh God forgive me Sadie never let that be your record Let me give you a motto Press toward the mark The mark is high don t look away from or forget it as I did don t be content with simply sauntering along looking toward it now and then but take in the full meaning of that earnest sentence and live it Press toward the mark And now good by When you have finished reading this letter do this last thing for me If you are already a Christian get down on your knees and renew your covenant resolve anew to live and work and suffer and die for Christ If you are not a Christian Oh I put my whole soul into this last request I beg you kneel and give yourself up to Jesus My darling good by until we meet in heaven ESTER RIED The letter dropped from Sadie s nerveless fingers She arose softly and turned down the gas and raised the shade the moonlight still gleamed on the marble slab doctor Van Anden came with quick firm tread up the street She gave a little start as she recognized the step and her thoughts went out after that other lonely Doctor who was to have been her brother and then back to the long earnest letter and the words I give him up and she realized as only those can who know by experience what a giving up that would be how much her sister longed for her soul And then moved by a strong firm resolve Sadie knelt in the solemn moonlight and the long long struggle was ended Father and sister were in heaven but on earth this night their prayers were being answered Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord from henceforth Yea saith the Spirit that they may rest from their labors and their works do follow them THE END End of Project Gutenberg s Ester Ried by Pansy aka Isabella M Alden END
