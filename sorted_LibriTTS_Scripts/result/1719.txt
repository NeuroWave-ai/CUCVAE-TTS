THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE BALLAD OF THE WHITE HORSE Produced by Paul Bonner and Martin Ward THE BALLAD OF THE WHITE HORSE By G K Chesterton Prefatory Note This ballad needs no historical notes for the simple reason that it does not profess to be historical All of it that is not frankly fictitious as in any prose romance about the past is meant to emphasize tradition rather than history King Alfred is not a legend in the sense that King Arthur may be a legend that is in the sense that he may possibly be a lie But King Alfred is a legend in this broader and more human sense that the legends are the most important things about him The cult of Alfred was a popular cult from the darkness of the ninth century to the deepening twilight of the twentieth It is wholly as a popular legend that I deal with him here I write as one ignorant of everything except that I have found the legend of a King of Wessex still alive in the land I will give three curt cases of what I mean A tradition connects the ultimate victory of Alfred with the valley in Berkshire called the Vale of the White Horse I have seen doubts of the tradition which may be valid doubts I do not know when or where the story started it is enough that it started somewhere and ended with me for I only seek to write upon a hearsay as the old balladists did For the second case there is a popular tale that Alfred played the harp and sang in the Danish camp I select it because it is a popular tale at whatever time it arose For the third case there is a popular tale that Alfred came in contact with a woman and cakes I select it because it is a popular tale because it is a vulgar one It has been disputed by grave historians who were I think a little too grave to be good judges of it The two chief charges against the story are that it was first recorded long after Alfred s death and that as mister Oman urges Alfred never really wandered all alone without any thanes or soldiers Both these objections might possibly be met It has taken us nearly as long to learn the whole truth about Byron and perhaps longer to learn the whole truth about Pepys than elapsed between Alfred and the first writing of such tales And as for the other objection do the historians really think that Alfred after Wilton or Napoleon after Leipsic never walked about in a wood by himself for the matter of an hour or two Ten minutes might be made sufficient for the essence of the story But I am not concerned to prove the truth of these popular traditions It is enough for me to maintain two things that they are popular traditions and that without these popular traditions we should have bothered about Alfred about as much as we bother about Eadwig One other consideration needs a note Alfred has come down to us in the best way that is by national legends solely for the same reason as Arthur and Roland and the other giants of that darkness because he fought for the Christian civilization against the heathen nihilism But since this work was really done by generation after generation by the Romans before they withdrew and by the Britons while they remained I have summarised this first crusade in a triple symbol and given to a fictitious Roman Celt and Saxon a part in the glory of Ethandune I fancy that in fact Alfred s Wessex was of very mixed bloods but in any case it is the chief value of legend to mix up the centuries while preserving the sentiment to see all ages in a sort of splendid foreshortening That is the use of tradition it telescopes history G K C DEDICATION Of great limbs gone to chaos A great face turned to night Why bend above a shapeless shroud Seeking in such archaic cloud Sight of strong lords and light Where seven sunken Englands Lie buried one by one Why should one idle spade I wonder Shake up the dust of thanes like thunder To smoke and choke the sun In cloud of clay so cast to heaven What shape shall man discern These lords may light the mystery Of mastery or victory And these ride high in history But these shall not return Gored on the Norman gonfalon The Golden Dragon died We shall not wake with ballad strings The good time of the smaller things We shall not see the holy kings Ride down by Severn side Stiff strange and quaintly coloured As the broidery of Bayeux The England of that dawn remains And this of Alfred and the Danes Seems like the tales a whole tribe feigns Too English to be true Of a good king on an island That ruled once on a time And as he walked by an apple tree There came green devils out of the sea With sea plants trailing heavily And tracks of opal slime Yet Alfred is no fairy tale His days as our days ran He also looked forth for an hour On peopled plains and skies that lower From those few windows in the tower That is the head of a man But who shall look from Alfred s hood Or breathe his breath alive His century like a small dark cloud Drifts far it is an eyeless crowd Where the tortured trumpets scream aloud And the dense arrows drive Lady by one light only We look from Alfred s eyes We know he saw athwart the wreck The sign that hangs about your neck Where One more than Melchizedek Is dead and never dies Therefore I bring these rhymes to you Who brought the cross to me Since on you flaming without flaw I saw the sign that Guthrum saw When he let break his ships of awe And laid peace on the sea Do you remember when we went Under a dragon moon And mid volcanic tints of night Walked where they fought the unknown fight And saw black trees on the battle height Black thorn on Ethandune And I thought I will go with you As man with God has gone And wander with a wandering star The wandering heart of things that are The fiery cross of love and war That like yourself goes on O go you onward where you are Shall honour and laughter be Past purpled forest and pearled foam God s winged pavilion free to roam Your face that is a wandering home A flying home for me Ride through the silent earthquake lands Wide as a waste is wide Across these days like deserts when Pride and a little scratching pen Have dried and split the hearts of men Heart of the heroes ride Up through an empty house of stars Being what heart you are Up the inhuman steeps of space As on a staircase go in grace Carrying the firelight on your face Beyond the loneliest star Take these in memory of the hour We strayed a space from home And saw the smoke hued hamlets quaint With Westland king and Westland saint And watched the western glory faint Along the road to Frome BOOK I THE VISION OF THE KING 
1482_140067_000002_000000	train-clean-360	Before the gods that made the gods Had seen their sunrise pass The White Horse of the White Horse Vale Was cut out of the grass 
1482_140067_000003_000000	train-clean-360	Before the gods that made the gods Had drunk at dawn their fill The White Horse of the White Horse Vale Was hoary on the hill 
none	none	Age beyond age on British land Aeons on aeons gone Was peace and war in western hills And the White Horse looked on 
1482_140067_000005_000000	train-clean-360	For the White Horse knew England When there was none to know He saw the first oar break or bend He saw heaven fall and the world end O God how long ago 
1482_140067_000006_000000	train-clean-360	For the end of the world was long ago And all we dwell to day As children of some second birth Like a strange people left on earth After a judgment day 
none	none	For the end of the world was long ago When the ends of the world waxed free When Rome was sunk in a waste of slaves And the sun drowned in the sea 
1482_140067_000008_000000	train-clean-360	When Caesar s sun fell out of the sky And whoso hearkened right Could only hear the plunging Of the nations in the night 
1482_140067_000009_000000	train-clean-360	When the ends of the earth came marching in To torch and cresset gleam And the roads of the world that lead to Rome Were filled with faces that moved like foam Like faces in a dream 
1482_140067_000010_000000	train-clean-360	And men rode out of the eastern lands Broad river and burning plain Trees that are Titan flowers to see And tiger skies striped horribly With tints of tropic rain 
1482_140067_000011_000000	train-clean-360	Where Ind s enamelled peaks arise Around that inmost one Where ancient eagles on its brink Vast as archangels gather and drink The sacrament of the sun 
1482_140067_000012_000000	train-clean-360	And men brake out of the northern lands Enormous lands alone Where a spell is laid upon life and lust And the rain is changed to a silver dust And the sea to a great green stone 
1482_140067_000013_000000	train-clean-360	And a Shape that moveth murkily In mirrors of ice and night Hath blanched with fear all beasts and birds As death and a shock of evil words Blast a man s hair with white 
1482_140067_000014_000000	train-clean-360	And the cry of the palms and the purple moons Or the cry of the frost and foam Swept ever around an inmost place And the din of distant race on race Cried and replied round Rome 
1482_140067_000015_000000	train-clean-360	And there was death on the Emperor And night upon the Pope And Alfred hiding in deep grass Hardened his heart with hope 
1482_140067_000016_000000	train-clean-360	A sea folk blinder than the sea Broke all about his land But Alfred up against them bare And gripped the ground and grasped the air Staggered and strove to stand 
1482_140067_000017_000000	train-clean-360	He bent them back with spear and spade With desperate dyke and wall With foemen leaning on his shield And roaring on him when he reeled And no help came at all 
1482_140067_000018_000000	train-clean-360	He broke them with a broken sword A little towards the sea And for one hour of panting peace Ringed with a roar that would not cease With golden crown and girded fleece Made laws under a tree 
1482_140067_000019_000000	train-clean-360	The Northmen came about our land A Christless chivalry Who knew not of the arch or pen Great beautiful half witted men From the sunrise and the sea 
none	none	Misshapen ships stood on the deep Full of strange gold and fire And hairy men as huge as sin With horned heads came wading in Through the long low sea mire 
1482_140067_000021_000000	train-clean-360	Our towns were shaken of tall kings With scarlet beards like blood The world turned empty where they trod They took the kindly cross of God And cut it up for wood 
1482_140067_000022_000000	train-clean-360	Their souls were drifting as the sea And all good towns and lands They only saw with heavy eyes And broke with heavy hands 
1482_140067_000023_000000	train-clean-360	Their gods were sadder than the sea Gods of a wandering will Who cried for blood like beasts at night Sadly from hill to hill 
1482_140067_000024_000000	train-clean-360	They seemed as trees walking the earth As witless and as tall Yet they took hold upon the heavens And no help came at all 
1482_140067_000025_000000	train-clean-360	They bred like birds in English woods They rooted like the rose When Alfred came to Athelney To hide him from their bows
1482_140067_000026_000000	train-clean-360	There was not English armour left Nor any English thing When Alfred came to Athelney To be an English king 
none	none	For earthquake swallowing earthquake Uprent the Wessex tree The whirlpool of the pagan sway Had swirled his sires as sticks away When a flood smites the sea 
1482_140067_000028_000000	train-clean-360	And the great kings of Wessex Wearied and sank in gore And even their ghosts in that great stress Grew greyer and greyer less and less With the lords that died in Lyonesse And the king that comes no more 
1482_140067_000029_000000	train-clean-360	And the God of the Golden Dragon Was dumb upon his throne And the lord of the Golden Dragon Ran in the woods alone 
1482_140067_000030_000000	train-clean-360	And if ever he climbed the crest of luck And set the flag before Returning as a wheel returns Came ruin and the rain that burns And all began once more 
1482_140067_000031_000000	train-clean-360	And naught was left King Alfred But shameful tears of rage In the island in the river In the end of all his age 
none	none	In the island in the river He was broken to his knee And he read writ with an iron pen That God had wearied of Wessex men And given their country field and fen To the devils of the sea And he saw in a little picture Tiny and far away His mother sitting in Egbert s hall And a book she showed him very small Where a sapphire Mary sat in stall With a golden Christ at play 
1482_140067_000034_000000	train-clean-360	It was wrought in the monk s slow manner From silver and sanguine shell Where the scenes are little and terrible Keyholes of heaven and hell 
1482_140067_000035_000000	train-clean-360	In the river island of Athelney With the river running past In colours of such simple creed All things sprang at him sun and weed Till the grass grew to be grass indeed And the tree was a tree at last 
none	none	Fearfully plain the flowers grew Like the child s book to read Or like a friend s face seen in a glass He looked and there Our Lady was She stood and stroked the tall live grass As a man strokes his steed 
1482_140067_000037_000000	train-clean-360	Her face was like an open word When brave men speak and choose The very colours of her coat Were better than good news 
1482_140067_000038_000000	train-clean-360	She spoke not nor turned not Nor any sign she cast Only she stood up straight and free Between the flowers in Athelney And the river running past 
1482_140067_000039_000000	train-clean-360	One dim ancestral jewel hung On his ruined armour grey He rent and cast it at her feet Where after centuries with slow feet Men came from hall and school and street And found it where it lay 
1482_140067_000040_000000	train-clean-360	 Mother of God the wanderer said I am but a common king Nor will I ask what saints may ask To see a secret thing 
none	none	The gates of heaven are fearful gates Worse than the gates of hell Not I would break the splendours barred Or seek to know the thing they guard Which is too good to tell But for this earth most pitiful This little land I know If that which is for ever is Or if our hearts shall break with bliss Seeing the stranger go
1482_140067_000043_000000	train-clean-360	 When our last bow is broken Queen And our last javelin cast Under some sad green evening sky Holding a ruined cross on high Under warm westland grass to lie Shall we come home at last 
1482_140067_000044_000000	train-clean-360	And a voice came human but high up Like a cottage climbed among The clouds or a serf of hut and croft That sits by his hovel fire as oft But hears on his old bare roof aloft A belfry burst in song 
1482_140067_000045_000000	train-clean-360	 The gates of heaven are lightly locked We do not guard our gain The heaviest hind may easily Come silently and suddenly Upon me in a lane 
1482_140067_000046_000000	train-clean-360	 And any little maid that walks In good thoughts apart May break the guard of the Three Kings And see the dear and dreadful things I hid within my heart 
1482_140067_000047_000000	train-clean-360	 The meanest man in grey fields gone Behind the set of sun Heareth between star and other star Through the door of the darkness fallen ajar The council eldest of things that are The talk of the Three in One 
1482_140067_000048_000000	train-clean-360	 The gates of heaven are lightly locked We do not guard our gold Men may uproot where worlds begin Or read the name of the nameless sin But if he fail or if he win To no good man is told 
1482_140067_000049_000000	train-clean-360	 The men of the East may spell the stars And times and triumphs mark But the men signed of the cross of Christ Go gaily in the dark 
1482_140067_000050_000000	train-clean-360	 The men of the East may search the scrolls For sure fates and fame But the men that drink the blood of God Go singing to their shame 
1482_140067_000051_000000	train-clean-360	 The wise men know what wicked things Are written on the sky They trim sad lamps they touch sad strings Hearing the heavy purple wings Where the forgotten seraph kings Still plot how God shall die 
none	none	The wise men know all evil things Under the twisted trees Where the perverse in pleasure pine And men are weary of green wine And sick of crimson seas But you and all the kind of Christ Are ignorant and brave And you have wars you hardly win And souls you hardly save I tell you naught for your comfort Yea naught for your desire Save that the sky grows darker yet And the sea rises higher
1482_140067_000055_000000	train-clean-360	 Night shall be thrice night over you And heaven an iron cope Do you have joy without a cause Yea faith without a hope 
none	none	Even as she spoke she was not Nor any word said he He only heard still as he stood Under the old night s nodding hood The sea folk breaking down the wood Like a high tide from sea 
1482_140067_000057_000000	train-clean-360	He only heard the heathen men Whose eyes are blue and bleak Singing about some cruel thing Done by a great and smiling king In daylight on a deck 
none	none	He only heard the heathen men Whose eyes are blue and blind Singing what shameful things are done Between the sunlit sea and the sun When the land is left behind BOOK II THE GATHERING OF THE CHIEFS Up across windy wastes and up Went Alfred over the shaws Shaken of the joy of giants The joy without a cause In the slopes away to the western bays Where blows not ever a tree He washed his soul in the west wind And his body in the sea And he set to rhyme his ale measures And he sang aloud his laws Because of the joy of the giants The joy without a cause The King went gathering Wessex men As grain out of the chaff The few that were alive to die Laughing as littered skulls that lie After lost battles turn to the sky An everlasting laugh The King went gathering Christian men As wheat out of the husk Eldred the Franklin by the sea And Mark the man from Italy And Colan of the Sacred Tree From the old tribe on Usk The rook croaked homeward heavily The west was clear and warm The smoke of evening food and ease Rose like a blue tree in the trees When he came to Eldred s farm But Eldred s farm was fallen awry Like an old cripple s bones And Eldred s tools were red with rust And on his well was a green crust And purple thistles upward thrust Between the kitchen stones But smoke of some good feasting Went upwards evermore And Eldred s doors stood wide apart For loitering foot or labouring cart And Eldred s great and foolish heart Stood open like his door A mighty man was Eldred A bulk for casks to fill His face a dreaming furnace His body a walking hill In the old wars of Wessex His sword had sunken deep But all his friends he signed and said Were broken about Ethelred And between the deep drink and the dead He had fallen upon sleep Come not to me King Alfred Save always for the ale Why should my harmless hinds be slain Because the chiefs cry once again As in all fights that we shall gain And in all fights we fail Your scalds still thunder and prophesy That crown that never comes Friend I will watch the certain things Swine and slow moons like silver rings And the ripening of the plums And Alfred answered drinking And gravely without blame Nor bear I boast of scald or king The thing I bear is a lesser thing But comes in a better name Out of the mouth of the Mother of God More than the doors of doom I call the muster of Wessex men From grassy hamlet or ditch or den To break and be broken God knows when But I have seen for whom Out of the mouth of the Mother of God Like a little word come I For I go gathering Christian men From sunken paving and ford and fen To die in a battle God knows when By God but I know why And this is the word of Mary The word of the world s desire No more of comfort shall ye get Save that the sky grows darker yet And the sea rises higher Then silence sank And slowly Arose the sea land lord Like some vast beast for mystery He filled the room and porch and sky And from a cobwebbed nail on high Unhooked his heavy sword Up on the shrill sea downs and up Went Alfred all alone Turning but once e er the door was shut Shouting to Eldred over his butt That he bring all spears to the woodman s hut Hewn under Egbert s Stone And he turned his back and broke the fern And fought the moths of dusk And went on his way for other friends Friends fallen of all the wide world s ends From Rome that wrath and pardon sends And the grey tribes on Usk He saw gigantic tracks of death And many a shape of doom Good steadings to grey ashes gone And a monk s house white like a skeleton In the green crypt of the combe And in many a Roman villa Earth and her ivies eat Saw coloured pavements sink and fade In flowers and the windy colonnade Like the spectre of a street But the cold stars clustered Among the cold pines Ere he was half on his pilgrimage Over the western lines And the white dawn widened Ere he came to the last pine Where Mark the man from Italy Still made the Christian sign The long farm lay on the large hill side Flat like a painted plan And by the side the low white house Where dwelt the southland man A bronzed man with a bird s bright eye And a strong bird s beak and brow His skin was brown like buried gold And of certain of his sires was told That they came in the shining ship of old With Caesar in the prow His fruit trees stood like soldiers Drilled in a straight line His strange stiff olives did not fail And all the kings of the earth drank ale But he drank wine Wide over wasted British plains Stood never an arch or dome Only the trees to toss and reel The tribes to bicker the beasts to squeal But the eyes in his head were strong like steel And his soul remembered Rome Then Alfred of the lonely spear Lifted his lion head And fronted with the Italian s eye Asking him of his whence and why King Alfred stood and said I am that oft defeated King Whose failure fills the land Who fled before the Danes of old Who chaffered with the Danes with gold Who now upon the Wessex wold Hardly has feet to stand But out of the mouth of the Mother of God I have seen the truth like fire This that the sky grows darker yet And the sea rises higher Long looked the Roman on the land The trees as golden crowns Blazed drenched with dawn and dew empearled While faintlier coloured freshlier curled The clouds from underneath the world Stood up over the downs These vines be ropes that drag me hard He said I go not far Where would you meet For you must hold Half Wiltshire and the White Horse wold And the Thames bank to Owsenfold If Wessex goes to war Guthrum sits strong on either bank And you must press his lines Inwards and eastward drive him down I doubt if you shall take the crown Till you have taken London town For me I have the vines If each man on the Judgment Day Meet God on a plain alone Said Alfred I will speak for you As for myself and call it true That you brought all fighting folk you knew Lined under Egbert s Stone Though I be in the dust ere then I know where you will be And shouldering suddenly his spear He faded like some elfin fear Where the tall pines ran up tier on tier Tree overtoppling tree He shouldered his spear at morning And laughed to lay it on But he leaned on his spear as on a staff With might and little mood to laugh Or ever he sighted chick or calf Of Colan of Caerleon For the man dwelt in a lost land Of boulders and broken men In a great grey cave far off to the south Where a thick green forest stopped the mouth Giving darkness in his den And the man was come like a shadow From the shadow of Druid trees Where Usk with mighty murmurings Past Caerleon of the fallen kings Goes out to ghostly seas Last of a race in ruin He spoke the speech of the Gaels His kin were in holy Ireland Or up in the crags of Wales But his soul stood with his mother s folk That were of the rain wrapped isle Where Patrick and Brandan westerly Looked out at last on a landless sea And the sun s last smile His harp was carved and cunning As the Celtic craftsman makes Graven all over with twisting shapes Like many headless snakes His harp was carved and cunning His sword prompt and sharp And he was gay when he held the sword Sad when he held the harp For the great Gaels of Ireland Are the men that God made mad For all their wars are merry And all their songs are sad He kept the Roman order He made the Christian sign But his eyes grew often blind and bright And the sea that rose in the rocks at night Rose to his head like wine He made the sign of the cross of God He knew the Roman prayer But he had unreason in his heart Because of the gods that were Even they that walked on the high cliffs High as the clouds were then Gods of unbearable beauty That broke the hearts of men And whether in seat or saddle Whether with frown or smile Whether at feast or fight was he He heard the noise of a nameless sea On an undiscovered isle Lifting the great green ivy And the great spear lowering One said I am Alfred of Wessex And I am a conquered king And the man of the cave made answer And his eyes were stars of scorn And better kings were conquered Or ever your sires were born What goddess was your mother What fay your breed begot That you should not die with Uther And Arthur and Lancelot But when you win you brag and blow And when you lose you rail Army of eastland yokels Not strong enough to fail I bring not boast or railing Spake Alfred not in ire I bring of Our Lady a lesson set This that the sky grows darker yet And the sea rises higher Then Colan of the Sacred Tree Tossed his black mane on high And cried as rigidly he rose And if the sea and sky be foes We will tame the sea and sky Smiled Alfred Seek ye a fable More dizzy and more dread Than all your mad barbarian tales Where the sky stands on its head A tale where a man looks down on the sky That has long looked down on him A tale where a man can swallow a sea That might swallow the seraphim Bring to the hut by Egbert s Stone All bills and bows ye have And Alfred strode off rapidly And Colan of the Sacred Tree Went slowly to his cave BOOK III THE HARP OF ALFRED In a tree that yawned and twisted The King s few goods were flung A mass book mildewed line by line And weapons and a skin of wine And an old harp unstrung By the yawning tree in the twilight The King unbound his sword Severed the harp of all his goods And there in the cool and soundless woods Sounded a single chord Then laughed and watched the finches flash The sullen flies in swarm And went unarmed over the hills With the harp upon his arm Until he came to the White Horse Vale And saw across the plains In the twilight high and far and fell Like the fiery terraces of hell The camp fires of the Danes The fires of the Great Army That was made of iron men Whose lights of sacrilege and scorn Ran around England red as morn Fires over Glastonbury Thorn Fires out on Ely Fen And as he went by White Horse Vale He saw lie wan and wide The old horse graven God knows when By gods or beasts or what things then Walked a new world instead of men And scrawled on the hill side And when he came to White Horse Down The great White Horse was grey For it was ill scoured of the weed And lichen and thorn could crawl and feed Since the foes of settled house and creed Had swept old works away King Alfred gazed all sorrowful At thistle and mosses grey Till a rally of Danes with shield and bill Rolled drunk over the dome of the hill And hearing of his harp and skill They dragged him to their play And as they went through the high green grass They roared like the great green sea But when they came to the red camp fire They were silent suddenly And as they went up the wastes away They went reeling to and fro But when they came to the red camp fire They stood all in a row For golden in the firelight With a smile carved on his lips And a beard curled right cunningly Was Guthrum of the Northern Sea The emperor of the ships With three great earls King Guthrum Went the rounds from fire to fire With Harold nephew of the King And Ogier of the Stone and Sling And Elf whose gold lute had a string That sighed like all desire The Earls of the Great Army That no men born could tire Whose flames anear him or aloof Took hold of towers or walls of proof Fire over Glastonbury roof And out on Ely fire And Guthrum heard the soldiers tale And bade the stranger play Not harshly but as one on high On a marble pillar in the sky Who sees all folk that live and die Pigmy and far away And Alfred King of Wessex Looked on his conqueror And his hands hardened but he played And leaving all later hates unsaid He sang of some old British raid On the wild west march of yore He sang of war in the warm wet shires Where rain nor fruitage fails Where England of the motley states Deepens like a garden to the gates In the purple walls of Wales He sang of the seas of savage heads And the seas and seas of spears Boiling all over Offa s Dyke What time a Wessex club could strike The kings of the mountaineers Till Harold laughed and snatched the harp The kinsman of the King A big youth beardless like a child Whom the new wine of war sent wild Smote and began to sing And he cried of the ships as eagles That circle fiercely and fly And sweep the seas and strike the towns From Cyprus round to Skye How swiftly and with peril They gather all good things The high horns of the forest beasts Or the secret stones of kings For Rome was given to rule the world And gat of it little joy But we but we shall enjoy the world The whole huge world a toy Great wine like blood from Burgundy Cloaks like the clouds from Tyre And marble like solid moonlight And gold like frozen fire Smells that a man might swill in a cup Stones that a man might eat And the great smooth women like ivory That the Turks sell in the street He sang the song of the thief of the world And the gods that love the thief And he yelled aloud at the cloister yards Where men go gathering grief Well have you sung O stranger Of death on the dyke in Wales Your chief was a bracelet giver But the red unbroken river Of a race runs not for ever But suddenly it fails Doubtless your sires were sword swingers When they waded fresh from foam Before they were turned to women By the god of the nails from Rome But since you bent to the shaven men Who neither lust nor smite Thunder of Thor we hunt you A hare on the mountain height King Guthrum smiled a little And said It is enough Nephew let Elf retune the string A boy must needs like bellowing But the old ears of a careful king Are glad of songs less rough Blue eyed was Elf the minstrel With womanish hair and ring Yet heavy was his hand on sword Though light upon the string And as he stirred the strings of the harp To notes but four or five The heart of each man moved in him Like a babe buried alive And they felt the land of the folk songs Spread southward of the Dane And they heard the good Rhine flowing In the heart of all Allemagne They felt the land of the folk songs Where the gifts hang on the tree Where the girls give ale at morning And the tears come easily The mighty people womanlike That have pleasure in their pain As he sang of Balder beautiful Whom the heavens loved in vain As he sang of Balder beautiful Whom the heavens could not save Till the world was like a sea of tears And every soul a wave There is always a thing forgotten When all the world goes well A thing forgotten as long ago When the gods forgot the mistletoe And soundless as an arrow of snow The arrow of anguish fell The thing on the blind side of the heart On the wrong side of the door The green plant groweth menacing Almighty lovers in the spring There is always a forgotten thing And love is not secure And all that sat by the fire were sad Save Ogier who was stern And his eyes hardened even to stones As he took the harp in turn Earl Ogier of the Stone and Sling Was odd to ear and sight Old he was but his locks were red And jests were all the words he said Yet he was sad at board and bed And savage in the fight You sing of the young gods easily In the days when you are young But I go smelling yew and sods And I know there are gods behind the gods Gods that are best unsung And a man grows ugly for women And a man grows dull with ale Well if he find in his soul at last Fury that does not fail The wrath of the gods behind the gods Who would rend all gods and men Well if the old man s heart hath still Wheels sped of rage and roaring will Like cataracts to break down and kill Well for the old man then While there is one tall shrine to shake Or one live man to rend For the wrath of the gods behind the gods Who are weary to make an end There lives one moment for a man When the door at his shoulder shakes When the taut rope parts under the pull And the barest branch is beautiful One moment while it breaks So rides my soul upon the sea That drinks the howling ships Though in black jest it bows and nods Under the moons with silver rods I know it is roaring at the gods Waiting the last eclipse And in the last eclipse the sea Shall stand up like a tower Above all moons made dark and riven Hold up its foaming head in heaven And laugh knowing its hour And the high ones in the happy town Propped of the planets seven Shall know a new light in the mind A noise about them and behind Shall hear an awful voice and find Foam in the courts of heaven And you that sit by the fire are young And true love waits for you But the king and I grow old grow old And hate alone is true And Guthrum shook his head but smiled For he was a mighty clerk And had read lines in the Latin books When all the north was dark He said I am older than you Ogier Not all things would I rend For whether life be bad or good It is best to abide the end He took the great harp wearily Even Guthrum of the Danes With wide eyes bright as the one long day On the long polar plains For he sang of a wheel returning And the mire trod back to mire And how red hells and golden heavens Are castles in the fire It is good to sit where the good tales go To sit as our fathers sat But the hour shall come after his youth When a man shall know not tales but truth And his heart fail thereat When he shall read what is written So plain in clouds and clods When he shall hunger without hope Even for evil gods For this is a heavy matter And the truth is cold to tell Do we not know have we not heard The soul is like a lost bird The body a broken shell And a man hopes being ignorant Till in white woods apart He finds at last the lost bird dead And a man may still lift up his head But never more his heart There comes no noise but weeping Out of the ancient sky And a tear is in the tiniest flower Because the gods must die The little brooks are very sweet Like a girl s ribbons curled But the great sea is bitter That washes all the world Strong are the Roman roses Or the free flowers of the heath But every flower like a flower of the sea Smelleth with the salt of death And the heart of the locked battle Is the happiest place for men When shrieking souls as shafts go by And many have died and all may die Though this word be a mystery Death is most distant then Death blazes bright above the cup And clear above the crown But in that dream of battle We seem to tread it down Wherefore I am a great king And waste the world in vain Because man hath not other power Save that in dealing death for dower He may forget it for an hour To remember it again And slowly his hands and thoughtfully Fell from the lifted lyre And the owls moaned from the mighty trees Till Alfred caught it to his knees And smote it as in ire He heaved the head of the harp on high And swept the framework barred And his stroke had all the rattle and spark Of horses flying hard When God put man in a garden He girt him with a sword And sent him forth a free knight That might betray his lord He brake Him and betrayed Him And fast and far he fell Till you and I may stretch our necks And burn our beards in hell But though I lie on the floor of the world With the seven sins for rods I would rather fall with Adam Than rise with all your gods What have the strong gods given Where have the glad gods led When Guthrum sits on a hero s throne And asks if he is dead Sirs I am but a nameless man A rhymester without home Yet since I come of the Wessex clay And carry the cross of Rome I will even answer the mighty earl That asked of Wessex men Why they be meek and monkish folk And bow to the White Lord s broken yoke What sign have we save blood and smoke Here is my answer then That on you is fallen the shadow And not upon the Name That though we scatter and though we fly And you hang over us like the sky You are more tired of victory Than we are tired of shame That though you hunt the Christian man Like a hare on the hill side The hare has still more heart to run Than you have heart to ride That though all lances split on you All swords be heaved in vain We have more lust again to lose Than you to win again Your lord sits high in the saddle A broken hearted king But our king Alfred lost from fame Fallen among foes or bonds of shame In I know not what mean trade or name Has still some song to sing Our monks go robed in rain and snow But the heart of flame therein But you go clothed in feasts and flames When all is ice within Nor shall all iron dooms make dumb Men wondering ceaselessly If it be not better to fast for joy Than feast for misery Nor monkish order only Slides down as field to fen All things achieved and chosen pass As the White Horse fades in the grass No work of Christian men Ere the sad gods that made your gods Saw their sad sunrise pass The White Horse of the White Horse Vale That you have left to darken and fail Was cut out of the grass Therefore your end is on you Is on you and your kings Not for a fire in Ely fen Not that your gods are nine or ten But because it is only Christian men Guard even heathen things For our God hath blessed creation Calling it good I know What spirit with whom you blindly band Hath blessed destruction with his hand Yet by God s death the stars shall stand And the small apples grow And the King with harp on shoulder Stood up and ceased his song And the owls moaned from the mighty trees And the Danes laughed loud and long BOOK IV THE WOMAN IN THE FOREST Thick thunder of the snorting swine Enormous in the gloam Rending among all roots that cling And the wild horses whinnying Were the night s noises when the King Shouldering his harp went home With eyes of owl and feet of fox Full of all thoughts he went He marked the tilt of the pagan camp The paling of pine the sentries tramp And the one great stolen altar lamp Over Guthrum in his tent By scrub and thorn in Ethandune That night the foe had lain Whence ran across the heather grey The old stones of a Roman way And in a wood not far away The pale road split in twain He marked the wood and the cloven ways With an old captain s eyes And he thought how many a time had he Sought to see Doom he could not see How ruin had come and victory And both were a surprise Even so he had watched and wondered Under Ashdown from the plains With Ethelred praying in his tent Till the white hawthorn swung and bent As Alfred rushed his spears and rent The shield wall of the Danes Even so he had watched and wondered Knowing neither less nor more Till all his lords lay dying And axes on axes plying Flung him and drove him flying Like a pirate to the shore Wise he had been before defeat And wise before success Wise in both hours and ignorant Knowing neither more nor less As he went down to the river hut He knew a night shade scent Owls did as evil cherubs rise With little wings and lantern eyes As though he sank through the under skies But down and down he went As he went down to the river hut He went as one that fell Seeing the high forest domes and spars Dim green or torn with golden scars As the proud look up at the evil stars In the red heavens of hell For he must meet by the river hut Them he had bidden to arm Mark from the towers of Italy And Colan of the Sacred Tree And Eldred who beside the sea Held heavily his farm The roof leaned gaping to the grass As a monstrous mushroom lies Echoing and empty seemed the place But opened in a little space A great grey woman with scarred face And strong and humbled eyes King Alfred was but a meagre man Bright eyed but lean and pale And swordless with his harp and rags He seemed a beggar such as lags Looking for crusts and ale And the woman with a woman s eyes Of pity at once and ire Said when that she had glared a span There is a cake for any man If he will watch the fire And Alfred bowing heavily Sat down the fire to stir And even as the woman pitied him So did he pity her Saying O great heart in the night O best cast forth for worst Twilight shall melt and morning stir And no kind thing shall come to her Till God shall turn the world over And all the last are first And well may God with the serving folk Cast in His dreadful lot Is not He too a servant And is not He forgot For was not God my gardener And silent like a slave That opened oaks on the uplands Or thicket in graveyard gave And was not God my armourer All patient and unpaid That sealed my skull as a helmet And ribs for hauberk made Did not a great grey servant Of all my sires and me Build this pavilion of the pines And herd the fowls and fill the vines And labour and pass and leave no signs Save mercy and mystery For God is a great servant And rose before the day From some primordial slumber torn But all we living later born Sleep on and rise after the morn And the Lord has gone away On things half sprung from sleeping All sleepy suns have shone They stretch stiff arms the yawning trees The beasts blink upon hands and knees Man is awake and does and sees But Heaven has done and gone For who shall guess the good riddle Or speak of the Holiest Save in faint figures and failing words Who loves yet laughs among the swords Labours and is at rest But some see God like Guthrum Crowned with a great beard curled But I see God like a good giant That labouring lifts the world Wherefore was God in Golgotha Slain as a serf is slain And hate He had of prince and peer And love He had and made good cheer Of them that like this woman here Go powerfully in pain But in this grey morn of man s life Cometh sometime to the mind A little light that leaps and flies Like a star blown on the wind A star of nowhere a nameless star A light that spins and swirls And cries that even in hedge and hill Even on earth it may go ill At last with the evil earls A dancing sparkle a doubtful star On the waste wind whirled and driven But it seems to sing of a wilder worth A time discrowned of doom and birth And the kingdom of the poor on earth Come as it is in heaven But even though such days endure How shall it profit her Who shall go groaning to the grave With many a meek and mighty slave Field breaker and fisher on the wave And woodman and waggoner Bake ye the big world all again A cake with kinder leaven Yet these are sorry evermore Unless there be a little door A little door in heaven And as he wept for the woman He let her business be And like his royal oath and rash The good food fell upon the ash And blackened instantly Screaming the woman caught a cake Yet burning from the bar And struck him suddenly on the face Leaving a scarlet scar King Alfred stood up wordless A man dead with surprise And torture stood and the evil things That are in the childish hearts of kings An instant in his eyes And even as he stood and stared Drew round him in the dusk Those friends creeping from far off farms Marcus with all his slaves in arms And the strange spears hung with ancient charms Of Colan of the Usk With one whole farm marching afoot The trampled road resounds Farm hands and farm beasts blundering by And jars of mead and stores of rye Where Eldred strode above his high And thunder throated hounds And grey cattle and silver lowed Against the unlifted morn And straw clung to the spear shafts tall And a boy went before them all Blowing a ram s horn As mocking such rude revelry The dim clan of the Gael Came like a bad king s burial end With dismal robes that drop and rend And demon pipes that wail In long outlandish garments Torn though of antique worth With Druid beards and Druid spears As a resurrected race appears Out of an elder earth And though the King had called them forth And knew them for his own So still each eye stood like a gem So spectral hung each broidered hem Grey carven men he fancied them Hewn in an age of stone And the two wild peoples of the north Stood fronting in the gloam And heard and knew each in its mind The third great thunder on the wind The living walls that hedge mankind The walking walls of Rome Mark s were the mixed tribes of the west Of many a hue and strain Gurth with rank hair like yellow grass And the Cornish fisher Gorlias And Halmer come from his first mass Lately baptized a Dane But like one man in armour Those hundreds trod the field From red Arabia to the Tyne The earth had heard that marching line Since the cry on the hill Capitoline And the fall of the golden shield And the earth shook and the King stood still Under the greenwood bough And the smoking cake lay at his feet And the blow was on his brow Then Alfred laughed out suddenly Like thunder in the spring Till shook aloud the lintel beams And the squirrels stirred in dusty dreams And the startled birds went up in streams For the laughter of the King And the beasts of the earth and the birds looked down In a wild solemnity On a stranger sight than a sylph or elf On one man laughing at himself Under the greenwood tree The giant laughter of Christian men That roars through a thousand tales Where greed is an ape and pride is an ass And Jack s away with his master s lass And the miser is banged with all his brass The farmer with all his flails Tales that tumble and tales that trick Yet end not all in scorning Of kings and clowns in a merry plight And the clock gone wrong and the world gone right That the mummers sing upon Christmas night And Christmas Day in the morning Now here is a good warrant Cried Alfred by my sword For he that is struck for an ill servant Should be a kind lord He that has been a servant Knows more than priests and kings But he that has been an ill servant He knows all earthly things Pride flings frail palaces at the sky As a man flings up sand But the firm feet of humility Take hold of heavy land Pride juggles with her toppling towers They strike the sun and cease But the firm feet of humility They grip the ground like trees He that hath failed in a little thing Hath a sign upon the brow And the Earls of the Great Army Have no such seal to show The red print on my forehead Small flame for a red star In the van of the violent marching then When the sky is torn of the trumpets ten And the hands of the happy howling men Fling wide the gates of war This blow that I return not Ten times will I return On kings and earls of all degree And armies wide as empires be Shall slide like landslips to the sea If the red star burn One man shall drive a hundred As the dead kings drave Before me rocking hosts be riven And battering cohorts backwards driven For I am the first king known of Heaven That has been struck like a slave Up on the old white road brothers Up on the Roman walls For this is the night of the drawing of swords And the tainted tower of the heathen hordes Leans to our hammers fires and cords Leans a little and falls Follow the star that lives and leaps Follow the sword that sings For we go gathering heathen men A terrible harvest ten by ten As the wrath of the last red autumn then When Christ reaps down the kings Follow a light that leaps and spins Follow the fire unfurled For riseth up against realm and rod A thing forgotten a thing downtrod The last lost giant even God Is risen against the world Roaring they went o er the Roman wall And roaring up the lane Their torches tossed a ladder of fire Higher their hymn was heard and higher More sweet for hate and for heart s desire And up in the northern scrub and brier They fell upon the Dane BOOK V ETHANDUNE THE FIRST STROKE King Guthrum was a dread king Like death out of the north Shrines without name or number He rent and rolled as lumber From Chester to the Humber He drove his foemen forth The Roman villas heard him In the valley of the Thames Come over the hills roaring Above their roofs and pouring On spire and stair and flooring Brimstone and pitch and flames Sheer o er the great chalk uplands And the hill of the Horse went he Till high on Hampshire beacons He saw the southern sea High on the heights of Wessex He saw the southern brine And turned him to a conquered land And where the northern thornwoods stand And the road parts on either hand There came to him a sign King Guthrum was a war chief A wise man in the field And though he prospered well and knew How Alfred s folk were sad and few Not less with weighty care he drew Long lines for pike and shield 
1482_140071_000007_000000	train-clean-360	King Guthrum lay on the upper land On a single road at gaze And his foe must come with lean array Up the left arm of the cloven way To the meeting of the ways

1482_140071_000018_000000	train-clean-360	 I was a fool and wasted ale My slaves found it sweet I was a fool and wasted bread And the birds had bread to eat

none	none	Meeting may be of war men Where the best war man wins But all this carrion a man shoots Before the fight begins And stopping in his onward strides He snatched a bow in scorn From some mean slave and bent it on Colan whose doom grew dark and shone Stars evil over Caerleon In the place where he was born For Colan had not bow nor sling On a lonely sword leaned he Like Arthur on Excalibur In the battle by the sea

none	none	The thorn woods over Ethandune Stand stiff as spikes in mail As to the Haut King came at morn Dead Roland on a doubtful horn Seemed unto Alfred lightly borne The last cry of the Gael BOOK VII ETHANDUNE THE LAST CHARGE Away in the waste of White Horse Down An idle child alone Played some small game through hours that pass And patiently would pluck the grass Patiently push the stone On the lean green edge for ever Where the blank chalk touched the turf The child played on alone divine As a child plays on the last line That sunders sand and surf For he dwelleth in high divisions Too simple to understand Seeing on what morn of mystery The Uncreated rent the sea With roarings from the land Through the long infant hours like days He built one tower in vain Piled up small stones to make a town And evermore the stones fell down And he piled them up again And crimson kings on battle towers And saints on Gothic spires And hermits on their peaks of snow And heroes on their pyres And patriots riding royally That rush the rocking town Stretch hands and hunger and aspire Seeking to mount where high and higher The child whom Time can never tire Sings over White Horse Down And this was the might of Alfred At the ending of the way That of such smiters wise or wild He was least distant from the child Piling the stones all day For Eldred fought like a frank hunter That killeth and goeth home And Mark had fought because all arms Rang like the name of Rome And Colan fought with a double mind Moody and madly gay But Alfred fought as gravely As a good child at play He saw wheels break and work run back And all things as they were And his heart was orbed like victory And simple like despair Therefore is Mark forgotten That was wise with his tongue and brave And the cairn over Colan crumbled And the cross on Eldred s grave Their great souls went on a wind away And they have not tale or tomb And Alfred born in Wantage Rules England till the doom Because in the forest of all fears Like a strange fresh gust from sea Struck him that ancient innocence That is more than mastery And as a child whose bricks fall down Re piles them o er and o er Came ruin and the rain that burns Returning as a wheel returns And crouching in the furze and ferns He began his life once more He took his ivory horn unslung And smiled but not in scorn Endeth the Battle of Ethandune With the blowing of a horn On a dark horse at the double way He saw great Guthrum ride Heard roar of brass and ring of steel The laughter and the trumpet peal The pagan in his pride And Ogier s red and hated head Moved in some talk or task But the men seemed scattered in the brier And some of them had lit a fire And one had broached a cask And waggons one or two stood up Like tall ships in sight As if an outpost were encamped At the cloven ways for night And joyous of the sudden stay Of Alfred s routed few Sat one upon a stone to sigh And some slipped up the road to fly Till Alfred in the fern hard by Set horn to mouth and blew And they all abode like statues One sitting on the stone One half way through the thorn hedge tall One with a leg across a wall And one looked backwards very small Far up the road alone Grey twilight and a yellow star Hung over thorn and hill Two spears and a cloven war shield lay Loose on the road as cast away The horn died faint in the forest grey And the fleeing men stood still Brothers at arms said Alfred On this side lies the foe Are slavery and starvation flowers That you should pluck them so For whether is it better To be prodded with Danish poles Having hewn a chamber in a ditch And hounded like a howling witch Or smoked to death in holes Or that before the red cock crow All we a thousand strong Go down the dark road to God s house Singing a Wessex song To sweat a slave to a race of slaves To drink up infamy No brothers by your leave I think Death is a better ale to drink And by all the stars of Christ that sink The Danes shall drink with me To grow old cowed in a conquered land With the sun itself discrowned To see trees crouch and cattle slink Death is a better ale to drink And by high Death on the fell brink That flagon shall go round Though dead are all the paladins Whom glory had in ken Though all your thunder sworded thanes With proud hearts died among the Danes While a man remains great war remains Now is a war of men The men that tear the furrows The men that fell the trees When all their lords be lost and dead The bondsmen of the earth shall tread The tyrants of the seas The wheel of the roaring stillness Of all labours under the sun Speed the wild work as well at least As the whole world s work is done Let Hildred hack the shield wall Clean as he hacks the hedge Let Gurth the fowler stand as cool As he stands on the chasm s edge Let Gorlias ride the sea kings As Gorlias rides the sea Then let all hell and Denmark drive Yelling to all its fiends alive And not a rag care we When Alfred s word was ended Stood firm that feeble line Each in his place with club or spear And fury deeper than deep fear And smiles as sour as brine And the King held up the horn and said See ye my father s horn That Egbert blew in his empery Once when he rode out commonly Twice when he rode for venery And thrice on the battle morn But heavier fates have fallen The horn of the Wessex kings And I blew once the riding sign To call you to the fighting line And glory and all good things And now two blasts the hunting sign Because we turn to bay But I will not blow the three blasts Till we be lost or they And now I blow the hunting sign Charge some by rule and rod But when I blow the battle sign Charge all and go to God Wild stared the Danes at the double ways Where they loitered all at large As that dark line for the last time Doubled the knee to charge And caught their weapons clumsily And marvelled how and why In such degree by rule and rod The people of the peace of God Went roaring down to die And when the last arrow Was fitted and was flown When the broken shield hung on the breast And the hopeless lance was laid in rest And the hopeless horn blown The King looked up and what he saw Was a great light like death For Our Lady stood on the standards rent As lonely and as innocent As when between white walls she went And the lilies of Nazareth One instant in a still light He saw Our Lady then Her dress was soft as western sky And she was a queen most womanly But she was a queen of men Over the iron forest He saw Our Lady stand Her eyes were sad withouten art And seven swords were in her heart But one was in her hand Then the last charge went blindly And all too lost for fear The Danes closed round a roaring ring And twenty clubs rose o er the King Four Danes hewed at him halloing And Ogier of the Stone and Sling Drove at him with a spear But the Danes were wild with laughter And the great spear swung wide The point stuck to a straggling tree And either host cried suddenly As Alfred leapt aside Short time had shaggy Ogier To pull his lance in line He knew King Alfred s axe on high He heard it rushing through the sky He cowered beneath it with a cry It split him to the spine And Alfred sprang over him dead And blew the battle sign Then bursting all and blasting Came Christendom like death Kicked of such catapults of will The staves shiver the barrels spill The waggons waver and crash and kill The waggoners beneath Barriers go backwards banners rend Great shields groan like a gong Horses like horns of nightmare Neigh horribly and long Horses ramp high and rock and boil And break their golden reins And slide on carnage clamorously Down where the bitter blood doth lie Where Ogier went on foot to die In the old way of the Danes The high tide King Alfred cried The high tide and the turn As a tide turns on the tall grey seas See how they waver in the trees How stray their spears how knock their knees How wild their watchfires burn The Mother of God goes over them Walking on wind and flame And the storm cloud drifts from city and dale And the White Horse stamps in the White Horse Vale And we all shall yet drink Christian ale In the village of our name The Mother of God goes over them On dreadful cherubs borne And the psalm is roaring above the rune And the Cross goes over the sun and moon Endeth the battle of Ethandune With the blowing of a horn For back indeed disorderly The Danes went clamouring Too worn to take anew the tale Or dazed with insolence and ale Or stunned of heaven or stricken pale Before the face of the King For dire was Alfred in his hour The pale scribe witnesseth More mighty in defeat was he Than all men else in victory And behind his men came murderously Dry throated drinking death And Edgar of the Golden Ship He slew with his own hand Took Ludwig from his lady s bower And smote down Harmar in his hour And vain and lonely stood the tower The tower in Guelderland And Torr out of his tiny boat Whose eyes beheld the Nile Wulf with his war cry on his lips And Harco born in the eclipse Who blocked the Seine with battleships Round Paris on the Isle And Hacon of the Harvest Song And Dirck from the Elbe he slew And Cnut that melted Durham bell And Fulk and fiery Oscar fell And Goderic and Sigael And Uriel of the Yew And highest sang the slaughter And fastest fell the slain When from the wood road s blackening throat A crowning and crashing wonder smote The rear guard of the Dane For the dregs of Colan s company Lost down the other road Had gathered and grown and heard the din And with wild yells came pouring in Naked as their old British kin And bright with blood for woad And bare and bloody and aloft They bore before their band The body of the mighty lord Colan of Caerleon and its horde That bore King Alfred s battle sword Broken in his left hand And a strange music went with him Loud and yet strangely far The wild pipes of the western land Too keen for the ear to understand Sang high and deathly on each hand When the dead man went to war Blocked between ghost and buccaneer Brave men have dropped and died And the wild sea lords well might quail As the ghastly war pipes of the Gael Called to the horns of White Horse Vale And all the horns replied And Hildred the poor hedger Cut down four captains dead And Halmar laid three others low And the great earls wavered to and fro For the living and the dead And Gorlias grasped the great flag The Raven of Odin torn And the eyes of Guthrum altered For the first time since morn As a turn of the wheel of tempest Tilts up the whole sky tall And cliffs of wan cloud luminous Lean out like great walls over us As if the heavens might fall As such a tall and tilted sky Sends certain snow or light So did the eyes of Guthrum change And the turn was more certain and more strange Than a thousand men in flight For not till the floor of the skies is split And hell fire shines through the sea Or the stars look up through the rent earth s knees Cometh such rending of certainties As when one wise man truly sees What is more wise than he He set his horse in the battle breech Even Guthrum of the Dane And as ever had fallen fell his brand A falling tower o er many a land But Gurth the fowler laid one hand Upon this bridle rein King Guthrum was a great lord And higher than his gods He put the popes to laughter He chid the saints with rods He took this hollow world of ours For a cup to hold his wine In the parting of the woodways There came to him a sign In Wessex in the forest In the breaking of the spears We set a sign on Guthrum To blaze a thousand years Where the high saddles jostle And the horse tails toss There rose to the birds flying A roar of dead and dying In deafness and strong crying We signed him with the cross Far out to the winding river The blood ran down for days When we put the cross on Guthrum In the parting of the ways BOOK VIII THE SCOURING OF THE HORSE In the years of the peace of Wessex When the good King sat at home Years following on that bloody boon When she that stands above the moon Stood above death at Ethandune And saw his kingdom come When the pagan people of the sea Fled to their palisades Nailed there with javelins to cling And wonder smote the pirate king And brought him to his christening And the end of all his raids For not till the night s blue slate is wiped Of its last star utterly And fierce new signs writ there to read Shall eyes with such amazement heed As when a great man knows indeed A greater thing than he And there came to his chrism loosing Lords of all lands afar And a line was drawn north westerly That set King Egbert s empire free Giving all lands by the northern sea To the sons of the northern star In the days of the rest of Alfred When all these things were done And Wessex lay in a patch of peace Like a dog in a patch of sun The King sat in his orchard Among apples green and red With the little book in his bosom And the sunshine on his head And he gathered the songs of simple men That swing with helm and hod And the alms he gave as a Christian Like a river alive with fishes ran And he made gifts to a beggar man As to a wandering god And he gat good laws of the ancient kings Like treasure out of the tombs And many a thief in thorny nook Or noble in sea stained turret shook For the opening of his iron book And the gathering of the dooms Then men would come from the ends of the earth Whom the King sat welcoming And men would go to the ends of the earth Because of the word of the King For folk came in to Alfred s face Whose javelins had been hurled On monsters that make boil the sea Crakens and coils of mystery Or thrust in ancient snows that be The white hair of the world And some had knocked at the northern gates Of the ultimate icy floor Where the fish freeze and the foam turns black And the wide world narrows to a track And the other sea at the world s back Cries through a closed door And men went forth from Alfred s face Even great gift bearing lords Not to Rome only but more bold Out to the high hot courts of old Of negroes clad in cloth of gold Silence and crooked swords Scrawled screens and secret gardens And insect laden skies Where fiery plains stretch on and on To the purple country of Prester John And the walls of Paradise And he knew the might of the Terre Majeure Where kings began to reign Where in a night rout without name Of gloomy Goths and Gauls there came White above candles all aflame Like a vision Charlemagne And men seeing such embassies Spake with the King and said The steel that sang so sweet a tune On Ashdown and on Ethandune Why hangs it scabbarded so soon All heavily like lead Why dwell the Danes in North England And up to the river ride Three more such marches like thine own Would end them and the Pict should own Our sway and our feet climb the throne In the mountains of Strathclyde And Alfred in the orchard Among apples green and red With the little book in his bosom Looked at green leaves and said When all philosophies shall fail This word alone shall fit That a sage feels too small for life And a fool too large for it Asia and all imperial plains Are too little for a fool But for one man whose eyes can see The little island of Athelney Is too large a land to rule Haply it had been better When I built my fortress there Out in the reedy waters wide I had stood on my mud wall and cried Take England all from tide to tide Be Athelney my share Those madmen of the throne scramble Oppressors and oppressed Had lined the banks by Athelney And waved and wailed unceasingly Where the river turned to the broad sea By an island of the blest An island like a little book Full of a hundred tales Like the gilt page the good monks pen That is all smaller than a wren Yet hath high towns meteors and men And suns and spouting whales A land having a light on it In the river dark and fast An isle with utter clearness lit Because a saint had stood in it Where flowers are flowers indeed and fit And trees are trees at last So were the island of a saint But I am a common king And I will make my fences tough From Wantage Town to Plymouth Bluff Because I am not wise enough To rule so small a thing And it fell in the days of Alfred In the days of his repose That as old customs in his sight Were a straight road and a steady light He bade them keep the White Horse white As the first plume of the snows And right to the red torchlight From the trouble of morning grey They stripped the White Horse of the grass As they strip it to this day And under the red torchlight He went dreaming as though dull Of his old companions slain like kings And the rich irrevocable things Of a heart that hath not openings But is shut fast being full And the torchlight touched the pale hair Where silver clouded gold And the frame of his face was made of cords And a young lord turned among the lords And said The King is old And even as he said it A post ran in amain Crying Arm Lord King the hamlets arm In the horror and the shade of harm They have burnt Brand of Aynger s farm The Danes are come again Danes drive the white East Angles In six fights on the plains Danes waste the world about the Thames Danes to the eastward Danes And as he stumbled on one knee The thanes broke out in ire Crying Ill the watchmen watch and ill The sheriffs keep the shire But the young earl said Ill the saints The saints of England guard The land wherein we pledge them gold The dykes decay the King grows old And surely this is hard That we be never quit of them That when his head is hoar He cannot say to them he smote And spared with a hand hard at the throat Go and return no more Then Alfred smiled And the smile of him Was like the sun for power But he only pointed bade them heed Those peasants of the Berkshire breed Who plucked the old Horse of the weed As they pluck it to this hour Will ye part with the weeds for ever Or show daisies to the door Or will you bid the bold grass Go and return no more So ceaseless and so secret Thrive terror and theft set free Treason and shame shall come to pass While one weed flowers in a morass And like the stillness of stiff grass The stillness of tyranny Over our white souls also Wild heresies and high Wave prouder than the plumes of grass And sadder than their sigh And I go riding against the raid And ye know not where I am But ye shall know in a day or year When one green star of grass grows here Chaos has charged you charger and spear Battle axe and battering ram And though skies alter and empires melt This word shall still be true If we would have the horse of old Scour ye the horse anew One time I followed a dancing star That seemed to sing and nod And ring upon earth all evil s knell But now I wot if ye scour not well Red rust shall grow on God s great bell And grass in the streets of God Ceased Alfred and above his head The grand green domes the Downs Showed the first legions of the press Marching in haste and bitterness For Christ s sake and the crown s Beyond the cavern of Colan Past Eldred s by the sea Rose men that owned King Alfred s rod From the windy wastes of Exe untrod Or where the thorn of the grave of God Burns over Glastonbury Far northward and far westward The distant tribes drew nigh Plains beyond plains fell beyond fell That a man at sunset sees so well And the tiny coloured towns that dwell In the corners of the sky But dark and thick as thronged the host With drum and torch and blade The still eyed King sat pondering As one that watches a live thing The scoured chalk and he said Though I give this land to Our Lady That helped me in Athelney Though lordlier trees and lustier sod And happier hills hath no flesh trod Than the garden of the Mother of God Between Thames side and the sea I know that weeds shall grow in it Faster than men can burn And though they scatter now and go In some far century sad and slow I have a vision and I know The heathen shall return They shall not come with warships They shall not waste with brands But books be all their eating And ink be on their hands Not with the humour of hunters Or savage skill in war But ordering all things with dead words Strings shall they make of beasts and birds And wheels of wind and star They shall come mild as monkish clerks With many a scroll and pen And backward shall ye turn and gaze Desiring one of Alfred s days When pagans still were men The dear sun dwarfed of dreadful suns Like fiercer flowers on stalk Earth lost and little like a pea In high heaven s towering forestry These be the small weeds ye shall see Crawl covering the chalk But though they bridge saint Mary s sea Or steal saint Michael s wing Though they rear marvels over us Greater than great Vergilius Wrought for the Roman king By this sign you shall know them The breaking of the sword And man no more a free knight That loves or hates his lord Yea this shall be the sign of them The sign of the dying fire And Man made like a half wit That knows not of his sire What though they come with scroll and pen And grave as a shaven clerk By this sign you shall know them That they ruin and make dark By all men bond to Nothing Being slaves without a lord By one blind idiot world obeyed Too blind to be abhorred By terror and the cruel tales Of curse in bone and kin By weird and weakness winning Accursed from the beginning By detail of the sinning And denial of the sin By thought a crawling ruin By life a leaping mire By a broken heart in the breast of the world And the end of the world s desire By God and man dishonoured By death and life made vain Know ye the old barbarian The barbarian come again When is great talk of trend and tide And wisdom and destiny Hail that undying heathen That is sadder than the sea In what wise men shall smite him Or the Cross stand up again Or charity or chivalry My vision saith not and I see No more but now ride doubtfully To the battle of the plain And the grass edge of the great down Was cut clean as a lawn While the levies thronged from near and far From the warm woods of the western star And the King went out to his last war On a tall grey horse at dawn And news of his far off fighting Came slowly and brokenly From the land of the East Saxons From the sunrise and the sea From the plains of the white sunrise And sad saint Edmund s crown Where the pools of Essex pale and gleam Out beyond London Town In mighty and doubtful fragments Like faint or fabled wars Climbed the old hills of his renown Where the bald brow of White Horse Down Is close to the cold stars But away in the eastern places The wind of death walked high And a raid was driven athwart the raid The sky reddened and the smoke swayed And the tall grey horse went by The gates of the great river Were breached as with a barge The walls sank crowded say the scribes And high towers populous with tribes Seemed leaning from the charge Smoke like rebellious heavens rolled Curled over coloured flames Mirrored in monstrous purple dreams In the mighty pools of Thames Loud was the war on London wall And loud in London gates And loud the sea kings in the cloud Broke through their dreaming gods and loud Cried on their dreadful Fates And all the while on White Horse Hill The horse lay long and wan The turf crawled and the fungus crept And the little sorrel while all men slept Unwrought the work of man With velvet finger velvet foot The fierce soft mosses then Crept on the large white commonweal All folk had striven to strip and peel And the grass like a great green witch s wheel Unwound the toils of men And clover and silent thistle throve And buds burst silently With little care for the Thames Valley Or what things there might be That away on the widening river In the eastern plains for crown Stood up in the pale purple sky One turret of smoke like ivory And the smoke changed and the wind went by And the King took London Town End of Project Gutenberg s The Ballad of the White
