FORTUNE SEEKERS Those who join the stampede to a new goldfield may generally be divided into two classes the tenderfoot and the old timer otherwise the novice and the experienced prospector The novice joins the stampede because he catches the fever dreams dreams The old timer goes because the diggings he had last worked in proved of little good Were the sea dogs of old Drake Raleigh or Frobisher born into the world to day their spirit would surely have impelled them to the mining camp to seek fortune in the mountain fastnesses and to wager years of effort on the chance of wresting from Nature her treasure stores On the steamship Aleutian as she lay in the dock at Vancouver British Columbia one day in the March of eighteen ninety eight there were many tenderfeet and a few old timers Amongst the experienced was John Berwick About him surged the steamship s host of passengers waving their arms and yelling answers to the cheer that went up from the great crowd upon the dock side He and his fellows were bound for the Klondike goldfields Before them lay adventures toil and danger the adventurous will ever draw the tributes of goodwill from the multitude staying at home The air was chill and damp and the increased speed of the steamer as she passed from the harbour accentuated the effect of the breeze that blew against her so that Berwick felt cold He shivered and half turned towards the door across the promenade but the wavelets flying by in their half blue half grey ripples fascinated him and he lingered Suddenly he was aroused a hand was on his shoulder and he heard a familiar voice say Hullo old chum John swung round He looked into the smiling face of his old time mining mate George Bruce George by all the gods he cried Are you bound for the diggings too Yes and mighty glad to find an old mate I told you when you left Coolgardie that you wouldn t stand civilization long but had no idea of running across you in this rush The two turned and entered the saloon together Neither mentioned it but each knew that in the adventures before them their efforts and their fortunes would be joined In the language of the Australian they were mates or in the vernacular of their new surroundings partners George Bruce was tall and athletic with golden hair He was a jovial soul blessed with a body of activity He would go for the hardest work in a cheery way and during the social hours of evening was the best of company He was as liberal with his money and means as he was of good nature The saloon was crowded with men drifting about staring at all they met or talking in groups On the lower deck dogs could be heard barking The ship was tense with an atmosphere of excitement Berwick and his pardner went by a companion way to the lower deck where they found a passage way to the fore part of the ship and so came to the presence of the canine choir Big dogs and little dogs of every breed and colour were there All grades of canine society were represented from the big and well fed saint Bernard to the mongrel snared in the slums Dogs were a safe investment in the towns on the Pacific Coast of North America and unscrupulous humanity was actively at work capturing them and getting them there The portion of the deck to which the dogs were relegated was also set apart for the baggage which was piled in heaps in the middle A dozen men were diving into kit bags extracting necessary articles or packing them away The inspiration of the last few minutes in Vancouver had prompted many to purchase odds and ends which had been forgotten in the general outfitting A tall angular man was attending to three dogs of an uncommon breed Two of them were practically of the same size which was that of an ordinary collie the third was not so large All had the same markings black with tan about the face and neck and a show of tan about the legs but the hair on the two larger was longer than on the third This couple also had bushy tails which curled over their backs while the tail of the smaller dog was only a stump John recognized them from their wolfish look as belonging to a Northern breed George and he became interested After watching the dogs for a minute John approached one of them and patted him remarking to his owner Your dogs don t seem over affectionate No They don t make much noise These dogs never bark Why is that Don t know suppose it is because they have wolf in them but they howl when the spirit moves them Often Only when they are alone and then generally at night The conversation was lapsing when the stranger turned and gazed at the mountains showing through the mist along the coast Those mountains look kind o cold said he You fellows going inside Yes answered John Come from Australia The stranger had evidently been sizing them up There are a whole lot going inside from Australia I hear The only man I know on board is George Bruce here my mate but there is such a crowd about there may be others The passes are already crowded a whole lot of these fellows don t know what they are up against The man shook his head with an aspect of melancholy Been in the Klondike before Berwick asked him Yes five years ago I came down from the River in ninety six just before the news of Carmack s discovery reached Forty Mile or else I would have been in on the best of it The fellows sent me out word right after but I didn t think the pay streak would hold so didn t go in last year But this spring I got so dead sick of civilization I just had to get away although I don t think there s much chance of my striking it rich Your dogs are Yukon dogs Yes Malamoots I brought them out with me just to kind of keep me from getting homesick but they worked the other way I took them back on the home ranch and every time they set up a howl on winter nights I began to see the old Northern Lights sky shooting overhead and smell the bean pot boiling and I d feel like getting down a hole to bed rock somewhere and trying a pan of dirt Besides the folks outside I don t like their ways they ask a man so many fool questions They all want to know why I ain t a millionaire You see I ve been up to Bonanza Creek where Carmack made his discovery and where the rich claims have been discovered a dozen times We used to call it Rabbit Creek and there were always a half dozen moose or so mooching round and we used to go shooting then Didn t you ever try a dish of gravel asked George for the first time entering the conversation The stranger looked at him and evidently did not understand John cleared the situation by saying I think what you call a pan we call a dish in Australia Oh yes I ve panned it often enough but could not get more than a few colours to the pan of dirt Fellows writing me say they go down through twenty feet of black muck before they strike the gravel and bed rock I was not looking for any proposition like that How Carmack found out the gold was underneath I don t know The two friends bade their new acquaintance good evening and returned to the saloon All the seats were occupied and there were yet groups of men standing about but the excitement was less They passed on to the smoking room at the fore part of the ship This was crowded and the air thick A large man in a white sweater was holding forth He was stout almost to corpulency and extended his fist excitedly in the ardour of his argument I tell you gentlemen he was saying I come from the State of I dee ho We have big mountains in I dee ho with lots of snow on them in winter I ve lived among these mountains for twenty years and I know what snow is and you bet your life if there is one man who will get into the Yukon it is John Muggsley Big Jack they called me back home It s a big man who is needed on a trip like this a fellow who can put a couple of hundred pounds on his back and walk off with it as if it were nothing I tell you this is not a proposition for any tenderfoot to tackle Well said another man I don t want any packing so far as I am concerned I have two cows with me both good milkers and I will load my stuff on their backs and drive them over the pass I can have their milk to drink and when I get to Lake Bennett I ll kill them and sell their meat John and George had seen those cows Poor cows Poor man So it was with a large portion of the passengers With the excitement and the thirst for gold the most quixotic ideas had been developed What the cows were to live upon en route had not yet been considered Such is the haste with which an idea is acted upon when the gold fever has seized its victim Others there were who had machine propelled devices designed to travel over ice and snow or on dry land These machines were manufactured and sold by keen witted salesmen to the inexperienced and confiding After dinner that first evening out of port John and George fell into conversation with the owner of the Malamoots They had seized two of the cots erected in the saloon and their new friend seeing them had taken one next to them His greeting was friendly Well gentlemen getting located Yes Good act The three were soon in deep conversation discussing gold mining as prosecuted in Australia and in the Yukon After an hour or two they strolled forward between the cots stepping over sacks and bags and articles of clothing spread upon the floor They passed several tables at which games of cards were being played The tin horns are getting down to business remarked the stranger What are they playing asked George Black Jack the great game for the tenderfoot It is so easily learned so easy to cheat at too and these greenhorns will get robbed blind Their eyesight will be improved by the loss of their money remarked John A fool never learns said the stranger They entered the smoking room and found Muggsley still holding forth Gentlemen you just watch me and see how soon I get over these here mountains It s experience that counts in this kind of work The man who had the cows and he who was the proud possessor of the Klondike ice locomotive were listening with some disdain but the dozen other listeners were open mouthed in envy and astonishment at wonderful Muggsley The three passed out on deck The wind was chill a frizzle was in the air and the waves breaking in dull phosphorescence against the bow of the ship looked sickly and uncanny through the blackness A dangerous coast the insurance rate for ships travelling this route is fifteen per cent remarked the stranger John Muggsley was still shaking his fist vociferously in the faces of his listeners as the party returned from deck to seek their beds Good night you fellows Glad I met you My name s Hugh Spencer the stranger said as he settled in his cot The same to you answered the others The freemasonry of the gold seeker holds throughout the world and its handshake is honest Three gold seekers have been introduced to the reader in this chapter and these pages will tell something of what befell them in what was probably the most spectacular gold rush in the history of the world John Berwick who is by way of being our hero shall have a chapter to himself CHAPTER II JOHN BERWICK Like most men whose success in life is largely the whim of fortune John Berwick had for years accepted her rulings without protest and regarded passing little incidents as signs of her influence One night in the December preceding his setting out for the Klondike he was lying in his bunk on Judas Creek one of the innumerable streams in British Columbia in which colours of gold otherwise prospects could be found reading a month old newspaper that a trapper who had passed the previous night with him had brought from the settlement and in its columns had found an item of news telling of the recent rich discoveries in the Yukon He read the paragraph carefully again and again striving to separate exaggeration from truth and to satisfy himself that there was truth in it By the camp stove sat Joe the French Canadian whom he employed smoking and gazing at the glow of the fire with stolid and witless eyes He would sit thus for hours to a man of Berwick s temperament he was a satisfactory companion On the Claim things had gone none too well True by great effort they had reached bed rock at thirty feet and were beginning to cross cut in search of a pay streak There was certainly little gold in the gravel on the bed rock already uncovered and the flow of water into the working was very great indeed as much time was taken in keeping the shaft free of water as in all their other works combined And up to three days previously rain had been incessant though relief was apparently at hand owing to the frost that had succeeded The earth had hardened Judas Creek was already flowing in less volume and the boulders in the stream were becoming massed with ice Berwick had been but a few months on Judas Creek having essayed to try his fortune in Canada s most western province Fortune meant much to him for lack of it hindered his marriage with the one necessary girl Alice Peel the only daughter of Surgeon Major Peel This was one cause of his presence on the frontier another was that he and his religion had fallen out years ago His father had intended him for the Church and here he was The Creek is falling rapidly we can hardly hear it now remarked John Dat s so was Joe s reply He was laconic John s thoughts went back to his prospects Much of his small capital had gone into the works Joe was not in love he had no capital save his strength of body and his religion was negligible When first this French Canadian had arrived in British Columbia and started work in a saw mill he had refused to work on Sunday until the foreman told him that the devil never crossed the Rocky Mountains which silenced his scruples For sure the Rocky Mountains were very high I think we should empty the shaft to morrow with seventy or seventy five buckets I guess dat s so Again Berwick relapsed into silence and kept his mind on his many problems had he or had he not better throw up his Judas Creek Claim and strike out for the scene whence came these wonderful tales The volume of the Creek was diminishing with abnormal rapidity For three days now frost had been upon the canyon and the flying spray had frozen upon the boulders The rushing gurgling stream falling over rocks and sunken logs had during that time been sucking down bubbles of cold air which sealed the fine ice particles to the river bed For miles Judas Creek was lined with anchor ice encasing the rocks with a coating sickly white insidious In the darkness the opaque ice seemed to shine out in phosphorescence in fact it threw back the light of the stars overhead which seemed to have lowered themselves in the heavens so bright and grand were they At a point a mile below the little pool where the nucleus of the mass now filling the river bed had formed a tree was stretched across the torrent It had fallen into the stream above and floated down until it jammed holding back the current The avalanche as the thickening stream had now become found this tree and swept against it but a second when it snapped Now the flow of the river became a seething mass of ice and sticks four feet high travelling at the rate of several miles an hour picking up all that came in its way It passed the mouth of several tributaries which lent it increase of force still its speed quickened the grinding noise increased logs sticks masses of ice and great roots of trees appeared for an instant on its surface and sank again Now the wave was five feet now six feet high broadening out gaining yet in speed still more effectually holding back the river s flow The gradual silencing of the river s roar was getting on the nerves of John Berwick who was miles down stream far below the ice flow The river had tapered into a little rill When a certain noise has been a companion for days and days and is suddenly stilled a sense of uneasiness results as when on a steamer the throb of the engine ceasing will rouse sleepers from their slumber The slowing down of the torrent in Judas Creek made Berwick restless He did not at first recognize what it was that worried him Joe also seemed as if he were not altogether proof against the spell at last he took his stare from the stove and looked around the cabin I t ink something pretty soon happen by gosh John stared at him for Joe to volunteer a remark was unusual it increased his employer s apprehension Berwick returned to his newspaper fascinated by its news A party of miners had arrived in San Francisco bringing much gold from some unknown region of the north They called it the Klondike Would his Judas Creek Claim ever pay him for his efforts What were his chances of fortune Masses of gold or mountains of dust He was in search of fortune with a big F His thoughts naturally drifted to the girl he wanted to marry She was the daughter of luxury and wealth He was just a prospector no more in the eyes of Dame Fortune than the sturdy natural by the stove in fact experience had led him to believe that in the mining enterprise Fortune had a partiality for such men as Joe Berwick had been five years at the mining game He had drifted from one camp to another over America to Australia back to America He had possibly become something of a cynic certainly his mind had hardened with his muscles He dreamed dreams What would his lady say if she received a letter saying he was again pulling stakes and had left Judas Creek in order to avoid being defeated He whistled and shrugged his strong shoulders He did not know He put some practical thoughts together The Klondike was evidently in the North far inland in Canada Could he withstand great cold Yes he could he could endure and do anything as any other normal strong man could and could go anywhere that was practicable to humanity This was not vanity not conceit but just healthy self confidence Should he pull up stakes and leave his Judas Creek Claim to the coyotes As this question once more came to his mind he was aware of the complete silence now outside and letting his paper fall bent his head to listen Joe was listening also Judas Creek was absolutely still Joe arose and opened the cabin door His employer joined him there There was no sound from the Creek there was no Creek By gosh dat s funnee t ing Joe exclaimed I certainly do not know how to account for it said Berwick He felt apprehensive They returned from the cabin door Joe going to his seat by the stove Berwick putting his bed in order for the night when Joe jumped up and ran to the door again A dull distant roar was heard By gosh By gosh I got it He s a river snow slide what s coming Quick boss quick Get for hell out of dis Pretty soon no more cabin no windlass no no bucket only water No not ing all gone The man began hurriedly putting on his boots and instinctively his master followed his example inquiring as he did so What s that He s a river snow slide dat s all I know for to call him A havalanche on wheels all turn over over over Him carry away everything bridge tree dam all sort of thing everything go And as the sullen roar coming from the valley continued to increase the appreciation of approaching danger spread from the one to the other Berwick made haste and scrambled into his winter garb Joe bundled together his personal effects and some of the more valuable of the supplies in the cabin Berwick did the same out of the door they sprang into the night and up the hillside under which their cabin was built Joe gave a sign when he considered they were out of danger At once they threw down their loads and rushed back to the cabin Grabbing another load they again sought the higher ground Meanwhile the flood had broken from the canyon at the head of their little valley The timber there had been largely cut and over the rugged stumps the rolling mass spread grinding tearing up the weaker roots Berwick and his companion sat and watched their home going to destruction Deliberately it seemed the mass of ice and water fell upon their workings There was a loud crack as the windlass went down and then the fury of water poured into their shaft It was but for an instant The flood tore against their cabin Would the cabin endure the shock The answer soon came There was a rending of timber the cabin was pushed before the ice and then it seemed to melt away swallowed up by the flood The lights went out Lower and lower it sank till the roof was touched by the surging ice Then that too went under and nothing but a fractured log or pole was left of the little home John shivered The flood fell almost as quickly as it had risen now that its work was proved effectual Berwick turned to look at his man Joe was already hard at work with an axe on a fallen tree from which the chips flew There was no doubt about it now The Judas Creek venture was a failure he could write it down as such He had known many miners on whom Fortune had smiled drunken swine many of them to whom money appealed only as a means to dissipation And he to whom money the price of his future home happiness meant so much Joe struck a match applied it to a handful of birch bark and the flame sprang up By all the canons of his life Berwick should have jumped into the fray and helped Joe make their camp but after all it was only a little past nine o clock Yes Now he must throw up Judas Creek Joe laid twigs on top of the birch bark and soon had a fire to which he added larger sticks and logs Then he cut down a fir tree and made a bed over which he spread the canvas of a tent and blankets The night was perfectly clear they would be warm and snug enough beside the fire Joe cut several more logs of wood and piled them near after which he sat down upon the blankets took off his boots and coat rolled this into a pillow and soon was asleep Berwick sitting by the fire watched far into the night His fancy played about the flames calling up scenes of his youth and conceiving all manner of pictures of the miner s life in the sub Arctic Klondike that was to be CHAPTER III THE BEGINNING OF YUKON No more wonderful system of navigation probably exists on the globe than that of the inland passage between Puget Sound and the Lynn Canal at the head of which are the towns of Skagway and Dyea the respective ports of the White and the Chilkoot Passes For ten hundred miles the steamers plying along this route run behind the great barrier of islands beginning with that of Vancouver and ending at Point Deception In summer the trip is grand beyond compare in winter it is full of gloom and awe As the ship travels northward the mountains grow greater the narrow passages narrower till they develop as canyons cut only by other canyon like passages to the sea or by glacier ridden valleys from the mainland whose mighty burdens shimmer in the sunlight as they yield in torrents tributes to the parent ocean In summer continuous light reigns in the latitude of Skagway and the traveller entering this weird zone is moved by its uncanny beauty Winter was still on the land as the Aleutian ploughed her way northward and the passengers saw the great walls of rock uplifting to the clammy mantle of low lying clouds Here and there Indian villages were passed and Indian graveyards with flags flying from the stagings raised six or eight feet from the ground on which reposed the deceased The ship called at Wrangle and unloaded freight and passengers This town had a boom during the excitement of the Cassiar twenty years back remarked Hugh Spencer to Berwick and Bruce as the three stood on the deck and watched the bustle between the steamer and the wharf Let s stretch our legs up the quay said George They went ashore Squaws were sitting with baskets of their handiwork before them doing a lively trade with the disembarked passengers The sales made were mostly of moccasins in beads and bark canoes adorned with porcupine quills of brightest colours Hugh stopped before an old squaw and picked up a pair of large mittens with gauntlet attachments They were made of canvas and lined with red flannel How much he inquired Dollar two bits Give you six bits
5968_61356_000020_000000	train-clean-360	 All right 
none	none	Better take a couple of pair each fellows there s nothing like them for the trail look how big the thumbs are So Hugh and his two companions bought the whole of the squaw s store There s nobody knows how to make mitts for real cold weather like the Siwash They make the thumbs good and big so as not to stop circulation and we ll have some cold weather yet before we get over the summit But you have to beat the beggars down as they always ask twice as much as they expect to get Here we paid only seventy five cents a pair for these mitts and the squaw said she wanted a dollar and a quarter for them Are these Siwash one Indians inquired John one Corruption of the French sauvage Well we call them Siwashes but they don t like it The real Siwash lives farther south and the name I believe is one of contempt They are different Indians from any I have seen on the plains said John Oh yes very different I guess their only resemblance is that they are both good only when they are dead You re pretty hard on them was the remark of the good natured John Perhaps I am You see a tough outfit has been trading up here for years from down the coast and before that the Russians were here and they didn t put in most of their time building churches They found a dollar s worth of hootch would get more from the savages than a dollar s worth of anything else so they used whisky The savage when you find him without the cussedness taught by the white man makes a pretty good citizen He may be lazy but he is honest and perhaps his laziness is only due to the fact that he has always had a klootch two to do chores around and has never been trained to the white man s ways of working but let any fellow try following an Indian on snow shoes for a couple of days and his ideas soon change He is not much good with a pick and shovel for sure but he is Aone on the trail Another thing about the Indian is that when one has grub they all have grub This is the way of the Stick Indians inside and you can cache your grub in their country or leave the things lying around and they won t touch them two Squaw During the rest of the day John and his mates were in the company of Hugh Spencer listening to his tales of Yukon life the glories of the summer there and the great cold of the winter with the resources of the miners to keep from despair He told them the traditions of the camps and how the discoveries of forty nine in California had been followed by others in Oregon British Columbia the Fort Steele district Wild Horse Creek Kettle River Caribou and finally in the Yukon It wasn t a miner who was the first finder of gold in the Yukon it was a missionary But the missionary did not follow up this discovery which makes a difference However I ll tell you the story and it will let you see a little of Siwash nature in the telling of it The reverend Robert Macdonald Doctor of Divinity and Archdeacon of MacKenzie River was the first white man to find gold in the Yukon Say I ain t got much use for missionaries as a general proposition but Archdeacon Macdonald is as white a man as ever lived though he is east of the Rocky Mountains now I guess the reason I don t like missionaries is that you can never do anything with the Siwashes once a missionary gets hold of them Well the Archdeacon he wasn t Archdeacon then though drifted down the Porcupine and took up his residence with the Hudson Bay Company people at Fort Yukon in the year eighteen sixty two which was a few years before I was born You see the Hudson Bay people established themselves at Fort Yukon in eighteen forty seven In eighteen forty two mister J Bell in charge of the Hudson Bay Post on the Peel River which runs into the MacKenzie from beyond the divide from the head waters of the Porcupine crossed over and went down the Porcupine a way In eighteen forty six he followed it to its mouth and saw the Yukon In the following year mister A H Murray built Fort Yukon and set up business Well it was here that the Archdeacon started to tell the savages of the Great Spirit and they were mighty interested The savages had some sort of a tradition that a certain canyon which opened into the Yukon a short distance up stream from the Fort was the home of bad spirits they could hear them groaning and they asked the missionary to put them wise three So when a bunch four arrived one day in July eighteen sixty three he trotted the whole outfit off to the canyon three Inform them four Bunch Party Of course the missionary found the noises were caused by the wind or nothing but as the Siwashes said there were noises up the Creek he said it was the wind Walking along the shore the Archdeacon saw a bit of something shining in the gravel and picked it up It was a flake of gold sticking to a piece of mica of which there s lots in the Klondike country mica schist the scientists call it So this was the first find of gold by a white man but the Company was not looking for gold hunters in their country so the discovery was never followed up The Siwash is Aone at asking questions just about as bad as a six year old kid and if a medicine man comes among them it is surprising what sort of conundrums they will bring him In this way John Berwick and his old time mining mate pleasantly passed the hours listening to the conversation of Spencer by whom they were attracted On the third evening at dinner the three being seated together they noticed some movement beginning amongst those of the company who were seated near the companion way Several were seen to rise and hurry away Quickly the excitement spread the saloon was soon empty of most of its feasters Keep your seats fellows it s only some chechacho got the toothache said Hugh Shouts were heard with a trampling and rush of feet on the upper deck The only thing that could happen outside of fire would be to run ashore or hit an iceberg We are hardly far enough north for the icebergs yet besides if we had hit one or run ashore we should know it If we caught fire it would not be far to the shore anywhere along this route and it is always well not to get stampeded in any case After dinner the friends entered the main saloon and found groups of men talking excitedly with others returning from the upper deck where the life boats were stored To the upper deck they went and there they found mister Muggsley I tell you gentlemen no officer or anybody else is going to keep me from the life boats when a ship is sinking I don t care for anybody You stand by and let the officers and sailors run things and they will fill the boats with women and their own friends and look out for themselves But I look out for John Muggsley Big John Muggsley the boys call me And it s a case like this that makes me glad I m big and strong An excitable coal heaver had found a stream of water entering by a sea cock which had been left open through carelessness and running up through the saloon to the boats had started the excitement Such trivial circumstances often cause most disastrous panics and likewise tell tales of how certain men are made The ship eventually after blinding snowstorms entered Gastineau Channel To the left was the great line of stamp mills pounding out the wealth of the mighty Treadwell quartz deposits on Douglas Island to the right was the pioneer town of Juneau with its gambling halls and saloons enjoying the licence of the Alaska mining camp The next stop for the ship was Skagway where the sea journey would end on the morrow The passengers were alert and astir From then on it was to be a struggle CHAPTER IV SOCIETY IN ALASKA The weather had changed during the night and as the two friends stepped on deck the following morning a chill and cutting wind met them from the north Away above them towered the mountains their peaks dazzling white against the sky Behind them to the south was the Lynn Canal walled with mountains Before them were mountains and yet more mountains The cluster of tents and hastily constructed buildings resting on a few square miles of gravel flats comprising the town of Skagway were robbed of any importance by the great uplifting walls of rock As they stood a voice hailed them Is this Skagway It was mister Muggsley who spoke I fancy so said John better ask the purser here he comes Do we have to climb those mountains to get to the Klondike Yes But where is the White Pass There The purser pointed to the mouth of a valley which soon appeared blocked by a mighty mountain And that is the White Pass It is Say purser is that berth I had taken for the trip down again If not save it for me I guess I m wanted back in I dee ho mister Muggsley the big man the strong man Big Jack as his friends called him was suddenly possessed of cold feet The great uplifting mountains with their glittering peaks flung to heaven had quickened the cowardice of his craven soul Berwick and his comrade struggled ashore through the rushing freight handlers and piled up supplies The freight which came from the Canadian port Vancouver had to be passed by the United States Customs and the officers seemed few There was a method of overcoming the Customs by employing a convoy an official of the United States Customs to escort the goods across the narrow strip into Canadian territory again John made inquiries and addressed a fellow in a wild garb bespeaking a resident Pay the duty partner These escort fellows are a bunch of grafters They ain t no credit to the United States I can tell you Yes pay duty and hand an officer a ten dollar bill on the side or they ll keep you here a week you bet John decided to pay the duty The convoy would cost five dollars per day and expenses He made an effort to get his goods passed but without success till he paid the ten dollar bribe George did the same John did not like bribery but what else could he do It was afternoon ere they got through and as they gained the town a rough board building with a great white cloth sign painted on it Restaurant meals fifty cents met their gaze from the head of the wharf Other buildings of similar character composed generally this section of the town so they walked into the first It was a box of a place as unfinished internally as externally A dozen or so men perched on high stools were leaning against a board counter covered with white oilcloth Behind the counter stood a woman and a girl a range where the chef was operating at their back A board partition divided off a sleeping apartment The curtain that gave the room privacy was but half drawn Articles of clothing trunks and boxes were strewn in disorder on the floor Soup queried the lady as they took their seats The cook filled two flat tin plates with a watery solution of tomatoes and rice This they attacked When the soup was finished two other tin plates were handed them laden with cubical chunks of beef and gravy Dishes of potatoes and boiled beans with bread and butter in tin bowls were lined upon the counter for each man to help himself from At the end of the second course a plate bearing a quarter section of sickly looking apple pie was slid over to each The old lady presiding wore the smile of prosperity and looked communicative so John opened conversation Been in Skagway long Just a month Doing well Sure thing feed about three hundred people a day Don t care if the rush never lets up You ve got a gold mine here without the trouble of going to Dawson Sure that is if Soapy don t put the whole town out of business He makes the saloons and gambling halls pay him royalty now besides running shows himself and I guess he ll be after us soon to make us anti up too I thought Alaska was a prohibition territory no whisky sold here Yes that s what they say back East but when you get up town you ll find every second place a saloon with all the hootch you want to drink or have money to pay for But how do they get the whisky Oh that s easy enough The hootch is consigned through to the Canadian side in bond but when it is landed here they drill a hole in the barrel and take out the whisky They refill the barrel with water and it is packed over the summit But it costs thirty cents a pound to put the water over the summit That don t matter with whisky fifty cents a glass over the bar Don t the officers know this is going on Sure thing they do but they stand in There is no graft like a whisky graft Stand in and graft the two Australians felt they knew the meaning of the terms but they had yet to grasp how deep the meaning of standing in and grafting as understood by officialdom in Alaska and the Yukon could be Berwick and his friend ate their pie and departed to see the sights The main street of the town ran due north and south and was lined with tents and buildings finished and under construction The street was devoid of snow except in patches here and there the ever persistent wind from the north having generally swept the gravel clean Sleighs drawn by dogs or horses passed smoothly over the ice but shrieked in protest against the stone Dogs and horses seemed everywhere in that rush of fifty thousand men No man could enter the Yukon without a year s provisions which meant that he must transport at least a thousand pounds in every case Along the streets vehicles were waiting to transport vast stores of supplies to White Pass City twelve miles distant after which dog teams alone or pack animals or the labour of the human animal were necessary Some pack horses mules and burroes were passing down the streets to their stables after having carried up their loads Men in outlandish garb were walking about many wore what appeared to be night shirts coming down to their knees with hoods attached and rings of fur around the wrists and the face of the hood Some of the peculiar garments were made of blue drill others even of bed ticking showing its dingy stripes This garment was the parka Berwick and Bruce entered the Pack Train Saloon and Gambling hall and met there the leaders of Alaska society men and women of diverse morals and immoralities In the great grab bag system of the goldfields every man has an equal chance and on the frontier custom affords but one field of diversion which each may enjoy to the full extent of his purse and inclination As muscle and endurance alone give eminence on the trail so only money and extravagance command attention in the bar room and at the gaming table and it is there that the illiterate squander their money over the bars and tables finding pleasure in the open mouthed admiration of the yokel as well as in the stimulation of the liquor or the excitement of the play At the bar of the Pack Train stood a row of men in widest diversity of costume talking together and to women numbered among the fallen Behind the bar were the roulette wheel the faro the Black Jack tables and the crap game A large percentage of these men were actively engaged in putting supplies over the Passes and were now squandering at the tables the money received in payment of that work The thought struck John that probably not a man of them wasting his money there but had some one dependent to whom that money would be as a gift from heaven Alas for the recklessness of frontier life where it so often happens that men regard a show of contempt for money as tantamount to personal eminence Such scenes were not new to him On the plains in his apprenticeship he had seen a cowboy shoot his revolver through a bar mirror and cheerfully pay the exorbitant recompense demanded by the proprietor and in Sydney he had watched a drunken sailor place a five pound note between two slices of bread and eat it Such scenes as this in the mushroom Alaska town may be ever interesting to the students of human nature they are also intensely pitiable as Berwick found What sight is sadder than that which shows man degraded or woman fallen Man the noblest being in all creation upbuilt evolved through the ages practically perfect in his parts his body complex yet true delicate and confident enriched with a mind capable of holding dominion and conscious of the inspiration of his Creator To see him mind and body lost to dissipation drawn from hope truth and love fallen into the mire is truly sadder than death From the Pack Train Saloon the two friends visited several shops and notwithstanding the crowds therein succeeded in adding to their supplies such necessities as were recommended by Hugh Spencer Their purchases completed they turned before the wind and went back to the restaurant The air had taken on a greater chill the mountain peaks shone with sunset gold CHAPTER V SOAPY S LITTLE GAME Soapy Smith was a criminal with a long record of robbery and murder In early life he had been a common faker and sold soap hence his sobriquet His process consisted of wrapping small bits of laundry soap in paper and including or appearing to include with several of the pieces a bank bill of varying value Then he would mix all the pieces together and picking a handful out of the mass auction them Needless to say every successful purchaser was a confederate In the Mining Camps of the Western States he later took more radical methods making many enemies and some friends When he and his gang wished to exterminate an enemy they would hunt him out in some saloon gather about him and play at fighting among themselves Revolvers would be drawn and shots fired the man wanted would be killed It would be somewhat hard to find the actual man who fired the fatal shot and in any case a subservient jury would bring in a verdict of accidental death The community that grew at the head of the Lynn Canal in the spring of eighteen ninety eight was a complete hotbed for crime There Soapy Smith established himself and law and justice ceased to exist Gold seekers were enticed into games and fleeced or openly robbed in the streets Every saloon was owned by the desperado or paid him tribute and he drew revenue from every gambling table Soapy Smith was the boss of these evil conditions He was styled Colonel and spoken of as a candidate for Congress A body of United States Regulars were stationed at Skagway but did nothing The Deputy United States Marshal would make promises but take no action The second evening after the arrival of our party in Skagway the sky was overcast and through the night a storm arose So they stayed within doors all the next day but towards night inaction told on them likewise lack of fresh air They became restless after their evening meal and George finally said Let us go out and they went George did not say where nor did John ask There was only one place to go to and that was a saloon and gambling hall one was much the same as the other Every saloon was a gambling hall every gambling hall a saloon On the next night in the vicinity of Skagway s Sixth Avenue they wandered into a saloon which had no sign the question of what its name was did not cross their minds The air was foul and floor space not too plentiful Women stared at them and Passed them up Not so the men They moved on to the gaming tables John threw a coin on to the Black Jack table To his surprise he won He speculated again again he won Then he remembered the old dodge of letting the novice win a bit at first so he decided he would keep on until he found himself losing When he had won twenty dollars he put the money into his pocket and went on with George to watch a man playing for heavy stakes at roulette At this table there was never a word spoken and the gold pieces passed from banker to player from player to banker without comment While the two were looking on they noticed a man come and stand by the banker watch the game for a little while glance shrewdly at them and go away Shortly afterwards another man did the same John and George realised this attention but said nothing A third man came along and bluntly asked them Ever play roulette No at least not often said John Good game Yes Ever shoot craps No There s a table down at the end of the hall Care to see it They followed their entertainer to the dimly lighted rear where several men were leaning over a table throwing dice They watched the game a bit and found it uninteresting They turned to go when their new acquaintance made a move to follow and asked in a hesitating way Have a drink George declined The fellow pondered a bit and then said in an ingratiating way Would you fellows like to see a big mountain goat I bought from the Siwashes to day John and George followed the man through a doorway into a cold room where a few candles were burning on a rough table On the floor lay an immense mountain goat My word said George what a beauty They stood for some minutes surveying the dead monarch of the mountain crests their entertainer taking one of the candles and holding it at the animal s head Suddenly they heard groans which appeared to come through the doorway at the opposite end of the room What s that The man took a candle and walked to the door bending his head as if listening intently The groans were continued John and George went over to him He held the candle in his left hand and appeared to haul at the door with his right Oh Oh came from the room in tones of deepest distress The fellow handed the candle to John and then catching the door with both hands gave it a mighty wrench The heavy plank door opened and showed a dark cavity which drank up the slender light of the candle so effectually that they could distinguish nothing Cautiously John entered followed by George The door was slammed they were trapped We re caught Soapy has us exclaimed George John turned shaded the candle with his hand and explored the room It was not large and it took him but a minute to make a circuit of the four walls We re caught was said again But there is no one here where did the groans come from asked John Don t know if they weren t ventriloquism replied George That seemed likely John ran and gave the door a kick it was solid as a wall What will they do with us he asked Freeze us to death we ll freeze quick enough in this atmosphere The place was cold clammy benumbing The walls were log the floor of earth sparkling with frost crystals the roof was built of poles There was no window Here and there where the crevices of the logs had not been thoroughly filled and the air came in there were patches of frost They searched for some implement The room was thoroughly bare there was not even a billet of wood let alone an axe or saw Things were at a pass They were both to perish in horrible death The cold was seizing them They stamped up and down the room and shouted There was there could be no answer Frenzy came over them Trapped To perish of bitter cold Horrible Horrible To famish as caged animals They saw their little destiny to walk and walk and walk and then to lie down and sleep till death the reality came Their impotency galled them How weak were their arms and strength against these walls of logs They marched about for an hour or more encouraging each other as brave men will Then cries were heard faintly from the outside and new noises which grew and continued to grow A great blow shook the wall and then another John shouted George shouted the blows were repeated then they heard voices and shouted again The door was burst open and in rushed a number of men Come fellows out of this or you ll be cooked It was the voice of Hugh They eagerly followed him through the room where the goat was and out through a side door into the open where a great glare met them An outhouse was on fire Men were rushing about and shouting but Hugh kept on through the crowd and the rescued followed him till they reached the safety of the street Now we d better duck for home said Spencer I go with you and through the storm they struggled till they reached the Frau s restaurant She had not yet retired so they called for supper tea bacon and beans After they had settled down Hugh told his story You see fellows after I landed I went over to the Chilkoot to have a look at things there but after talking to the fellows I reckoned that the White Pass was best for me so back I comes I was in the hall to night with you fellows but you did not see me and I thought I would just lay back and see if you would hit the games Then I kind of got a notion Soapy s men were watching you so I thought I would watch the whole outfit I see you go back to the crap game and then I see you go into the room with your bunco man and then I don t see you come out so I said to myself you are there for keeps Now there was with me one fellow I could rely on so I asked him to keep an eye on that door and I got out on the street to size up the building I see towards the rear the wing you went into so I walks down there sizing things up Round on the back side I see a door and a window but the door had the snow piled up against it besides I knew they would not lock you in a room with a window in it as you could easily kick that out Then I looks at the walls and I see by the end of the logs sticking out that there was a room which had neither window nor door to the outside and I said That s the cage So I ran back to the saloon and asked my friend there if anybody had come out and he said No I came to the conclusion that I would make a bluff of going in at the door you came out of It was no good a fellow stopped me and said This room is private This made me sure you were still there so I commenced figuring out how I could get you free and I thought hard The thing was to get a crowd together and as a dog fight is no good in Skagway in the middle of the night especially in a snowstorm I said to myself Fire I remembered a building I took for a wood shed lying near your skookum house five so I just hunted it up and after finding there was a lot of wood in it with some hay I set a match to it and got out taking an axe with me In five minutes it was going fine and I yelled Fire fire fire Then it was all easy I struck the logs with the axe and yelled there was somebody in there who would get burned I busted in the door to the outer room and then the one into where you were locked up the other fellows following I don t know what the other fellows around the fire will think you were doing in there but I guess they won t ask any questions Fellows don t ask questions in Soapy s town it doesn t do them much good if they do five Skookum House Chinook Indian term for prison literally strong house John and George expressed their gratitude very simply I am going in over the White Pass he continued and I figure as us fellows can t keep clear of each other that we d better join forces Done cried George A good idea said John So it was agreed In the morning details were talked over and business was arranged Additional purchases were made including two more dogs thereupon named Tom and Jerry Hugh induced his friends to part with much of their bedding saying he had a large lynx skin robe that was warmer than a dozen pairs of blankets under which the three might sleep A waterproof a large tanned moose skin and a couple of pairs of blankets would be sufficient to lie upon Then the commissariat was considered Sugar tea evaporated potatoes dried fruit et cetera to be used in the preparation of every meal were put into small canvas bags and those into a large sack The general stores were put away in waterproof canvas sacks which were marked to indicate contents The axes of the party were ground and sharpened At last all was ready for the advance CHAPTER VI HITTING THE TRAIL To be early on the trail was an essential to Hugh Spencer He was up at four on the morning of the start harnessed the dogs carried the outfit to the sleigh and lashed it on Then he aroused his friends who when dressed found that an early breakfast had been arranged for them of bacon eggs and beans Better put lots next your ribs for there isn t room to cook a meal on the trail between here and White Pass City was the advice they received They left the restaurant after a kindly good bye from the old lady John and George tied their hand bags containing underclothing towel soap et cetera and socks to the load The main portion of their extra clothing was left in the general supplies Of the five dogs he of the stub tail Dude the leader was the only one that appeared to take an interest in the proceedings for he was standing watching his master The others were mere balls of fur lying in the snow Hugh went ahead and harnessed himself in the cord that was tied to the front of the sleigh and grasped the gee pole lashed as a single shaft on the right side of the sleigh Mush he ordered Dude gave a tug at the traces and the other dogs stood up Mush was ordered again The whole five dogs strained at the traces in a half hearted sort of way not sufficient to move the load Hugh then let go his hold of the pole threw off his harness and picked up a whip that was tucked under the lashings of the load Behind Dude was Two Bits then came Four Bits Tom and Jerry Beginning with Two Bits he gave each a cut with the whip causing heart rending howls but Dude stood throughout the ordeal evidently oblivious to the sufferings of his companions his tongue protruding He was a picture of conscious virtue Dude knew these signs of the trail the stern hard life the cut of the whip the cry of the dog Hugh then cracked the whip re harnessed himself in the cord and grasped the gee pole Mush he ordered The five dogs strained at the traces taking quick furtive glances over their shoulders at the man with the whip The load moved the march towards the great and golden Klondike had started Early as they were they saw as they reached the main street others on the trail and up the long avenue heading north between the great mountains horse teams dog teams and men unaided were drawing their loads The wind was roaring down the pass cutting their faces like a knife They now appreciated the special virtues of the parka for with hood drawn over their head as they bent before the gale their faces largely escaped the cutting blasts and the light material of which the garment was made was wonderfully effective in keeping the wind from their bodies Although the recent storm had improved the travelling it was not long before the sleigh grated on gravel and stopped the dogs appearing instinctively to realize that the noise meant further effort was useless Hugh said nothing but disengaged himself from his harness went to the rear of the load and undid a coil of rope from either side to which Berwick and Bruce were harnessed also He then resumed his position Mush The three men and five dogs threw themselves against the load There was a shriek from the gravel and the sleigh glided again over the soft snow The difficulty being over Hugh told his friends to disengage themselves and throw the cords back on the load which they did after protesting that they had better remain in harness and help to pull No you fellows can each take a turn at the gee pole when I get tired Hugh said The dogs would stop for any excuse it was only necessary for Hugh to pass the time of day with a south bound traveller when the train would stand their tongues lolling out their eyes vacantly staring Tis the nature of the beast The native dogs of the north never give the impression that they work because they feel it their duty They work because they know there is a stronger will than theirs behind them a will with a whip The party moved steadily along for a mile or two when the road left the flats and took to the side hill at the right hand of the canyon A considerable amount of work had been done and the trail was in good shape but they had not gone far before they were met by a toll gate Twenty five cents each and two dollars and a half for the dog team was demanded of them which they paid The keeper of the toll gate seemed happy he was prospering and those who employed him were making money John and George thought the charge excessive but Hugh was exercising his wits calculating how much the proprietors made out of what he called their graft Not far beyond the toll gate they met an old man sitting by a fire under the lee of a wall of rock He was off the trail in a sort of little cove and on the much betramped snow around was a sleigh and by it five goats in harness The old man merely looked up as the three friends approached and went on poking the fire Well partner enjoying the scenery asked Hugh in his good natured manner No I wish I was dead How s that These ornery goats here I can t do nothing with them an if it wasn t for poor little Bess back home I d shoot them and meself too What s the trouble Well the ornery critters won t pull a pound and the fellow who sold them to me down in Seattle said they was just the thing for the Pass better n dogs for I could feed them on birch browse but I lit out from Skagtown six four days ago and could get no further than this I pretty near had to pull sleigh and goats too to get this far and I pitched camp here where I ve stayed ever since You see it s this way the old woman died last fall and after she died the poor old farm went plumb to pieces hard times and mortgage falling due so I got a sickening of the old place without the old woman and I let the farm go and put little Bess to school for a year and lit out for the Klondike Bess ain t Bess by rights she was christianized Matilda Jane and we called her Bess for short Well the old woman was always building on bringing up Bess a real lady and afore she died I promised I d give Bess a good schooling and help all I could and I took to the Klondike hearing all a fellow had to do was to get there and he d be rich Here I am now and I ain t got no more money I m just trying to make up my mind to shoot the blamed goats and pull my stuff back to Skagtown and sell it Then I guess I ll go packing on the Chilkoot along with the Siwashes six Skagway The old man seemed to forget the presence of the strangers and muttered Poor little Bess Poor little Bess I was hoping to make her a real lady with silks an satins an diamonds an kid gloves an fancy eye glasses Hugh cracked the whip John tightened on the cord the dogs threw themselves into the traces and the trio was on its way up the Pass No one spoke for some time each was thinking of the old man s tale and of such as that old man there were hundreds in the Passes The trail as they struggled along proved to be more and more built against the side hill and frequently the sleigh showed a disposition to slide into the canyon so that all were compelled to give attention to it But the three men taking turn at the gee pole they had soon crossed Kill a man Creek and were at the foot of Porcupine Hill The time had passed quickly and the air though cold was highly stimulating George and John voted the parka a wonderful garment Arriving at the base of the hill Hugh quickly undid the fastenings piled half the load on the side of the trail and relashed the balance to the sleigh then he and John set about the task of taking the first load to the top of the hill while George mounted guard at the base Hugh took the gee pole John harnessed himself in the cord that was attached to the left hand rear of the sleigh so they set out The hill made a rise of several hundred feet in the first quarter of a mile and in some places seemed almost standing on end but straining pulling tugging men and dogs both they eventually reached the top They soon had the sleigh unloaded and Hugh was off down again for the remainder of the load In three quarters of an hour they were all together again Then began the descent which was almost as acute as the rise had been They adjusted the necessary brakes by tying a piece of rope around each runner Before leaving the summit of Porcupine Hill they had a good look at the view Across the valley in front set in a basin of the mountains was a collection of buildings and tents constituting White Pass City Two long lines of men and teams marked the White Pass one on the left side of the canyon the other on the canyon bottom The hillside trail was used by horses mules and oxen while in the wedge like canyon bottom men and dogs toiled The reason for the hillside trail was that its ascent was more gradual the lower trail having many abrupt rises up which horses and oxen could not clamber The scene of toil and labour backed by the sublimity of the surroundings impressed the beholders but the party came to life again with Hugh s order Mush The dogs struggled with the load over the brink of the decline down which the sleigh quickly passed and the party was not long in reaching White Pass City This was the first depot out from Skagway and was distant there from twelve miles From White Pass City to Lake Bennett the distance was twenty four miles so they were now one third of the way But the twelve miles they had passed was the easiest part of the journey Saloons and restaurants in wide array and numerous stables in the shape of tents tied down and guyed against the ever recurring blasts comprised White Pass City And how the wind did blow from the funnel shaped canyon across the basin in which the town was built Notwithstanding the cold beasts of burden were standing in all directions tied to posts and rails while the dogs seemed without number It being now late in the day there were more teams returning from the summit and Bennett than were setting out Amongst those returning they met a man with a dozen pack mules Long icicles hung from his moustache powdery snow was driven into the folds of his parka his cheeks were alternate patches of blue and crimson His manner was blustering because he was glad at having returned and proud that he had done so without losing any horses Hello said Hugh what s it like on the summit What s it like Look here stranger if I owned hell and that summit I d sell the summit and live in hell so help me What s the matter with the summit Why if that cursed wind ain t blowing from the north cold enough to freeze hell then it s blowing from the south and snowing as if all the feather beds in the New Jerusalem were being split open and shaken loose I ll be hanged if the Mounted Police ain t got a stable and store house scooped out under the snow and the roof standing up like as if it was a rock About sixty feet of snow has fallen up there this winter and how them poor devils of policemen hold things down in tents is more than I know A fellow can tackle it for a day or two but these fellows have been up there since early in February It s a way they have in the Army suggested George always an ardent Briton Those fellows are different from any Army fellows I ever seed was the stranger s reply The pack train was called to a halt The communicative stranger and his assistants were taking the saddles off the mules but for once the dogs were impatient and restless instinct told them they were near the end of their day s work and the prospect of food So Hugh let them have their way and they drew up in front of a restaurant which bore the legend Meals seventy five cents Better go in and eat fellows and I ll look after the dogs said Hugh His friends demurred but he insisted so they entered the restaurant There was the same motley crowd feeding in the same savage manner as at Skagway Everybody smoked on the trail in all places and under any condition save where the pipe froze and refused its duty The hour was between two and three Berwick and his comrade thought they had never been so hungry How they relished the hot soup and the meat potatoes and beans And when they drank George finished his dinner first and scrambled off to relieve Hugh whom he found cutting up pieces of raw meat for the dogs Raw meat ain t any too good for dogs but after they get over the summit they will get down to boiled rice and tallow and that ain t far off Hugh was certainly the favourite of the dogs just then but soon after George s arrival he put the piece of meat he had been dividing into a sack and threw it on the sleigh and hurried to the restaurant saying that he would boil the rest of the meat for the dogs after he himself had something to eat Look out for Soapy s gang was his final warning to George After Hugh had his dinner dinner is the mid day supper the evening meal on the trail he remarked that he would take a mooch round When he returned he greeted his friends with Say I found a fellow I know here running one of these stables and he has a tent with a lot of hay in it and says we can sleep in that which will save us making camp We can put the dogs inside and run less chances of having them stolen also the grub So Dude was aroused from his sleep four other doggy noses were withdrawn from under four bushy tails and to the accompaniment of howls the load was removed to the hay tent the dogs unharnessed the load unpacked Hugh undid the bedding and spread it on a pile of straw This will be the last bed we ll strike for some time after we leave here was his remark He grabbed the sack with the meat and went off to see if he could find space on a stove to boil it He soon returned with the meat as well as a bucket in which were canine dainties kitchen scraps Chuck it into you was Hugh s remark to the dogs as he threw them the food you ll have to work to morrow As there was nothing to do now till that morrow the three again strolled out to look at the trail up which the full flow of traffic was now toiling Profanity filled the air The travellers cursed the trail they cursed their horses cursed their dogs the wind the country generally They wandered into a saloon which as ever was reeking with tobacco and vibrating to the notes of Home sweet Home reeled off on a gramophone Hugh looked cautiously at the company Soapy s men he whispered so he and his companions went John noticed that a good deal of money was being won at the tables but Hugh told him that the men who were winning were Soapy s staff They seem to run a wonderful system said John Yes Soapy pretty nearly owns the whole shop from the Lynn Canal to the summit But why does he stop at the summit Police But they have police on this side Not the same How do you account for that Don t know discipline The Canadian police are not grafting Fellows I ve met from the inside tell me that Cap Constantine gave records for all the rich claims in Bonanza and neither he nor any of the rest of the Mounted Police grafted any That s what I call honest but now since the records have been taken away from the police there s nothing but grafting going on Fellows have to give up half interest in claims to the officials before they can get record and even the Government is grafting officially with this ten per cent royalty If some of those Members of Parliament back in Canada were here with this proposition getting over these Passes they d think they had a right to all they d found in this country And now they are taking part of it away it s a shame I call it They had walked up the lower trail leading to the summit Whatever men and horses were to be seen were making down the Pass for the trail that clung to the side of the mountain was so narrow that two horses going in opposite directions could not pass each other so in the morning the horses passed up the trail and in the afternoon down That was the unwritten law They returned to the sleeping quarters Every dog except Dude had his nose under his tail and was apparently oblivious to all outside concerns Dude s tail was not long enough to cover his nose and Hugh noticed his eyes quiver and open slightly On the floor was the empty meat sack The five dogs had demolished the large piece of dead horse That s Dude said Hugh Which asked John Why stealing that meat Before we get to Dawson you ll know what a high class article in the stealing line he is However there ll be lots more dead horses they kill about a dozen a day between here and Bennett How do they manage that Wait till to morrow and you ll see CHAPTER VII HUGH S PHILOSOPHY The stars were still shining when the friends tore themselves stiff and sore from under their lynx skin robe on the morrow to dress in the chill atmosphere of the tent but the sounds of movement were everywhere Commands embellished with profanity were being shouted When the three adventurers after a hurried breakfast eagerly went out a sickly light was spreading over the mountains which seemed spectral and immense We ll take the flour sugar and hardware in the first two loads remarked Hugh as he began selecting these supplies and it won t do any harm to hang our bacon sack from a rafter while we are away as a stray malamoot might get in here These blamed dogs will chew a tin can open to get at the meat inside The plan of campaign suggested by Hugh and endorsed by the others was to divide the supplies in three loads to take two comprising the reserve stores to the summit and cache them then on the following day to carry the remainder of the stuff right through to Log Cabin or to Bennett if they could manage it and establish a camp there This depended on the condition of the trail Early as they were there were scores of outfits setting out and many were ahead of them They had not gone far when they met two men and a dog team one of the men was belabouring the dogs with a whip making them howl dreadfully Dude and the rest of the team halted and with their masters watched the proceedings The dogs belaboured were soon tangled among the traces in fine confusion Each animal as he saw a stroke coming his way jumped sideways with a howl and buried his nose and feet in the snow The cruelty aroused the anger of John and George who made a move towards the brute with the whip Hugh caught him by the arm and pulled him back Better not make yourself a Humane Society in this country you ll only get into trouble besides he ain t hurting the dogs wait When the man rested from the belabouring Hugh asked to be allowed to try the dogs The fellow glared angrily at him but then with a surly nod gave the permission Hugh started with the leaders and worked down the whole line placing the dogs in order once again hauling them about but saying nothing Then he took the gee pole and ordered mush The leader looked back over his shoulder as did the dog next him Mush again cried Hugh The dogs drew steadily at their collars glancing furtively at their new master Hugh once more encouraged them and when the load began to move passed on his charge to the owner who had the grace to look sheepish To handle dogs said Hugh when he had rejoined his party and had resumed the trail you ve got to get them frightened of you and moving round them silent like puts fear in their souls You see that fellow wasn t really hurting them they could hardly feel that light whip through their fur and their feet and noses where they are tender they stuck in the snow As for howling it comes natural to malamoots No you ve got to treat them just as you do women The trail often became precipitous but as the combined strength of the three men and the dogs was sufficient to lift the load bodily their difficulties were well overcome They had not been out of the White Pass City an hour when George shouted Look and pointed to the mountain side to the left The trail away above them was lined with horses moving slowly forward but down the mountain side eight burroes were plunging head tied to tail as is the custom Every dog team on the lower trail had stopped to watch the sight for there was a great rattling of rock and a general shout calling attention to the catastrophe The unfortunate creatures soon reached the base of the slide and were lost in the soft snow They struggled and they disappeared One more sacrifice to that dreadful trail which during the Klondike rush had claimed the lives of thirty five hundred animals In that canyon between White Pass City and the summit during the spring of eighteen ninety eight it was possible to walk long distances on the bodies of dead horses and to this day the line of march is marked by protruding bones indicating the graves of the patient and faithful creatures sacrificed to man s insatiable greed for gold Now you see where the dog food comes from remarked Hugh The accident had occurred a little in front of them and shortly afterwards two men were seen floundering through the soft snow down the side hill to the beaten trail along which the dog teams were pressing You had hard luck Hugh called to them Yes I couldn t keep that blame bell burro from experimenting how near he could go to the side without falling off till at last he got his needings replied one of the drivers Whose outfit were they Rivers and the Canadian Government owns the supplies police stuff They can stand it The two drivers went on down the trail to White Pass City The Canadian Government was evidently not popular The iniquities of the royalty on gold and the grafting current in the Gold Commissioner s office in Dawson were resented As the party progressed up the Pass they found its walls coming closer together making the canyon so narrow that the horse trail on the mountain side appeared directly overhead Numbers of dead cattle appeared by the side of the path telling of the calamities of the trail Veterans of the trail will tell weird tales of horses goaded by whip and burden deliberately throwing themselves into the canyon below seeking surcease from suffering in death As the canyon became narrower so did the trail become more congested It also grew steeper as they neared the summit and men and dogs had frequently to pause for rest It appeared to John a curious struggling mass that surrounded him strange oaths in all accents came to his ears The multitude were striving in a race in which brute force alone could conquer They came to a party in trouble and overheard an argument I tell you the territory clear through to Lake Bennett belongs to the United States and I m convoy for the United States Customs I ain t going to let you get over the summit until you pay my wages for four days more that is two days from the summit to Lake Bennett loaded and two days back again from Bennett to Skagway travelling light and that s going some too It amounts to thirty two dollars at eight dollars per day so all you ve got to do is pay up No you don t own the land beyond the summit Don t you see the English flag up there that red thing flying from the tent pole All you ve got to do is show me over the summit and we re quits I ve paid you forty dollars already three days doing nothing at White Pass City during the storm and you lost the money playing Black Jack I ain t got any more money to pay you anyway I can t pay you when I ain t got the money Well dig for it sell part of your outfit You can t bluff me I m an officer of the United States Customs and I m on to my job More grafting muttered Hugh So it was that these convoys armed with authority more or less real harassed and blackmailed the victims They were now near the summit in the midst of the last struggle which would put them over the most difficult portion of the trail and the excitement was general There was a deal of shouting and a great renewal of effort The horse trail and the lower trail merged into one At last they were through The narrow defile curved to the right an open basin appeared with strewn tents and an endless promise of supplies and most conspicuous of all side by side the flags of Britain and the United States were flying A dozen members of the Canadian Mounted Police wearing the uniform of England s Queen were examining freight with their backs to the wind or passing in and out of a tent half buried in snow which served as an office This was the second great depot out from Skagway and piled about everywhere were loads of freight Outfits stood about in disorder awaiting the returning tide of men while constantly teams were arriving from or setting out to Bennett The outfit of Hugh and his companions was finally passed by eleven o clock Goods of Canadian manufacture were allowed to pass free and the charges against the few American goods were of no great amount Hugh selected a projecting rock on which to make his cache and the policeman who examined his baggage and whose good offices the party had won promised to keep an eye on their goods Soapy doesn t operate on this side said the man in uniform significantly We could coast back in half an hour if the trail was clear Hugh remarked as they started on the return As it was they sat on the sleigh most of the way to White Pass City which they reached at noon as a man was pounding a great triangle of steel with an iron rod announcing dinner The three were very well pleased with their morning s work There were not quite so many teams on the trail in the afternoon and they reached the summit by half past three The sun had been shining all day so that the atmosphere seemed mellower and the wind did not blow so strongly After passing the goods they had time to climb the ridge on which the police tents were erected From thence they gazed down the valley which they knew was the uppermost watershed of the mighty Yukon whose course makes a great curve of twenty four hundred miles ere it flows into the Behring Sea Far in the distance they could see a stunted growth of timber but their immediate surroundings were mountains hardly less overpowering than in White Pass City The view impressed them the scene was weird in its desolation they felt that stirring incidents were to take place in that great valley before them Looks as if we would have a touch of spring to morrow and I guess we had better have our snow glasses ready before we set out said Hugh CHAPTER VIII OVER THE SUMMIT Hugh s prediction came true for on the morning following a gentle breeze was blowing from the south soft with the touch of spring The first light that came over the mountains was a softening blue Roll out and get the kinks out of you fellows we ve got to be first on the trail to day They had breakfast the dogs were harnessed and the party on the march by half past four Though the light was uncertain it was not hard to keep the trail By six they were at the summit greeting the police sentinel who had been on guard there through the night and marvelling at the wealth of colours that lit the eastern sky Mush The dogs were off The sleigh slid down upon the frozen plain of Summit Lake The lightness with which it glided along seemed to assure the party that their troubles were over As the dogs trotted along it required a pace faster than a walk to keep up with them so Hugh induced his two companions to sit on the load saying that he would take a ride after a while At nine they reached Log Cabin passed without a halt it being merely a police depot used for cutting firewood though it had been the Customs post before the Canadian Government had asserted proprietary rights to the summit Almost invariably when greetings were exchanged with those met on the trail the humour played about Soapy Say you re hustling I guess you ain t chechachoes How s Soapy going to run for President next trip I guess so if he ain t hung in the meantime Looks like that he was the whole thing in the Passes As the party at one o clock drew into Bennett they saw one party eating dinner in the open with sleigh loaded and dogs harnessed beside them A pile of spruce boughs denoted where these strangers had slept and where their tent now drawn up on their sleigh had been erected Moving camp asked Hugh Yes I don t suppose you re going to take your location away with you I guess not Then it will just suit us and we can use your fire This is what I call lucky said Hugh as he began unlashing the load and throwing the bundles of supplies on the spruce bed George was busying himself undoing the supplies while John replenished the fire George cooked bacon Hugh mixed flour baking powder and water for slap jacks the large pancakes of the frontier As they worked Hugh re opened conversation with the strangers Where s your new location Down the lake five miles Got wind of a good bunch of timber there and hauled a load down this morning One of our fellows stayed down making camp while us two came back for the rest of the stuff How long have you been coming from Skagway Three weeks a week here and two weeks getting over the Pass Contracted with a fellow to put through our stuff at thirty cents a pound but finally had to buy dogs and haul it ourselves And then the storms have been something fearful up to the last few days sort of Dakota blizzard every day almost after which trails was mighty bad hauling This sort of weather comes hard on a fellow who was reared in California I guess it would come hard on a fellow reared at the North Pole You fellows will have your boat built in lots of time Yes if we don t take to quarrelling like the rest of the blame fools around here What are those fellows doing here Hugh nodded to the great array of tents spread over the sand hills that lie between Lake Bennett and Lake Lindeman Most of them don t know what they are doing but I guess they put in their time quarrelling Old Moss backs from the East who have lived neighbours all their lives and been best of friends have come up here partners and before they got through the Passes were calling each other the names they heard used by the old timers to their dogs It takes the police all their time settling disputes The habit seems to have took all round now that they are through their troubles and have only straight hard work whip sawing lumber ahead of them Why say I saw two fellows the other day dividing their outfit They took a two faced axe and drove it into a log and with the face sticking up and a hammer they cut a whip saw in two making it no good for either and swearing at each other all the time till you could smell sulphur They cut stoves in two and boats after working hard to build them It seems a new kind of bughouse that has got hold of them The strangers were now washing up their dishes and packing them away Here take this hand me a plate and one of them poured some stewed prunes out of a pot and from another emptied into a second plate beans and bacon But you fellows could take these along protested Hugh No we couldn t they d get spilled besides we have some beef steak for supper Some fellows down near the lake killed an ox this morning and you can get steak for six bits per pound if it ain t all gone Good bye The strangers went off down the hill to the lake Pipes were lit and the three lay in the sun smoking The day was glorious and the party had removed their snow glasses so that they were able to view their surroundings to the full Mountains gleamed and glistened everywhere in the distance but did not appear so overpowering or inspiring as in the Pass though more beautiful How pure the air seemed and spotless the snow Though the sun was warm and the party comfortable there were duties to be performed so not without groans Hugh and his friends started to erect camp After the tent was up Hugh put pots of beans prunes and rice on to boil the rice being for the dogs as there was small prospect of getting dead horse in Bennett After the bed had been made and the supplies stored in the tent and more wood cut there was nothing to be done so Hugh went off among the tents on a mooch round with an eye for beef steak George acting as cook stayed at home John also went sight seeing He took a different trail from his friend crossed to the west side of the stream that led from Lake Lindeman to Lake Bennett and walked in the direction of a smoke stack the local saw mill half a mile distant As he strolled through the array of tents he heard angry voices proceeding from one of them I tell you he s no good one was shouting I had to pull most all the way up the Chilkoot him saying he had rheumatism backache toothache heartburn everything but the mumps for them I could see An then when we did get over the summit it s me who had to do all the pulling It s a lie you re a low dog and didn t I have to take whisky along before you d travel at all I tell you mister Policeman he s no good he s a skunk and I wouldn t take a skunk into Dawson with me not if I never got there nor never saw the million dollar claim I guess I m going to get if ever I get there John passing beside the tent could see the two disputants each seated on a log of wood with a red coated policeman standing in front of them Well said the policeman if you fellows can t get on together the only thing to do is split up the outfit and each take what belongs to him I own the whole outfit said the man with the many diseases No you don t I own the tent the stove the sleigh and a whole lot of the grub shouted the other John passed on Another petty problem for the Mounted Police They are great men great workers those yellow legs There were some industrious prentices at Lake Bennett for down along the shore were numerous groups of men building boats Like beef steak asked Hugh as John returned Yes rather A big frying pan with sizzling meat was busy on the little tin camp stove Keep an eye on the meat John while I get some water Hugh took a pail and went off to the river George Bruce was away with an axe getting wood so John was left in charge Shortly afterwards George came along hauling a log of firewood by an axe driven into it John ran to assist him and when the two had returned with the wood Hugh was arriving with the water John again turned his attention to the frying pan the largest piece of steak was gone What has happened to the steak John asked Hugh looked A grim smile came over his face Dude Dude could not steal steak out of a frying pan Not Dude You bet your life that s where the steak has gone to And there is no use licking him the only way to cure Dude of stealing is to cut his tail off behind his ears I told you Dude would rather steal than eat and this shows how careful you must be Dude was lying a picture of innocence on the snow How he could maintain an appearance of unconcern with a broiling hot beef steak inside him was a marvel John looked at him amazed the smallest slit of a black eye was watching him I was only away about three minutes Half a minute is enough for Dude He likes beef steak Hugh refilled the pan and then civilization knows no artifice to better the enjoyment of such a meal They were partakers too of another repast their souls were fed by the glories of nature the sun was setting its splendour spread from high in the heavens to the rugged range that yesterday had resisted them On that vast canvas were painted salmon coloured clouds with long ribbons of yellow bearing the lustre of burnished gold It was the extreme of grandeur awe inspiring and ennobling The evening was very still CHAPTER IX STORM AND STRESS It was five o clock on the morrow before the party was up and six o clock before breakfast cooked and eaten John and Hugh were on the road to the summit They were to travel the twenty miles there and return with one thousand pounds of supplies The glow of the sun was already upon the mountains when they set out Say it s going to be a hot day and it s going to thaw some It ll make hauling easy but our feet will be pretty wet good thing we ve got some dry socks and rubbers in our outfit at the summit Another thing is we re going to meet a whole lot of fellows on the trail the way we re going to day and what s worse we ll get more of them coming back Sure enough after they left Log Cabin they could see the toilers coming winding in a snake like procession among the hills Hugh had prophesied correctly By eleven o clock they were in their shirt sleeves The dazzling whiteness of the snow reflected from all sides made the use of smoke glasses necessary but the perspiration dimming the glass troubled their sight The end of John s nose became painful his cheeks burned It reminded him of the after effects of his first sunny spring day on the water in England They met and passed scores of teams and still more were pouring over the summit when they arrived there at one o clock It was half past two before they had their feet encased in German socks and rubber shoes and their load ready again for the trail We can t make home before dark but we should be able to make Log Cabin by seven after which the trail will be clear and we should arrive by ten This trail will be mighty good going after it starts to freeze which it will do soon as the sun goes down At four o clock they were three miles on the trail There was already frost in the air Ere another half hour had passed Hugh felt his cheek smitten by a gust of wind laden with particles of ice I thought so he exclaimed these last few days have shown too large a pay streak of spring to last We re in for trouble It will be down on us in half an hour All we can do is to keep on as we are going steadily I guess we shall make Log Cabin but not with this load The soft snow makes a thousand pounds too much for the dogs Look He pointed to a miniature cyclone coming along the trail drinking up the ice particles as it whirled It struck them sharply as a gust of wind The first contact of the storm was cold and cutting then the wind veered and down came the snow The sleigh was soon too heavy The only thing is to cache the sleigh and turn the dogs loose the chances are we won t be able to keep the trail in this storm and if we do come out alive we won t be able to find the sleigh if we abandon it far from the trail Do you think the storm will be very bad It s bad now ain t it How long will it be before there is eighteen inches of snow on this trail For a time we can keep it by feeling it hard under us but we are liable to get off it and once lost there is no finding it again Mind the wind is blowing from the right half to the rear Here s a tree I ve noticed this lone spruce before and we can find it again Let us stand the sleigh up against it and turn the dogs loose So to the tree dogs and men struggled the dogs were unhitched harness was piled on top of the load Then with a great effort the men managed to up end the load against the tree Hugh called Dude to him and pulled an old envelope out of his pocket on which he scratched Cached sleigh on north side of trail by spruce tree five miles from the summit Hugh Spencer This he tied to a handkerchief and that to Dude s collar It s no harm letting George know where the grub is for if we don t find camp again Dude will The dogs went Dude leading and were soon lost to sight Down the trail the two men strode The snow was six inches deep already the wind piling it upon the trail The weather did not feel cold in fact both were comfortably warm For an hour they plodded along Occasionally one would plunge into the soft snow and scramble back on to the beaten trail Conversation was not much indulged in The light began to fail yet they stumbled along There was nothing they could recognize in the boulders and cliffs that loomed around them in a deathly monotony For half an hour darkness was upon them when Hugh remarked that Log Cabin could not be far away Immediately following his remark they plunged into soft snow The trail seemed to have come to an end but this could not be so They retraced their steps and regained firm footing They felt cautiously around with their feet but could find the underlying snow hard only in the direction whence they came I guess we re off the trail and have walked along a bank where the wind has packed the old snow good and hard Looks to me as if we was lost Don t give up said John Give up I ain t giving up but we re lost I won t give up as long as I can wiggle What had we better do Keep moving If you don t you freeze Spencer s voice was low and serious as he said Keep the wind on your right side and if you ve got any last will and testament to make scratch it on a piece of paper and leave it in your pocket before your hands get numb or your mind weak We re up against it hard We will stay together of course but should we get separated don t move too fast or you will tire yourself out and go to sleep in the snow Don t let sleep take hold of you or you re dead Just keep moving fast enough to keep warm or at least from freezing go down hill rather than up and don t fall over a cliff Have you ever been up against a life and death proposition If not you are pretty near one now They proceeded on their uncertain journey but were soon floundering in soft snow They kept on It was easy enough to say keep going down hill but so far as John was concerned he seemed to be walking up hill all the time They frequently exchanged shouts and so remained together For hours they plodded on the snowfall growing less but the cold greater John began to act to call mechanically His mind in that desolate trampling was transported to happier places He thought of his Alice Peel She was probably he mused thinking of him also Did her mind ever picture such experiences as he was now realizing She would possibly read in the newspapers of the great rush of gold seekers over those terrible mountains and through the stormy passes If he should die in that storm and months afterwards she heard of his demise The thought drifted along to several loose ends He must not sleep or he would die and it was his duty to live but oh to sleep His father and the old school the church services How much he would like to hear the old organ and the choir It had been the family wish that he should take Holy Orders and he had refused the vocation feeling it not his Had he done right He believed yes He might be about to meet his Creator What might his record be His mind went back to an occasion in Australia when he had been lost in the Bush and had wandered for days without water till some blacks found him He remembered before going into unconsciousness with his back against a rock that a vulture was watching him He had taken a piece of stone and pretending it was a pistol had pointed it at the bird John Berwick s mind was picturing sand and heat while above him roared the Arctic storm How cold it was getting and the wind was beginning to blow The parka did not sufficiently protect his face Hugh shouted out that they were crossing a lake and there might be a camp along its edge They came in due course to the other side of the lake with the cliff so steep they could not climb it They followed the shore to the right facing the storm They crossed another lake and still another The air had grown intensely cold the wind was higher and ever there came that terrible inclination to lie down and sleep After they had passed over the last little lake Hugh shouted to John that they were surely now far from the proper trail as he could recollect no such water near Bennett Lake Lindeman was four miles long The wind was rising and the increasing cold told that it came from the north Hugh began now really to doubt whether they would live through the storm Soon afterwards fine ice crystals impinged against their faces Great swirls of wind fell upon them This new severe onslaught of nature aroused John who called to his comrade He had suddenly realized how very very close they were to death The snow is going it s easier walking he said suddenly They closed together and struggled along abreast They were too nearly dead to notice that the going was good Suddenly John fell into the soft snow and Hugh exerting his worn powers dragged him back The trail the trail gasped John with his face close to Hugh s Trail we ain t been on any trail for hours Feel with your feet Hugh stopped to feel with his feet two runner tracks of horse sled Hope came to them made a great call to their resources Meanwhile their tired hearts and very weary bodies endured the bombardment of the snow laden wind which seemed to penetrate them taking the heat of life from their vitals They came to another lake How the wind cut The snow driven over the surface of the ice gave a hard grinding noise Would ever they come to the end of that pitiless journey Bang They stumbled against a sleigh standing in the middle of the road Hugh kicked at it the singletree rattled he recognized the sound He gave a desperate shout another and another Then at last the promise of relief and of life came to them They smelt smoke Just for a second that creosotic odour was to them as sweetest perfume It meant life warmth comfort human companionship The figure of a man with a lantern loomed up before them and a deep voice asked What s the matter We re lost said John No you re not you re right here on Crater Lake just over the summit of the Chilkoot Thank God said Hugh We re the police come inside They staggered into a tent warmed by a tin stove on which was a pot of coffee The man quickly produced cups and gave them to drink John Berwick just fell on a pile of wood stacked near the stove and fell asleep Now that the great struggle against the elements which force of personality rather than strength of limbs had carried him through was over he collapsed When the policeman returned with bread and meat for them he found Hugh removing his friend s shoes and brushing the snow from his legs Let him sleep said Hugh In far away London at that very hour in England high noon Alice Peel was walking down Regent Street Her spirits were restless The bustling traffic the interest of the shops the passing of the people could not keep her thought from a far wanderer She was weary of this ordered civilization and remembering John in his adventures heard the call of the wilds There was now a possibility for this yearning to be satisfied Her father Surgeon Major Peel had lost his money through a sudden misfortune and had been prompted by the news from the Klondike also to make a bid for fortune there not as a gold seeker but in his own profession He was convinced that a hospital in that desperate region would be in all ways a good venture Alice had determined to accompany him To her that spring morning even with all the fever of restlessness in her blood was full of hope The soft air and the sunshine were conditions how different from those endured by Berwick and his comrade in their life and death march CHAPTER X AN EMPIRE S OUTPOST After two hours of solid sleep the blanket was lifted from the exhausted gold seekers and they were shaken back into life Get up and eat you need it Still aching in every bone the two poor fellows staggered to their feet A dim light was penetrating the canvas as they looked about them Underneath was ice the frozen surface of Crater Lake on which were spread piles of blankets the beds of the police Notwithstanding the fire the air of the tent was chill and frosty and the canvas flapped in the wind The walls of the tent were dark showing the level of the snow around them The presence of this snow no doubt explained how the tent had withstood the fury of the gale The policeman led the way to the cook tent where they were given bacon and slap jacks Can t make bread here and don t get it very often from Dyea and we re just out now apologized the policeman who acted as cook While they were eating ravenously the officer in command of the post called to see them and inquired if they were any the worse for their experiences Hardly salubrious the climate eh he said after they had answered his particular questions On several occasions we have had the tents blown down and frequently the men had to sit up all night holding the poles to prevent a catastrophe I must say our fellows have shown great grit under most trying circumstances You see we are on a civil campaign here and there is not the excitement of fighting to keep the men up With that the officer left the tent A policeman glanced after him and muttered Civil campaign Hear the old man talk We re holding down the blooming Passes for the Queen That s what we re doing We could live in comfort at Lindeman with all the wood we want for cabins and to burn Where do you get your wood Down the trail when we get any at all They send a horse up from Lindeman The last few days the trail has been pretty good and some teams have been hauling from there to here but we got only one load which won t last us through the storm if it holds much longer Do you collect much duty here Well rather The old man just dumps the money he takes in a leather sack and the other day he had thirty five thousand dollars in it but he hasn t got that much now He sent one of the fellows down to Skagway with it It was rather risky for all the hard cases travelling the Passes got to know the sack and there was a good deal of risk of the fellow getting shot but he went through the whole gang and got on the boat at Dyea and crossed to Skagway The man had pluck Yes but human nature in many ways is alike in both red skin and white men and the police have learned to do these sort of things Down on the plains in the old days when the savages were mean it was often the case that one or two policemen would ride into a reservation arrest a red skin and take him away with hundreds of armed Indians yelling around them The Indians thought the police were crazy and it is against their religion to kill a crazy man I guess if Soapy recognized the sack he thought it was a job of some kind Do as many men come over this Pass as over the White Pass More The Chilkoot is the poor man s Pass Most of the fellows who come over here haul their own stuff and pack it over the summit or hire the Siwashes to put it to the summit and haul from here themselves They get it up here and then when they get a fine day run it through to Lindeman or Bennett where they build their boats An outfit is putting in an aerial tram that is a cable from the foot of the big hill to the top This summit is too steep for horses Oh yes It s as much as an ordinary man wants to climb it light and it s much worse with a pack on your back though a Siwash staggered up the other day with a cask of tar weighing three hundred and fifty pounds The sad part of it was that then he could not get his five cents a pound for his work at least he came to one of our fellows who told him to hide the barrel in the snow and not show the owner where it was till he got his money Wait till you see the hill It is one of the most remarkable sights I fancy ever seen in the world s history thousands of men toiling in line up nine hundred feet of almost perpendicular ascent for what to be given a chance of drowning themselves in the Yukon or of dying of disease in the Dawson country The time came for the evening meal but the storm still raged outside and the weather remained cold It would be hard to conceive more miserable surroundings The heat given out by the stove was scarcely felt six feet away and the icy floor snow walls and flimsy roof sapped the body s heat Darkness came and bed time Two policemen offered to share their bed with the guests so that the strangers had somewhere to lay their heads It appeared to John that he had just fallen to sleep when he was awakened by the sentry calling to all hands to dress as water was overflowing the ice and coming into the tent So up all hands got hastily dressing in the frosty atmosphere By the uncertain light of a few flickering candles water was to be seen entering the tent and what was the best move was a matter of discussion till one policeman suggested that sleighs be hauled into the tent and the beds built on them This was done but not before a good portion of the bedding had become wet Let any one who desires a picture of the hardships which policemen and civilians went through in those dreadful Passes imagine the poor fellows living in tents with water six inches deep within a storm surging without and the thermometer many degrees below freezing point It was three more days ere the wind ceased to blow and for those three days the police and their guests existed under distressing conditions At the end of the three days milder weather came but the water still remained on the ice so that it was plain the camp must be moved Preparations were being made to do this when John and Hugh bade their kindly hosts good bye CHAPTER XI ANOTHER PASS John and Hugh could not resist the temptation of looking at the far famed Chilkoot Pass ere they turned for the last time from the Great Divide So they mounted the steep ascent from Crater Lake to the summit Reaching this they found a great array of caches or drifts of snow the formation of which suggested a cache beneath them A half dozen policemen were levelling the new site for their tents A desperate situation for an encampment said John but there was no other Looking down the Pass it presented a picture like nothing so much as a great funnel with the side towards the sea broken out Through this passage from the sea a long line of ant like figures human beings each laden with his load was pouring towards them The town of Lindeman was reached at three o clock at five they arrived at Bennett Dude rose up from his bed on the snow and looked at them but the four other dogs were bundles of fur before the camp refusing to give even a silent welcome Hurrah cried Bruce here you are at last I knew you would turn up safe and sound so stayed home to have something hot ready The two were ready for another meal and as George had set up the camp stove in the tent they were comfortable As soon as his partners had started on the morning of the storm George had set to work and put up the stove in the tent and for the balance of the day till the storm came had been cutting firewood with no other idea than to keep busy And great was his reward for he had enough to do and to think of to keep him supplied during the storm and the severe weather that followed Then at seven or eight o clock after the snow had been falling several hours a low wail came from outside the tent door Dude You got the note on Dude s collar inquired Hugh Yes but I didn t go after the grub being too anxious about you That was right The chechachoes will have the trail beaten for us to morrow I only sent it in case we did not turn up which we came pretty near not doing How have your neighbours been getting on doing much quarrelling No they have had too much trouble keeping warm and have limited their disputes as to who should go out into the storm and cut wood They weren t as lucky as I in having a good supply at hand How the wanderers appreciated their warm bed under the lynx skin robe that night for in their late abode the chill of the ice and water had seemed to penetrate to their bones The next day Hugh took a piece of canvas and with a needle fashioned a sail after which he fixed a mast in the front of the sleigh and set the sail You see he explained when spring sets in the wind generally blows from the south and we might as well make it work for us As it did when they started on the morning following A breeze from the south filled the sail and helped the sleigh over the frozen surface of Lake Bennett It was three o clock and as they were close upon the end of March the days were lengthening wonderfully so that they had not been an hour on the trail when daylight came As the light increased so did the wind which relieved the dogs of almost all the weight of the load The trail was good and by eleven o clock they had travelled the twenty miles to Caribou Crossing the site of the present town of Car Cross Here Hugh called a halt declaring they had done a good day s work and that the recently abandoned camping ground at which they then were was too good to pass So the dogs were unhitched and their evening meal put to boil While this was in process the tent was erected and the bed made The second day out from Lake Bennett was much like the first and so it was until the fourth day when they reached Miles Canyon and the White Horse rapids From Lake Bennett they passed Windy Arm to Tagish Lake and on Marsh Lake which followed they got more away from the mountains when their range of vision became greater When they arrived at the foot of Marsh Lake which merged into Miles Canyon they found a number of men putting in a tramway over which horses would haul freight when navigation opened thus covering the five miles and avoiding the danger of the canyon and the rapids They hauled their load along the route of the tramway to below the rapids where the waters of the Yukon are known as the Fifty Mile River Here they found a number of men building boats but they kept steadily on Below White Horse Rapids fewer men were on the trail Some they met were travelling south gaunt and haggard unshaven uncouth loud of voice and wild of eye These men had travelled the long trail from Dawson five hundred miles it was and the heavy toil and hard food had told on their minds and natures The party covered the fifteen miles from White Horse to where the Fifty Mile enters Lake Le Berge when the crust had become so soft that they could not travel so they camped Recently the trail had taken on new conditions that of standing higher than the snow on either hand like the back of a great serpent The fact was that the general level of snow was settling under the warmth of the sun while the trail being packed hard remained as it was The tent was up and the bed made by noon Hugh planned that the party should go to bed at three and hit the trail again at midnight There would be no wind to aid them further for as they left the coast range the diurnal breeze had failed Their own efforts and those of the dogs must haul the load the final stage of thirty miles to the foot of Lake Le Berge where they were to build their boat They ate their dinner and spread spruce boughs over which they placed their blankets and enjoyed a rest in the glorious sunlight The view from the tent was beautiful To the north lay the stretch of the lake on either hand of which were great rounded hills all dazzling white To the south far distant were heavy ranges of mountains The air was that of peace and hope and seemed full of promise of the glorious summer soon to burst over this vastness of solitude melting the snows and flooding the hillsides with floral beauty Presently they saw two black specks crossing the frozen lake far beneath which eventually proved to be two human figures approaching one some distance behind the other The first was hauling a sled slowly and evidently with difficulty Hugh at once acted He put the kettle to boil and filled a frying pan with beans and bacon I guess those fellows coming up the lake will need a little grub when they get here he explained at least they can drink tea if they are too plumb played out to eat The actions of the leading man were very erratic Frequently he would stop place his hand before his eyes and when again he endeavoured to start would stagger plunging into the softened snow which broke under him bringing him to the knees Snow blind was Hugh s comment The stranger seemed to smell the smoke from the camp fire and gave a wild Hullo The three answered the call He turned towards the sound and when he saw the camp he shook himself free of the harness and plunged through the soft snow towards it When he saw the blankets stretched before the tent he threw himself on them at full length and with his fingers at his eye sockets groaned Sympathy being often better expressed by doing nothing the man was left in his misery for some ten minutes Hugh then poured him out a cup of tea to which was added much sugar and condensed milk The man raised his head at a word and showed his blackened face made horrible by the streaks of tears and perspiration He drank the refreshment greedily Hugh explained the man s curious appearance This fellow has been taking a leaf out of the Siwash s book in blackening his face The black saves the eyes a whole lot from the glare of the sun The campers turned their attention to the second traveller now plainly in sight and noticed that the pack on his back jolted him horribly as he broke through the trail at every third or fourth step As he wore glasses he was evidently not in distress from his eyes He saw the camp staggered to it and threw himself down pack and all sitting with his back against the load He stared at the man in agony on the blankets Hello there s Bill Ha I told the blame fool not to travel without glasses Wake up Bill and tell us your dreams How s that wife you re so struck on outside and you in such a hurry to give your dust to Ho Bill wake up As the prostrate man gave no sign of hearing his hilarious companion turned to the others and in more moderate tones continued Bill and me have come from Dawson together and he has near killed himself me too trying to get out and see his wife and kids and this morning nothing would do him but he must go and tramp on his glasses and bust them I told him to lay up to day and travel to night but he wouldn t Must keep moving to get to his wife Ha Wife be damned I ain t got no wife Hugh interrupted the tirade Have some beans Sure thing Beans yes nothing like beans on the trail besides I don t mind eating your beans seeing my own grub pile is most petered out Just a little flour and baking powder left not much good to travel on The man fell to eating His manner turned from hilarity to morosity He bolted his food Soon his companion on the blankets moved and gasped Don t let that hog eat all the beans I want some Ha I thought Bill wasn t dead you re just a bluffer ain t you Bill Say Bill let s turn round and go back to Dawson We can travel along with these fellows they have lots of grub and we can buy off them It was evident to John and his friends that if the first stranger was the worse affected in physical condition the second was mentally the more upset The snow blinded sufferer raised himself and took from Hugh the plate of beans and a second cup of tea This man ate slowly while his partner continued to talk You see me and Bill came from Dawson together and when we got to Thirty Mile we found it open and the blame sleigh was always sliding into the open water I wanted Bill to chuck the sleigh and pack our grub and blankets but Bill wouldn t So I says I ll pack my half and you can haul your half and that s the way we ve been coming Bill had a hell of a time with his sleigh sliding into the river and then coming up the lake he never could keep it on the trail No wonder he s bughouse seven seven Crazy When the first arrival had finished his meal Hugh led him into the tent and bathed his eyes with fresh made tea In the tent the sufferer was free from the glare of the sun Hugh hung a dark grey blanket from the ridge pole so that if the sufferer opened his eyes he could fix his gaze upon it Then he went out How s Bill asked the erratic one Better I hope Not bughouse yet I don t think so Well if he ain t bughouse he is sure locoed on that wife of his Hugh made no reply and the other continued Ha that s Bill Stanbridge owns in on Eldorado with Slim Mulligan who s in charge now and will look after the clean up My name is Frank Miller just blew in about the time Carmack made discovery but went and used my rights on Boulder Creek Boulder showed up better on surface than Bonanza or Eldorado but there s nothing on bed rock in Boulder As the man got his mind away from his partner his conversation indicated less disorder of intellect Hugh quickly noticing the change and with a view to further the good process asked How s Dawson Dawson She s fine Lots of grub Old Healey gave the boys a speel last fall that they d all starve if they stayed in the country and then the speculators corralled all the grub and run up prices but they re loosening now You can get a pretty good meal of beans now for two dollars and a half even at Miss Mulrooney s Say that girl is making money How s Bonanza Good but Eldorado is better Bill s go ground some of it going five hundred dollars to the pan for picked dirt But this high grade pay The Government is going to send their yellow legs round to relieve the boys of ten per cent and fellows with poor ground will have to pay as well as the fellows on Eldorado That ain t fair It s fair to charge for the administration of the country and keeping law and order said George To hell with law and order You re a chechacho or you wouldn t talk like that Miners meetings make pretty good law courts and now they have law and order fellows begin to lock their doors The country was a whole lot better before ever it saw an official Yes but the gang going in now will make things different said Hugh You re an old timer Thought so when I first swallowed your beans Chechachoes don t know how to boil beans like that You ll find a big change round Rabbit Creek when you blow in there It s gamblers and saloon men most have the good claims Of course Carmack had to put his wife s relations in next to him on discovery and when the crowd got up from Forty Mile they staked on Boulder Gulch and Adams Gulch Neither any good but say they ve got Dawson a hot town He laughed Games running night and day all the fun you want but no gun play the yellow legs will put you on the wood pile right away quick if ever you make a break and it ain t no fun to be sawing wood at forty below with a yellow legs and a Winchester standing over you for the glory of the Queen of England Frank Miller s mind was lapsing CHAPTER XII A NEW PARTNER Frank Corte stood at the door of his kitchen and with a large smile eyed the coming of the party The new comers were evidently going to build their boat at the foot of Le Berge and already he had favourably sized them up There were many tents pitched around the cabin where Frank distributed the necessities of human sustenance but Dude s instincts drew him to the kitchen and down he and his canine followers flopped before the door Well well fine dogs nice day strangers Going to build boat here yes thought so Thirty Mile is open to the Hootalink and the Lewis is getting holes in it Early spring sure Frank s heart was hospitable but the cost of grub was high moreover the grub he cooked was not his He was debating how far his hospitality could go Frank Corte was a Hungarian by birth and a citizen of the United States of America which he proudly announced as opportunity offered He was over six feet tall with long arms stooping shoulders and an angular form His physical strength was enormous there was a wealth of native kindness in his heart His chief diversion was argument in which thanks to his study of the Bible and a small besmeared pocket edition of Webster s Dictionary he was rather effective He could argue with any one or even on necessity address his convictions to the little red haired female dog that was ever at his heels Frank thought the world of Fanny Say fellows it s against orders to feed pilgrims though I guess you ain t altogether tenderfeet but if you wants to boil your tea and cook grub on my stove you re welcome Come right in and cook up No thanks said Hugh though I guess I will leave the team here and mooch round and get a good camping place I guess we ll be here three weeks and might as well set up our tent in a good place We re not hungry That s right and you can t have a better camping ground than right over against that bunch of spruce Frank was interested in these strangers and his desire for news stimulated his hospitality so he continued Come right in and feed up and look for your camping ground after Days are getting long now Hugh hesitated and then accepted Frank put on more wood to which the tin stove quickly responded How s Soapy he inquired Fine replied Hugh hold ups galore The people of Skagway have a murder nearly every morning for breakfast Say what a time Soapy would have if they only let him operate around Dawson wouldn t he make a killing But them police They don t have any more excitement beyond the games and dance halls in Dawson than they do outside That s no mining camp for a country like this and the crowd what s inside there now I don t like to see too much killing but a hold up now and again is interesting besides these rich claim owners can stand it A fellow was telling me that it was nothing to see the Big Moose eight coming into Dawson last summer with ten or twenty thousand dollars tied to his saddle and him without a guard Say we re going to have a squaw dance Friday night in the dining room here will you come One of our fellows has an accordion and we ll have fine music Only four bits a dance I m going to try and get some hootch There s nothing like hootch to get the squaws on the move if the yellow legs don t get on to it They soak you like the devil if they catch you at it though Say how s Uncle Sam getting on licking them there Spaniards he ll do them up in about three weeks I d like to be outside to go to the Philippines After he gets through with the Spaniards he s going to come in and take Canada and here Frank stole side glances at Hugh s companions but his instincts of hospitality stayed him from this his favourite joke eight Indian name for the late Alexander mc donald Say where did you get those dogs Fine team Three I got inside the others in Skagway I thought you was no chechacho You come from Uncle Sam s country don t you I come from all over what s this outfit you re with Jack Haskins is building two scows to take down some freight he hauled in over the ice He has me cooking for him though I could get two hundred fifty dollars in Dawson for the same job He only pays me one hundred fifty dollars per month but I ll soon be in with the best of them Say if you fellows is going to build a boat I ll ask Jack if you can t use one of his pits He has two and I guess you fellows can get the chance to use one of his pits for all the lumber you want and that will save you building one I m glad you fellows have showed up it will make more company and I hope you ll come to our dance You ll see the squaw camp down the river a bit They re out from Dalton House came out to Tagish visiting some Siwashes there and drifted down here just to take in the sights Are a bit shy though some have picked up a little English Here is another human study thought John as he and his friends moved over to the point suggested for their encampment They found it satisfactory so went back for the dogs Say if you fellows want anything in the way of dishes or if you re real short of any grub maybe I can let you have it on the sly said Frank to the party as they returned his hospitality getting ahead of his morals But Hugh assured him the party was fixed up all right Frank s generosity was of the aggressive kind for as John Berwick s party sat in their tent that evening he stuck his head in at the door and said they could have the use of one of Haskins saw pits on the morrow and probably right along Don t work too hard for I want you to be lively on Friday night Two fellows have just blown in from Dawson and they say the river is full of holes so it is just as well you fellows don t have to build a pit it looks like an early opening maybe about the first of May The river won t open by the first of May but it will before the tenth most likely commented Hugh Next morning the party visited the yard where the scows were building and introduced themselves to mister Haskins who again informed them that the saw pits were at their disposal when he did not require them Ever do any whip sawing asked Haskins Some said Hugh It s no picnic I never found it so How s timber That looks pretty good up the hill there and Hugh pointed to a clump of spruce Yes it s all right but you ll find bigger and clearer stuff higher up and you can mush it down the hill easy I suppose you have your own saw With this the three friends stormed the hill They were to cut the trees and slide them to the bottom after which the dogs would aid in hauling them to the pit The trees Hugh selected were the larger ones clean and free from knots By the close of the day sufficient logs were at the pit A saw pit is a scantling of poles eight feet high on which the logs are placed to be sawn The modus operandi is that one man stands below the log and another on the top the upper man pulls the saw towards him the lower man company operates The work is simplicity itself but very hard The three companions would want from two to three hundred feet of lumber which meant perspiration and backache As Hugh expressed it the upper man is up against about the hardest proposition a white man puts himself at these days About three o clock on the first afternoon of whip sawing Frank Corte appeared with Fanny at his heels George was the upper man and even his elastic muscles were aching at the work Hugh was having a spell off but keeping an eye on his friends Ha how do you fellows like hard work This will teach you to go hunting after gold What have you done with your last summer s wages Say we re going to have a great time at the dance a regular potlatch one of the Sticks has just come in saying he s killed a caribou back on the hills and is going to potlatch it Now if I can only get some hootch I d give ten dollars a bottle for some Better cut the hootch out said Hugh The police may catch you and send you down to Dawson and put you sawing wood for Queen Victoria And it won t be Uncle Sam s men who will be chasing you with a Winchester Yes yes A damned pity Uncle Sam would not come over and take Canada then we should have a camp at Dawson George was very hot and sore and this sort of bantering was new to him He was in that humour which causes a man to go into a fight on little provocation but John he noticed was smiling amicably so he held his peace If this was Uncle Sam s country Soapy would have been here taking away your wages before this laughed Hugh I wouldn t kick if he could do the trick Say can you dance This is going to be a swell dance all right Wish I had enough lumber to cover the floor so we could dance proper Poles is mighty hard to dance on Well I must be going I have some beans boiling Don t you fellows tire yourselves too much sawing lumber so you can t dance to morrow night

none	none	 THE DANCE
5968_61356_000003_000000	train-clean-360	 Are you all set 
5968_61356_000003_000001	train-clean-360	Then dance 
none	none	damn you dance Come on gentlemen get partners for the next Frank Corte s great dance was on Hugh and his companions stood by the door of the dining hall 
5968_61356_000004_000002	train-clean-360	On went the dance and through the atmosphere thick with tobacco smoke the native women were guided their bronzed faces speaking excitement 
none	none	Come on in gentlemen The walls of the room were lined with men 
5968_61356_000006_000001	train-clean-360	Squaws who had not yet learned the dance sat on boxes 
5968_61356_000006_000002	train-clean-360	The three friends crowded into the room and stood with their backs against the wall 
none	none	Frank Corte was beating time with his foot and clapping his hands while he sang the calls in a weird drawl Honours to the right Each man bowed most gravely to his partner who most respectfully returned it Honours to the left Each man bowed to the lady at his left in the quadrille and when Swing your right hand lady dance around the room came the men grabbed their partners and whirled around quarters were too close to permit of any great range of movement and the squaws were so excited they seemed to occupy more room than really they did
5968_61356_000008_000000	train-clean-360	 A la main left All stood to attention 
5968_61356_000008_000001	train-clean-360	 First gent swing the left hand lady with the left hand round 
none	none	Every gentleman turned towards the lady on his left 
5968_61356_000009_000001	train-clean-360	The ladies turned to the right 
none	none	They grasped left hands at the height of their shoulders and pranced round to the left The left hand round Turn your partners with the right hand round The right hand round All chassez First couple lead to the right Four hand round Dos a balnette Right hand to partner and grand dos a balnette Every man took his partner s right hand and wheeled to the right and then her left hand 
5968_61356_000010_000001	train-clean-360	This movement brought them opposite and so they were in a circle at which they balanced the men facing outwards the women inwards 
5968_61356_000011_000000	train-clean-360	 On to the next 
none	none	The men wheeled and with their ladies pivoted to the left then the men took the hand of the ladies next on their right as they swung round The ladies holding the men by the left gave their right hand and at the words dos a balnette all again balanced the men this time facing inwards the ladies outwards
5968_61356_000013_000000	train-clean-360	 On the next again brought the men facing outwards the ladies inwards and so on 
none	none	The quadrille was concluded with
5968_61356_000014_000000	train-clean-360	 Promenade all Around the hall And seat your ladies at the ball 
none	none	The faces of the crowd were wild with excitement 
5968_61356_000015_000001	train-clean-360	The music was weird and discordant 
none	none	Yet John found it all very stimulating Dance after dance was gone through while he stayed and watched till there came to his mind pictures of the old home his father s house in London and Alice Peel Was she thinking of him
5968_61356_000016_000000	train-clean-360	 Say why don t you fellows get in and dance 
none	none	Dreams and fancies were reft away as reality in the person of Haskins of the saw pits stood before John Berwick Then he noticed George laughing at a clumsy mystified squaw a beginner in the dance His hilarity provoked the squaw and as the dance paused for a second between her gasps and through her perspiration she hissed with a look of contempt Che chac Ka Say you fellows will have to get in and dance in this next set 
5968_61356_000019_000001	train-clean-360	I saw a squaw looking at you and saying heap dam dood so if you want to keep your station in society you ve got to dance Haskins was again worrying them 
none	none	All right 
5968_61356_000020_000001	train-clean-360	Who will I ask to dance George was ready 
none	none	Go and ask that squaw sitting in the corner said Haskins pointing across the room 
5968_61356_000021_000001	train-clean-360	She it was who had said Heap dam dood 
5968_61356_000022_000000	train-clean-360	George went and invited her to be his partner 
none	none	Ni ka halo introdux You have not been introduced she answered This was more than George could withstand in gravity He roared with laughter and returned to Haskins He only guessed the meaning of the words so he repeated them to Haskins Who the devil has taught these savages up here chinook It s a special lingo manufactured by the Hudson Bay Company to suit the savages and when white men first came into British Columbia they found the savages with a lingo which was called white man s wa wa and which no person could understand it is easy enough to learn you can pick it up in a week it has only about six hundred words All the old timers in British Columbia talk it Dagoes Chinese Mexicans Swedes all talked it in the old days in Caribou The Siwash calls an Englishman King George man and an American Boston man 
5968_61356_000026_000000	train-clean-360	The squaw in the corner was keeping her eye on George with evident dislike 
5968_61356_000026_000001	train-clean-360	As John noticed this he recommended their departure so George and he went back to bed 
none	none	Hugh arrived home hours later in great glee You fellows will laugh at the Siwashes eh 
5968_61356_000027_000001	train-clean-360	Well you ll get the worst of it 
none	none	George I hear you were not sufficiently formal with one of the klootches squaws and got called down ha ha On the Sunday morning following John left Hugh and George repairing their wardrobe in the tent and was strolling past Frank Corte s kitchen to where the scows were being built Hullo how s the heap dam dood Come in I want to argue with you John looked up and saw the smiling face of Frank at his kitchen door He had no great wish to argue but he loved the study of humanity and realized that Frank was something of a conundrum Corte who was kneading bread took a seat on a box by the kitchen door Say don t you think it would be a good thing for this country if Uncle Sam was really to come over and take it I hope not What s the matter with it as it is
5968_61356_000034_000000	train-clean-360	 Too much police too much law and order you can never have a real live mining camp in Canada 
none	none	That was a pretty good dance you had Friday night Yes it was all right but what a time we would have had if we had had lots of hootch But say that was a good one when the squaw told the other King George man he had not been introduced to her 
5968_61356_000037_000000	train-clean-360	Frank chuckled and then as the prospect of an international argument did not seem good went on another tack 
none	none	Do you believe there is a God A flood of memories surged through Berwick s brain He glanced at the dark sinister features of the man awaiting his reply and then looked at the sunlight Should he give such an answer in such a tone as would discourage further argument 
5968_61356_000040_000002	train-clean-360	No the question was too serious 
none	none	He might not have felt called upon at one time to divulge his belief which in the past had been a burden of much questioning but here it was asked perhaps in levity by one who evidently could not fully believe 
5968_61356_000040_000004	train-clean-360	He felt called upon to answer 
5968_61356_000041_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes I do 
none	none	Corte s face had taken on a strained look Realizing the seriousness with which Berwick regarded the question he feared lest he had hurt the feelings of his guest The answer he received reassured him Removing his big arms from the dough and gesticulating he answered
5968_61356_000043_000000	train-clean-360	 Well partner I don t 
none	none	Now here s the proposition those who say there is a God say what He set out to do The first thing God done was to build the world and after He done this He built a mighty fine ranch and fixed it up Aone and then He puts Adam and Eve into it after having made them He tells them not to eat apples and then He goes and has a snake which tells them to eat apples And because they do eat apples He pulls up the ranch and kicks them out Now there would be no kick coming if He simply turned them loose and made them rustle having to rustle never hurt any man but He brings all sorts of diseases and pains on earth That s what keeps me from believing in God Now look here if God was able to make the earth and the stars and everything why should He not make man and let him enjoy all this seeing that He is doing it all more or less for amusement without putting him in the middle of a lot of good things and then putting up a job on him I ve talked to parsons on this thing and some of them says that after He bust up the home ranch He kind of got sorry and says He would send His Son on earth to die to fix up the big mistake Adam and Eve made in eating one apple 
5968_61356_000044_000002	train-clean-360	Now say 
none	none	If you was doing all this would you after you made man and put him on the earth and he did wrong would you send your son to fix things up so that the crowd would go and nail him to a big wooden cross by driving big stakes through his hands and feet and then stick him up for the crows to peck at If God was not able to make a man the first go off who would stand a mill test why did He not kill him off body and soul and try again without trying to fix things up by making His Son suffer The whole proposition ain t natural And what would you think of a man who if he fell down on any proposition would make his son go and suffer to fix up his mistakes Why did He not come on earth and die on the cross Himself and suffer and turn the earth and all the stars and the rest of it over to His Son to run while He was gone John Berwick was not by nature argumentative having seldom in his life allowed himself to be drawn into any but political controversy 
5968_61356_000045_000001	train-clean-360	He had it is true discussed doctrine at college with his class mates 
none	none	He had read much philosophy and had pondered deeply on the mystery of human suffering the deepest of all mysteries He had weighed the arguments of great minds which wanted belief in God and in his own mind had done much to surmount the difficulty to justify the ways of God to man but the crude intellect before him had launched forth a proposition he could not confute His training in rhetoric and in the drawing of parallels was of use only against the cultured mind The legend of the Saxon king drawing the simile of life from the little bird which flew within the hall firelight and was gone again came to his mind but he put it aside as impotent 
5968_61356_000045_000006	train-clean-360	He did not know what to say he said nothing 
5968_61356_000046_000000	train-clean-360	Frank Corte was working at his bread again his face twitching with a smile 
none	none	And then there s miskities and black flies and moose flies and bull dogs Say wait a month or two till the miskities get busy and then try and figure out how any great and good God would put such things on earth These devils ain t in cities where men is but in the country where the beasts is Have you ever seen a big bull moose going hell bent for election through the bush chased by flies Have you ever shot a bear with his eyes and ears and nose full of flies and the flies sticking all round his eyes enough to drive even a bear plumb crazy Why should God because man went and eat an apple make animals suffer in trying to get even 
5968_61356_000048_000000	train-clean-360	Frank Corte returned to the kneading while John Berwick thoughtfully watched the sun flooded landscape 
none	none	Frank he said after a pause the proof of the pudding is the eating I have never heard any argument quite like yours but man s coming to the world how he came to the world and whether he has a soul have been the greatest subjects of study through the ages We know the Christian religion was taught back to within a few years of the time Christ came on earth and from that time on has got bigger in power and influence over the minds of men so that the majority of civilized people give justice to their fellows because this religion tells them to do so
5968_61356_000050_000000	train-clean-360	 The Bible tells a story of the origin of man which we may or may not believe 
5968_61356_000050_000001	train-clean-360	The Bible says there is a God and God sees best not to explain His schemes and why He makes man and animals suffer 
none	none	I believe there is a God and that God is just and that there is a reason for everything Why not try to believe there is a God rather than argue with yourself and others that there is no God If the Christian belief has made the world so much better as a whole it will make you and me better as single men and I know you would give a man a meal if he wanted it or if a fellow were sick you would help him out all you could and you d expect me to do the same If you saw a fellow drowning in the river you d help him out but the Chinaman who is not a Christian would let him drown You re a Christian all right but you don t know it 
5968_61356_000051_000000	train-clean-360	John paused and would have added something but Frank his face half flushed in confusion his voice less rasping than usual broke in 
5968_61356_000052_000000	train-clean-360	 Say stranger when I first saw you I sized you up along with the Siwashes as a heap dam dood though I didn t like to say it serious like but that s a pretty good talk of yours and sure sounds natural 
none	none	Say is that other King George man with you as good a fellow as you are Say you ve set me thinking Frank had set Berwick thinking too CHAPTER XIV A LONG SHOT Hugh Spencer was working as upper man on the whip saw and an Indian was trying to extract a cartridge from an old and rusty rifle at his camp down the river Suddenly there was a report and Hugh tumbled headlong from his position His friends sprang to his side and found blood spurting from a hole in his neck The flow was not great so that their first feeling of horror was changed to hopefulness John shouted and waved to Haskins whom he saw standing near his scows Haskins came running up was told what had happened and with the single word Wait bolted to his tent He was back again in little more than a minute with a camp bed blankets and all Few words were spoken and those in whispers The injured man was lifted on to the bed and carried to the tent his temporary home George hot water George was off to the cook tent at the word while Haskins got Hugh on his side the wound uppermost and Frank arrived hurriedly Boracic acid out of the medicine bag Frank you light the fire and then take off Hugh s boots It don t look as if it was bad said Haskins when the wound was washed No replied John I don t think the bullet is far in it is the shock that has knocked him out but I have no instruments with which to get the bullet out and even if I were able to draw it it might be followed by a rush of blood I should not know how to stop and then there is the danger of blood poisoning A doctor with his partner is building a boat at White Horse said Haskins Good I ll get him George you know what to do Keep a good watch and when he comes round keep him quiet John left the tent and saw four of the dogs before Frank s kitchen See anything of Dude he called to Frank Yes he was in front of my kitchen all the afternoon Frank looked out of the tent door Say I ve left my door open I bet he s stole something They ran to look Yes a side of bacon s gone Damn that dood heap dam dood he Frank s sense of humour could not be suppressed by any calamity but its expression did not stay his activities He was out of his kitchen and peering into the bushes on the hillside Yes I thought so there he is been up to his cache I located the other day he s done quick work and is coming back Don t call him he ll come quicker without and he may think we want to lick him for thieving Come inside It seemed an age before the reprobate reappeared before the cabin Don t let on you see him but walk by and grab him whispered Frank John followed the instructions and was successful Where s the harness asked Frank With the sleigh at the tent I ll get it Here Two Bits here Four Bits here Tom Jerry and Frank had the team in harness Dude Dude went to his place in the lead Hold on a minute Frank went into the kitchen and returned with half a loaf of bread and some fried bacon in a piece of birch bark Throw this into you as you go How about the dogs Damn the dogs I ve been feeding them all day Mush Dude looked back and did not move Mush He moved ahead at a slow walk Mush damn you John felt surprised to hear himself swear but the dogs were in the condition styled ornery Dude turned in by the side of the building the others followed the sleigh bumped against the corner Frank had Dude by the collar in a moment and was belabouring him over the flank with a stout stick The hills reverberated with howls He hauled the animals back into line and with a kick for good measure said in a cold slow tone Mush Dude trotted off Frank ran by the side of the team till they were on the lake They ll go all right if you once get them away from camp but lick em good and plenty if they turn mean was his counsel on quitting John Berwick was alone with the team on the great expanse of Lake Le Berge Before him to the south lay the thirty mile stretch of ice flanked by rolling hills flooded with opalescent tints and peace For an instant the exceeding beauty of the scene gladdened his mind He was anxious about Hugh There were forty five miles to traverse before he would come to White Horse The dogs were travelling at five miles an hour nine hours before he could reach White Horse and then if the river were open what then The thought of the delay necessitated by a journey overland staggered him It were easier to travel thirty miles on the ice than fifteen through the bush He jumped off the sleigh and ran but the dogs moved no faster and the labour in running would soon exhaust him for while there was no snow on the ice the surface of the lake was a coarse ice sand which constituted a poor foothold The sun was setting already a chill was in the air A crust would form within the hour perhaps the dogs would move faster then These thoughts ran through his mind till his fear developed into a lingering dread He realized that to go through that intolerable process of analyzing the details of his anxiety could only result in futility The surface of the lake became harder he picked up pieces of ice threw them at Dude and shouted Every missile with its accompanying shout brought a merely temporary increase of speed All attempts to get the dogs to gallop proved futile It was three o clock on the following morning when Berwick pounded on the door of the police cabin at White Horse and was greeted sleepily He entered The flicker of a match showed a man in the act of lighting a candle by the head of a bed built against the wall Man shot at the foot of Le Berge bullet in his neck wants doctor The policeman jumped from bed slipped to the door and pointed to a tent by the river side The doctor with his partner live in that tent What is it accident Yes Indian trying to extract a cartridge from an old rifle Damn the Siwashes Same old story Well I have no doubt the doctor will go I guess you ll need some sleep so if those fellows can t put you up return here and you can climb into bed with me John had intended returning to his friend with the doctor but bolted without comment save a mere Thank you There is no process of knocking at a tent door so John used his voice to rouse the occupants What do you want was the gruff response John gave the necessary information Doc then said the man to his unseen companion there s a chance of doing the Good Samaritan act the preachers talk about There was silence for a while as the doctor and his comrade were dressing and preparing then John asked Can I build a fire outside and cook some dog feed If you will let me have some feed I ll return it or pay for it I thought you was a chechacho said the gruff voice You want the Doc to travel quick Certainly And the Doc s taking them dogs home Yes Well don t feed them John Berwick s nature revolted against this theory but he made no protest as the life of his mate was in jeopardy The doctor packed his hand bag and was ready You stay here he said you can do no good down there Roll in and have a sleep Dude was alert but the other dogs were in repose when they were jerked into life again The train moved down the river Fatigued in body and mind Berwick gladly rested and slept CHAPTER XV REVELATION John awoke at five in the afternoon At the first opportunity his new acquaintance began to talk My name s Jim Godson Shorty the boys call me sometimes Long Shorty That s what you call a blooming paradox ain t it Parson I m not a parson Well if you ain t you look as if you ought to be What s your name Oh is it Ain t you got no appellation yet Not as yet Well I ll call you Parson Jack though I guess you look too good a man for a parson Parsons is mostly parsons because they re too lazy to work and you don t act lazy No you ain t lazy not if you are in tow with an old timer Godson s light chatter kept away the sense of apprehension which was ever tending to creep into Berwick s mind Say I knew a parson once that was worth having Yes sir Father Pat was his name and his run was down in the Kootenays A whiter parson never lived than Father Pat Father Pat Was he a Roman Catholic The Roman clergy are not called parsons No sir he weren t no Catholic he was an Angle Anglican and a pretty acute one too He was moseying along a trail down below one day and was just turning off on a side trail leading to a mining proposition up there when three fellows met him who were just naturally full of cussedness How do says Father Pat Where are you going says the fellows I m going up to the mine says Father Pat No you ain t says the fellows But I am says Father Pat We don t want no damned parsons around here says the fellows I can t help that says Father Pat I m going up the hill and if you fellows want to quarrel over it I ll take you one at a time and lick you And he did so Now that s what I call a parson worth having And which of the three were you asked John Me I was the second fellow that got licked yes since then I ve always thought parsons worth looking into The time for departure came Go easy for the first two or three miles Parson forty five miles is a pretty good walk for any fellow who ain t an old timer You re making a mistake not waiting for the dogs will be back here with the doctor even if he has to stay a day or two with your partner but if you re stuck on going I guess I ain t got any string on you Good bye said John and clambered down the river bank to the ice The day had been more than usually warm the air unusually clear the evening frost had come early As Berwick left White Horse it was seven and already the crust had formed He had food in his pockets and the air brought him stimulation Anxiety steeled his muscles Away he strode He passed from the curving river and came again to the frozen stretch of Lake Le Berge The light of day was gone the stars gleamed and danced and shed their glamour over the hills And what dignity they held Greece had risen and gone to decay Caesar had striven after his great ambition Pharaoh had succeeded Pharaoh while those hills had slept as they now were sleeping The influence of his environment closed upon John Berwick The psychic force of the weird Northland was upon him Through his mind passed the orthodox story of creation and again and again as he walked he weighed the various arguments of the agnostic He looked upon the limestone masses to the east and mused upon the ways of Nature which caused the destruction of myriads of shell fish to upbuild the marble of the palace He pictured the diamond in the atomic theory of matter a mass of pulsating atoms oscillating within magnetic bonds even as the stars swing through space guided by the influence which is called gravitation Was not this known movement of the heavenly bodies similar to the theoretic movement of the atom A feeling of apprehension grew in John Berwick faster and faster he walked Life s greatest problems had for years occupied his mind He looked about him and into the heavens Before his fevered eyes the stars shimmered and grew in shape the earth beneath him dwindled and melted till it was but a star and he felt its rush through space He realized the centrifugal force that would throw the world out of its orbit he felt the counteracting restraint system joined to system swinging circling driving the universe grew about him suns and stars were but atoms in a component whole the whole formed into Presence Love God It came to him as a mighty magnificent discovery He must hurry to tell Frank Corte CHAPTER XVI A STREAM OF HISTORY Good bye fellows wish you all kinds of luck I won t be long behind you Good bye answered the four from the boat that glided out on the swift waters of Thirty Mile River In the bow stood Hugh Spencer bandaged at the oars were Bruce and Frank Corte in the stern John Berwick pale and weak from his late fever was resting A new light shone in his eyes the lines of his face were softened Anxieties which had been as a weight on his soul had been removed by that revealing walk which had ended in catastrophe He had been found by the side of the trail some few hours after he had fallen in delirium The legs of his trousers were worn at the knees his flesh was cut through his struggling after he had fallen His finger tips were worn to the quick his blood had stained the ice The doctor returning had been John s rescuer and had placed him on the sleigh Truly a good Samaritan he had returned with the invalid to the foot of Le Berge Berwick s delirium was the climax of half a dozen years of mental strain His old struggle as to whether he should make his vocation in the Church as well as his almost hopeless passion for Alice Peel had though even George Bruce barely suspected it wrought upon him Now the climax had come and was passed George seeing this catastrophe had guessed much the doctor trained in the study of humanity had also guessed something Hugh Frank Corte and Haskins only knew that John had played out on the trail Spencer had told his companions there was nothing much in the first six miles of the river but that afterwards she is swift and crooked Sunken boulders were the chief danger so he took his post in the bow to read the water ahead and to direct the course saying Frank or George as he wished the one or the other to pull the harder After an hour the boat came to a point where the river takes a turn to the right on rounding which the boat s pace increased Looking over its side into the clear water John saw the stones at the bottom flash by and noted the scurrying greyling affrighted The boat swept by sunken boulders or grazed the curving shores but held its swift course without pause or incident For four hours their rapid progress continued then the current died away and the boat floated upon the dead water that marks the junction of the Hootalinquia River with the Thirty Mile henceforth to be called the Lewis till Lewis is joined by the Pelly to become the Yukon Now that the necessity for vigilance was past Hugh entertained his friends with reminiscences of his first trip there and the story of the entrance of the gold seekers to the Upper Yukon They would soon be at Cassiar Bar and the mouth of the Big Salmon River In eighteen eighty one miners had crossed the Passes and descended the lakes and rivers to the mouth of the Big Salmon which they ascended and obtained gold by washing the bars Cassiar Bar was not discovered till eighteen eighty six five years after the Big Salmon party had done their mining The men who mined Cassiar Bar had wintered here and their cabin came in useful for others who mushed out over the ice to give word about Howard Franklin s discovery of coarse gold on the Forty Mile and to order more grub to be sent up river by the Alaska Commercial Company s steamer In eighteen eighty some fellows from Sitka had gone over and prospected up the Hootalinquia but they did not strike much while the first white man over the Passes looking for gold was George Holt who found a few colours around Lake Bennett In eighteen seventy three Arthur Harper and a British Columbia outfit came up the Liard and over the Divide but though they found prospects almost everywhere in the Yukon they did not make a real strike so they floated to the mouth of the Yukon and went to work for the Alaska Commercial Company Hugh thus told the history of Yukon so far as the white man knows it Although the ice still clung along the river banks the land was free of snow and vegetable life was asserting itself The mosquito was very little behind the grass shoot in realizing that summer was at hand and that it had but a few short months in which to play its part It was because sleep on shore would be difficult through the mosquitoes that Hugh suggested their continuing the journey through the night One watched and steered while the others slept So Hugh George and Frank divided the night between them John asserted that the rest and change of scene had done him a world of good and that he was able to steer but the others squashed his proposals Heap dam dood heap sick all same baby he he sniggered Frank Corte They had now dropped away from the great mountains not a snow topped peak was in sight but the hills stretched majestically on either side of the river The routine of watches having been decided the party settled down to silence at nine o clock Towards midnight John awoke It was now merging upon the season of perpetual light and the hills and the great river were weirdly visible George was on watch sitting on the thwart ahead of him his back towards him The boat quietly swiftly glided on No effort was needed from the man at the look out save an occasional stroke to keep the head straight John glanced at his watch and saw the hour The fact startled him though he had schooled himself In the lands where his previous existence had been passed the haunts of men were always at this hour illuminated by artificial light and filled with artificiality Here was the opening of the months long day and reality Reality the Eternal Verities In that wonderful silence he needs must think and overhaul his spiritual condition He could and he would take Holy Orders He would first fight the issue in the goldfields for if he made money that power would be useful So he came to his decision and at last he slept When he awoke the boat was hauled half way up one of the Yukon s many islands and breakfast was being cooked The party had travelled one hundred miles in twenty four hours three days more would carry them to Dawson They re embarked and as the same glorious weather prevailed their expedition was very like a delightful picnic In the regions of Tantalus Buttes the river took a number of great horseshoe bends which induced Hugh to remark We do a lot of travelling here without much progress Then came Five Finger Rapids where four great pillars of conglomerate rock stood ranged across the river The Yukon s waters were low the season of freshets was not due until the snow in the mountains was melted and the sun had attacked the glaciers so Hugh said the main or right hand channel might be run Run her right on the top of the crest he ordered They approached the rapid and the current slackened almost to dead water They rowed the boat under the cliff to the right of the channel and then shot out into the middle directly on the crest The current caught the little craft there was a swish and swirl of water she heaved and was over the cataract into the dancing waters beyond The current remained swifter than it had been above the rapids and the party was soon at Rink Rapids four miles beyond Five Fingers This rapid was more dangerous than that of the Five Fingers had been owing to its being spread over a wide range of bottom and to the presence of numerous boulders however they shot the boat under the right bank and glided through in safety There now remained uninterrupted smooth water to Dawson They breakfasted at Fort Selkirk situate on the left bank of the river opposite the mouth of the large tributary the Pelly Frank protested that a day s rest would do the party good particularly a dance that night for there was a squaws camp near You will get all the dancing you have money to pay for in Dawson said Hugh As the party were again afloat Hugh pointed across the river and remarked Back at that bunch of bush are the ruins of old Fort Selkirk which Robert Campbell built for the Hudson Bay Company in the year eighteen forty nine In eighteen fifty two the Chilkats burned it down because it was cutting off their trade with the savages hereabouts You see before the Hudson Bay fellows got in here the Chilkats who held the passes to the sea used to give inside Indians most nothing for their furs and sell them at a big profit to the white traders on the coast The Chilkats would not let the inside Indians out to the coast to trade for themselves Well when the Hudson Bay Company showed up it broke up the cinch the Chilkats thought their own and they came after the Company The Indians then hereabouts the wood Indians got hold of the plans of the Chilkats and kept watch but they let up for a few days and the Chilkats came into the Fort and told the officers they had to get It was a ground hog case so they just naturally got Campbell found the local Indians and came back but the Chilkats had cleaned out The tea tobacco and sugar they took away with them and what they couldn t take they cached The Chilkats didn t offer to do murder though they are up to most anything One thing they took away with them was the Company s flag which the Chilkats keep at Kluckwan their village on the Chilkat River which lies in the valley just over the mountains west of Skagway The Chilkats are very proud of their King George man flag It was on August twenty one the Fort was seized so Campbell had to do something right away quick before the winter set in so after going down the Yukon to White River where he met the remainder of his men who had been to Fort Yukon and were coming back he told them to go back down the river and winter at Fort Yukon and he lit out up the Pelly and over the Divide to the Liard and down the Liard to Fort Simpson When he got there the Liard was running bank full of ice The next place that drew reminiscences from Hugh was the mouth of Stewart River Here was a police post with a few cabins In eighteen eighty five thirty miles up the Stewart the first considerable bar diggings was struck Dick Popham was up there in eighteen eighty four but he did not find anything water was too high Frank Densmore and Johnnie Hughes brought to Juneau in the fall of eighteen eighty five the news of good gold on the Stewart and in eighteen eighty six the gang went in about three hundred Along with the gang went George Carmack but he took up with the Siwashes on the Chilkoot You see when the fellows started in first the Siwashes packed from what is now Dyea to Lindeman for nine cents a pound but as the boys were in a hurry prices rose to thirty cents and this was too much for Carmack who was a Missourian besides he got stuck on a squaw I guess he must have stayed with the Siwashes ever since travelling among them and living their life till he made the big strike on Bonanza which started this here stampede When the boys got to the Stewart diggings in eighteen eighty six they found them good all right but not enough to go round so a lot of them lit out down the river away below Fort Yukon to try some prospects reported from there Among the bunch was Bill Hartz Web foot the boys called him because he came from Oregon Well those boys tried the lower diggings and found them no good so Web foot started back up the river on Jack McQuestion s steamer called the New Racket Jack McQuestion was trading in the country then with Arthur Harper and Al Mayo as partners He was in the country before Harper and used to work for the Hudson Bay Company on the Mackenzie At this time they had four posts one at Fort Selkirk one at Stewart River one just below Dawson and one about where Eagle City now is There was a big mountain there called by Harper Teetotalim At Teetotalim there was a queer sort of fellow from back east in Canada a Frenchman who was always fooling round with bits of rock and talking about how the mountains were made One day a Siwash blew in with a piece of woolly rock which the Frenchman said was Asiebestos and if there was much of it it would be worth money so McQuestion sent out Web foot with a grub stake to find the place Web foot did not find the Asiebestos but he found gold on the Forty Mile as also did Howard Franklin who was sent up the Forty Mile from its mouth by McQuestion They came back out and on up the Yukon to winter at Stewart Next year the fellows left Stewart for the Forty Mile and George Matlock Billy Leak Oscar Ashley and Percy Walker found Matlock Bar with coarse gold which washed down out of Franklin Gulch Franklin Gulch was found in August eighteen eighty seven This was the first really coarse gold found in the Yukon and the best discovery up to that time While the boys were wintering at Stewart grub got short and Harper passed it round fair and square not raising the price any But one day some stuff was stole and Harper told the boys who called a miners meeting right off The boys appointed a committee to go round and search the cabins for every fellow was glad enough to clear himself by showing everything he had Nothing was found And then the boys thought of two fellows Missouri Bill and Arkansaw Frank who lived down the river a bit And when they struck a fresh trail leading to and from their cabin they became mighty interested and when they saw where they had made a fire and found half burnt up staves of a butter firkin they got real hot When they got up to the cabin the door opened and the two fellows came out one of them Missouri Bill with a Winchester in his hands swearing he would shoot the first man who came a step further This stopped the boys for a bit but Frank Morphet got a rope off a sleigh and slipped round back of the cabin The first thing Missouri Bill knew he had a rope round his neck and the game was up Well the boys didn t want to hang them so each of the fellows gave them a handful of beans or a little rice and told them to get thinking that mushing out five hundred miles and breaking trail all the way was pretty nearly as bad as hanging They made the trip all right but it was only because they met some Siwashes CHAPTER XVII DAWSON Being in the vanguard of the multitude whose rush to the diggings in the following year was the outstanding feature of the history of the Klondike the Dawson that John Berwick and his companions found was that of the winter of ninety seven very different from the city of five thousand tents it was to become two months after their arrival An hour before midnight when they arrived Hugh had pointed out a high hill Dawson s Dome placed beyond the mouth of the Klondike River or as it was called before usage corrupted its name the Thron Duik Little did he or his companions dream of the part this Dome was to play in the events yet to be The Dome was to become historic The main portion of Dawson was built on the north side of the Klondike It was a scene of much movement and business Pack trains were passing up and down the streets and innumerable dogs seemed everywhere Few boats had yet arrived and a group of loafers gathered to watch them land One fellow shouted I ll give you a dollar apiece for any late papers you have Now that they were at the Klondike capital the natural impulse of the party was to enjoy whatever amusements were available so in spite of their being tired and the hour late they drew the boat upon the gravel shore Passing between tents they came to the mire of the main thoroughfare The atmosphere and circumstance of the goldfields were all about them There were pack horses and pack mules waiting before the shops Men were hurrying in and out with pack straps on their backs Even the dogs wore saddle bags a good dog being able to pack forty pounds of supplies Other dogs passed drawing a cart on which were half a dozen cans oil tins filled with water dispensed at twenty five cents the tin The festive side of life was more marked than the commercial Men in wild attire women in gorgeous raiment were ever passing in and out of the saloons and gambling halls The four adventurers floundered across the mud and entered the hospitable doors of the Borealis This was a saloon and dance hall combined but a roulette wheel and faro lay out invited to play It was the interval between the dances when they entered and a loud voice was calling Come along gentlemen pretty ladies here just in over the ice The next dance will be a waltz Frank Corte ever the squire of dames made a dive for the rear of the hall and was soon leading one of the gorgeous creatures into the dizzy whirl The partners from the last dance were crowding the bar ordering drinks As each man paid his two dollars his lady was handed a check This check was redeemable for one dollar the girls source of revenue The orchestra was good but the male section of the dancers was certainly grotesque many of the men with sombreros on their head and cigars between their teeth were floundering through the dance in a half intoxicated condition their great hob nailed boots almost drowning the music with their noise The three others soon left Frank to his diversions and passed out to the street They saw a policeman with whom in the way of such a free and easy community they fell into talk What s the chance of getting a claim they asked Don t know They are having stampedes right along and any time you may hear of good pay being located on a creek When news like this gets out there is a big rush by all classes and you re lucky if you get anywhere near discovery If you want work they are paying ten dollars per day and board on the creeks for shovelling in so I guess you need not starve Hugh with his mind on the immediate necessities of the party asked Where is a good place to locate Up on the bench on the north side of the Klondike over there The policeman pointed south east You can get wood handy and the water is good What s the matter with pitching our tent where we landed Among the outfit along the water front No they are the sore heads and general kickers You don t want to tie to them Most of them have lived in these tents all winter and had nothing to do but dream of what some other fellow has done them out of and how much better things would be if they had struck it rich instead of mc donald or Carmack No you fellows pole up stream to morrow to the Klondike and then up that stream half a mile Pack your grub to the top of the hill there where you can live like white men That sounds reasonable but we want to sleep now Well go to Flanagan s bunk house up the street and the man pointed up a turning running at right angles to the main street He will give you beds at a dollar each Our boat and things will be all right Good night and thanks When the three visited the boat next morning they found a man standing on the bank his legs encased in rubber boots coming up to his hips far apart hands in the pockets of his overalls a sombrero on the back of his head Hugh noticed the smile of good natured cynicism on his face as he regarded the boat and said Queer ain t it And they say there are thousands more coming Yes fifty thousand more coming in and me waiting for a chance to get out I wonder what makes them do it Same thing as made me do it Didn t you git a chance to stake anything Stake anything how long have you been in the country Say is that your boat Yes Well take my tip and just get in it and keep right on going till you strike saint Michael s For what reason would we do that Don t you know they have a Government in this country Well that s the reason officials and graft Stake a claim and they rob you of it No sir no more British mining camps for me I m for the good old State of Washington If this camp was in Alaska a fellow could hold down what was his with a shot gun but here you daren t make a break Law and order hell Grafters appointed by the law and the law to see no fellow interfere with the grafters We d shoot the whole bunch if we had them on the other side We intend to stake claims and we intend to hold them You do eh well I bet you won t You fellows should have brought your nurse girls with you to teach you the A B C The party was then joined by Frank the habitual smile on his face but his eyes were heavy Cost me fifty dollars he said You got off easy better get in and cook breakfast to wake you up We haven t eaten yet and meals up town cost two dollars and a half Say if you fellows want to you can use my tent and things but I have no grub to give away This invitation from the new found pessimist was accepted and Frank went to work cooking while their host let loose his opinions upon life He told them how the manager of a great trading company had the autumn before addressed the crowd prophesying famine through the winter and exhorting all to leave the place by the only avenue of escape the river then filling with ice It was a dismal picture enough but happily worse than the reality He spoke well of the police and praised the way they had rushed the mail in and out with dog teams And it ain t their fault there is so much grafting they don t graft themselves He told of the fabulous wealth of Eldorado Bonanza and Hunker Creeks and of Alec mc donald the Big Moose estimated to be worth twenty six million dollars He expatiated at length upon the irregularities of the Gold Commissioner s office the iniquitous Orders in Council from Ottawa such as the imposition of ten per cent royalty on the production of the creeks and the reserving to the Crown of every alternate claim on Dominion Creek of all other creeks on which new discoveries might have been made and of the hillside claims Frank with his Yankee predilections was ready to believe anything bad of Canada and chuckled at the account John and George though they had had experience of official corruption in Australia thought the accounts fantastic and could not believe such things possible in British dominions The Gold Commissioner is not in the graft he s honest but he s like a baby and the gang play with him as they like Breakfast over the party set out and in an hour had poled and tracked the boat half a mile up the Klondike They passed under a crude suspension bridge and saw two ferries and innumerable boats plying across the river Hugh noticed a break or draw in the cliff marked by a trail that led to the bench on which the party was to locate and stopped the boat Get out the axes fellows and Frank you pack the tent up the hill It will make you think of what you have done with your last winter s wages John you re the honoured guest you re going to boss the job Berwick without any load found the climb to the top of the hill sufficiently exhausting as he was not yet fully recovered After Frank had thrown down the tent Hugh unlashed it and spread it in the sun folded one end to make a pillow and told John to lie upon it And then he addressed his partners Look here fellows one thing is certain Whatever we do as regards prospecting and taking up claims we want a home camp as a sort of headquarters and we might as well make it here and now We need not bother building a cabin but we can put up a wall of logs the size of the tent and put the tent on top This will do till the fall by which time we will all be millionaires except Frank here unless he quits dancing Now we ll pack up the rest of the outfit Come on boys By four o clock their new habitation was completed two beds were built and the little stove erected inside the tent Frank had an early supper and went to bed The others built a camp fire outside to keep away the flies and discussed mining far into the night CHAPTER XVIII POO BAH During the days of his convalescence John Berwick spent many hours roaming about the bluff indulging his passion for the sights of Nature and thinking quite without panic now of the infinite problems associated with human existence in an universe governed by an inscrutable Providence Much of his thought too naturally turned to the girl he had left behind him His illness and these after thoughts had taught him lessons and given him hopes In the steep ascent one day of the bench on the south side of the Klondike John came up with a tottering figure bent under a heavy load The man was old and the temptation came to John invalid as he was to offer to relieve him of the burden for a bit when the man sat down to rest and wiped away the perspiration with a much soiled red handkerchief John sat down near him but for a time he paid no attention to him or to any of the passers by It s a nice day John began It s only chechachoes that talk about the weather was the blunt reply I m a chechacho Don t have to tell me that what in hell are you fellows coming here for To stake a claim and get rich Poo Bah will get it Poo Bah Poo Bah of the Mikado This ain t the Mikie do s Poo Bah this is the Octopus Poo Bah He s got the Mikie do and the Czar of Russia skinned to death Poo Bah comes pretty near running things in Dawson If you stake a claim and go to Poo Bah and give him half interest you may get a grant for it that is if Poo Bah can t find any person to run it for him Then again he may think he wants it all himself in which case you can go to hell If you wants to start manufacturing hootch just go to Poo Bah and he will fix things so as you won t be touched But are you sure This is British territory British nothing this is the Octopus country and him and Poo Bah is old friends Fellows tell me Poo Bah helped elect the Octopus back east to Parliament or whatever you Britishers call your Government lay out Look at this royalty they are putting on our gold how much of this here royalty ever gets to Queen Victoria No sir I bet Sir Wilfrid Laurier never gets his hands on one half of what s robbed from us poor devils But the expenses of Government must be raised and you must admit that you have good law and order and that you never get held up Held up Law and order Hell What s the difference between being held up by fellows like the Soapy Smith gang or being held up by the blooming yellow legs You have some chance of getting clear of Soapy Smith and it s only a matter of time till some fellow takes a shot at him but you can t get past the yellow legs they won t stand for no bluffs The Government will build roads Roads Then why ain t they building them No the Government says Poo Bah will build them and has given Poo Bah a franchise to charge fellows going up Bonanza Creek trail twenty five cents apiece and for each pack animal two dollars and a half Poo Bah started to build the road all right but he quit just as soon as he got the toll gate up What do you think I m climbing this two thousand feet for mountain scenery same as you re doing No it s a mighty sight easier to climb this blooming hill than to wade through Poo Bah s bog holes The Bonanza trail makes the slough of despond look like the rocky road to Dublin But say I must be getting You re away from the land of dooks and earls and kings and queens and all that brand of cattle and you d better turn white man with a new set of notions in your head Let me carry your load a little way Go on I ain t dead yet It serves me right for getting caught in a country ruled by a Government my fathers bled to get rid of about the time of the Boston tea party The old man struggled into his harness again God I wished I was back again under Old Glory John shrank under the insult Tears came to his eyes What soul cherishing the honour of British institutions would not have protested at such a state of things as his eyes were daily being opened to Sadness came over him Here was a great injustice and sordid festering corruption inspired by greed He gritted his teeth and a resolve came to him If he found these stories true he would strive somehow anyhow to overthrow Poo Bah and his clique of corruption After a while John again came up to the old man resting by the side of the trail who blurted out I thought I had given you enough to send you out of the country Then you didn t Tell me this are you aware of any case of a miner being cheated out of his claim Yes lots There s my own for one Where and how was that The old man was not disinclined to talk Well stranger it was this way Me and my partner staked a claim on French Hill and we was sure first on the ground We went to Dawson and gave a lawyer a hundred dollars to apply for the claim for us They told him that we must have a survey before they would give the grant Well we gave a surveyor two hundred dollars to survey the claim for us and we went out there with him When we got there with the surveyor we found a dozen fellows with rockers taking the rich pay off the rim rock It was three weeks before we got our grant The Gold Commissioner s gang took thirty thousand dollars out of it and now we have the leavings not worth much If we hadn t thought of getting the lawyer we wouldn t have even got the leavings That was enough for John He arose and pushed through the bushes on the opposite side of the trail walking in the general direction of the hill top He desired solitude that he might think He felt fiercely angry at these wrongs They were intolerable they struck at the simplest principles of human liberty Here were men enduring privations which sometimes caused permanent bodily harm John remembered the snow blinded traveller of Cape Le Berge only to have the fruits of their strenuous endeavour mercilessly taken from them Before he could control his indignation he had wandered miles from Dawson and gained the summit of the hill where he sat to eat his luncheon To the eastward was the valley of the great gold bearing creek Bonanza He noted the great rounded ridges which with their intervening valleys ran along the slopes to its bottom He marvelled at the softness and beauty of their lines each of which ended in a gracefully rounded head standing sentinel over the creek And well they might appear to guard its riches for those heads contained immense deposits of bench gravels that were to cause extraordinary sensation in the days to come Finishing his lunch he was idly working at the moss with his heels when he noticed that the rock beneath was white as milk He examined it closely yes it was quartz the parent rock of gold Immediately the instinct of the miner was aroused He took a piece of loose rock and easily broke off several pieces These he put into his pockets and set out eagerly for home His mind was free of politics now A tinge of palest green was on the hills this one day s sun had burst a myriad of buds upon a million poplars Yes it was summer George and Hugh coming in soon after John s return were shown the find and all was enthusiasm Pretty hungry looking stuff was Hugh s comment on close inspection How will you get water up there for your stamp mill John found an answer as he remembered the long gently reclining ridge to Bonanza Creek with its flanking valleys on either side I ll take my ore to Bonanza Creek But they won t let you take the water out of Bonanza Creek Perhaps not but they will let me have the water out of the tributaries if I can turn it back before it reaches Bonanza Creek On the morrow George and he visited the famous or infamous seat of the Head over the mining industry They found the Gold Commissioner s office a log building of no great dimensions near the police barracks A waiting crowd was lined before the door A policeman standing near the office entrance directed John who wished merely to get a copy of the regulations governing the taking up of quartz claims to ask at the wicket inside He entered As he stood waiting his turn he overheard a miner evidently a Scandinavian applying for a claim This claim is already applied for said the official But mister there vos not a stake on it ven I staked it I don t care It is applied for Next Can t I see the Commissioner No he s busy Next Say mister this is my claim Next Poor Ole was shoved aside by the crowd He had waited through the weary night to gain a hearing and now ethereal castles came toppling down As soon as John had obtained a copy of the regulations he and George Bruce set off to the hill of promise each to take up a quartz claim They staked their claims and then followed the ridge down to Bonanza Creek They found that the rounded end of the ridge overlooking the creek was admirably suited as the site of a quartz mill George said his companion I don t think my right will be of any other use to me I shall take up a claim here under the placer laws and I think you had better do the same So each of them staked a placer claim Instead of returning by the way they had come the inclination to return by the creek trail was too strong to be resisted They would be forced to wade through numerous bog holes but what of that Down the hill they scrambled and came to a sudden halt amid the full activity of some mining operations A gang of men were working over a line of sluice boxes with a big fellow standing on a pile of rocks superintending The water was shut off from running through the sluices The men had lifted the riffles out of the dump box and the gleam of nuggets and dust was plainly visible It looks good It ought to be after three days shovelling in on discovery answered the superintendent who flashed a keen glance at the new comers Is this discovery That s what I endeavoured to enunciate Do you object to our watching the clean up Not that I knows of I s pose the gold ain t going to evaporate cause you look at it But where do you come from Are you miners We are Do you want a job Give you ten dollars and board No we have just staked claims quartz claims on the ridge up there and intend working them Quartz this country is full of quartz There ain t nothing in it see all the quartz in the wash here and the foreman pointed to the white pebbles among the rocks on which he was standing You can crack these all day and never find a colour Where does the gold come from if it does not come from the quartz Where does it come from just grows I guess Gold is like potatoes in this country It was over there just under the bluff that Carmack made discovery He found a bunch of high grade pay in the creek bottom and worked it out and then he had to go twenty feet through the muck to bed rock before he got the real thing Now how did the gold get on top of the muck where Carmack first found it There has not been a good sized colour found above bed rock on any other claim on the creek I tell you if you try to figure where gold in this country comes from you ll go bughouse before you find out Gold is where you find it It s a blooming conundrum Take me I came up here and could have staked in on Eldorado Well I couldn t find a colour in the creek but what I could see was a sign stuck up readin This creek is reserved for Swedes and Moose Now I weren t a Swede and I sure weren t a Moose So I passes her up What happens Why a lot of fools take her up and she s the richest ground in the country Nice ain t it and me working for wages Well how do you know I won t strike it rich on my quartz claim You may stranger you may I ve given up calling people fools for having different notions from me Hope you will They found the trail as bad as it had been described to them It did indeed make the slough of despond look like the rocky road to Dublin Few men they met but had some humorous remark to make and there is probably no toil greater than wading with pack on back from stump to stone from stone to stump in the course of that desperate journey Humour was the saving grace it was an effective barrier against despair Occasionally men were met blaspheming cursing the land the gold the Government but generally it was humour which made the path passable A led horse waded into a bog hole He stopped and seemed to hesitate Throw a stick at him shouted the man leading him to another who walked behind A stick was thrown The horse plunged and the bog being deeper than the men had imagined was more in the mire Keep him going it s the only way to save him was shouted Stick after stick was hurled at the struggling animal which became more and more bemired It gave up the struggle The report of a rifle soon after told that the horse was dead CHAPTER XIX GRAFT John and his fellow prospector were working with hammer and drill on their quartz claims three weeks after they had staked them when Hugh Spencer and Corte paid them a first visit Hugh scrutinized the quartz his friends had mined Well this is poverty rock for sure why don t you quit it That s what we ve been thinking lately George confessed but what shall we do go to work for wages Better earn ten dollars a day than get nothing here after blowing in your money buying grub and powder but why not take a chance in the new stampede to Australia Creek that runs into Dominion Creek on the Indian River side of the Divide That s what we hunted you up for John and George gazed at one another Not a word was said John walked to the tent and began taking it down Four packs were made of the camp and the equipment and the party well loaded returned to Dawson So John passed from a place of many dreams Hugh had already made his plans Australia Creek is already taken up he said and besides it is too far away It s two days trip out there about sixty miles My idea is to hunt up a creek for ourselves I hear the grafters in the Gold Commissioner s office already refuse applications on the grounds that the creek is all applied for There was some sort of a row in the office when the discoverers came in to record Things is getting pretty bad when even a discoverer is refused a record He he it s about time for Uncle Sam to come along chaffed Frank exploiting once more his set theory The party reached the home camp deposited their loads and passed on into the town to make purchases for their projected trip As they passed up the main street they saw a crowd collected yelling itself hoarse Revolvers were being fired in the air and a frenzy of passion seemed to govern a number of individuals A man wild of eye and with a disordered beard came running down the street man Dooey Dewey has knocked hell out of the Spaniards at Manilla he shouted Frank gave a cock crow and was off at a dive into the crowd where a man standing on a pile of lumber was reading a newspaper He would read a line then yell and wave the paper over his head He would again and again return to the headlines and shout them out Biggest sea battle since Trafalgar yells cheers revolver shots Dooey ranks with Nelson more uproar Rebels cut the cables but the Eye Opener gets account by special dispatch boat When exhaustion had overtaken the first reader another took his place till the owner of the newspaper was inspired to claim it and cry To the Pioneer Hall boys and hear the full account of the biggest sea fight that was ever pulled off admission only one dollar It is said that the celebration of Admiral Dewey s victory at Manilla caused the dogs in Dawson numbering many thousands to leave for the hills and stay there for the space of three days Having bought the supplies the next problem before the companions was to find Frank They entered the Borealis he was not there Hugh suggested that his two companions should wait in the saloon while he sought the truant in other places of revelry They remained glad to sit watch and smoke in the shaded comfort of a curtained recess Presently a man of giant heavy figure with face coarse and brutal in every line stalked into the motley crowd His massive forehead suggested a power of brain while his lower face showed the lines of a masterful spirit A part of his left ear was missing and from the size and shape of the cut one could readily believe the popular legend that this disfigurement had been gained in a camp brawl and was caused by another man s teeth To complete this awesome personality there was a cast in one eye A whisper went through the crowd Poo Bah This then was the prince of grafters the all powerful of that region As Poo Bah walked towards the dancers every eye was on him and if any face denoted anything save disgust and loathing it was fear A girl slid up to him and said in a tone of confident familiarity Hullo Poo Bah How s my baby to night I told you not to call me that he answered fiercely What baby No Poo Bah That s what they call you she said with a strange affectation of simplicity Well they won t make friends with me by doing so he boomed and I m a pretty good friend to have Ain t you going to buy the wine I suppose so but ain t you got that thirst of yours wet up yet I ve got to live Just then Poo Bah and the girl popularly known as Round Eyes were joined by two men One was a strong big fellow with a bronzed face who had been a master mariner The other was Hardman the record clerk of the Gold Commissioner s office evil looking and a weakling His small black eyes were watery Hullo fellows The lady has suggested wine Will you help us clean up a bottle or two Sure thing replied the Cap Hardman was glad to agree His eyes were watching the face of his lord with the same expression as shines in the eyes of a hungry cur watching his master feast Both the Cap and he had tales of woe to tell their troubles lay sore upon them The party entered the booth against which John and George were sitting As they entered and seated themselves the two friends could hear their voices through the hangings At first there was nothing in the words they spoke that their brazen natures would not have willingly advanced to all the world at least to all Dawson s world but later the wine made them forget They had not realized that the wall of their compartment was only a blanket Two bottles of wine Poo Bah demanded The waiter brought the bottles and glasses and Poo Bah signed the tab Now you pay that tab or I don t get no percentage said the girl Suppose I don t pay answered he you know these damn fools from the creeks will buy all kinds of wine just to have the honour of drinking with my girl ain t that right I guess it is she answered with a cold unpleasant laugh Because men are fools makes life easy for you and me ain t that right Look here I ve got a kick coming said the mariner thumping his knee with a fist like mahogany What s the matter Cap I wrote the doctor to get me appointed as Collector of Royalty You did sure and I backed you up but I heard you got your appointment in the mail that got in to day Sure thing I did Well what are you growling about You don t want to be told how to make a dollar or two on a job like that It s going all wrong What s the trouble I went down to see Smoothbore Smoothbore was the nickname of the head of the police and told him I had orders for him to put me on collecting I guess I may have looked a little bit as if I thought I owned the earth but I sure reckoned myself on easy street as soon as I got collecting Well Smoothbore he sizes me up a bit I guess he kind of felt I knew how to take a few ounces out of a poke and make up the weight in black sand and then he says I guess I ll send you to Thistle Creek Thistle Creek hell They won t clean up a hundred dollars in that creek this summer and if you ll show me how I can work a graft there I ll be obliged Anyhow two hundred and fifty dollars a month will keep you going till something better turns up Two hundred and fifty dollars a month ain t even a flea bite seeing what it costs to live like a gentleman in Dawson You can t eat under ten dollars a day His voice faded in a growl Poo Bah took up the running The thing is we ve got to get Smoothbore relieved from command here He puts backbone even into Hi u Bill Hi u Bill was the District Commissioner We ve got to get a putty man The others agreed cordially John and his companion who had before felt like going looked at each other and silently decided to stay What kick have you got Hardie they heard Poo Bah ask Kick whined the little man I ve got lots of kick We had a row in the office to day I heard something of that What was the row Some Australians came in John and George looked at each other and grimly smiled I sized it up that they had staked something rich I tried to tell them that the creek they wanted to record on was all taken up intending of course to put you in on discovery Yes yes Well the cockneys just pulled five guns and said Record those claims I made a break as if to get the books intending to get out the back door but the old man comes out of his office and catches on He turns white around the gills and says Record those claims Of course I just had to give record But where does Smoothbore come in He comes in all right I m just from him now I went down after supper to see him to find out if an example could not be made of the cockneys thinking if we got them on the wood pile nine we would have a chance at their claims after all He was alone walking up and down the mess Sit down he says and I sits What is it I had to tell him the story straight You see he is a hard man to lie to and I knew he already had the story After I got down to telling him of the old man ordering me to record the claims he says And you recorded them Yes says I The men did not ask you for any money No In fact they only desired to assist your memory to the point that you had never before recorded the claims they asked for I guess so says I This is what you must say if you give evidence against them And then I thinks a bit and I says You couldn t give them twenty four hours to get out of the country could you No says he if I do anything I arrest them and bring them to trial which I will do as soon as you swear out information I guess I won t do that I says Now look here Poo B oh all right Smoothbore ain t with us he s against us and it s up to you to get him fired Hardman had ended his long speech nine In jail It might not be easy said the heavy man thoughtfully Yes it will Laurier will do anything our boss says these days you fix it That s right the Cap put in Hardie s right again You d be a long time in Nova Scotia before you d earn two hundred and fifty dollars a month Eh Cap sneered the girl Earn How much do you earn here You graft same as the rest of us Quit fighting Poo Bah broke in and their querulous voices ceased Cap I think I see how you can make a dollar or two and you ll be near our friend Hardie here besides being in a position to pick up information for the benefit of yours truly I ll see the Gold Commissioner and get you put on as special door keeper instead of a policeman Guess your dignity will stand up under this You will have the right to let fellows into the office on special appointment see which will cost a ten or a twenty Not so bad slowly muttered the Cap while the girl gurgled her appreciation The thing looks to have possibilities and I guess my dignity will stand it Just then Hugh with Frank at his heels came in Wait till I have just one dance cried Frank and was off to the room where music was to be heard John motioned to Hugh to be still They listened eagerly Now I ve got some news blamed noise those people make came in the mail to day went on Poo Bah Orders have come from Ottawa throwing open the hillside claims of Dominion I won t mind you fellows getting a claim or two but I want to get a bunch You ll get hold of yours before the news is made public suggested the Cap No that won t hardly do drawled Poo Bah you see there ll be hell enough raised when it is found I get a bunch of claims and while Ottawa is ready enough to take our explanation of things there is such a thing as being too coarse even here besides it ain t necessary No in a few days the news will be made public till then keep your heads shut see We ll trust you to work the graft said the girl You can certainly rely on me Now people I ve got to pull my freight Hugh gripped John s arm but he released it as he saw the party were leaving the box The friends shrank back further into the shadows When they were gone he whispered Did you hear that Dominion hillsides to be thrown open Some of the richest ground in the country I heard them talking about grafts and I heard complaints about Smoothbore who ever that may be The Colonel at the Barracks They appear to find him in the way John hurriedly gave some account of what they had overheard Hugh s eyes glistened Sure thing Smoothbore is in the way He s straight but this last about Dominion is the news We ll get in on the hillsides of Dominion and do our best to hold them It was late enough for rest especially for weary workers such as they so they passed through the streets directly for the home camp Dawson was now the home of twenty thousand people ninety nine per cent adult males Its streets were a wide range of strange sights and wild scenes Its outskirts were of tents and yet more tents They went to bed with the waking dreams of wealth very close to them John Berwick who had some qualms at taking advantage of what he had overheard felt it was an unsatisfactory condition of things in which such a malefactor as Poo Bah could swagger and flourish CHAPTER XX A LOTTERY On the second day after leaving Dawson John Berwick and his partners camped on Dominion Creek worn out and weary Their commissariat was equal to a three weeks stay and their tools and their bedding were added to the load Hugh remained their leader While John and George had been prospecting their quartz find he had visited Dominion Creek and found many miners looking with avidity towards the claims on the left limit of the creek several miles below the confluence of Caribou It was to this locality that he directed the party The laws governing the taking up of placer claims in the Yukon demanded that the applicant should swear to the finding of gold No quantity was mentioned John and George had met this difficulty when they applied for the placer claims on the Bonanza hillsides but this technicality had been smilingly dispensed with by the record clerk on the consideration that nobody wanted the ground for placer In the case of the Dominion Creek hillsides however they determined to make discoveries if possible They pitched their tent upon the hillside which rose in a gentle incline from the creek If any former channel ran underneath the ground they had chosen it could not be very far to bed rock They picked their four claims and numbered them one two three four They drew lots for them John had one Hugh two Frank three and George the fourth As their tent was small they determined that two of them should work at night time and two by day This also meant that a continuous watch could be kept Miners from the creek claims visited them curious to learn their motive When they were told that the party expected the claims to be some day thrown open they smiled in superior wisdom Each of the four began to sink a shaft to the bed rock of his claim A single man can sink a hole ten even twelve feet but after that a windlass is necessary to hoist the dirt It was arranged that the first day they all should work George and Frank continuing the watch through the night They began early in the morning of the first day each on his claim Each made a little clearing around the spot he had chosen as the locality of his first shaft The growth was not heavy and was quickly disposed of By noon each had made a hole about three feet deep No frost was met as yet It was George who first reached bed rock at five foot depth He went to the other workers and announced the fact Hugh had expected it to be thirty or twenty five feet at least Their first feeling was of disappointment The party gathered about the pit and Hugh jumped into it There was about a foot of gravel above the bed rock Hugh picked out a pebble lying directly on bed rock and smoothed over its muddy surface with his fingers His eyes brightened It gleamed with half a dozen specks of gold He passed it up to the others who gazed on it gladly They gave him a pan Hugh scooped it full of gravel and scrambled out of the hole The others turned towards the creek No fellows I ve got a pool located up in the bushes here and he looked away from the creek What those fellows on the creek don t know won t do them no harm He led the way through the bushes Arriving at the pool he dipped the pan into the water and shook it He then placed it on the ground grabbed a handful of the pebbles washed them in the water of the pan and threw them away He continued this process till he had removed the larger stones Then again he whirled the pan in the water this time more vigorously He picked out the smaller pebbles and replaced the pan in the water whirled and shook it again frequently lifting it out on an incline allowing the off rushing water to carry away the small pebbles and sand This process he kept up till but a handful of stuff remained at the bottom He kept the pan on an incline which caused the stuff to remain at one side He moved the pan gently to and fro with occasional quick shakings very gently he drew the pan in and out of the water the ebb to draw off the lighter sand The residue in the pan became but a spoonful or two and now occasionally a golden speck shone and gleamed The sand in the pan became less and some of it was black the black sand of the miners magnetic from the iron which so largely composes it As the process proceeded the sideward motion occasionally carried the body of black sand away leaving a trail of gleaming yellow dust The black sand had at last all been washed over the side of the pan Hugh with his fingers massed the gold into a little pile and muttered Seventy five cents Three bob George repeated after him The pan was passed from hand to hand for scrutiny and comment Not bad said John You bet it ain t agreed Hugh even if it don t rank with Eldorado This ground ain t deep and the surface can be ground sluiced off Let us try another pan off of bed rock The pan was again filled and the process of washing resumed If we get two cents in this gravel a foot off of bed rock I ll be satisfied was Hugh s comment He got this time what he estimated to be five cents Perhaps this is above average he muttered Your old time miner is ever a sceptic So while he was washing this second pan Hugh s mind was at work George I guess you had better go and chuck back all the gravel and wash into the hole and get a fire built on it quick The ashes will hide the wash and any person looking down the hole will simply think that you have struck frost and are using fire The rest of us will keep going till we strike wash Frank reached gravel at about seven feet and reported the same to Hugh who suggested that he should work a small hole to bed rock to get a pan of gravel from that point Hugh cautioned Frank against throwing any gravel out of the shaft to attract the notice of passers by Frank secured a pan of dirt immediately on bed rock and Hugh panned it for him Frank was the only one of the four not a miner The pan yielded a little better than that of George had done Hugh suggested significantly that Frank had found frost at the bottom of his shaft which induced the latter to mutter Ground heap frozen all same rock no ketchum gold without fire he he This was supposed to be a humorous imitation of the Siwash Never mind your Siwash sweethearts but get the fire in quick I suppose if you do strike it rich or ever get this claim which is sure worth something it will be heap klootch heap dance all the time Get a move on or some rubber neck will be mooching round here Hugh went back to his pit and both he and John had struck real frost before Frank roared Supper During the meal and afterwards the conversation was about the claims and the prospect of their getting them It was two weeks yet before they could be judiciously staked In the meantime Frank and George could put down other shafts prospecting the width and extent of the pay streak while John and Hugh were getting their shaft down to bed rock It would be slow work for these two now that they had struck frost which necessitated thawing by wood fires I guess we need a cabin on these claims said Hugh It s more a sign we re holding them down and if we start building it we can kill time so as not to look conspicuous as we would if we was just to sit and do nothing It would have the rubber necks guessing So the work continued upon the four hillside claims on Dominion Creek John and Hugh working at day George and Frank at night These two holding the vigil of the second night again found bed rock and gold twenty feet further up the hillside than their first shafts On the day following John and Hugh quickly cleared the bottom of their shafts of the earth which the fires burning through the night had thawed They then set new fires and sat in the shade of a tree while they burned The bed rock on each of their claims was deeper than that on the claims of their two associates and both felt that their claims would prove the richer though neither of them uttered this thought The minds of all were planning how best to gain possession of their discoveries I guess said Hugh as he lit his pipe and slapped divers mosquitoes to death that it ain t altogether judicious for George and Frank to perforate this here landscape with any more shafts There is sure to be some fellows rubber necking here soon I see some water has seeped into the two holes they sunk first and the other two will probably fill soon This will keep others from investigating I guess they had better get to work on a cabin which we will help them with as soon as we get bed rock ourselves These claims is mighty well worth holding on to and we don t want to run no chances of not getting them which we sure won t do if Poo Bah s gang gets on to the fact that they are any good When the four were seated round the evening meal the matter was talked over and Frank and George agreed to start building a cabin The work was begun that very night Days came and went yet neither John nor Hugh found bed rock although each shaft was now fifteen feet deep At twelve foot depth a windlass had been constructed on each claim and the earth hoisted from the shaft At eighteen feet Hugh struck gravel As John who worked the windlass dumped a bucket of gravel he would hide it by shovelling over it earth from the dump Finding gravel there at that depth suggested gold in fact the depth to which the shaft was sunk without striking bed rock was sufficiently compromising At last bed rock was reached and a pan of dirt extracted The pan was washed and a nugget worth fully a dollar and a half besides about two dollars in fine gold was its product Here was wealth and no mistake Hi u chickaman stuff he he laughed Frank They all looked into each other s eyes Hugh gritted his teeth as he thought of Poo Bah If there was any extent of this gravel it constituted a fortune yes very little of this ground meant wealth How much of it would there be Was this gold of Dominion Creek pay streak He did not know the great thing about mining is you never know John s shaft found bed rock at twenty two feet where he got a good five dollars to the pan Frank jabbered the others said but little It was late in the afternoon when the pan of dirt from John s shaft was tried After supper Hugh took a stroll He walked far up the hillside and gazed at the tributary valley that ran into Dominion Creek just up stream from John s claim This pup as the miners term these small tributaries Hugh noticed had been staked and prospected but had not yielded pay He had already planned to use its water for the washing of the gravel should he gain possession of his claim He then walked down to the adjacent claim being worked on Dominion Creek and began asking questions of the man at the windlass He was always ready to receive information though he seldom gave any The ground on Dominion was rich enormously rich ten twenty and sometimes fifty dollar pans Up stream the second claim was not nearly so rich The man at the windlass did not know the value of the intervening claim it was held by the Government How far are you to bed rock About twenty five feet Much gravel About three feet hardly three feet Hugh was tempted to ask how deep the miners who had prospected the pup had gone before they had struck pay but did not because he gave the man credit for intelligence Black muck above gravel he asked Yes or we would not be working with wood fires now Black muck takes a lot to thaw but as it is I guess we shall have to quit till winter but we have proved our ground rich Until the advent of steam thawing machines the Klondike miners thawed their ground by wood fires which process can only be carried on extensively in winter Hugh left the miner and walked to the mouth of the pup With a pole he sounded the depth of an abandoned shaft It was fifteen feet He walked to the camp and found John the others being at work on the cabin John the bed rock at the bottom of your shaft dips towards my claim and the bed rock in my shaft dips towards your claim Yes The fellow at the windlass on the creek claim tells me that he is in the biggest kind of pay outside of Eldorado but that the second claim up stream is not up to much He has muck Yes We have earth and broken rock down to the gravel Yes His shaft is twenty five feet to bed rock and if we sank a shaft half way between yours and mine we would find it deeper than either In all probability yes Don t you see what I am driving at No John answered bluntly You ve caught on to that pup up stream there I have Well it s only fifteen feet to bed rock there The old channel of that pup runs underneath your claim and mine and is mighty rich The gold found on the creek claim looks exactly like ours I saw some of it lying in a pan John was watching the face of his friend intently These hillside claims are two hundred and fifty feet long and stretch one thousand feet back which means the chances are that the claims you and I are prospecting cover one thousand feet of mighty rich ground We are wealthy men said John And his thought passed in a flash to Alice Peel Hold on we ain t got them yet counselled Hugh His mind reverted to Poo Bah CHAPTER XXI THE PEELS HOSPITAL Alice Peel and her father the Surgeon Major arrived in Dawson by one of the first steamers from saint Michael s It was late in the evening when they docked so they arranged to stay on board all night This made it possible for them to see some of the sights ere they retired They landed and mingled with the crowds preparatory to finding lodgings Alice suggested they should ascertain the whereabouts of the Rector Her father did so and when he thanked the man of whom he inquired added I ll look him up to morrow Might as well do so right away quick he s always hangin round there But it s eleven o clock Don t make no difference in Dawson Alice and her father thereupon picked their way towards the Police Barracks where on the banks of the slough rested the little log church It was shut off from the street by a rustic fence a peaceful sight Alice and her father were standing regarding it and had almost made up their minds to enter to see if any one was about when their attention was attracted by a man in a boat mooring his craft beside the church grounds He landed his bundle of blankets and was spreading them under the church window when a slight figure with bared head stepped out of the door and stood looking at the intruder The man folded up his coat that it might serve as a pillow and was placing it in the prescribed position when the Rector spoke You ll have to get out of this The man looked up and stared Say Parson are you any relation to the Good Samaritan This was rather a poser a suitable reply was evidently not ready on the moment No I m not I m sorry to say but what s the matter with you Just broke Besides if I wasn t I don t see why I need pay a dollar for a bed when I have my own blanket What are you High Church or Low Church I m anything you like but you ll have to get out of this If you sleep there you ll roll over and crush my flowers But what are you Everything you don t like I guess No that you re not But the thing is if I let one of you fellows camp here I ll have a hundred in no time All right I don t mind sleeping inside the church if you don t want the other fellows to see me What could be done with such a man But I m going to have service at twelve o clock for any of the boys coming in from the creeks I don t mind the services singing won t keep me awake and as for sermons It looks as if I can t get rid of you I suppose I ll have to stand for it Roll up your blankets you can sleep inside after service As the clergyman turned to re enter the building he noticed Alice and her father regarding him and his guest with some amusement He advanced to them and held out his hand We arrived this evening and thought we should like to look you up and gain some knowledge of Dawson and the manners and customs of its people said Alice You have evidently been enjoying an exhibition of them Come in and see our church They entered the yard and walked towards the door watching the intruder wrestle with his bedding They passed into the church and to Alice it seemed fitting that this should be the first log building she had ever entered the first roof to cover her in the New World Being a thorough Churchwoman it was to her a matter of satisfaction and sentiment As they stood before the altar others entered whereupon their host looked at his watch It is almost time he said May we stay asked Alice Assuredly The night was cloudy outside and the church too dark for reading so the clergyman brought out and placed two candles upon the altar The father and daughter each noted the candlesticks were bottles How incongruous thought the Surgeon Major The one had evidently held gin the other whisky The service was short just a lesson and a hymn Only half a dozen were present When it came to the hymn the clergyman beckoned to Alice and her father Each accepted from the clerk s hand a bottle and a candle and he motioned them to stand on either side of him This they did he holding the hymn book They sang I need Thee every hour After the service the new comers waited for the clergyman and the three passed down towards the door The intruder was already making his bed Say Parson that wasn t bad he said What wasn t bad That there tune but I never thought you d confess it Confess what That you needed it every hour Isn t that what you meant by having the chechachoes hold the bottles No it wasn t The Parson was annoyed You get out of here in the morning or I ll throw you into the slough All right Pard Your friend seems somewhat facetious remarked Surgeon Major Peel Yes they are all friends of mine They all know me if they don t their friends do This man is a type of what I have to deal with Then they settled down to the business on which the Peels had called If you have the necessary supplies said the Parson a private hospital is the thing There is a great deal of sickness now The typhoid is getting bad too many living in the manner of our friend at the church Food poor and badly cooked general uncleanness hard trails and stampedes The Parson conducted the new comers to their boat and left them satisfied and almost contented Alice asked him as he was taking his leave if he knew John Berwick but had for answer No She wanted to inquire at the post office but could not get near enough on account of the long lines of men standing before the wickets postal affairs being in a state of chaos It was evidently more than possible that John had not received her letters or at any rate the communication which told of her coming On the morrow the Peels giving fulfilment to their intentions secured a building in Dawson and so saint George s Private Hospital came into being It was a matter of much detail Help and assistance of every kind was enormously dear They had changed their money into gold dust and each carried a poke Alice was astounded when she reckoned the equivalent of the charge made by the man who brought their heavy luggage Half an ounce of dust meant thirty shillings There were no idle hands in Dawson it was the hum of industry except with the loungers at the water front Alice worked hard and her work brought distraction Now she was near John Berwick at least she ought to be but had heard of so many cases of drowning deaths by fever and scurvy in that terrible country that she could only fear possibilities and eagerly scan every face she met She stared into the faces of men of uncouth beards and matted greasy hair and as was the custom of the country her gaze was returned All seeing her wondered what had brought this fragrant gentle English girl to Dawson She was so different from the women of the underworld hitherto the only representatives with one or two exceptions of womanhood in that place Her fresh complexion contrasted with their painted cheeks her simple grace with their brazenness and vulgarity Oh it was pitiful In the shops wherever she went she asked about John Berwick Only once was she in some measure successful I think there was a fellow by that name bought a bill of goods and said he would be back for them later one day not long ago He must be living near Dawson said the man Why do you say that eagerly asked Alice Because the grub he bought weren t the kind of grub men takes with them on long trips besides he didn t buy enough to last him long She thanked him and left her name and address in Dawson Alice was possessed of the faith that only death can kill and that faith gave her patience She buckled to her work and was content Had she been less industrious she might have found the trails up the Dome and to John but no sooner had the hospital opened than patients came pouring in Nurses of experience were impossible to obtain She and her father had to struggle with the help of only one woman and three men All were untrained and inexperienced CHAPTER XXII THE LAST STRAW One night George ran into the tent and shook life into John and Hugh They re here Who Poo Bah s gang At once the two were wide awake Hugh stuck his head out of the tent and saw a number of men walking down the creek carrying stakes over their shoulders He darted back and clambered into his clothes John followed his example Where s Frank asked Hugh George went to the tent door and gave a low whistle Frank made his appearance Each man armed himself with his two stakes and made towards the down hill limit of his claim and drove them in at their proper places One stake bore the legend I claim two hundred fifty feet down stream and one thousand feet up hill for placer mining purposes John Berwick Miner s License No T sixty four thousand eight hundred fifty nine The other was similar except that it claimed up stream The claims were staked in the small hours of July twelve in the year eighteen ninety eight the day of the great Dominion Creek stampede The party then ate a hasty meal and took food for luncheon At about four o clock they set out for Dawson a distance of forty miles They hoped to reach the city by six p m They passed the minions of the great grafter Travelling early gentlemen said one of them Not so many flies answered Hugh Occasionally wild eyed men passed them with a stride that seemed as if it could never tire This was an hour or two after John and his friends had set out These men had evidently been given the tip the night before and had begun to travel at once News spreads in a mining camp with amazing rapidity and the crowd of hurrying men grew greater as the party progressed It was also noted that the fever was most marked in those who felt themselves at the rear of the stampede Those in the lead carried nothing save a little axe their body s sustenance was in their pockets often consisting only of a few pots of beef extract When time for resting came the little axe would serve to make a spruce bed Covering was not needed in the summer as rest was taken in daytime often in the full glare of the sun a form of repose generally limited to negroes and savages The twelfth of July eighteen ninety eight was one of the hottest days of the hottest season Dawson had ever known The thermometer was nearly ninety in the shade The land was parched for water and the smoke of forest fires filled the air which seemed to burn the throats of those mad men They coughed as they hurried by The party passed the Bonanza Dome and commenced the decline into the Bonanza Valley The trail followed the hog s back which ends in Carmacks Forks the confluence of two branches of the Upper Bonanza The descent to them was rapid and the steep ascent of a thousand feet seemed terrible to the stampeders Yet up it they stormed and struggled till they fell exhausted Even in the glaring sun men lay dead beat panting They were twenty miles from Dawson twenty hard miles yet rested between them and their goal It seemed as if this stampede were born of frenzy in a last final effort of the desperate gold seekers of that year They were close to the end of the rainbow where lay prizes for a few There was no more of the old affected humour of the road Drawn faces and staring eyes were telling of soul strain It was the last scene of the last act of a real tragedy At the spring beneath a group of stunted spruce trees at which more or less every man who has sought the glittering dust of the Klondike has gained refreshment the party of four halted for lunch A dozen men were already about it in all postures of fatigue As soon as one got up and staggered on his place was occupied by a new comer who would gulp his fill of the blessed water and lie for a time inert They came and they went Not a word was said Where are you stampeding to John at last asked one who seemed less exhausted than the others I don t know just following the crowd Something doing on Dominion they say the hillsides Some say the creek claims held by the Government are being thrown open but I guess not Just following the crowd It is ever the way in gold rushes No wonder the man who had advised them to keep on going till they struck saint Michael s had said it was a disease They passed on down the Bonanza trail soon the majority of the people met were other than the stampeders The stampeders were in the crowd but the bulk were those engaged in the ordinary economic development of Bonanza They passed from the Valley of Bonanza after each had contributed the usual twenty five cents to the coffers of Poo Bah Here they were but a mile or two from Dawson and the flood of stampeders had passed As they approached the ferry they noticed a group of men standing before a cabin evidently examining something They joined the crowd and saw a little woman with an infant in her arms My look at the baby said an individual bearing the superior dignity of an old timer it s the first white baby I ve seen in six year kind of makes me think of home You say it was born inside here Yes right here in this cabin where my husband and I have wintered He is off on the stampede I ve only been in the country two months yet the sight of that baby makes me think of a land where there ain t no Bonanza Creek trail sighed a chechacho Ain t you frightened to live here alone No Nobody will harm a respectable woman in Dawson The speaker s face shone with pride which was not all that of motherhood The old timer threw a nugget of gold on the baby s breast as he walked away desiring that the mother should buy the child something The contribution was becoming general when the mother protested She knew there were many in the crowd who could not afford such a gift and that any miner would part with his last cent rather than appear before his fellows as lacking in generosity or holding anything but a contempt for money To cross Poo Bah s ferry cost each person an additional twenty five cents There was none other than Poo Bah s ferry for his franchise was exclusive Many impoverished prospectors had attempted to retrieve their fortunes by plying at the river but were stopped After eating their evening meal at the home camp the party passed down into the city to take their places in the line before the Gold Commissioner s office None of the Dominion Creek stampeders had yet arrived and the line was its usual length They knew that ere the morning arrived the line would be much increased and hundreds would have arrived within twenty four hours So as nine o clock came they all lay down at full length on the earth and slept indifferent to the current of life about them This was the life of the goldfields absolute lack of conventionality and indifference to social distinction Just before John fell asleep he noticed some men slipping into the Gold Commissioner s office by a side door among whom were Hardman and the Cap Mentioning this on the day following Hugh remarked that they had stayed in the office till late In the morning a policeman was consulted and Frank was commissioned to leave his place in the line visit a shop and buy tinned meat and biscuit The policeman would recognize Frank when he returned and see that he got his place So the friends secured their morning meal As was expected the morning saw the arrival of the first of the Dominion Creek stampeders they had staked their claims and returned to add to the length of the waiting line Their faces and appearance told something of the terrors of their experience Bodies limp and eyes glazed faces wan and expressionless these were the result of thirty six hours of intense muscular and nervous strain The gold frenzy is the hardest harshest of tax masters drawing its victims into such self inflicted labour as if imposed by an employer would rouse the protests of civilized humanity Such toil breeds the determination to have and to hold what is justly won develops sympathy for the rights of others and will push aside the laws of custom and society if they stand in the way of justice The office doors were opened and the slow procession began It was an hour past noon when John and his three companions stood before the wicket where the whiskered Hardman was at work Hugh came first John next then George lastly Frank We want to record hillsides on Dominion said Hugh What numbers I have lower half fifty below centre discovery left limit and my friend here has upper half Hardman grabbed a book and turned over the leaves to the space allotted these claims These claims are already recorded which answer was not unexpected When were they staked Fatigued though he was Hugh s face was livid with anger At one minute past midnight of the eleventh of July eighteen ninety eight No they wasn t Well that is what the affidavit says which I entered late yesterday afternoon John now interposed We have been camped on this ground for three weeks and have been on continuous watch We staked these claims at four A M yesterday No stakes were in the ground when we staked I can t help that Joseph Trudean swears he staked one and Ole Anderson swears he staked the other Say have these claims been transferred asked Hugh Yes each has been sold to James C Beecher barrister of Dawson And the consideration One dollar Which would not buy a meal in Dawson Sick and beaten John and Hugh stepped aside George and Frank passed to the slaughter Their friends waited for them The time to wait was not long the second two being even more quickly disposed of than the first They went home and ate a meal Even Frank was reduced to seriousness his only possible return to cheerfulness being when he said He he I told you it was time Uncle Sam came and took Canada John Berwick felt himself prompted to say Amen They early sought repose but about nine in the evening John arose and dressed himself He had slept but four hours when he suddenly awakened Something called him to action Hugh awakened too and asked the time He then also arose as did the others No one explained why he was dressing or what he intended to do Without words each knew they were going to the city the call was on them to enter the haunts of men to speak of their wrongs and to be heard They had tea and set out over the trail called after the great Alaska Commercial Company who built it to the city The flowers that bloomed by the wayside drew the eyes of John who even in this hour of disappointment and anger was alive to the beauties of nature The dog roses great in size and delicate in colour greeted him as old friends and carried his mind to England and to Alice The atmosphere of Dawson was latent with strong emotion There was no noise A malamoot howled and those hearing him shuddered Men stood in groups and talked their tones were low their eyes alert But in the Borealis Saloon Joseph Andrews jumped upon the bar and addressed the house That he suspended the dance which brought the proprietor many hundreds of dollars daily was overlooked in the face of national disaster for these men of Dawson had become as a nation united and distinctive John Berwick and his friends were drawn by the voice that came through the door of Dawson s most popular rendezvous Straining to look over the heads and shoulders in front of them they saw a man red in face through the strain of his oratory standing on the bar and gesticulating A crowd of eager men listened to him intently I tell you fellows from South Africa that the Government of this here country has got that of Paul Kruger done to a finish Oom Paul is a genius at grafting but where does he figure with his coarse schemes of dynamite monopolies in comparison with the liquor law handed out by the gang of thugs and highway robbers who run this country I tell you the Octopus and his liquor permit system has got Paul Kruger beaten to death Permit system permit system permit system nothing Graft graft graft that s what it is graft The Octopus tells the good ladies down East that he doesn t approve of the liquor traffic that he won t allow any liquor to go into this country unless by special permit from him But what are these permits They re handed out in ten thousand gallon blocks and there s enough whisky in Dawson City and on the way here to float a battleship And who gets the permits His own pals and the Jews Jews gentlemen Jews and the quid pro quo is a contribution to this same Octopus s electioneering fund Here gentlemen under a surface showing of morality and pink tea temperance are true fissure veins of graft assaying high in craft and subtlety Men of the Yukon are we going to stand for it Have we got to stand for it There are fifty thousand of us gentlemen Are we yelping coyotes or are we men The speaker paused that his words might sink in His audience answered with a yell and then were hushed again But after all this liquor business is only a marker on the rest only a token Dominion Creek hillsides Dominion Creek hillsides is where Poo Bah our own Octopus s own Man Friday has got in his fine work Orders came from Ottawa that these claims were to be thrown open and posters were printed and stuck up saying the time was July fourteenth Then when the twelfth came round somebody finds a mistake was made and the proper date is the twelfth We rush the creek gentlemen and stake what Nothing we get nothing There are fifty thousand of us gentlemen and every man has two rifles and a shot gun Are we going to stand for it No was the general shout We ve all been over the Passes and we ve run chances big chances most of us have had a handshake with death cold grimy death Can t we shake hands once again Are we men or only mangy malamoots He paused but there was no cheer at this moment They were all too eager for him to continue What is our situation gentlemen Look at our situation We re two thousand miles from nowhere and those two thousand miles are mountains snow and glaciers Talk about Napoleon s retreat from Moscow That was just a game of ping pong compared to marching an army across country from back East to the Yukon just a little lally gag The White Pass and the Chilkoot Pass and the mouth of the Yukon belong to Uncle Sam At the mention of Uncle Sam a great cheer went up a mighty shout Uncle Sam Hurrah for Uncle Sam he won t tax our gold No no gentlemen the Republic of the North a Republic of the North we can work out the mines before trouble can come to us said the speaker The Klondike Free State The Klondike Free State shouted a man The crowd took up the cry Chaos reigned John Berwick who had pushed his way through the crowd sprang upon the bar beside Joseph Andrews the orator He raised his hand for silence CHAPTER XXIII REVOLUTION Is a man s life to be mere existence breathing and the eating of food with hours of repose or is it to be striving after some ideal whether of ambition or duty Strife surely Man spends his life in toil the results of his labour represent his life Imagine for one moment that we are standing upon Dawson s Dome The audience began to cough and shuffle This exordium was unusual The men seemed restless and then as if with an unanimous impulse they appeared to settle to attention John went on We turn our faces to the north and view a mass of gorgeous colouring the shield of the day that is past and the herald of the day that is to come To the south and east and west this beauty is reflected in blended tints sinking into valleys purple and silent Whence came these valleys They mark the erosion of ages as a day is to a thousand years so is the life of man on earth to the time the hand of God has been at work carving the original plain And what are the fruits of His labour One of them is gold gold that you and I may win During the ages when the land where most of us were born was under ice the work went on the rains fell and flowed to the sea and out of all those ages of preparation and waiting one result appears to us and that is gold There was an interruption or two but the bulk of the audience clamoured for silence and got it God is just He who robs a man of the results of his labour is a murderer to this extent that he takes a portion of his realized life I need not remind you my friends of our labours in reaching this land and the sacrifices we have made Some of us have mortgaged our homes even sold our all to make this effort Many of us have spent the best years of our adult life in this quest of nature s treasure and in the hour of consummation have been robbed robbed of our efforts The result of those years has been torn from us callously brutally Such corruption can only be remedied in one way Thou shalt not kill is the Divine decree But we have to get justice There came from the audience words of earnest agreement The harangue of Joseph Andrews had awakened the frenzy of the crowd The tones and the serious presence of John Berwick appealed to their minds while his argument wakened the thought of moral right and far better than rhetoric could do steeled their resolves John told simply briefly the history of gold mining in Australia and of the many times corruption had wrecked individual fortunes Justice primarily had to do with the rights of the individual Countless lives had been lost in the past ages to establish that principle The conditions in the Klondike were now worse than any that had troubled Australia but there as in the Klondike the distance between the mining fields and the seat of Government had been too great and modes of communication too slow to bring effective remedies The agents of betterment found the diggings depleted and the wrongs complained of now irreparable But there need not be any shedding of blood that fact he emphasized What they must do was organize and so win thousands to their cause against the hundreds under the orders of the established and ineffective authorities But we need a head a strong heart to rule John was saying You re the man a voice shouted You re the man a hundred echoed Parson Jack Parson Jack I knew he had something in him Through the uncertain light John could distinguish Long Shorty So it happened that Berwick became the head of the revolutionists As he sprang down from the bar the excited men crushed round him He whispered a rendezvous to a dozen of the most eager Dawson s Dome to morrow noon That night Smoothbore paced his room The scandal of the Dominion Creek hillsides was known to him and he speculated on its being the last straw on the back of that patient camel the honest prospector There was a knock on the door He told the new comer to enter It was Sergeant Galbraith in civilian clothes There was a meeting in the Borealis to night sir Joseph Andrews was talking Did he say much A little more than usual sir Did he stir them up They did a lot of yelling They always do when he talks Anything else There was another speaker sir Who Don t know sir But you have charge of the Secret Service You placed a man on his trail Yes sir Constable Hope What did the stranger say He talked philosophy Philosophy Yes he s an Australian Did he rouse them They did not say much he held them quiet Any sedition Yes sir He says the man who steals another man s work is a murderer in that he takes a portion of his life and he quoted the Bible The Sergeant saluted and retired Smoothbore paced his room A man who could silence a Dawson crowd one who quoted the Bible was a man to be watched Smoothbore knew his duty it was to his sovereign and his sovereign s authority it was in his province to maintain the integrity of his sovereign s empire He knew that many of his men sympathized with the miners and that the miners were conscious of this sympathy He knew also that many of the miners believed in the case of an uprising of the people that the opposition of the police would be merely nominal The question what action he should take had been facetiously asked him many times but he had allowed no man to read his mind The iniquities of the liquor permit system were known to him for in his official capacity he had to enforce the law The rascality in the Gold Commissioner s office and the graft of the toll bridge and the Bonanza Creek trail all all were known to him and were bad bad thoroughly bad Villainy barefaced or subtle permeated officialdom but officialdom he must protect There was no real hesitancy although he recognized both sides of the question He was going to do his duty and he knew that his men would follow him Twenty men were present on the Dome at the time appointed No one had marked their coming and it would not have mattered if they had Men often climbed the Dome to spy out the land or to locate the timber that grew upon its sides for it would soon be winter and logs were already being cut and hauled From the Dome all who were approaching could be seen there were no walls with ears at that place John moved a resolution that a council be formed representative of the four nationalities Australian English Canadian and the United States He and George would canvass the Australians and English Hugh said he and Joseph Andrews would work among the Canadians Long Shorty thought he could round up a host of Americans and Frank Corte said he would back him up These were men who would form the council The first thing to do was to canvass the town and find out how many could be won to the cause after which another meeting would be held and progress reported Following this the creeks were to be gone over To prevent bloodshed the force must be overwhelming Bonanza Hunker and Eldorado would probably not yield many helpers These creeks had been staked before the advent of Poo Bah and the police had given records The owners had no complaint Nothing more than moral support could be counted from these But on the new creeks Dominion Sulphur Indian River Australia Eureka Too Much Gold All Gold and the rest there was little doubt that the support of thousands could be obtained On the hillsides of Bonanza and Hunker startling discoveries had recently been made Gold Hill was proved enormously rich Adams Hill Magnet Hill and Monte Cristo Hill were all of great potential wealth The White Channel was being discovered and the rights of location were hard to establish if not impossible In the gambling and dance halls clerks of the Gold Commissioner s office were nightly to be seen squandering money on gambling and women Their wage was two dollars per day and food yet many of them rather lived in the hotels at a cost of fifteen dollars per diem All this explained the difficulty of obtaining record The rightful owners of the newly discovered property were mostly residents of Dawson employing lawyers in their attempt to obtain just rights These men were the most desperate Then there were the Forty Mile Glacier and Twelve Mile Creeks There was a large number on Glacier and Forty Mile Creeks The nature of the discussion was necessarily wide John insisted that they all should devote attention to the town for the first few days Each man gained as an adherent should be questioned as to his arms and ammunition the capacity of his rifle and the quantity of his ammunition Notes were to be taken of these details Only by such means could they estimate what might be expected from the men on the creeks The need of caution was expressed by all on all No word of what was doing should be allowed to reach the police and every possible adherent must be carefully sounded ere he was taken into confidence John tarried on the Dome after the meeting He requested George Frank and Hugh to post to the home camp and prepare a meal A tremendous responsibility had come to him in the last few hours and now that action had been taken he wished to meditate upon it He had taken a great step and could only contemplate a result far reaching When the last man had disappeared among the timber below he arose from his seat and wandered towards the wooded gulch to the north of the Dome which he had partly explored in the days of his convalescence He thought he remembered something He found it again a cleft in the rock By the aid of a few poles and brush and a little moss it would become a fair habitation his den David therefore departed thence and escaped to the Cave Adullam and every one that was in distress and every one that was in debt and every one that was discontented gathered themselves unto him Was he to be another David He sought the home trail and as he ate his meal told his companions that he would camp alone no one else had better be with him in the Cave of Adullam That afternoon he placed an outfit on his back and walked to his new lonely abode Time was precious so he would not allow any of his companions to assist him but rather requested that they should turn immediately to their work of organization Besides it was his humour to be alone As he chopped the trees necessary to complete his den his mind conceived many things Fond recollections came and they led to a contemplation of the purposes of his life Was he ever to be useful creative Instinctively his mind avoided the immediate issue of events After all the time for thought had given place to the time for action CHAPTER XXIV WITHIN THE BARRACKS When Constable Hope had made his report upon Berwick s abiding place and added to it particulars as to his visitors and the council held on the Dome Smoothbore recognized that he had to do with a man of more than ordinary character and intelligence In the first place a council held upon the Dome s summit in broad daylight was not susceptible to eavesdropping As a base of assault upon the town a modern rifle might drop a bullet into the barrack yard There were possibly fifty thousand men against less than two hundred As a matter of fact six hundred officers and men were on their way to the Yukon via the Stikeen route that is if they had not got cold feet and turned back In any case such military outfits were of little good Being a staunch believer in the Police Smoothbore had little faith in the Militia The report of the meeting on the Dome was to the effect that council had been held and that the different parties attending it had immediately left town Berwick s former residence had been abandoned and its other occupants who had been at the meeting were not to be seen in any of the dance halls or gambling saloons Crossing the quadrangle of the Barracks from the orderly room towards his own private office immediately after reading the report of Constable Hope Smoothbore met Inspector Herbert the officer of the day Smoothbore returned the other s salute and stopped which brought Herbert to a standstill also and then glancing over his shoulder at the Dome towering behind the town inquired Herbert how would you like leading a squad of men against a trenched position on the top of the Dome The only way a man could storm that position would be by flying machine and they re not invented yet But you might cut off the enemy s supplies that is if you had enough men or their water there is no water except in the draw at the back Were you thinking of having some manoeuvres sir Manoeuvres may be made necessary by the dread realities of war Herbert opened his eyes wide and looked at his chief Smoothbore did not return his gaze he was still looking intently at the top of the hill where he could see a flag staff and the figure of a man Herbert followed his gaze noted the human figure and made to take his military glasses from their case But his superior checked him Don t look up there with your glasses some one may have his on us You don t mean that you seriously fear an insurrection Herbert then exclaimed that these dirty prospectors will show fight Herbert had a contempt for the populace similar to that of Louis XV Smoothbore turned to him There are as many known murderers in Dawson as there are mounted police in the whole of the Yukon On that hill there is a man who quotes Scripture can probably string out his pedigree to the Conquest and propounds the doctrine that the man who steals another s substance steals that portion of his life which went to the acquiring of that substance This is a dangerous doctrine because it makes our grafters murderers The great majority of his followers will absorb this doctrine without question Every one of the discontented is ready to lay the responsibility of his non success on the shoulders of the officials God knows we have real grafting and grafters enough but if you would hear each separate tale of woe or the different tales of woe that each malcontent will unburden himself of at the least excuse and add the whole together the sum would involve twice the number of claims at present made in the Yukon Valley It does not matter that these injuries are many of them fancied the effect upon the possessor of the delusion is the same These men have endured countless hardships on the trail they have many of them staked their all in the venture The hopes they encouraged within themselves as they struggled to the goal have given place to dejection Now they find themselves at the end of their resources and their ways are blocked by corruption Can you not understand how little organized agitation will ferment rebellion And they have abundant ammunition commented Herbert ever practical They brought a great supply with them thinking to kill game on the way They met little or none and consequently have their ammunition unspent Look in at any of the second hand shops and you will find numbers of the highest class of modern rifles with stacks of ammunition on sale at half their original cost Then you really fear rebellion Not fear but I think rebellion is not improbable Officers of the mounted police don t fear anything this side of the Great Divide and the speaker smiled Would it not be well to arrest the ringleaders and nip the thing in the bud asked the Inspector We have no charge to lay against them except the voicing of sedition and there was only one man who did so And if we did arrest him no it would not do Besides sedition there are enough people voicing sedition within earshot of Whitehall to keep the prisons of England filled were they all arrested It would be a hard thing to get a jury to convict on a charge of sedition With this the Commandant continued his way to his office Smoothbore sat at his desk and filled his pipe His conversation with his Inspector had not dispelled his apprehensions far from it He must do something He turned to the constable who was busy with papers at a neighbouring desk and sent him for Sergeant Galbraith In the meantime he sat and thought There were few Canadians in the total population of the Yukon while the English and Australians were the most bitter against the existing wrongs and foremost in their utterances of protest In due time Sergeant Galbraith entered and saluted Smoothbore turned to him Constable Hope has not been able to find any trace of the associates of Berwick at their tent nor in the dance halls He has not sir They appear to have left town It is clear that they are organizing which means trouble What is Hope doing Detailed to watch the Dome sir You had better put another man on that job and send Hope to the Forks and on through to Dominion if needs be to see if he can pick up any trace of these men and if so to ascertain what they are doing He might travel in plain clothes It is possible he may give the appearance of being a likely recruit for the Klondike Free State Very good sir Do you see any signs of organization Nothing further sir Well have a look in at these second hand shops that have the most rifles and ammunition in stock and size up what they have Then you can see later if much is being sold You might ask the proprietors to find out where the purchasers say they are going The explanation for your questions will be that you understand there has been a new find made somewhere and that you wish to ascertain where it is Very good sir There could be no doubt that if a number of rebels entrenched themselves on the summit of the Dome there would be no dislodging them while they could drop bullets into any part of the town including the Police Barracks Smoothbore had small hopes of securing any number of recruits from the civilian population No the civilian population would take little hand in suppressing a rising There was no end to be served by the Police making the first move they could only wait and watch hoping for something to turn up The humour of the malcontents might change some new distraction might spring up The British Empire had been on the verge of collapse a score of times but always something had happened to floor the prophets He was quite ready to believe that the man at the head of the new movement this John Berwick was steadfast in his affection for the British Crown quite possibly his action in the matter grew out of his loyalty And being right in this reflection goes to show how worldly wise the Police Commandant really was That in a crisis such as was being developed he proved strong enough to lie low illustrates the moral and physical courage of the man CHAPTER XXV RECRUITING That Frank Hugh and George had not returned to their tent the night after the council of war on the Dome was due to nothing more than the fact that they had gone to town with Long Shorty and had stayed the night in his cabin They did not appear in the saloons and dance halls because they had decided upon Baxter s Free Library as down town headquarters Hence it was that two astute policemen had made wrong deductions and while Constable Hope was haunting the resorts on the creeks for them they were actually in the heart of the metropolis The selection of Baxter s Free Library was the result of the astuteness of Long Shorty He knew the place Only in Dawson would it have been worthy of the name of library as the number of volumes was limited to a score or so There were also several newspapers there which though thumbed and scrawled upon and tattered were the latest the camp contained Access to these newspapers and books was free the revenue of the establishment being derived from a lunch counter As the building was located one street back from that which ran along the water front the rent paid was comparatively small and the proprietor was able to serve a roll and a cup of coffee for fifty cents and a plate of stew made of bully beef or pork and beans for a dollar and a half which was about thirty three per cent cheaper than fashionable prices The combination of comparatively cheap food and free reading drew to Baxter s many of those who had ample time upon their hands with little or no money in their pockets and who were unwilling or unable to perform the heavy labour of mining operations on the creeks They were of the educated and semi educated classes and among their motley members Long Shorty guessed that many desperate characters might be found A winter the most severe in which white people lived would be upon them in a few short months The plan of campaign decided upon was that each of the four conspirators should enter the reading room engage in reading and gradually draw possible recruits into conversation which in free and easy Dawson would not be difficult to do Long Shorty was not long in picking out his man He seemed the ordinary type of prospector well set up and muscular his dress was of good quality by which it was to be inferred that his outfit would be large and in all probability would include a rifle or two with ammunition He was reading a copy of Shakespeare Long Shorty sat beside him and picked up a copy of the Bible Bibles and the works of William Shakespeare were the most common volumes in Dawson in the summer of ninety eight Long Shorty turned over the pages read a verse then put down the book and sighed Well stranger he said what do you think of things Damned bad They sure are but what are you going to do about it Just about the same as the rest get out of the country as soon as I can Isn t that what you re going to do I guess so after I ve made my pile Well if you get away with a pile I reckon you ll have to make two one for yourself and one for the grafters There may be a change You must have been listening to the fellow down at the Borealis the other night Perhaps I was said Long Shorty significantly And you think those fellows will ever do more than talk Well you know how many police there are and how many there are of the others The police are armed with old Winchesters twenty years behind the times Looks like the insurrectoes might have a chance if they got together and had ammunition and rifles There are lots of both among the crowd I guess I have a three hundred three and a thousand cartridges that is five shots for every policeman in the country He spoke with some bitterness Long Shorty rightly concluded that here was a spirit who only wanted a leader To make doubly sure he thought he would draw him a little and see how much real mutiny was in his heart so he said But there are the claim owners grafters and other civilians who might aid the police Not much The claim owners wouldn t except possibly those who got their holdings through Poo Bah The fellows who got their claims straight would know a new Government would do them more good than harm The speaker then as if tired of politics pointedly went on with his reading his mind was absorbing the philosophy of the melancholy Jacques Long Shorty s sensibilities were not of the finest and he refused to consider the conversation closed so he asked the direct question What would you do if the boys got up Nothing I d do nothing It s no use considering it I m off down the river on a steamer leaving to morrow I m going to work my way as a wood passer to saint Michael s after which I ll trust to luck for getting to Frisco But if the boys are really going to rise they have my good wishes I tried to sell my rifle to day and the best offer I could get was five dollars and I told the fellow I d chuck it into the Yukon first If you are going to stay I ll make you a present of it to be given to the boys if they want it The man was going home Long Shorty felt there was no use in attempting to hold him so he answered in such a manner as to accept the offer and yet not compromise himself He said I don t mind taking the rifle and the cartridges and holding them in case things do happen though I may be away on the creeks at the time All right I leave them with Baxter here you can call for them to morrow Again he returned to the Forest of Arden and Long Shorty permitted the conversation to close In the meantime the other three had been hard at work George met one Australian whose sentiments were so pronounced that he quickly closed with him and as the recruit knew several others in the library the agitation made good progress It was agreed by the reformers and the new recruits that they should all meet later in the day at Lookout Point which was the angle of the Klondike Bluffs where the valley of the Klondike met that of the Yukon In later years a seat and a flag staff were erected there and it became a favourite trysting place for young men and maidens engaged in another quest than that of gold This arrangement settled George set off to report to Berwick while the others still looking for more of the rightly disaffected drifted into the different saloons Berwick was delighted at their present success and was eager to meet the party at Lookout Point He felt that if so many adherents could be gained by such a small canvass three or four thousand devoted armed men at least could be recruited from Dawson and its environs The outlook was hopeful CHAPTER XXVI LOCATED In due course that is three or four days afterwards Constable Hope returned from the creeks with the report that there was no trace to be found of the allies of John Berwick To Smoothbore this was not evidence of any abandonment of the conspiracy He was convinced that Berwick meant business There was besides a strange quietude reigning over Dawson So mercurial a population could not have let its excitement subside and disappear in that short time On the other hand Inspector Herbert was confident enough to be facetious at the expense of the enemies of officialdom When Smoothbore told him that Hope s expedition had no result he said I thought as much you ll find the reputed leader has some fool theory of the origin of gold and is camped on the Dome to receive inspiration while his followers have slipped off down the river for the good of their healths Perhaps replied Smoothbore as he glanced at the Dome Perhaps and they parted The old man is a bit locoed on this rebellion theory mused Herbert as he went along It s strange in a man who has seen so much service and with him it is not nerves Just then Herbert happened to glance up at the Dome By Jove what a position for a couple of maxims One hundred men could stand off ten thousand I wonder There are thousands of men starving with many too proud to beg and little to spare even for them What would a successful revolution mean For one thing it would establish a multitude of openings in the new Civil Service with chances of graft It would mean a new police force or militia perhaps both the members of which would at least be fed It is not a case so much of righting wrong as of getting for these fellows a piece of the pumpkin Taking that view of it it looks serious What if the old man were right Such were the thoughts that flashed through Herbert s mind Almost within a minute after Smoothbore had left him he was wavering in his opinions now he was striding in pursuit of him Well what do you think we had better do about it asked the Commandant after he had heard the changed opinions of his Inspector Arrest the leaders The conversation was interrupted by a knock at the office door which was followed by the entrance of Constable Hope quite in a fluster I have located Berwick s friends sir he reported in fact he was with them when I spotted them They were all in Baxter s Free Library and they are up to something Berwick sits reading the Bible and every now and then one of his aides de camp comes up and whispers in his ear and then goes away to begin opening conversation with some pilgrim I sat down thinking one of them might come to me with his talk but no results sir Well now you have them located take two good men in plain clothes and point the gang out to them in fact you might take four so that henceforth they can be easily traced Detail one man to Berwick and two to the others Good man that remarked Herbert when Hope had left their presence Yes it would be a pity to have him in the Army My guess seems to have been wrong as to the movements of the gang Smoothbore made no comment on this but asked Would you arrest them now Yes I am afraid I must still disagree with you was the Chief s answer and Herbert shortly after went away Constable Hope collected together four of his comrades told them to dress in civilian clothes and follow him They did so and joined the crowd in Baxter s In due time the four policemen had registered in their memory the features of John Berwick and his followers Constable Hope then told off three men according to instructions and with the remaining policeman left the place Who are those fellows asked the Constable who accompanied Hope Berwick is the prospective liberator of the oppressed and down trodden miner He can talk on occasions in fact I heard him and nearly determined to jump my uniform What do they propose to do Send the police down the river and set up for themselves Cheerful for us Do you think they will make the effort Smoothbore seems to take them seriously and I think Herbert is coming to think the same way What will Smoothbore do Stand pat What else would he do What would you or I do and Constable Hope looked at his companion in a manner not complimentary The outfit would surely get licked in the end To be sure they would but in the meantime two years how much could you graft in two years This query admitted of no reply and lacking a further word from his companion Constable Hope continued Fifty miles ten hours on the river and you are in the land of Uncle Sam See Yes I see If you think over it a bit you will see more Yes I guess my vision would enlarge and you say Smoothbore is only standing pat I do Funny It s not funny it s the only thing to do they have not begun to mass their forces yet When they do we might have some evidence Shortly after Hope and Inspector Herbert had left Smoothbore Sergeant Galbraith knocked at the office door and reported I ve looked into the second hand shops and sized up their ammunition Rosenbaum on Second Street reports considerable buying lately and so does Hobson on Third Avenue In fact sir they appeared to be somewhat excited The Jew thought there was a strike up the Klondike and the Cockney thought there must be a stampede up the Stewart Perhaps these stories may be right No sir I think not The town patrol reported to day two fellows in from Wind City sir on the Edmonton Trail and I looked them up They had not met any fellows going up the Stewart that is any number worth mentioning Then this looks like corroborative evidence at least the trouble is reaching such a stage as to make it advisable to get on the defensive also we must let the men know what seems likely to happen Have the town patrol keep their eyes on all men carrying rifles Very good sir Report direct to me anything that appears of interest Yes sir And Sergeant what about those fellows who arrived from Edmonton They were in a very bad state sir Of their party of fourteen they were the only survivors They wintered at Wind City got scurvy and all died but four and of the four these two only remain The other two were drowned in a rapid Poor fellows That will do Sergeant Smoothbore was left to his recollections and general musings Gold gold the price that is paid for it Fifty thousand men in this stampede two hundred and fifty thousand people affected homes devastated affections torn asunder Hundreds dead by scurvy or drowning thousands with constitutions wrecked The gold is not worth the candle with the Trusts betrayed and morals twisted It is not worth it Look at this little Yukon district remote from the world Our genesis was of gold it would seem our dissolution will be through the same agent The love of gold that it may command luxury is a source of overwhelming evil it feeds our vices that is pretty well all that can be said of this insensate greediness But this is not practical he continued moving I must give orders that the men pay special attention to their rifles and side arms and he went off at once to the orderly office The time had come for every preparation to be made The Commandant considered the position There was no scope for fortifying the Barracks The buildings were of logs loopholes could be made by the simple process of pushing a rifle barrel through the mortar The main thing was that the police should appear to be unconscious of the movement on foot One action he determined upon and that was the purchase of the best rifles and ammunition in the shops this to be accomplished by secret agents This was not entirely intended to keep arms from Berwick s men for the enemy would still have enough ammunition to exterminate the police force But the arms of the police were not modern CHAPTER XXVII THE WOOD PILE The Wood pile was an institution almost as famous with the underworld as Dawson itself From saint Michael s to Frisco and up and down the Yukon River its reputation held At the mention of its name the pale and sickly faces of the vicious became still paler and more sickly when they did not flush with angry hatred The Wood pile was the prison called so because the inmates given hard labour worked out their debt to society by sawing wood In cold winter weather the winter of the sub Arctic with the thermometer forty degrees below zero the process was no joke The great majority of the prisoners were United States citizens in the souls of whom many fourths of July had engendered a contempt for the British uniform To be herded by a yellow leg with a rifle and made to saw wood to keep the oppressor warm was a circumstance that rankled Five Ace Dan called for brevity s sake Five Ace was on the Wood pile One day Five Ace was taking a hand in a Poker game and by some mischance one of the other players detected him extracting a card from his sleeve and charged him with the offence There was of course a row whereupon Five Ace drew a revolver and pointed it at his adversary with the words adorned with some special expletives If I had you across the line I d fill you full of holes Whereat the man addressed came back with the words uttered with a leer and a hiss But we ain t See Five Ace was surely in hard luck for a policeman heard the noise of the row and quickly gathered him in Smoothbore gave him three months on the Wood pile with a blue ticket at the end of that term A blue ticket meant that the authorities requested the recipient to leave the country an invitation rarely not taken advantage of But Five Ace was serving his term in the summer months when fuel was not a pressing necessity and the number of prisoners was large The stock employment of the gang was drawing gravel from the banks of the Yukon and carrying it in barrows to the quadrangle of the Barracks or the road bed of the main street While climatic conditions were infinitely better during the summer months than they were in winter this was not an unmixed blessing to Five Ace for while the winter months were dark and drear and cold the coldness darkness and dreariness together with the abundance of clothing it was necessary for the prisoners to wear made it hard for their persons to be recognized by passers by On the other hand during the bright summer days the situation was very embarrassing and it is easy to believe that any one holding strong ideas on the rights of man a true citizen that is to say of the United States so imprisoned was ready for any desperate venture If it came to the killing of a yellow leg or two what matter There were no greater or more glorious people on God s green earth than the citizens of the United States Five Ace was quite ready to pose as a hero and martyr when opportunity served Long Shorty happened to be a friend of Five Ace Dan not that he consorted with tin horns but Dan hadn t always been what he was now and anyway there wasn t much harm in pulling off a trick once in a while The officials in this country were always robbing people so why should not he put in a hand One day as Long Shorty was prospecting for recruits he recognized Five Ace among the gang employed in the gravel pit and quick as a flash the idea came that it would be well to have an ally among the prisoners How to get into communication with Five Ace was a matter demanding consideration it would not do to make a mess of things through any little mistake at the beginning So he walked away pondering and sat down and reviewed the situation from afar in other words he watched the prisoners and noted their movements There were about eight in this particular band over whom stood a policeman The process was for the prisoners to file down to the shore of the river fill their barrows and march back again Each man returned to the spot he had left and picked up the tools he had been working with The best means to get a word with Five Ace was by means of a note provided the note did not fall into the hands of the police Long Shorty soon came to his decision The note must not be compromising This is what Long Shorty wrote The Marmot has generally two entrances to his burrow the yellow leg has only one Some day soon something is going to happen but in the meantime the hunters with rifles would like to know if the yellow legs are wise to the game Where the seed is sown there will the flower grow and I expect response to this where I sow it at dinner hour I will look for it After setting down this on a piece of paper Long Shorty not a little proud of his achievement rumpled it up with another piece of blank paper and enclosed a small piece of lead pencil This was because prisoners were not always allowed paper and pencil After the little parcel was ready Long Shorty walked down stream to where there was a canoe belonging to a man he knew He borrowed the craft and began poling up stream towards the mouth of the Klondike He had noted that the site of Five Ace s labour was very near the river so that when he passed the spot he could have stepped on the tools with which the convict worked A labourer toiling with pick and shovel first loosens the soil with the pick and then uses the shovel The astute mind of Long Shorty conceived that if he dropped the paper close to where the hand of the toiler as he grasped the shovel would be events would work out as they did Five Ace on returning with the empty barrow took up his pick and began to work and while he was scratching the ground in the leisurely manner of the convict his eye saw the paper He judged that its appearance was possibly connected with Long Shorty who was hanging about watching So with the slyness proper to his fraternity he took up the shovel and managed to smuggle and hide away the parcel by slipping it down his neck When Five Ace had an opportunity he read the missive and his breast swelled Here was evidently an invitation for him to join a rising against the oppressors If successful it would mean that an honest fellow could shoot down a black leg and get away Judge Lynch would sit in the Yukon By all means things must be kept quiet Five Ace felt sure he could get the other prisoners to turn against their guard when the proper time came One man might get shot but if he were careful it need not be himself Long Shorty had the idea that Five Ace Dan and his fellow prisoners might in the case of a rising outside carry out some portion of a general move by striking a blow within On the other hand while Five Ace believed he was the child of a race of patriots and felt himself a champion of liberty with a possibility of shining before posterity his first and foremost idea was always his own liberty He wrote a note and left it as directed where Long Shorty secured it and this is what it said The Beaver is working with no thought of danger If his dam is broken in spots he will fix it To drive him out you must make a clean job You have friends who will help but you must keep them posted Five Ace had evidently the same ideas as the leader of the insurrection that a sudden display of force thousands strong would make the position at the Barracks untenable and force a surrender The following day Long Shorty replied Many years ago the south face slid off the Dome and many ingins went to the happy hunting grounds Some day something may slide off the Dome and keep on going till it hits the Barracks and bumps it into the Klondike I will look out for things that are to happen so that those in the Barracks will know what to prepare for In case they can help I will let them know All of which duly fell into the hands of Five Ace Dan and conveyed to him the true situation of affairs Had it fallen into those of the police it would have appeared as mere nonsense the scribbling of some prospector whose hardships had affected his reason That is what Long Shorty thought CHAPTER XXVIII A COUNCIL OF WAR Within a few days fifteen hundred men in Dawson had signified their readiness to act for a new Government Another thousand could readily be counted upon from the creeks Twenty five hundred well armed and determined men entrenched at the top of the Dome could withstand an army To attack them armed as they were with long range sporting rifles would be on the part of the police madness It was noon on a Saturday when Long Shorty left his last note to Five Ace Dan on the Yukon gravel bar Having satisfied himself that the missive had fallen into the proper hands he set out for the Dome to report He found Berwick Hugh Spencer Bruce Corte and several others holding a council of war Berwick was giving instructions Behind the Dome you will notice is a valley where the timber is comparatively heavy Our men can camp there with two weeks provisions Every man or two men will be their own commissariat Their instructions will be to hold themselves in readiness while recruits are being gathered from the creeks Recruits We don t want no recruits from the creeks roared Long Shorty Fifteen hundred men will fix the thing Hugh agreed with this Fifteen hundred men should be able to scare less than two hundred into surrender especially when we can show them that we can shoot and be out of range of their rifles Berwick put the matter to the vote and it was agreed that the fifteen hundred to be recruited from Dawson would be sufficient Berwick sighed Very good fifteen hundred let it be but we must try to avoid bloodshed This affair will be serious enough without anybody being killed Pass the word for a muster right away camps to be made in the woods as if a base for prospecting At the camps rifles may be cached to be quickly available It is possible the police may not notice the migration but we must chance that Until it is time to act the men will go into town every day as usual Don t you think we had better have a preliminary muster asked George Yes It would serve a double purpose give an opportunity to our men to learn the plans and the massing of so many upon the Dome would doubtless lead to inquiries by the police and probably impress them with our display of force It is hardly possible they will make arrests and they can hardly shoot unarmed men It won t do em any harm to show we look like meaning business Why not have the boys bring their arms asked Long Shorty I d say nothing about arms Hugh counselled Let each man suit himself there ll be enough guns in the crowd to guard against accidents And what are we to do after our display of force asked Long Shorty Send a letter to the Barracks calling on the officer commanding to surrender answered John Berwick If he does not surrender Suppose he tells you to go to the devil We ll give him till Saturday to consider it And then if he says no He won t say no he is a humane man and must know we are in the right He must also be aware that we can annihilate him Berwick did not quite possess the assurance he showed in this reply There might be such a thing as Smoothbore being willing to die at his post Of late this idea had been more and more gaining hold on his mind his sleep had become more restless as the time for action approached In all probability some irresponsible person would make a slip which would precipitate matters Dark thoughts and doubts came upon him as they must at times to every leader who holds under his control many lives but resolutely he put them from him and comforted his heart strengthened his determination by remembering the wrongs they had suffered and the righteousness of their cause He hoped earnestly that Smoothbore would recognize that his force was outnumbered by at least ten to one But Long Shorty was tenacious possibly he thought he detected some wavering in his leader And so he persisted But if he does call the bluff In that case we must hold a council of war and determine what to do Our display of force on Wednesday should make him apprehensive By Friday our intentions and strength must have impressed him Then we shall forward him a summons to surrender If by Saturday noon he has not complied We ll drop a few bullets round the flag pole cried Long Shorty and it would not do much harm if we peppered a yellow leg or two I d rather they got one of the grafters said a recruit to which remark others chorused Hear hear We ll see we ll see What we need first is to get our forces camped in the woods So pass the word among our adherents that they are expected to gain their encampment during Monday and Tuesday Let Sunday be a day of rest it is possible the Sunday after may be far from peaceful All right boss spoke up Frank Frank was far more loyal to Parson Jack much less inclined to question him than Long Shorty That ends this present business said John Those of you who don t wish to go into town may as well stay and go over the ground in survey of a line of entrenchment Thereupon with his friends about him John went to his den and secured a pick and shovel hidden there and with them traced a furrow to be enlarged later The riflemen would lie there and fire upon the Barracks To this day that furrow is to be found across the top of the Dome Dawson was now at the zenith of its prosperity Not only had the creeks produced many millions but vast sums of outside capital were being paid for speculative claims as well as for properties of proven worth For those who were prosperous it was a heyday of delight to those whose fortunes had stuck it was no heyday It was for these that Berwick and his comrades were working to give honest workers something of a fair chance though there was a long span between the idealism of John and the motives of Long Shorty which were not a little selfish and sordid There have been many popular outbursts in the world s history but never had a leader entered his fortunes against an established Government with the chances of success held by Berwick In numbers in arms and equipment he had the advantage His hesitation was therefore not due to any shirking of the issue He was the reverse of a moral coward and yet he felt keenly the responsibility and unpleasantness of the part he had to play in leading a force against the authority of Britain s Queen It was duty which drove him against his patriotic instincts He loathed the necessity but there was no alternative if wrongs were to be righted The five colleagues had been thoughtfully watching Dawson that hive of human bees The first to break the silence was Long Shorty when he told of his acquaintanceship with Five Ace Dan on the Wood pile and added the suggestion that he might prove useful This roused Hugh who said sharply We don t want any jail birds He s a bit of a tin horn protested Shorty but he ain t a jail bird There ain t much difference was Hugh s retort Long Shorty held his peace CHAPTER XXIX STONY GROUND Constable Hope had no doubts Professional instinct told him there was an important conspiracy hatching He was ambitious and he loved his work so that every impulse prompted him to find and follow the threads of the plot Smoothbore s action in keeping tab ten on the number of men carrying rifles suggested to him that his Commandant regarded the situation as serious ten Watch Therefore beyond his orders which were sufficient in themselves to work off an ordinary policeman s superfluous energy Hope worked overtime He discovered that George Hugh and Frank occupied the home ranch once more and were extremely busy He reasoned that if a man s business be legitimate it is easy to learn its nature As the business of these men was not quite evident he determined to find out what it was So that on the morning of the meeting at the Dome Hope had made his way there also by a detour to the east His route was the longer and the sun was hot Also the trail he took led through some patches of swamp which meant mosquitoes When he reached the nearest point to the Dome where he could remain under cover of the bush he was still out of earshot He watched those who came in view but because the council had been seated in a circle about the summit after the manner of the Indian pow wow and he was below the level of that summit he could see only some of those who had attended After the meeting had dissolved and those remaining had plotted out their entrenchments and started to return to Dawson Hope made bold to follow them He drew back in time to avoid discovery from the five who still were gazing thoughtfully upon the town but he happened to hear the reference to Five Ace Dan and the Wood pile They re camped on our trail Five Ace would hardly be in demand for a prayer meeting thought the guardian of the peace as eventually he returned to the Police Barracks He at once reported to Sergeant Galbraith The big Tyee eleven held a council of war on the summit at noon to day These fellows are sure up to something eleven Chinook for Chief Hear anything No could not get near enough except at the last when the big Yankee said something about Five Ace Dan Who s he asked Galbraith The tin horn on the Wood pile for pulling a gun Well the Yankee said something about his helping their cause or something and the one they call Hugh said he had no use for tin horns It looks as if the Yankee might be in communication inside the Barracks Well he wouldn t learn much He might tell them how poor are our arms They know that already Galbraith snorted And how weak our guard is They know that too That s the reason of this insurrection or one of the reasons But what has a reference to Five Ace Dan got to do with this plot that is supposed to be going on Nothing I guess Probably nothing Well the only thing you have to report is that there was a pow wow on the Dome this morning I guess so But whether they were planning to put us all out of business or organizing an expedition to the North Pole you don t know That s right Well keep your eye on them but don t report again until your report is calculated to make a noise Constable Hope not a little discouraged by the way his report was received sauntered out and drifted towards the Borealis The seeds of his efforts had fallen on stony ground But after he was gone Sergeant Galbraith expanded his chest drew up to the full extent of his six feet and gazed through the door of his office at the muskeg which did duty for a street Another council at the top of the Dome he said to himself He stood a minute stroked his moustache then his mind made up strode out of the office and in due course was in the presence of his Commanding Officer Another council at the Dome sir he reported Yes Seems serious sir when men climb eighteen hundred feet this hot weather that they may talk in private Any other signs Sergeant It s the other signs that make it look serious The number of men carrying rifles is increasing rapidly Yesterday no less than three hundred rifles were seen in the streets Did you question any of those carrying them No sir Had no orders sir Just so it would not have done any good and it might have done harm And you have had all supplies bought up arms and ammunition All that were better than our own sir Well have them secretly brought to the men s quarters and let each man have his pick Then some of the best shots can have a day off to practise a bit Very good sir Something is going to happen soon said Smoothbore to Herbert who during the interview had come in Rather suggestive of Micawber that if you will pardon my saying so Herbert ventured to assert He had been a sudden and complete convert to the theory that trouble was brewing The inaction of his Chief had been getting on his nerves Micawber had the great virtue of patience answered Smoothbore with a smile I would arrest the leaders sir on a trumped up charge and get the evidence out of them that way That would be a mistake my dear Herbert Perhaps so sir but here they can shoot us down like rats If we have to die we had better die like men If something does not turn up as you remind me Micawber might have said you will have sufficient opportunity to die I should wish to sell my life pretty dearly sir Perhaps you won t have to sell it at all if the something happens that I expect What do you expect sir may I ask Just something and Smoothbore smiled again After a pause he continued By all the laws of military and political science the British Empire should have been wrecked ages ago But something always has happened To arrest the leaders of this conspiracy would I am sure be an error It would precipitate matters and undoubtedly cause bloodshed You must remember it is not with redskins we are dealing Many of these fellows who are arraying themselves against us are excellent shots accustomed to rough life and in every way calculated to make good fighters in such a country as this If they really take up arms against us there is nothing to do but fight fight to the death sell our lives as dearly as possible as you say If they have no intention of taking up arms and it is not yet certain that they will we can suffer no harm by inaction We might buy the leaders A man who would sell himself and his friends would not stay bought and somehow I do not feel that the integrity of the British Empire should be maintained by purchasing her enemies But then there are our lives Our lives don t figure in this proposition and once again Smoothbore smiled Herbert felt his Chief was trifling with him and with the situation so he rose from his chair walked to the window and looked out upon the quadrangle This movement hid the flush of annoyance that had come over his face He made an excuse and found his way out of the office If only I were in command here he thought I d clap these fellows on the Wood pile and then After that point no well defined line of action suggested itself to him Meanwhile Smoothbore continued writing his report to Ottawa telling of his suspicions and explaining his action or want of action He intended to hold back the communication until the last moment until he was satisfied that something would not turn up which would certainly be close to the crisis Then he would confide it to a trusty scout and send to the outside While he was writing his mind constantly played with the facts of his own position It pleased him to compare it with that of Gordon in Khartoum with these differences that for him assistance was out of the question and his enemies were not fanatical and were Christian His would be a soldier s death if something did not turn up CHAPTER XXX ON THE SCENT After being snubbed by his Sergeant Constable Hope lost heart for a little while but on the Sunday he was again working assiduously with little luck Accident and caution caused Berwick to keep out of the way of the determined policeman Suddenly the idea of looking further into the possible connection of Five Ace Dan with the conspirators occurred to Hope So on the day following his Sunday of ill success he posted himself near the prisoners He could distinguish the person of Five Ace Dan and watched closely for any sign made to a possible confederate but without result This was disappointing for brooding during the night on what Long Shorty had said he brought himself to believe he was close to an important clue As his inspection of Five Ace Dan brought no help to him he felt again discouraged and became sullen and brooding Then his interest awoke again for Long Shorty had appeared upon the scene The constable was about to rise to his feet and abandon the enterprise when he saw the new comer He hid himself again immediately He watched Long Shorty take a piece of paper out of his pocket and write The man laboured hard over the missive he was evidently no fluent scribe The paper after being finished and carefully read through was rolled into a ball At last at stroke of noon the prisoners filed back to the Barracks Long Shorty at once strolled over with careful casualness to the scene of their labours and as before dropped the paper beside the handle of the Five Ace s shovel At once he went eager as a bird to Dawson When the coast was quite clear Hope came from his cover and annexed the letter The policeman s spirits were very cock a whoop The Eagle is very fond of Yellow legs he read in the awful scrawl and in two days time a great many Eagles will gather together about the summit of the big mountain where they may watch the Yellow legs and if the Yellow legs don t come and make peace within two days then at the end of one more day the Eagles will descend upon the Yellow legs and make a meal of them Any little dicky birds found among the Yellow legs may go the same way unless they make a move for liberty The Eagle loves liberty Constable Hope pondered over these words and after copying them into his notebook replaced the original where he had found it He then made his way to his Sergeant and the mid day meal No sooner however had he come to Galbraith than he changed his mind He would carry his news to the Commandant himself and not waste it on this discouraging minor light You re somewhat glum Seen a ghost asked the Sergeant No Sergeant no Been drinking the wrong kind of hootch I guess No Sergeant no The first thing Hope did after lunch was to search the cell occupied by Five Ace Dan There he found stuffed between the logs which comprised one wall of the cell the first missive written by Long Shorty He searched but could discover nothing else but that would do Off he went to the Commandant I have discovered something sir which I have thought sufficiently important to bring direct to you What is it One of the men I am watching is communicating with a prisoner Five Ace Dan I heard him mention the name on the Dome on Saturday To day I followed up the clue and intercepted a note Constable Hope took out his notebook He was a bit nervous and excited He knew he was running a risk by not reporting according to regulations by way of the Sergeant Smoothbore was eyeing him intently Constable Hope handed the letter found in the cell and his notebook containing the copy of the missive left that morning to the Commandant who read them with stern eyes You think these are not the idle words of some partially demented prospector I do not sir The big Yankee has nothing about him to indicate he has lost his wits So you think this is right that there will be a massing of forces about the Dome on Wednesday I do sir And if there is a display of force on Wednesday an attack will be made on Friday On Saturday sir On Saturday then if we see a massing of forces on Wednesday we may expect trouble by Saturday That is my idea sir What have you done with the original of the note you found to day Put it where I found it sir And what do you intend doing with the one you found in the prisoner s cell I had thought to replace it sir Very good we can see if to day s note is hidden in the same place to morrow Constable Hope was a proud man as he strode along the bank of the Yukon to the town He had ventured much and won Visions of himself holding a commission passed through his mind The possibility seemed more tangible now Whom should he meet but the Sergeant Well young fellow been hunting for more noiseless reports I ve been keeping my eyes open Seen anything Nothing much to trouble you with Sergeant Well I ve seen something I couldn t help but see A stampede seems to have set in to the top of the Dome Scores of fellows have been climbing up there packs on their backs You had better join the crowd Not a bad idea In fifteen minutes Constable Hope had reached the Town Station and made a roll of some blankets in which he stowed several tins of bully beef and some biscuits He was just setting out when his Sergeant arrived Are not you going to take a rifle I hadn t thought of doing so You d better all the others have rifles You didn t tell me Then I tell you now No not the police rifle as Hope picked up a carbine Take this sporting rifle Don t let em see you are a policeman and use your wits Hope strapped on his bundle it weighed full sixty pounds and with a Good bye kid from his Sergeant was off He made a detour far up the Klondike to gain a more gradual ascent and on the way did a powerful lot of thinking The fact that many men were climbing the Dome was some foundation for the idea that a gathering was to take place there on Wednesday He sat down to rest on the flat or as it was called in the diggings bench half way up the Klondike bluffs There was ample time for it was still the season of perpetual light and if he awaited some other pilgrim would certainly come along from whom he might find out something Sure enough a recruit to the forces of the rebellion came into sight before five minutes had passed The man was heavily laden and struggling up the steep ascent He clawed at the brush in his efforts to pull himself up and when finally he succeeded flung himself down by the side of the policeman his face streaming with perspiration A fellow will need a fat job when things get righted to pay for this He sure will said Hope I m looking for a job collecting gold dust But there won t be any royalty then That s right that s right and a thoughtful look came into the man s eye I was promised a job I wonder what kind of a job I can get I really had made up my mind to hold out for a job collecting It must be an all fired good job if a fellow reckons on the dust these fellows who hold it now blow in on the girls and wine One year would be enough for me I d save and quit the country Are you quite sure you d save Sure thing I m sure at least I think I m sure Now don t you think if you were given the job of collecting royalty that you might feel tempted to go to a restaurant order a steak with chechacho potatoes twelve and buy a bottle of wine to round things off twelve Fresh potatoes as distinguished from evaporated potatoes The man gazed into vacancy a bit and then looked Hope in the eye and slapped his knee as he said Do you know partner I think I might if I get any boodle out of this thing that s coming off I think I will Beefsteak Beefsteak and onions and chechacho potatoes Gosh what a lay out of them I could eat right now Beans beans bacon and beans and then beans and bacon What a hell of a lot a fellow misses in this here country Yes but I m afraid we will not be able to take our appetites with us Say I wonder what John D Rockefeller would give for my appetite and my stomach Say I bet he d give a million cold cash I bet he d give a million and a half enough to buy the best claim on Eldorado Perhaps perhaps but never mind there s a good time coming for us Constable Hope did not wish the conversation to merge too much upon the abstract Yes in one week more then we will have a chance to do some grafting And I tell you I can do with some yes sir You mean it will be all over in two weeks As I understand it there is to be something doing on Wednesday Only a line up as I understand it then on Friday the boss sends them word to quit giving them twenty four hours to make up their minds whether they will go to Heaven or down the River Yes I guess that s the programme said the policeman successfully hiding the satisfaction that made his pulses throb He felt this was the official plan as it coincided so well with the terms of the letter now again folded in its place in the cell of Five Ace Dan Had Hope been without orders he would have made an excuse and posted back to town right away But his Sergeant had told him to masquerade among the rebels and he must obey orders So he resumed the upward march with the remark Well pard I guess we had better hit the trail whereupon the pard with the accompaniment of numerous oaths and grunts and sighs struggled to his feet and onward up the hill CHAPTER XXXI AN ODIOUS DILEMMA Smoothbore was in possession of the facts Constable Hope had been able to gather which were indeed very little less than the complete plot Fifteen hundred men were camped in the bushes at the back of the Dome with enough bullets to kill the Standing Army of the British Empire and he had available a few more than one hundred men True they were good men but so were most of those on the other side The trouble was that both parties were right It was for him and his men to subdue this rebellion because it threatened the integrity and honour of the Empire At the same time the insurrectoes were demanding simple justice It was an odious dilemma In his mind s eye he pictured the vast spaces that stretched between the Klondike and the outside They could hardly seem farther away from help if the Klondike were on the planet Mars Well he would not surrender it would be better to die The Yukon was sweeping along but a stone s throw from the gate of the Barracks in eight or ten hours its rapid course would carry them into the United States That might be a resource of security to his men if they were beaten but for himself he would fill a grave in that region of eternal frost It was Tuesday evening the sun was sinking in the north Heaven s vault was finely painted in pink The abrupt cliff on the west of the Yukon threw a deep shadow across the mighty river whose stately flood had long held sovereignty in that weird land of dreams The light from the clouds above struggled against the shadows in the river and was blended with them It was certainly majestic magnificent The Commandant as he walked up and down his office often paused to gaze upon the familiar scene A knock on the door caused him to start round It was Herbert I came to inquire sir for any fresh news on the situation The news is Herbert that we may as well prepare to die a soldier s death There is to be a display of force to morrow and mobilization on Friday when a request to surrender will be sent in Hostilities will open on Saturday What will be their demands That the police and all Government officials quit the country in other words go down the river And you will not comply I will not comply Can nothing be done sir Nothing but to fight to the last drop of blood And the ultimate result Anyhow we shall have upheld the prestige of the British uniform There was a pause Both men were very thoughtful The Commandant then asked You remember Child Yes He followed orders He rode to death because his orders were to arrest not to shoot he did not flinch before the levelled rifle What he did as an individual the hundred and fifty of us can do But we shall shoot We shall While a cartridge remains and a finger has strength to pull a trigger Herbert looked glum he was not a coward but he thought his Chief s policy was all wrong and he was to give up his life or die in ignominy It made him bitter and then his mind travelled across the great stretch of glacier mountain and plain to his little cottage on the Prairie it was not cowardice that brought the moisture to his eyes Damn it all sir it s hard to die here like a rat in a trap Herbert cried He did not share his Chief s idealism Promise to force the Commissioner to bring some sort of order out of chaos and clear out the Gold Commissioner s office Smoothbore knew of the cottage and the little girl with golden curls who was all the world to the inspector so he understood the emotion of the other and felt sympathy Reform a promise of reform at this stage of the game would be no good The leader of this movement is an idealist a fanatic and three quarters of his followers luck having been against them hope to restore their fortunes by the experiment of a new Government The situation is not dissimilar to that in the Thirteen Colonies at the Revolution a leader of parts of education imbued with theories on the rights of man at the head of a mob thirsting for the lands and jobs of the Loyalists Why has Alaska a population Because the Sheriff back East could not shoot straight thirteen Why had America a population before the Revolution Because there were not prisons enough in Europe In fact the situation in the Klondike to day is much the same as it was in America before the Revolution only perhaps there is more justice on the side of these our enemies than there was on the side of the Yankees The Government of George III taxed tea which was then much more of a luxury than it is to day our Government taxes the one product of our people thirteen A common saying in the North It was a long speech for the Commandant but he knew what he was talking about Herbert sighed Any special orders sir he asked No The men have been given their new arms and the situation is pretty well understood among them They are in fine fettle sir and spirit Good If as I expect hostilities open and things look hopeless I shall give every man the opportunity of passing out and down the river and this will include officers but as for surrender I won t Herbert about to make his adieu turned towards the door when the Chief remarked It appears a prisoner known as Five Ace Dan has been receiving communications from one of the leaders of the rising I have given orders that a double guard be put on these men and special sentries to see that no word passes among them You will see that those orders are carried out Yes sir good night sir Good night Herbert Smoothbore gazed at the river once again It swung on its majestic course but the rose tints were gone only the dark shadows of the hill remained The hour seemed ominous CHAPTER XXXII A DERELICT Surgeon Major Peel was strongly imbued with the instincts of humanity but like many professional men his business acumen was small While one or two of his patients were prosperous claim owners who could afford to pay an ounce and a half of gold dust per day there were many who passed into his care who could not pay and these the poorly nourished and mentally depressed were the more susceptible to attacks by the deadly typhoid bacillus Not that the patients were dishonest they simply had not the money What could be done under the circumstances The delirious victim who was bundled up to the doors of saint George s could not be turned away Obviously it was the duty of the Government reaping enormous revenues from the whisky traffic and the gold royalty to pay One day it was the Tuesday before the meeting on the Dome a big hulk of a man joined the patients of the saint George s Private Hospital His temperature was one hundred four one two and he was delirious A neighbour had brought him his name was unknown his residence was given as the North End It was Long Shorty Poor fellow remarked the Surgeon Major sympathetically when he had taken his pulse had slipped the thermometer under his arm and was watching the gasping figure Typhoid attacks even the strongest What a handsome animal he would be if his face showed less dissipation He does not look likely to prove a profitable guest Alice commented She was the housekeeper of the establishment and found the domestic problems more difficult than her father imagined Who knows who knows He may have property which will turn out a Bonanza think of Gold Hill ten English pounds to each shovelful of dirt dug from the bed rock and the claim owners round about were coming to the two Swedes who owned the claim to ask them to work for wages Yes father said Alice but there s another side to these stories Think of the thousands in and around Dawson living on one meal a day it is always the same in every mining excitement It is either too much wealth or nothing at all She was evidently thinking of John remembering his talk of experiences Her father who though blind to many of the aspects of life was a keen observer of his daughter guessed at the truth It is strange we can learn nothing of John he said He must be away on the creeks she answered wistfully I have sent several letters to him through the post and it can t be that they all would go astray The girl sighed and her father busied himself anew with the work of the hospital Fred is to give this man a cold bath and put him in ward C I really must see the Commissioner Hi u Bill they call him and come to some understanding as to indigent patients For some reason not apparent on the surface Long Shorty made a great impression upon Alice She interested herself in his case and often sat by his bed His fever remained high and persistent he was still delirious Wild things he said What most interested Alice was his continuous references to Parson Jack Parson Jack I knew he was no tenderfoot a fellow what would mush forty five miles for a sick pal Parson Jack and then want to mush back again Parson Jack Parson Jack he gave Poo Bah hell hell on toast Parson Jack And the great muscles would stand out upon his neck and arms as he waved his clenched fists in the air Parson Jack might mean any one thought Alice The fever had run about a week of its course when Long Shorty entered the hospital so that the disease had another two weeks to run before the crisis would be reached There was nothing to do but wait patiently for the return of consciousness In the meantime her imagination pictured much She tried by suggestion to shape the course of his ravings but found they were as fleeting and volatile as the changing winds of the heavens The special services rendered by Alice to Long Shorty did not escape her father s notice He remarked to her one day Alice no one could accuse you of worldliness you certainly are giving the delirious patient in ward C a full measure of attention Do you know father she then said frankly in some ways he reminds me of John I don t know how it is I suppose they have something in common something may link them together He is perpetually calling on Parson Jack Ha snorted her father Our patient is far from being of the type of Berwick Both of them hurried away to their work That same evening hours after the day staff had ceased their labours Alice was watching beside Long Shorty and notwithstanding its many disagreeable passages listened to his wild flow of language He was ever living over again his struggles with the forces of Nature with his fellows and his own tempestuous passions The blue water the blue water keep her to the blue her patient was again living a dash through a rapid in a canoe White water means rocks and death death death I say To the right and he would shout In those anxious weary hours the girl grew to realize something of the wild rough life of the frontiersmen On the morning of the Friday when the ultimatum was to be sent to Smoothbore Peel returned to the hospital from the town He was in a condition of excitement as was every one else in Dawson Alice that typhoid fellow was talking about Parson Jack He was replied Alice opening her eyes with expectancy Why do you say that Because that s the chap who is trying to overthrow the Government Our patient may be one of the conspirators Possibly said Alice and hastened away She knew Parson Jack was Berwick Intuition told her so She was absolutely certain of the fact The news that a plot was brewing had of course penetrated the walls of the hospital Now that Alice knew John Berwick was concerned in it her interest quickened and her anxieties awoke CHAPTER XXXIII TRIBUTE The demonstration of force as organized by Berwick had taken place according to schedule The display was plainly seen from the Barracks and its intent generally known throughout the town wherein it became the one topic of conversation The dance halls were but half patronized the gambling tables seemed to have lost their popularity on that Wednesday night Not that any fear was felt The men of Dawson were generally not of the fearing type They were thirsty for news their interest was so stirred that they must let off steam by talking In the Borealis the woman nicknamed Roundeyes stood apart Of all the faces present hers alone showed apprehension for she had a real regard for Poo Bah the Prince of Grafters whose domination at last was threatened Suddenly her eyes lit up A big hulk of a man came stumbling into the place Poo Bah Her face grew white as she ran up and caught his arm What what will they do with you she asked Nothing I guess He laughed in a rambling manner What do they want me for Some fellow you have done up will take a shot at you now there is no danger of the yellow legs Until the present crisis the prestige of the police had been so great that the possibility of any one seeking and gratifying personal revenge had never crossed Poo Bah s mind What would happen now With all his confidence the question asked by the girl would repeat itself He knew he was not popular Many a man owed the wreck of his fortune to him and would enjoy a chance of shooting him His hands clenched for a minute but he put the thought away It was the spirit of the voyageur the custom of the country to brush aside the disagreeable The thought of death and of what may come after death was resolutely set aside Oh hell Come and have a drink So he endeavoured to disperse his own and the woman s fears She was not so easily satisfied She caught him again by the arm bowed her head against his shoulder and sobbed Oh my baby my baby Somebody will blow daylight through you Poo Bah drew his arm roughly from her with the single word Quit and strode towards a curtained recess Roundeyes meekly following In a minute or two a champagne bottle popped and there was laughter expressing the wild spirits of the underworld Meanwhile on the Dome John Berwick paced up and down a prey to conflicting motives He was now full in the vortex of civil strife a few short days and hostilities in all probability would open He had no doubts now as to the spirit to be shown by the Police Commandant On Point Lookout sat Constable Hope with his face towards the Upper Yukon To the left he could see the Klondike Valley to the right were the Police Barracks with Dawson beyond them His back was to the Dome He sat still a project was in his mind he was thinking hard At the same time Smoothbore was in his office with Hi u Bill the Commissioner and Inspector Herbert Sergeant Galbraith stood at attention before them You have ordered your men to be in readiness to fall back upon the Barracks The orders for additional commissariat are placed with the different companies The men I suppose pretty well understand what is in the wind Yes sir Galbraith answered to every question And the men are in good spirits I have told them sir you intend to fight And how do they seem to take it One of the fellows said he d go to hell for you sir Well that would seem satisfactory The Commandant smiled grimly Our best hope is dissension among the rebels and I have no idea how that may be brought about That will do Sergeant After the policeman had left there was silence for some time which was at last broken by Hi u Bill I don t fancy they will do anything to me and as I m not called upon to fight I m out of it I am and I suppose I may say it in modesty a bit of a shot but one has others to consider as well as himself The Commissioner was in the habit of spending his afternoons at target practice which was not altogether appreciated by those whose business with him was pressing I m afraid you are altogether too modest you know you re a famous shot Under usual circumstances Hi u Bill was quite ready to receive compliments on his shooting but the present circumstances were extraordinary and he was undoubtedly perturbed But the Commandant was merciless for he continued Of course I am letting it be understood that I shall welcome all volunteers who desire to lend their aid at the present crisis Yes yes no doubt there will be many who will avail themselves of the opportunity Hi u Bill was not over enthusiastic as he said this Indeed I think I could make my friends fairly comfortable under the circumstances Certainly quite so My cabin at the North End is quite comfortable and so close under the Dome that they could not shoot at me unless they came half way down in which case they would expose themselves to your fire Capital idea that of yours securing the long range sporting rifles I almost feel sorry that I could not be with you here as well as at my cabin just to try a shot or two but you see I think I had better stay outside I have many friends among the old timers and nobody has ever accused me of doing anything serious I certainly am not rich on ill gotten gains Hi u Bill rubbed his hands nervously and cast a look at the Dome Of course if you feel Smoothbore was choosing his words there is fear of any of the unsuccessful attributing their failure to you and wreaking vengeance on you I shall be quite happy to give you our protection Oh no no I prefer to run my chances outside really I do Herbert who was distressed equally at the irony of his Chief and the determined density of the Commissioner diverted the conversation to another channel In case of a siege sir there will be the question of water supply Yes I have thought of that We shall have a supply from the river before hostilities break out and after that a well may be sunk in twenty four hours the earth is not frozen here But then if something turns up Something turns up ejaculated Hi u Bill almost rising from his seat What could turn up It would take an army eighteen months to get here across country even by the Stikeen route it will be close upon winter by the time news of this reaches Ottawa and by the earliest time a force could be fitted out the Passes would be oceans deep in snow I know there s the luck of the British Empire There was a quiet smile on Smoothbore s lips Something always has turned up to save the British except except in the case of Gordon That was the exception to the rule There was a sharp knock at the door and the Come in was answered by Constable Hope his face flushed He was evidently very excited The idea on which for long he had been brooding had come to maturity I have a plan sir which will save us I think To carry it out I shall require gold within limits but the more the better Gold The Commandant should have large quantities the proceeds of royalty collections Hi u Bill pricked up his ears bethought him of the fact and asked directly What have you done with all your gold I ve had it buried The plan of the exact spot will reach the authorities if we go under But Forty Mile royalty came in to day and has not yet been buried How much do you want he asked Constable Hope s heart gave a great leap as he realized he was going to be trusted At least twenty thousand dollars sir Down River gold will do Your plan will take that much I shall need that much sir but shall return it all or nearly all Very good here it is With the words the Commandant took a bag of gold out of a rough chest and handed it to the policeman Thank you sir I That will do Hope Very good sir With the best salute he was master of the youth left the office Hi u Bill had both eyes wide open staring at Smoothbore What the devil That is just a tribute to the gods I may not bribe our enemies but the fates A bag of gold you can hardly lift Why your man will go down the River and stay down You know the Yanks would afford him every protection seeing that he stole from our Government He won t steal the gold replied Smoothbore He won t How do you know he won t I know my men An unusual thing had happened For a private to ask his Commanding Officer for the loan of twenty thousand dollars in gold for that Commanding Officer to entrust it to him for some unexpressed purpose was strange but many strange things happen on the frontier and this was a time of crisis CHAPTER XXXIV NO SURRENDER Berwick s muster had been fifteen hundred strong on the Friday at noon Of discipline there was little or none and Berwick knew better than to attempt to enforce any They had chosen him as their leader and up to the present had not disputed his authority His directions were that the men should hold the Dome retire to their camps in the forest to cook their food but be ever ready promptly to regain their position At noon he stood upon a boulder and read to his followers the summons to surrender he had dispatched to Smoothbore To the present nine o clock in the evening no answer had been received the summons to surrender was being received with contempt He felt the responsibility upon him greater than ever its weight increased as the time for the use of force approached The twenty four hours notice before striking had nearly expired He loathed the prospect of taking life and prayed that the police would submit If only they would see the hopelessness of resistance and send a pacific answer Would that answer never come As he sat in meditation Berwick observed a restlessness among some men who were grouped talking gazing down the river He looked in the same direction and noticed a column of smoke Then the hulk of a river steamer hove in sight This visibly affected the men who began to leave their posts and scramble down the hill to the town The arrival of a steamer in Dawson in the summer of eighteen ninety eight was a matter of moment An idea came to Berwick at the sight of her and the procession of people hurrying to meet her He would go to the town Everybody there would be keen to attend the docking of the steamer making it practically certain that his visit to the Barracks would not be noticed So to the Barracks he went I wish to see the Officer commanding he said to the sentry Name John Berwick The man gulped and stared at the visitor He knocked at the door and announced A man to see you sir by name of John Berwick Hi u Bill was again in the office had just read the ultimatum the discussion of which had been interrupted by the entrance of the man He opened his eyes wide at the mention of the rebel s name Show him in Had the usual happy accident come to pass flashed through Smoothbore s mind as he gazed with eyes of curiosity at the pseudo President of the Klondike Free State that was to be Berwick entered and stood facing the two chief executive officers of the Government He at once picked out the Police Commandant and returned his gaze without flinching What can I do for you he was asked I ve come in the hopes of saving life I have come to plead with you to comply with our request and surrender to our forces Smoothbore was struck by the transparent candour of the man and his quixotism British garrisons are not in the habit of surrendering at the call of rebels he answered stiffly The word rebel roused Berwick It stung I do not come to you from any cowardice or through fear of death or defeat I come in the spirit of humanity A very worthy mission Then why not disband your forces Berwick brushed the suggestion aside I have ten men for every one of yours and my position commands these buildings My men are in earnest and there is justice in our cause even to warrant the shedding of blood This you must recognize I recognize nothing but that I am here to uphold the law of the land You must know you must recognize that great dishonesty exists within the Civil Service and that we have met to protest and put an end to it Officially I know nothing of that It is my duty to maintain the Union Jack flying in the land We can fire your buildings You may be able to fire our buildings you may be able to kill us all and then you may lower the flag I tell you I intend to sink with my ship When you have burned us out those men of mine who wish to may take to the river That is all You have my answer Berwick s eyes filled a lump was in his throat He gulped and with a husky Good evening staggered into the open He bent his head that the sentry might not see his emotion and so gained the street by the Yukon s bank He does not look much like a traitor remarked Hi u Bill He is a man of evident ability I fancy in England in other days he would have been a Whig He has too little philosophy or too much Well Commissioner he said to Hi u Bill are you going to stay with me or run your chances in the town Me I really think I d better stay in my cabin You see I am really not in this and there are a lot of papers and records I had better bury somewhere On leaving the Barracks Berwick had been in somewhat of a daze He was still in that condition when he found himself at the dock The steamer Susan was tying to the wharf the swift current had made docking difficult so that he was in time to witness the landing of the passengers The crowd on the steamer was much as he had expected but there was one man coming down the gang plank who attracted his attention and that of the onlookers generally his hair fell to his shoulders he had a great beard his clothes were covered with grease and he was very dirty He had a small pack strapped to his back it was a very small pack not much larger than a turnip yet the figure that carried it bent under the load CHAPTER XXXV THE MAN WITH THE POUCH There were no signs of hesitancy in the movements of the man with the small round burden He entered the Borealis advanced to the bar upon which he threw down the sack Pass along your poison said he to the bartender What will it be What will it be Why wine what else would it be Pass along a bottle Large or small Large or small Why large of course Say son what do you take me for The bottle of wine was opened and the new comer quenched a willing thirst He then turned to the crowd that had by this time clustered round him Come on and have a drink boys he said waving the bottle Belly up to this good American timber He jumped upon the bar and drank again Wine wine Give them wine feed the nectar of the gods to the swine Make em happy for once Notwithstanding the manner of the invitation the crowd responded and soon the two bartenders were busy Stack the empties there so I can see and count em thirty dollars per and the host pointed to a shelf against the wall Where did you get it shouted one of his guests He made no reply but continued his tirade Oh you malamoots you coyotes You swine descended of jackals Drink damn you drink you who live in this neck of the woods and lie down and are robbed no self respecting jackal would own you for his sons You who call yourselves citizens of the great and glorious United States You re here rottin in your cabins the manhood squashed out of you by the yellow legs Say throw the booze into you and then tell me what I can call you to let you know how low down I think you Say partner called another cut out all that and tell us where you got the swag You sundowners and larrikins Do you not remember Hanson s reward Why don t you get in and dig Blow that and tell us what s what straight wire Kalgoorlie Charlie also was feeling the effect of the liquor The man on the bar began to dance a hornpipe while the crowd surged excitedly around The news had spread like wildfire through the dance halls Some fellow from new diggings was blowing himself The Borealis soon became crowded Oh you lily livered gelatinous vertibraed apologies for men cried he What do you take me for Me to go off into the bush for months and rustle new diggings and then tell a lot of perambulating carrion like you where I struck it Drink and be damned to you I don t care for a little gold I wouldn t mind letting you have a claim next to mine the claim I have will produce enough gold to make the Bank of England look like the baby s savings account Do you think I would show a bunch of Weary Willies like you where a month s work would make you all millionaires Come have another drink and get wise The speaker again put the mouth of his bottle to his lips but a keen observer would have noticed that his throat gave no movement to indicate that the wine was passing to his stomach This was noticed by Berwick alone who had followed the man with the big poke but had stood just inside the doorway Berwick guessed he was acting a part and wondered why He watched There was a confused buzz of conversation He must have struck the real stuff remarked one He sure has the goods agreed another This will make a hole in his poke said a third If what he says is anything near right this ain t a pinch of snuff was the comment of a fourth The man dancing on the bar stood waving his bottle looking at the crowd with a stupid stare evidently awaiting inspiration when a voice cried Say old cock won t you let us have the news We ll protect you in discovery Oh you North American Chinamen called Canadians do you know what I think of you You English you ain t no better than the others do you all know what I think of you You ve told us straight enough there s lot s of colour in your bouquets now tell us which way the new diggings is There ain t no yellow legs there Some one shouted There won t be any yellow legs here after to morrow but the remark was lost in the general noise It s in Alaskie God s country came a voice from the tumult I did not say so But it is it is I don t say it ain t It s in God s country whereabouts That s what I ain t tellin There was a clamour of inquiries The new comer still holding his bottle prominently was the target of eager gaze Up the Porcupine the Tanana or the Koyukuck You must think I m easy He spoke with a leer You ve made your stake why not tell us where to make ours It s a law of the frontier So it is among pards You ain t no pards of mine I m just standing you a few drinks out of pity finding my reward in tellin you what I think of you You ve told us what you think of us Now tell us what we want to hear Quite sure I ve expressed myself strong enough Quite Oh quite came from a dozen voices Well then I ll tell you But he from the newly found Eldorado stopped at the promise and paused regarding his audience A strange silence came over the erstwhile struggling and swaying mass The building was full and the crowd extended into the street where there were hundreds more and to this great number additions were continually being made Well where is it It s on the south fork The speaker put the bottle to his mouth once more Groans and hisses broke from the crowd If you don t tell us after keeping us here we ll string you up on a telegraph pole I did not keep you here it was the free booze besides there ain t no telegraph poles in Dawson Well we ll chuck you into the river I ll swim out I m strong on baths though perhaps I don t look it Have another drink What we want now is a straight tip and you had better give it It s on the south fork of the north branch The north branch of what I ain t tellin By God you d better We ain t going to stand for more foolin You are all what I say you are the scum of the earth All right We re anything you like but let us have the news It s the south fork of the north branch of the south fork What are you quitting for why don t you spit it out of you Ain t I getting rid of it Not fast enough quick out with it Don t be impatient sons patience is a great virtue It s taken me nigh to fifty years hard prospecting to make a strike and you fellows want me to tell you all about it in fifty minutes How many minutes are there in fifty years You old fool you d better quit playing with us Who wants to play with you You re teasing us now quit What river is this where you found the gold Well it s the south fork of the north branch of the south fork of the south branch Oh hell interrupted one of the impatient ones There now just when I get going you fellows spoil it all Remember it took fifty years almost And it will take you fifty years to tell us where you did find it No it won t it s on the Fifty Seven Mile River The Fifty Seven Mile River The south fork of the north branch of the south fork of the north branch of the Fifty Seven Mile River A great shout went up The Fifty Seven Mile River emptied into the Yukon on the Canadian side but it headed in Alaska where the diggings probably were Within two minutes the Borealis was practically empty Of the few remaining John Berwick was one He stood with his back to the wall staring at the man who still stood on the bar who returned the stare Meanwhile the host had turned to the row of bottles and begun the counting The number was sixty Sixty eighteen hundred dollars cheap at double the money said the man who proceeded to weigh out the cost That done he stalked out of the saloon and rapidly went his way There was so much activity and excitement about that his progress to the Barracks was uninterrupted No sooner was he within the gate than he tore off his beard and wig It was Constable Hope Berwick had followed him from the saloon and watched him enter the Barracks He now realized all that it meant A blow had been struck at his organization He realized that it was too late for any counter effort Greed of gold had taken possession of the men A new rush was beginning What call could reason loyalty righteousness make against that He wandered to the water front and watched the activity for within half an hour of the news of the supposed new strike being received boats had begun to shoot out from the river bank bearing adventurers to the new diggings CHAPTER XXXVI AFTER THE CRISIS Mankind in Dawson having muddled its affairs the gods took a hand in the game John Berwick as he turned his face homewards early on the following day happened to take the route that would carry him by the Barracks notwithstanding that it would add a mile to the journey As he climbed the hog s back to Lookout Point he saw the tall military figure of Smoothbore in front of him The Commandant seeing him coming awaited him Good morning The air is very good It is indeed After this there was a pause Evidently Smoothbore desired to make no reference to the interview of the preceding day Possibly he judged the cause of the reformers to be already lost If so Berwick would give him every opportunity of keeping the conversation from politics so he continued How pure the Klondike is and clear and how beautiful are the shades across the Yukon And only man is vile quoted the Commandant Berwick realized that the Head of the Police was poking fun at him and not knowing Smoothbore very well concluded that he must know of the new stampede in fact he seemed to be watching the dark specks of moving men streaming over the summit of the Dome Do you often walk abroad so early John asked Yes it is becoming a habit One requires but little sleep in this climate I shall soon return and go to work Are your labours heavy Oh heavy enough there are many details You have a splendid force sir I have and they are loyal to me and their country Loyalty is among the chief of human virtues But is loyalty in all cases a virtue I consider it so Your men must find many duties distasteful to them Duty is often distasteful but it is never to be mistaken With me it is very well defined Are you also taking a morning constitutional I am going up to the Dome It would not do for John to let the other know the whereabouts of his abode or to divulge the fact that it was his custom to sleep at night It was a custom with many in that city of perpetual light to sleep in the normal daytime and work at night I m going the same way We ll walk together I wish to spy out the land a bit We may decide to build a trail to Moosehide The two continued on the winding trail which was now lined with human habitations set down without any idea of system Some were cabins others tents others still a combination of the two such indeed as was John s home ranch Before many of them camp fires were crackling and burning and meals were being prepared The two who were or had been the leaders of the opposing parties passed without attention being paid to them Ah there s the danger signal the result of the first frost and a sign that summer will soon pass away John pointed to a willow whose leaves had turned crimson and scarlet Yes we shall have winter soon this weather won t last But you are in error in supposing that the bright tints in our foliage are due to frost the mistake is very common The redness is mere ripeness They found many topics in common and mutual interest made the stiff effort less trying as they climbed and climbed As they approached a point on the trail half way to the summit a man was seen coming down dragging a log by a rope They stepped aside from the path which here was on the side hill Berwick who was outside happened to place his foot on a loose lump of moss lying on a stone It moved his foot slipped he lost his balance He struggled on the shelving ground grabbed at some grass was tangled in some brush tore his hands went down with a crash being stopped by a sharpened stump of a severed tree trunk The point grazed his arm and pierced the body under the shoulder blade At once the Commandant and the woodman went to his help but the jar of attempting to raise him brought a cry of pain It was necessary to cut the tree stump before he could be assisted to his feet They had to carry him down the hill his mind in a half swoon punctuated with throbs and stabs of pain until he awoke to consciousness in the saint George s Hospital It seemed more as the remembrance of a dream than of actual occurrence He was in England Even the voice of Alice A pungent odour was about him He heard a buzzing rising rapidly in key higher higher yet higher higher higher still then there was a click As John Berwick s senses were stolen away by the blessed influence of an anaesthetic his lips framed the word Alice She heard the name and was glad The first words John uttered as the drug left him were incoherent but gradually they took form Who s afraid to die I m not afraid to die What s the good of a man s religion if he s afraid to die I know you re not afraid to die said Alice The only reply she got was Oh my head my head What s the matter with your head Oh my head it s bursting Water water continued to be his cry but Alice would feed him with only a drop or two at a time Gradually his ravings grew less pronounced less frequent Who are you he asked after gazing for some time with dazed eyes at Alice You look very like Alice Peel Alice is in England and I am where am I I m glad I look like Alice Peel she said in reply She s the only girl in all the world he murmured before his mind again wandered and he muttered straggling fragments of verses Alice Alice he cried suddenly Yes said Alice soothing his head with her cool hand He recognized her Alice he cried again She bent over and kissed him Go to sleep she said John did as he was commanded When he woke two hours later he called for water and Alice gave him some from a cup Alice I ve been wounded yes I remember that but how did you get here I will tell you to morrow when you are stronger You must not excite yourself now But at six o clock that evening Surgeon Major Peel taking his temperature and finding it normal gave the necessary permission So Alice told their story CHAPTER XXXVII OIL ON TROUBLED WATERS John Berwick s accident was the last touch which caused the uprising to crumble One more great effort after the ideal of justice had fallen and parted Frank Corte was sitting in front of the Dominion Creek cabin by the side of a pool of water that had formed since the claims which rightfully belonged to himself and his three associates had been taken over by the agents of Poo Bah The policy of the land was to reap to day and spend to morrow so a dam had been put in on the pup or tributary of Dominion Creek that entered above the claims and already a harvest was in sight Frank had some possessions in the cabin which he had come to fetch before joining the new stampede Above the cabin was a line of sluice boxes into which half a dozen lusty Scandinavians were shovelling the precious dirt It was Frank s own claim they were working and he gritted his teeth For an instant his face lost its habitual grin If this was only God s country he muttered as he glanced through the open door of the cabin at the rifle hanging on the wall therein He continued to whirl the gold pan which he held in his hands In the pan was a handful of dirt he was idly concentrating The boss won t stand for it and he s a white man Frank smiled again From the mining operations at the sluice boxes voices came to where Corte sat Neither the foreman nor his men had realized that their voices were carrying beyond the sound of rushing water They were shouting that they might hear each other above the roar in the sluices and were laughing cheerily for Poo Bah was a good paymaster to his men One dollar two dollar one and six bits would float to Frank s ears as the foreman estimated the contents of a pan and he would inwardly groan as he calculated the wealth that was passing from him into the great grafter s pocket I guess we d better clean up we can get her down to the black sand by half past ten and finished an hour later Something rose in Frank s throat and almost choked him The attitude of these intruders galled him He half jumped up to seize his rifle when No he muttered Them yellow legs His attention was attracted to the gold pan Specks of gold were floating upon the water at the bottom of the pan he noticed an unmistakable grease spot and true to its nature it had secured to its surface several of the tiny yellow grains Grease was alike fatal to the gold pan and the stamp battery Suddenly his eyes took on a new light they were full of energy He glanced towards the working miners and followed the line of sluices to the artificial pond in the pup whence they got their water Yes yes he muttered and sprang to his feet He hurried to the quarters of one of his friends Jerry the engineer on a neighbouring claim where a steam plant had been installed Jerry said Frank I want two bottles of lubricating oil Pretty near all I got Don t care must have it All right what do you want it for Frying slap jacks Frank went with his evil smelling petroleum What the devil is he up to asked Jerry as the drooping figure hulked out of sight The weasel that peeped at him through the poles of his cabin floor could not tell him nor did he know Frank put the oil on the table of his cabin and then went outside and began chopping wood It was now the orthodox bed time so he must show a good reason for being about The sun had just set in the north the quarter it sets in the Northland Shut her off he heard the foreman cry and he knew the cleaning was to be commenced Down came the axe on a four inch stick of spruce with a force that burst it asunder and threw the pieces far apart No experienced woodman in the ordinary course of events would have used so much force and Frank Corte had chopped much wood The roar of the water diminished the voices of the clean up men fell away He could hear no more but he knew every move First the riffles would be lifted from the sluice boxes and the dump box and the dirt in the sluice boxes would be shovelled into the dump box Then a strip of wood about two inches square would be placed across the dump box where it joined the head of the sluices This would prevent the gold from being washed down the boxes When these processes were accomplished the foreman shouted Turn on half a head and Ole Oleson at the gate allowed half the usual flow of water to rush down the flume to the dump box Had Frank watched the impact of the water on the dirt in the dump box he would even in the now failing light have seen a burst of yellow shine out from what had previously appeared dross As the water reached the dirt the dirt was forced against it by three or four stout paddles whereby the husky workmen churned and washed the dirt thoroughly Across the dump box where the water met the pay dirt stretched a band of gold First it was half an inch and then two inches Meanwhile the pebbles and the dross worked their way over the retaining block and bumped ignominiously to the tailings It looks good said the foreman in loud tones Frank heard him then shout to Ole A quarter of a head Corte thereupon threw down his axe It was time for action He went into the cabin and placed the two bottles of oil in a bucket with which he set out for the dam It was the most natural thing in the world for a man to draw a bucket of water before retiring he might want a drink during the night Ole was almost asleep when Frank came up to him He was lounging over the gate Frank greeted him with Good evening partner you re working late to night Dat s so was all Ole had life enough to answer Frank slipped his bucket into the water the bottle sank against the mud The hues of iridescence spread across the weird and silent surface The bottles were safely at the bottom of the pool and the bucket full of water as Frank turned towards the cabin saying Good night Ole As he neared his cabin he heard the foreman shout Shut her half off and knew that the work of taking out the black sand from the dust was at hand He knew that already the small specks of gold were being carried to the lower end of the pool So he made haste and taking a blanket nailed it at the waste gate of the lower pond so that the total flood from above went through it then he turned in He was awake at four on the next morning and proceeding to the lower pond loosed the blanket which was heavy with water and gold Then he built a fire in the open and after it was burning well placed the blanket upon it When the blanket was totally consumed and the fire burnt down Frank collected the ashes and panned them out The gold was fine in form and quality and proved worth some thousands of dollars Hi u chickaman stuff laughed Frank CHAPTER XXXVIII REUNION Frank Corte mushing through to Dawson from Dominion Creek took his time comfortably and arrived on the second evening He danced till five in the morning after which as was natural he lay down and slept Accordingly it was not until the evening after his arrival that he gave a thought to his three companions and began to search for them by visiting the Borealis and going the round of the dance halls and gambling saloons He found George and Hugh who were together but not John Something must surely have happened to him George Bruce had visited his den several times lately he was not there At last by inquiry at the police station they learnt that he had hurt himself by falling when climbing to the Dome and had been taken to saint George s Private Hospital It was about nine in the evening when the three friends visited him in the ward Hello what s wrong now Frank cried better than typhoid anyway Alice rose in indignation at the noise and clatter but seeing John smile reseated herself Frank was broadly grinning Alice this is Frank Corte my good friend George Bruce and Hugh Spencer my pards now you know personally the good fellows I ve told you about Alice shook hands with them and there was a moment of some awkwardness which Frank broke by saying Here as he laid a large poke of gold on John s chest Where did you get it asked he Frank took a sly glance at Alice in fact he had already taken several She was certainly attractive and had impressed him His usual vocabulary was insufficient in the circumstances He gave a sniff I applicationed the principles of childish lore to the exigencies of existence in a land of graft and corruption I lubricated the wheels of the flow of justice and distracted this here gold dust from Poo Bah Who inquired Alice frankly laughing Poo Bah he s the high mucky muck round here sort of man Friday to the Octopus who s got his tentacles round these here environs How did you get the dust asked John again as with critical eyes he estimated the value of the contents of the poke Well I was sitting in front of our cabin on the claims with my brain working and my eyes on the quivi vivi as them Frenchers would say and I was ebolluting hot and then I thought of grease So I gets some lubricating oil and then Nature does the rest of course I was the instrument whereby the oil was placed in the sluices John grasped Frank s meaning and method It flashed upon him at the mention of the lubricating oil What do you mean to do with this gold Berwick asked You are going to keep it Oh no I can t do that why give it to me Why to me more than to Hugh Oh he can get more He s coming with me to God s country Where asked Alice more than ever bewildered To God s country the new strike down in Alaska there ll be no Poo Bah there and plenty of shot gun justice But there s George s interest George Oh he will put his up with ours O K I guess Here Frank again looked at Alice I guess you ll be needing that stuff if parsons charge like other folks do John smiled at this and Alice blushed Leaving the friends together for she knew they would wish to talk she went from the room No no Frank it won t do Then seeing that Corte looked troubled he added I ll take a quarter if you like you ve proved yourself a comrade But what s this about the new strike Big gold excitement richer than Bonanza and Eldorado and best of all in God s country you ll be coming I no you must remember my work Are you for giving up our enterprise to get justice done here and in other goldfields Sure thing me and Hugh in fact everything that don t wear hobbles is going And leave all this wrong unrighted Sure thing this ain t my country I m going where things can be made right overnight and there ain t no yellow legs And you Hugh are you going to Alaska Yes I think so you see the chances of getting in on a new strike seem good and well our great show has melted right away It was a fine effort but it failed I don t mind running chances in fact I m used to it and after all that s all Poo Bah and his chums know is grafting Let them keep their dirty money It s a pity a pity John was thoughtful for a time They were looking at him I don t know what I shall do if you and Frank desert me sighed John Get married and settle down Frank said bluntly You ll do all right interposed Hugh you and George got record for two claims on the left limit of Bonanza working out your quartz proposition right against discovery Well this is Chechacho Hill now reckoned amongst the richest ground in all the Klondike You and George don t need to worry about Poo Bah and Dominion Creek hillsides nor your daily bread no more I thought I would not tell George the news till I caught you two together Frank and I will try our chances again and George can stay here and watch you live happy ever afterwards John frowned his mind reverted to his Mission He believed that his duty was to the great portion of the Klondike s population whom Poo Bah and the system of grafters had wronged He refused even yet to recognize the game was up Our people he began Our people are mostly down the river striking for God s country where there ain t no yellow legs and a shot gun holds down your claim Frank is right interposed Hugh our whole big following has gone John knew this to be only too true Alas alas the fickleness of man Just like the Siwash Si Ya Creeks Hi u Chickaman we re all much alike yes yes except some and Frank glanced at Alice who then entered the room with refreshment for the visitors Frank says that far away creeks appear to hold much gold John translated for the benefit of Alice Well you re all right with your gold on Chechacho Hill said Hugh I might have known it was there if I had only thought Why asked Bruce Because of Carmack finding gold on top of twenty feet of muck I might have known that the gold slid down the hill It wasn t creek gold Bonanza was discovered on no sir it was hillside And that accounts for its being above the muck there and nowhere else If a fellow could only think right before he knows We ll try and know right down in God s country Boss Hugh and I must be going now George won t be going with us he has his claim in this yellow leg country In the way of the goldfields they proceeded at once to say good bye Corte and Spencer took their shares of the gold Frank had brought from Dominion Creek and went carrying all manner of wishes for good from those they were leaving behind CHAPTER XXXIX RETROSPECTION Constable Hope had been attracted by John Berwick and meant to see more of him So that when he met him one day with his arm in a sling he showed himself friendly Smoothbore s trooper was a youth of ideas a good type of the fine force Though he was still but twenty four years of age his life had so often been in danger that he had courage and character far beyond his years As the incident which broke down the conspiracy had proved he was an adventurer at heart with more than usual brilliance and spirit He would ride into a band of yelling drunken savages and get his man without showing a gun and time and again had solved difficulties through sheer daring cleverness and shrewd knowledge of men He played the game for love of the game Money by way of graft he did not deem any reward John Berwick had interested him He felt that they held interests in common so when they met he addressed him He was not in uniform and Berwick had no idea he belonged to the police He followed John into one of the gambling halls whither John had gone in search of any of his old time colleagues who might not have joined the stampede As standing beside each other they watched the play at a Black Jack table a burly Swede lounged up and from his hip pocket drew out a bag of dust which he laid on the table in line with the wagers of the other players The sack held about three thousand dollars worth of gold The dealer dealt each man a card slipping it under his wager and then dealt another round The different players starting with the one on the dealer s left after looking at what they had drawn either tapped their cards if they wished another card or placed their hand beneath their wager if they were content to stand When it came to the Scandinavian s turn he stood stupidly looking at his gold Well what do you intend to do asked the dealer Have I got to leave that gold there No you can take it up if you want to replied the other The Swede hesitated then picked up his gold and walked away while the dealer idly turned over the cards at sight of which even the stoic Dawson audience grew noisy with comments The cards turned up were an ace and a king Black Jack a winning hand against all others That s what a fellow gets whose nerve fails him remarked Constable Hope Yes but perhaps it is not always better to win Constable Hope glanced shrewdly at John He followed up the thought with a searching remark I wonder if it would have been better if the miners had won against the officials I wonder The remark was not encouraging I heard you make your speech at the finish of the Dominion Creek stampede Hope persisted in saying there does not seem to be much agitation in these days No the discontented or rather the wronged have gone down the river preferring the chances of a new field to securing justice here Those who have property are afraid to speak A goldfield is not a place where principle flourishes You re not like the Swede you didn t lose your nerve said Hope Berwick made no reply Did you ever see a good man lose his nerve the policeman asked No Well I have Once I was in the mountains down below with a buck policeman a Scotch Canadian from back east and as good a trooper as ever sat a horse Got lost in a blizzard on the prairies later on and they never found him till spring the coyotes had not left much of him Well Chisholm and I went hunting one day and travelling along came to a box canyon We decided to try and cross it it was a couple of hundred feet deep and we started Chisholm going first I let him down he holding my hands with one of his while with the other he grabbed a bush No sooner had he put his foot on the ledge we figured on getting down to than he found it soft and yielding For some reason he dropped my hand and grabbed at a tuft of moss and hung there Then his footing went further down which drew his chest tight against the wall of the canyon I threw myself on my stomach and grabbed him by the collar and said Jump His eyes glistened and he appeared not to hear me Then I looked over the edge and saw that the ledge he had been standing on had given way entirely and that he was suspended by his arms alone He would not speak he would not move The wild light in his eyes faded a bit but there he hung to all appearance dead Had I not had a lariat with me I should have been powerless As it was I got a slip knot around his feet and so up under his arms and this I made fast to a tree Then I laughed at him It is a wonderful light that which comes into men s eyes at the fear of death I have only seen it once again in the eyes of a mother travelling on a river steamer who thought her child had fallen overboard Losing your nerve is dangerous When their drink and Hope s story were finished they walked out in the street where they met Smoothbore As they passed him John nodded and his companion brought his hand half way to the salute and then lowered it Hope had given himself away the other saw he was a policeman You know Smoothbore Hope asked I have spoken to him Hope did not reply for a moment after which he continued There s a man who never loses his nerve It was the highest tribute Hope could pay Did you ever hear of Paper collar Johnnie No said John Paper collar was an officer down below and he and Smoothbore were pals They were out to a banquet one night and returning home late in fact dawn was breaking over the prairie cold and misty when they reached the ford of the river outside their post It had been raining hard the stream had risen and the driver drew up before the ford and said The river seems pretty bad sir Hold on said Paper collar this won t do mustn t try and cross that ford if the river is in flood Driver halt ordered Smoothbore my companion wishes to alight get down sir Paper collar stepped down on the prairie Now driver the ford And he took it all right Yes sir and hours afterwards a patrol from the fort picked up poor Paper collar What would Smoothbore have done had the miners risen after the Dominion Creek stampede Berwick ventured to ask He d have fought and the police would have stood by him He d have used his nerve I learn there is a Nordenfelt and a maxim in the Passes If the miners had got them down here and hauled them to the top of the Dome they would have made things hot in the Barracks Well maxim or no maxim Smoothbore would have fought Neither he nor any of the police do any grafting but we should have fought Perhaps it is as well the Alaska stampede began said Berwick musingly It was very much better said Hope decisively So they parted and Berwick felt the last word had been said about his bid for miners justice CHAPTER XL THE HAPPY ENDING When the next day Alice accompanied John and George Bruce in a first visit to their claims on Chechacho Hill they saw that the signal thrown out by the first red tints of the maples and the willows which told of summer ending and the dreary months of winter beginning was shown The sun was shining brightly but already it seemed robbed of some of its heat Alice had often pictured life at the diggings She had read numbers of mining camp stories with scenes laid in America and Australia yet had gained little insight to the realities She gloried in the experience and was eager to urge them on Hurry hurry but John exhorted her to stay her speed for the distance they had to go was twenty four miles and the trail though many of the mud holes had dried was rough She looked at the men she met hunting for the type of her fancy the type engendered by novel and tale No one seemed armed save occasionally with a rifle or a shot gun but the wild man with the brace of pistols bandolier huge moustache and homicidal aspect did not present himself They crossed the Klondike by Poo Bah s ferry Once in Bonanza Valley Alice felt she had left the civilized world behind her and was entering the enchanted regions of Nature To her in her happy illusions it was fairy land Few women had preceded her over the Bonanza trail so that men mushing who passed their fellows with lowered head openly stared at her and many of these lonely wayfarers would have been glad of a word from her to hear again the sweet soft accents of the better world outside For to the men of the frontier the idea of home is very refined and dear and women ever virtuous and tender so that the appearance of Alice Peel on the Bonanza trail upon that glorious day was to them as a beautiful picture and an uplifting influence One grizzled miner hurried out holding a gold pan full of nuggets dust and black sand Put your hand into it lady and see what it feels like Alice did so and thought it felt like any other sand only heavier He then selected a nugget worth quite a sovereign from the pan and gave it to her Why did you give me this Because you are a lady Alice looked perplexed Keep it as a souvenir said John so she thanked the man and slipped the nugget inside her glove But that was not to be the limit of their host s hospitality for as they turned to go he said It s just about noon and if you ve walked from Dawson the lady must be near petered Better stay and have dinner We thought of dining at the road house at Discovery said George We have some ground on Chechacho Hill I can give you a better feed here moose meat either steak or nose whichever you fancy You see lady in the old days this was a sort of a pet locality for moose so they stray in once in a while yet and sometimes they don t get a chance to get away again The sound of a horn came from a tent close by The signal was answered by a general throwing down of tools and the half dozen men at work made their way towards the tent They all washed in a couple of tin basins and dried themselves on a filthy towel Alice and her companions were ushered into the dining tent where John s quick eyes noticed extra places had been set Alice was asked to sit at the head of the table in the owner s place John and George were seated at her right and the owner Wild Horse Bill on the left The men were already hard at work consuming their food moose steak pork and beans and great pieces of bread As they sat down the cook placed on the table a large tin platter in which was a piece of meat of indescribable colour and shape This is moose nose lady the best part of the animal and along with the beaver tail and wild cat makes the finest eating in the Northland Wild cat Alice exclaimed She had indeed read of the tail of Canada s mascot being a frontier dainty but moose nose and especially wild cat were new and did not sound altogether attractive articles of diet Yes lady the lynx or wild cat is the best eating the trapper knows in the Northland You would think you were eating chicken As for moose nose and beaver tail one is much like the other The owner pushed the platter containing the strange dainty towards Alice with the words Help yourself lady Alice was game and without showing her disinclination she took up the knife and fork and cut off a piece of the blubberous meat and put it on her plate After they had walked about a mile and a half beyond the claim where they had lunched they stood beneath Chechacho Hill at the north east a quarter of a mile down stream from where Carmack had made his discovery and John pointed to where their claims were situate Men were at work rocking gold on the next claim to John s When they reached their claims Alice looked across the valley noting the great stretches of poplar and birch golden yellow in their autumn tints and smiled at the beauty of it till out of the chilled atmosphere somewhere came the whisper Make haste and provide I should like to live here always whispered Alice to John while Bruce went to talk with the men working on the claim alongside Always is a long time and every day will not be as beautiful as this but for a year or two Yes for a year or two And so it was decided They were married in the little church by the side of the slough in Dawson PRINTED BY HAZELL WATSON AND VINEY LD LONDON AND AYLESBURY ENGLAND Transcriber s Note
