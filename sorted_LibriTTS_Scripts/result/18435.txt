GOOD THINGS TO EAT AS SUGGESTED BY RUFUS A COLLECTION OF PRACTICAL RECIPES FOR PREPARING MEATS GAME FOWL FISH PUDDINGS PASTRIES et cetera BY RUFUS ESTES FORMERLY OF THE PULLMAN COMPANY PRIVATE CAR SERVICE AND PRESENT CHEF OF THE SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES OF THE UNITED STATES STEEL CORPORATIONS IN CHICAGO Illustration CHICAGO PUBLISHED BY THE AUTHOR nineteen eleven Copyrighted nineteen eleven BY RUFUS ESTES CHICAGO FOREWORD That the average parent is blind to the faults of its offspring is a fact so obvious that in attempting to prove or controvert it time and logic are both wasted Ill temper in a child is alas too often mistaken for an indication of genius and impudence is sometimes regarded as a sign of precocity The author however has honestly striven to avoid this common prejudice This book the child of his brain and experience extending over a long period of time and varying environment he frankly admits is not without its faults is far from perfect but he is satisfied that notwithstanding its apparent shortcomings it will serve in a humble way some useful purpose The recipes given in the following pages represent the labor of years Their worth has been demonstrated not experimentally but by actual tests day by day and month by month under dissimilar and in many instances not too favorable conditions One of the pleasures in life to the normal man is good eating and if it be true that real happiness consists in making others happy the author can at least feel a sense of gratification in the thought that his attempts to satisfy the cravings of the inner man have not been wholly unappreciated by the many that he has had the pleasure of serving some of whom are now his stanchest friends In fact it was in response to the insistence and encouragement of these friends that he embarked in the rather hazardous undertaking of offering this collection to a discriminating public To snatch from his daily toil a few moments here and there in order to arrange with some degree of symmetry not the delicacies that would awaken the jaded appetite of the gourmet but to prepare an ensemble that might with equal grace adorn the home table or banquet board has proven a task of no mean proportions Encouraged by his friends however he persevered and this volume is the results of his effort If when gathered around the festal board in camp or by fireside on train or ship trying out the recipes his friends will pause retrospectively and with kindly feelings think from whence some of the good things emanated the author will feel amply compensated for the care the thought the labor he has expended in the preparation of the book and to those friends individually and collectively it is therefore dedicated SKETCH OF MY LIFE I was born in Murray County Tennessee in eighteen fifty seven a slave I was given the name of my master D J Estes who owned my mother s family consisting of seven boys and two girls I being the youngest of the family After the war broke out all the male slaves in the neighborhood for miles around ran off and joined the Yankees This left us little folks to bear the burdens At the age of five I had to carry water from the spring about a quarter of a mile from the house drive the cows to and from the pastures mind the calves gather chips et cetera In eighteen sixty seven my mother moved to Nashville Tennessee my grandmother s home where I attended one term of school Two of my brothers were lost in the war a fact that wrecked my mother s health somewhat and I thought I could be of better service to her and prolong her life by getting work When summer came I got work milking cows for some neighbors for which I got two dollars a month I also carried hot dinners for the laborers in the fields for which each one paid me twenty five cents per month All of this of course went to my mother I worked at different places until I was sixteen years old but long before that time I was taking care of my mother At the age of sixteen I was employed in Nashville by a restaurant keeper named Hemphill I worked there until I was twenty one years of age In eighteen eighty one I came to Chicago and got a position at seventy seven Clark Street where I remained for two years at a salary of ten dollars a week In eighteen eighty three I entered the Pullman service my first superintendent being J P Mehen I remained in their service until eighteen ninety seven During the time I was in their service some of the most prominent people in the world traveled in the car assigned to me as I was selected to handle all special parties Among the distinguished people who traveled in my care were Stanley the African explorer President Cleveland President Harrison Adelina Patti the noted singer of the world at that time Booth and Barrett Modjeski and Paderewski I also had charge of the car for Princess Eulalie of Spain when she was the guest of Chicago during the World s Fair In eighteen ninety four I set sail from Vancouver on the Empress of China with mister and missus Nathan A Baldwin for Japan visiting the Cherry Blossom Festival at Tokio In eighteen ninety seven mister Arthur Stillwell at that time president of the Kansas City Pittsburg Gould Railroad gave me charge of his magnificent twenty thousand dollars private car I remained with him seventeen months when the road went into the hands of receivers and the car was sold to John W Gates syndicate However I had charge of the car under the new management until nineteen oh seven since which time I have been employed as chef of the subsidiary companies of the United States Steel Corporation in Chicago HINTS TO KITCHEN MAIDS It is always necessary to keep your kitchen in the best condition Breakfast If a percolator is used it should first be put into operation If the breakfast consists of grapefruit cereals et cetera your cereal should be the next article prepared If there is no diningroom maid you can then put your diningroom in order If hot bread is to be served including cakes that is the next thing to be prepared Your gas range is of course lighted and your oven heated Perhaps you have for breakfast poached eggs on toast Deerfoot sausage or boiled ham One of the above with your other dishes is enough for a person employed indoors When your breakfast gong is sounded put your biscuits eggs bread et cetera in the oven so that they may be ready to serve when the family have eaten their grapefruit and cereal Luncheon This is the easiest meal of the three to prepare Yesterday s dinner perhaps consisted of roast turkey beef or lamb and there is some meat left over then pick out one of my receipts calling for minced or creamed meats baked or stuffed potatoes are always nice or there may be cold potatoes left over that can be mashed made into cakes and fried Dinner For a roast beef dinner serve vegetable soup as the first course with a relish of vegetables in season and horseradish or chow chow pickle unless you serve salad If quail or ducks are to be served for dinner an old Indian dish wild rice is very desirable Prepare this rice as follows Place in a double boiler a cupful of milk or cream to each cupful of rice and add salt and pepper to taste It requires a little longer to cook than the ordinary rice but must not be stirred If it becomes dry add a little milk from time to time Do not serve dishes at the same meal that conflict For instance if you have sliced tomatoes do not serve tomato soup If however you have potato soup it would not be out of place to serve potatoes with your dinner Fish should never be served

BROILING STEAK While many prefer steak fairly well done still the great majority desire to have it either rare or certainly not overdone For those who wish a steak well done completely through and still not to have the outside crisp to a cinder it is necessary to cut the steak possibly as thin as one half inch and then the outside can have that delicious and intense scorching which quickly prevents the escape of juices and also gives the slightly burned taste which at its perfect condition is the most delicious flavor from my own preference that can be given to a steak By this I do not mean a steak burned to a cinder but slightly scorched over a very hot fire FOR RARE BROILED STEAK For those who are fond of rare steak it can be cut from one inch to one and one quarter inches in thickness and the outside thoroughly and quickly broiled leaving the inside practically only partially cooked so that the blood will follow the knife and still the steak has been heated completely through and a thin crust on either side has been well cooked which has formed the shell to retain the juices PROPERLY FRYING STEAK To fry steak properly although some claim it is not proper to fry steak under any circumstances it is necessary to have the butter oleo fat or grease piping hot for two reasons First the steak sears over quickly and the juices are thus retained within the steak to better advantage than by the slow process of cooking but even more important is the fact that the incrustation thus formed not only holds the juices within the steak but prevents the fat from penetrating and making the steak greasy soggy and unattractive As a rule however we must acknowledge that broiled steak is in varying degrees largely superior to fried steak BROILED LOIN STEAKS Two loin steaks of about a pound each season with salt and pepper to taste baste on either side with a little oil Place on a broiler over a bright charcoal fire and broil for six minutes on each side
