none	none	the rule wasn t observed too closely The men themselves were too keyed up and excited to rest easily But as soon as the scores began to mount and eliminations cut into their ranks there was complete silence after dark Particularly so on this last night when only two of the little cubicles were occupied the thousands of others standing with dark empty doors Angry words had dragged Brion from a deep and exhausted sleep The words were whispered but clear two voices just outside the thin metal of his door Someone spoke his name Brion Brandd Of course not Whoever said you could was making a big mistake and there is going to be trouble Don t talk like an idiot The other voice snapped with a harsh urgency clearly used to command I m here because the matter is of utmost importance and Brandd is the one I must see Now stand aside The Twenties I don t give a damn about your games hearty cheers and physical exercises This is important or I wouldn t be here The other didn t speak he was surely one of the officials and Brion could sense his outraged anger He must have drawn his gun because the intruder said quickly Put that away You re being a fool Out was the single snarled word of the response There was silence then and still wondering Brion was once more asleep Ten seconds The voice chopped away Brion s memories and he let awareness seep back into his body He was unhappily conscious of his total exhaustion The month of continuous mental and physical combat had taken its toll It would be hard to stay on his feet much less summon the strength and skill to fight and win a touch How do we stand he asked the handler who was kneading his aching muscles Four four All you need is a touch to win That s all he needs too Brion grunted opening his eyes to look at the wiry length of the man at the other end of the long mat No one who had reached the finals in the Twenties could possibly be a weak opponent but this one Irolg was the pick of the lot A red haired mountain of a man with an apparently inexhaustible store of energy That was really all that counted now There could be little art in this last and final round of fencing Just thrust and parry and victory to the stronger Brion closed his eyes again and knew the moment he had been hoping to avoid had arrived Every man who entered the Twenties had his own training tricks Brion had a few individual ones that had helped him so far He was a moderately strong chess player but he had moved to quick victory in the chess rounds by playing incredibly unorthodox games This was no accident but the result of years of work He had a standing order with off planet agents for archaic chess books the older the better He had memorized thousands of these ancient games and openings This was allowed Anything was allowed that didn t involve drugs or machines Self hypnosis was an accepted tool It had taken Brion over two years to find a way to tap the sources of hysterical strength Common as the phenomenon seemed to be in the textbooks it proved impossible to duplicate There appeared to be an immediate association with the death trauma as if the two were inextricably linked into one Berserkers and juramentados continue to fight and kill though carved by scores of mortal wounds Men with bullets in the heart or brain fight on though already clinically dead Death seemed an inescapable part of this kind of strength But there was another type that could easily be brought about in any deep trance hypnotic rigidity The strength that enables someone in a trance to hold his body stiff and unsupported except at two points the head and heels This is physically impossible when conscious Working with this as a clue Brion had developed a self hypnotic technique that allowed him to tap this reservoir of unknown strength the source of second wind the survival strength that made the difference between life and death It could also kill exhaust the body beyond hope of recovery particularly when in a weakened condition as his was now But that wasn t important Others had died before during the Twenties and death during the last round was in some ways easier than defeat Breathing deeply Brion softly spoke the auto hypnotic phrases that triggered the process Fatigue fell softly from him as did all sensations of heat cold and pain He could feel with acute sensitivity hear and see clearly when he opened his eyes With each passing second the power drew at the basic reserves of life draining it from his body When the buzzer sounded he pulled his foil from his second s startled grasp and ran forward Irolg had barely time to grab up his own weapon and parry Brion s first thrust The force of his rush was so great that the guards on their weapons locked and their bodies crashed together Irolg looked amazed at the sudden fury of the attack then smiled He thought it was a last burst of energy he knew how close they both were to exhaustion This must be the end for Brion They disengaged and Irolg put up a solid defense He didn t attempt to attack just let Brion wear himself out against the firm shield of his defense Brion saw something close to panic on his opponent s face when the man finally recognized his error Brion wasn t tiring If anything he was pressing the attack A wave of despair rolled out from Irolg Brion sensed it and knew the fifth point was his Thrust thrust and each time the parrying sword a little slower to return Then the powerful twist that thrust it aside In and under the guard The slap of the button on flesh and the arc of steel that reached out and ended on Irolg s chest over his heart Waves of sound cheering and screaming lapped against Brion s private world but he was only remotely aware of their existence Irolg dropped his foil and tried to shake Brion s hand but his legs suddenly gave way Brion had an arm around him holding him up walking towards the rushing handlers Then Irolg was gone and he waved off his own men walking slowly by himself Except that something was wrong and it was like walking through warm glue Walking on his knees No not walking falling At last He was able to let go and fall II Ihjel gave the doctors exactly one day before he went to the hospital Brion wasn t dead though there had been some doubt about that the night before Now a full day later he was on the mend and that was all Ihjel wanted to know He bullied and strong armed his way to the new Winner s room meeting his first stiff resistance at the door You re out of order Winner Ihjel the doctor said And if you keep on forcing yourself in here where you are not wanted rank or no rank I shall be obliged to break your head Ihjel had just begun to tell him in some detail just how slim his chances were of accomplishing that when Brion interrupted them both He recognized the newcomer s voice from the final night in the barracks Let him in doctor Caulry he said I want to meet a man who thinks there is something more important than the Twenties While the doctor stood undecided Ihjel moved quickly around him and closed the door in his flushed face He looked down at the Winner in the bed There was a drip plugged into each one of Brion s arms His eyes peered from sooty hollows the eyeballs were a network of red veins The silent battle he fought against death had left its mark His square jutting jaw now seemed all bone as did his long nose and high cheekbones They were prominent landmarks rising from the limp greyness of his skin Only the erect bristle of his close cropped hair was unchanged He had the appearance of having suffered a long and wasting illness You look like sin Ihjel said But congratulations on your victory You don t look so very good yourself for a Winner Brion snapped back His exhaustion and sudden peevish anger at this man let the insulting words slip out Ihjel ignored them But it was true Winner Ihjel looked very little like a Winner or even an Anvharian He had the height and the frame all right but it was draped in billows of fat rounded soft tissue that hung loosely from his limbs and made little limp rolls on his neck and under his eyes There were no fat men on Anvhar and it was incredible that a man so gross could ever have been a Winner If there was muscle under the fat it couldn t be seen Only his eyes appeared to still hold the strength that had once bested every man on the planet to win the annual games Brion turned away from their burning stare sorry now he had insulted the man without good reason He was too sick though to bother about apologizing Ihjel didn t care either Brion looked at him again and felt the impression of things so important that he himself his insults even the Twenties were of no more interest than dust motes in the air It was only a fantasy of a sick mind Brion knew and he tried to shake the feeling off The two men stared at each other sharing a common emotion The door opened soundlessly behind Ihjel and he wheeled about moving as only an athlete of Anvhar can move doctor Caulry was halfway through the door off balance Two men in uniform came close behind him Ihjel s body pushed against them his speed and the mountainous mass of his flesh sending them back in a tangle of arms and legs He slammed the door and locked it in their faces I have to talk to you he said turning back to Brion Privately he added bending over and ripping out the communicator with a sweep of one hand Get out Brion told him If I were able Well you re not so you re just going to have to lie there and listen I imagine we have about five minutes before they decide to break the door down and I don t want to waste any more of that Will you come with me offworld There s a job that must be done it s my job but I m going to need help You re the only one who can give me that help Now refuse he added as Brion started to answer Of course I refuse Brion said feeling a little foolish and slightly angry as if the other man had put the words into his mouth Anvhar is my planet 
2194_141235_000012_000003	train-clean-360	why 
none	none	should I leave My life is here and so is my work I also might add that I have just won the Twenties I have a responsibility to remain Nonsense I m a Winner and I left What you really mean is you would like to enjoy a little of the ego inflation you have worked so hard to get Off Anvhar no one even knows what a Winner is much less respects one You will have to face a big universe out there and I don t blame you for being a little frightened Someone was hammering loudly on the door I haven t the strength to get angry Brion said hoarsely And I can t bring myself to admire your ideas when they permit you to insult a man too ill to defend himself I apologize Ihjel said with no hint of apology or sympathy in his voice But there are more desperate issues involved than your hurt feelings We don t have much time now so I want to impress you with an idea An idea that will convince me to go offplanet with you That s expecting a lot No this idea won t convince you but thinking about it will If you really consider it you will find a lot of your illusions shattered Like everyone else on Anvhar you re a scientific humanist with your faith firmly planted in the Twenties You accept both of these noble institutions without an instant s thought All of you haven t a single thought for the past for the untold billions who led the bad life as mankind slowly built up the good life for you to lead Do you ever think of all the people who suffered and died in misery and superstition while civilization was clicking forward one more slow notch Of course I don t think about them Brion retorted Why should I I can t change the past But you can change the future Ihjel said You owe something to the suffering ancestors who got you where you are today If Scientific Humanism means anything more than just words to you you must possess a sense of responsibility Don t you want to try and pay off a bit of this debt by helping others who are just as backward and disease ridden today as great grandfather Troglodyte ever was The hammering on the door was louder This and the drug induced buzzing in Brion s ear made thinking difficult Abstractly I of course agree with you he said haltingly But you know there is nothing I can do personally without being emotionally involved A logical decision is valueless for action without personal meaning Then we have reached the crux of the matter Ihjel said gently His back was braced against the door absorbing the thudding blows of some heavy object on the outside They re knocking so I must be going soon I have no time for details but I can assure you upon my word of honor as a Winner that there is something you can do Only you If you help me we might save seven million human lives That is a fact The lock burst and the door started to open Ihjel shouldered it back into the frame for a final instant Here is the idea I want you to consider Why is it that the people of Anvhar in a galaxy filled with warring hate filled backward planets should be the only ones who base their entire existence on a complicated series of games III This time there was no way to hold the door Ihjel didn t try He stepped aside and two men stumbled into the room He walked out behind their backs without saying a word What happened What did he do the doctor asked rushing in through the ruined door He swept a glance over the continuous recording dials at the foot of Brion s bed Respiration temperature heart blood pressure all were normal The patient lay quietly and didn t answer him For the rest of that day Brion had much to think about It was difficult The fatigue mixed with the tranquilizers and other drugs had softened his contact with reality His thoughts kept echoing back and forth in his mind unable to escape What had Ihjel meant What was that nonsense about Anvhar Anvhar was that way because well it just was It had come about naturally Or had it The planet had a very simple history From the very beginning there had never been anything of real commercial interest on Anvhar Well off the interstellar trade routes there were no minerals worth digging and transporting the immense distances to the nearest inhabited worlds Hunting the winter beasts for their pelts was a profitable but very minor enterprise never sufficient for mass markets Therefore no organized attempt had ever been made to colonize the planet In the end it had been settled completely by chance A number of offplanet scientific groups had established observation and research stations finding unlimited data to observe and record during Anvhar s unusual yearly cycle The long duration observations encouraged the scientific workers to bring their families and slowly but steadily small settlements grew up Many of the fur hunters settled there as well adding to the small population This had been the beginning Few records existed of those early days and the first six centuries of Anvharian history were more speculation than fact The Breakdown occurred about that time and in the galaxy wide disruption Anvhar had to fight its own internal battle When the Earth Empire collapsed it was the end of more than an era Many of the observation stations found themselves representing institutions that no longer existed The professional hunters no longer had markets for their furs since Anvhar possessed no interstellar ships of its own There had been no real physical hardship involved in the Breakdown as it affected Anvhar since the planet was completely self sufficient Once they had made the mental adjustment to the fact that they were now a sovereign world not a collection of casual visitors with various loyalties life continued unchanged Not easy living on Anvhar is never easy but at least without difference on the surface The thoughts and attitudes of the people were however going through a great transformation Many attempts were made to develop some form of stable society and social relationship Again little record exists of these early trials other than the fact of their culmination in the Twenties To understand the Twenties you have to understand the unusual orbit that Anvhar tracks around its sun seventy Ophiuchi There are other planets in this system all of them more or less conforming to the plane of the ecliptic Anvhar is obviously a rogue perhaps a captured planet of another sun For the greatest part of its seven hundred eighty day year it arcs far out from its primary in a high angled sweeping cometary orbit When it returns there is a brief hot summer of approximately eighty days before the long winter sets in once more This severe difference in seasonal change has caused profound adaptations in the native life forms During the winter most of the animals hibernate the vegetable life lying dormant as spores or seeds Some of the warm blooded herbivores stay active in the snow covered tropics preyed upon by fur insulated carnivores Though unbelievably cold the winter is a season of peace in comparison to the summer For summer is a time of mad growth Plants burst into life with a strength that cracks rocks growing fast enough for the motion to be seen The snowfields melt into mud and within days a jungle stretches high into the air Everything grows swells proliferates Plants climb on top of plants fighting for the life energy of the sun Everything is eat and be eaten grow and thrive in that short season Because when the first snow of winter falls again ninety per cent of the year must pass until the next coming of warmth Mankind has had to adapt to the Anvharian cycle in order to stay alive Food must be gathered and stored enough to last out the long winter Generation after generation had adapted until they look on the mad seasonal imbalance as something quite ordinary The first thaw of the almost nonexistent spring triggers a wide reaching metabolic change in the humans Layers of subcutaneous fat vanish and half dormant sweat glands come to life Other changes are more subtle than the temperature adjustment but equally important The sleep center of the brain is depressed Short naps or a night s rest every third or fourth day becomes enough Life takes on a hectic and hysterical quality that is perfectly suited to the environment By the time of the first frost rapid growing crops have been raised and harvested sides of meat either preserved or frozen in mammoth lockers With this supreme talent of adaptability mankind has become part of the ecology and guaranteed his own survival during the long winter Physical survival has been guaranteed But what about mental survival Primitive Earth Eskimos can fall into a long doze of half conscious hibernation Civilized men might be able to do this but only for the few cold months of terrestrial midwinter It would be impossible to do during a winter that is longer than an Earth year With all the physical needs taken care of boredom became the enemy of any Anvharian who was not a hunter And even the hunters could not stay out on solitary trek all winter Drink was one answer and violence another Alcoholism and murder were the twin terrors of the cold season after the Breakdown It was the Twenties that ended all that When they became a part of normal life the summer was considered just an interlude between games The Twenties were more than just a contest they became a way of life that satisfied all the physical competitive and intellectual needs of this unusual planet They were a decathlon rather a double decathlon raised to its highest power where contests in chess and poetry composition held equal place with those in ski jumping and archery Each year there were two planet wide contests held one for men and one for women This was not an attempt at sexual discrimination but a logical facing of facts Inherent differences prevented fair contests for example it is impossible for a woman to win a large chess tournament and this fact was recognized Anyone could enter for any number of years There were no scoring handicaps When the best man won he was really the best man A complicated series of playoffs and eliminations kept contestants and observers busy for half the winter They were only preliminary to the final encounter that lasted a month and picked a single winner That was the title he was awarded Winner The man and woman who had bested every other contestant on the entire planet and who would remain unchallenged until the following year Winner It was a title to take pride in Brion stirred weakly on his bed and managed to turn so he could look out of the window Winner of Anvhar His name was already slated for the history books one of the handful of planetary heroes School children would be studying him now just as he had read of the Winners of the past Weaving daydreams and imaginary adventures around Brion s victories hoping and fighting to equal them someday To be a Winner was the greatest honor in the universe Outside the afternoon sun shimmered weakly in a dark sky The endless icefields soaked up the dim light reflecting it back as a colder and harsher illumination A single figure on skis cut a line across the empty plain nothing else moved The depression of the ultimate fatigue fell on Brion and everything changed as if he looked in a mirror at a previously hidden side He saw suddenly with
2404_141242_000024_000000	train-clean-360	 terrible 
none	none	clarity that to be a Winner was to be absolutely nothing Like being the best flea among all the fleas on a single dog What was Anvhar after all An ice locked planet inhabited by a few million human fleas unknown and unconsidered by the rest of the galaxy There was nothing here worth fighting for the wars after the Breakdown had left them untouched The Anvharians had always taken pride in this as if being so unimportant that no one else even wanted to come near you could possibly be a source of pride All the other worlds of man grew fought won lost changed Only on Anvhar did life repeat its sameness endlessly like a loop of tape in a player Brion s eyes were moist he blinked Tears Realization of this incredible fact wiped the maudlin pity from his mind and replaced it with fear Had his mind snapped in the strain of the last match These thoughts weren t his Self pity hadn t made him a Winner why was he feeling it now Anvhar was his universe how could he even imagine it as a tag end planet at the outer limb of creation What had come over him and induced this inverse thinking As he thought the question the answer appeared at the same instant Winner Ihjel The fat man with the strange pronouncements and probing questions Had he cast a spell like some sorcerer or the devil in Faust No that was pure nonsense But he had done something Perhaps planted a suggestion when Brion s resistance was low Or used subliminal vocalization like the villain in Cerebrus Chained Brion could find no adequate reason on which to base his suspicions But he knew with sure positiveness that Ihjel was responsible He whistled at the sound switch next to his pillow and the repaired communicator came to life The duty nurse appeared in the small screen The man who was here today Brion said Winner Ihjel Do you know where he is I must contact him For some reason this flustered her professional calm The nurse started to answer excused herself and blanked the screen When it lit again a man in guard s uniform had taken her place You made an inquiry the guard said about Winner Ihjel We are holding him here in the hospital following the disgraceful way in which he broke into your room I have no charges to make Will you ask him to come and see me at once The guard controlled his shock I m sorry Winner I don t see how we can doctor Caulry left specific orders that you were not to be The doctor has no control over my personal life Brion interrupted I m not infectious nor ill with anything more than extreme fatigue I want to see that man At once The guard took a deep breath and made a quick decision He is on the way up now he said and rung off What did you do to me Brion asked as soon as Ihjel had entered and they were alone You won t deny that you have put alien thoughts in my head No I won t deny it Because the whole point of my being here is to get those alien thoughts across to you Tell me how you did it Brion insisted I must know I ll tell you but there are many things you should understand first before you decide to leave Anvhar You must not only hear them you will have to believe them The primary thing the clue to the rest is the true nature of your life here How do you think the Twenties originated Before he answered Brion carefully took a double dose of the mild stimulant he was allowed I don t think he said I know It s a matter of historical record The founder of the games was Giroldi the first contest was held in three hundred seventy eight A B The Twenties have been held every year since then They were strictly local affairs in the beginning but were soon well established on a planet wide scale True enough Ihjel said But you re describing what happened I asked you how the Twenties originated How could any single man take a barbarian planet lightly inhabited by half mad hunters and alcoholic farmers and turn it into a smooth running social machine built around the artificial structure of the Twenties It just couldn t be done But it was done Brion insisted You can t deny that And there is nothing artificial about the Twenties They are a logical way to live a life on a planet like this Ihjel laughed a short ironic bark Very logical he said but how often does logic have anything to do with the organization of social groups and governments You re not thinking Put yourself in founder Giroldi s place Imagine that you have glimpsed the great idea of the Twenties and you want to convince others So you walk up to the nearest louse ridden brawling superstitious booze embalmed hunter and explain clearly How a program of his favorite sports things like poetry archery and chess can make his life that much more interesting and virtuous You do that But keep your eyes open at the same time and be ready for a fast draw Even Brion had to smile at the absurdity of the suggestion Of course it couldn t happen that way Yet since it had happened there must be a simple explanation We can beat this back and forth all day Ihjel told him and you won t get the right idea unless He broke off suddenly staring at the communicator The operation light had come on though the screen stayed dark Ihjel reached down a meaty hand and pulled loose the recently connected wires That doctor of yours is very curious and he s going to stay that way The truth behind the Twenties is none of his business But it s going to be yours You must come to realize that the life you lead here is a complete and artificial construction developed by Societics experts and put into application by skilled field workers Nonsense Brion broke in Systems of society can t be dreamed up and forced on people like that Not without bloodshed and violence Nonsense yourself Ihjel told him That may have been true in the dawn of history but not any more You have been reading too many of the old Earth classics you imagine that we still live in the Ages of Superstition Just because fascism and communism were once forced on reluctant populations you think this holds true for all time Go back to your books In exactly the same era democracy and self government were adapted by former colonial states like India and the Union of North Africa and the only violence was between local religious groups Change is the lifeblood of mankind Everything we today accept as normal was at one time an innovation And one of the most recent innovations is the attempt to guide the societies of mankind into something more consistent with the personal happiness of individuals The God complex Brion said forcing human lives into a mold whether they want to be fitted into it or not Societies can be that Ihjel agreed It was in the beginning and there were some disastrous results of attempts to force populations into a political climate where they didn t belong They weren t all failures Anvhar here is a striking example of how good the technique can be when correctly applied It s not done this way any more though As with all of the other sciences we have found out that the more we know the more there is to know We no longer attempt to guide cultures towards what we consider a beneficial goal There are too many goals and from our limited vantage point it is hard to tell the good ones from the bad ones All we do now is try to protect the growing cultures give a little jolt to the stagnating ones and bury the dead ones When the work was first done here on Anvhar the theory hadn t progressed that far The understandably complex equations that determine just where in the scale from a Type I to a Type V a culture is had not yet been completed The technique then was to work out an artificial culture that would be most beneficial for a planet then bend it into the mold How can that be done Brion asked How was it done here We ve made some progress you re finally asking how The technique here took a good number of agents and a great deal of money Personal honor was emphasized in order to encourage dueling and this led to a heightened interest in the technique of personal combat When this was well intrenched Giroldi was brought in and he showed how organized competitions could be more interesting than haphazard encounters Tying the intellectual aspects onto the framework of competitive sports was a little more difficult but not overwhelmingly so The details aren t important all we are considering now is the end product Which is you You re needed very much Why me Brion asked Why am I special Because I won the Twenties I can t believe that Taken objectively there isn t that much difference between myself and the ten runner ups Why don t you ask one of them They could do your job as well as I No they couldn t I ll tell you later why you are the only man I can use Our time is running out and I must convince you of some other things first Ihjel glanced at his watch We have less than three hours to dead deadline Before that time I must explain enough of our work to you to enable you to decide voluntarily to join us A very tall order Brion said You might begin by telling me just who this mysterious we is that you keep referring to The Cultural Relationships Foundation A non governmental body privately endowed existing to promote peace and ensure the sovereign welfare of independent planets so that all will prosper from the good will and commerce thereby engendered Sounds as if you re quoting Brion told him No one could possibly make up something that sounds like that on the spur of the moment I was quoting from our charter of organization Which is all very fine in a general sense but I m talking specifically now About you You are the product of a tightly knit and very advanced society Your individuality has been encouraged by your growing up in a society so small in population that a mild form of government control is necessary The normal Anvharian education is an excellent one and participation in the Twenties has given you a general and advanced education second to none in the galaxy It would be a complete waste of your entire life if you now took all this training and wasted it on some rustic farm You give me very little credit I plan to teach Forget Anvhar Ihjel cut him off with a chop of his hand This world will roll on quite successfully whether you are here or not You must forget it think of its relative unimportance on a galactic scale and consider instead the existing suffering hordes of mankind You must think what you can do to help them But what can I do as an individual The day is long past when a single man like Caesar or Alexander could bring about world shaking changes True but not true Ihjel said There are key men in every conflict of forces men who act like catalysts applied at the right instant to start a chemical reaction You might be one of these men but I must be honest and say that I can t prove it yet So in order to save time and endless discussion I think I will have to spark your personal sense of obligation Obligation to whom To mankind of course to the countless billions of dead who kept the whole machine rolling along that allows you the full long and happy life you enjoy today What they gave to you you must pass on to others This is the keystone of humanistic morals Agreed And a very good argument in the long run But not one that is going to tempt me out of this bed within the next three hours A point of success Ihjel said You agree with the general argument Now I apply it specifically to you Here is the statement I intend to prove There exists a planet with a population of seven million people Unless I can prevent it this planet will be completely destroyed It is my job to stop that destruction so that is where I am going now I won t be able to do the job alone In addition to others I need you Not anyone like you but you and you alone You have precious little time left to convince me of all that Brion told him so let me make the job easier for you The work you do this planet the imminent danger of the people there these are all facts that you can undoubtedly supply I ll take a chance that this whole thing is not a colossal bluff and admit that given time you could verify them all This brings the argument back to me again How can you possibly prove that I am the only person in the galaxy who can help you I can prove it by your singular ability the thing I came here to find Ability I am different in no way from the other men on my planet You re wrong Ihjel said You are the embodied proof of evolution Rare individuals with specific talents occur constantly in any species man included It has been two generations since an empathetic was last born on Anvhar and I have been watching carefully most of that time What in blazes is an empathetic and how do you recognize it when you have found it Brion chuckled this talk was getting preposterous I can recognize one because I m one myself there is no other way As to how projective empathy works you had a demonstration of that a little earlier when you felt those strange thoughts about Anvhar It will be a long time before you can master that but receptive empathy is your natural trait This is mentally entering into the feeling or what could be called the spirit of another person Empathy is not thought perception it might better be described as the sensing of someone else s emotional makeup feelings and attitudes You can t lie to a trained empathetic because he can sense the real attitude behind the verbal lies Even your undeveloped talent has proved immensely useful in the Twenties You can outguess your opponent because you know his movements even as his body tenses to make them You accept this without ever questioning it How do you know This was Brion s 
2404_141240_000007_000005	train-clean-360	understood 
none	none	but never voiced secret Ihjel smiled Just guessing But I won the Twenties too remember also without knowing a thing about empathy at the time On top of our normal training it s a wonderful trait to have Which brings me to the proof we mentioned a minute ago When you said you would be convinced if I could prove you were the only person who could help me I believe you are and that is one thing I cannot lie about It s possible to lie about a belief verbally to have a falsely based belief or to change a belief But you can t lie about it to yourself Equally important you can t lie about a belief to an empathetic Would you like to see how I feel about this See is a bad word there is no vocabulary yet for this kind of thing Better would you join me in my feelings Sense my attitudes memories and emotions just as I do Brion tried to protest but he was too late The doors of his senses were pushed wide and he was overwhelmed Dis Ihjel said aloud Seven million people hydrogen bombs Brion Brandd These were just key words landmarks of association With each one Brion felt the rushing wave of the other man s emotions There could be no lies here Ihjel was right in that This was the raw stuff that feelings are made of the basic reactions to the things and symbols of memory DIS DIS DIS it was a word it was a planet and the word thundered like a drum a drum the sound of its thunder surrounded and was a wasteland a planet of death a planet where living was dying and dying was very better than living crude barbaric DIS hot burning scorching backward miserable wasteland of sands dirty beneath and sands and sands and consideration sands that burned had planet burned will burn forever the people of this planet so crude dirty miserable barbaric sub human in human less than human but they were going to be DEAD and DEAD they would be seven million blackened corpses that would blacken your dreams all dreams dreams forever because those H Y D R O G E N B O M B S were waiting to kill them unless unless unless you Ihjel stopped it you Ihjel DEATH you DEATH you DEATH alone couldn t do it you DEATH must have BRION BRANDD wet behind the ears raw untrained Brion Brandd to help you he was the only one in the galaxy who could finish the job As the flow of sensation died away Brion realized he was sprawled back weakly on his pillows soaked with sweat washed with the memory of the raw emotion Across from him Ihjel sat with his face bowed in his hands When he lifted his head Brion saw within his eyes a shadow of the blackness he had just experienced Death Brion said That terrible feeling of death It wasn t just the people of Dis who would die It was something more personal Myself Ihjel said and behind this simple word were the repeated echoes of night that Brion had been made aware of with his newly recognized ability My own death not too far away This is the wonderfully terrible price you must pay for your talent Angst is an inescapable part of empathy It is a part of the whole unknown field of psi phenomena that seems to be independent of time Death is so traumatic and final that it reverberates back along the time line The closer I get the more aware of it I am There is no exact feeling of date just a rough location in time That is the horror of it I know I will die soon after I get to Dis and long before the work there is finished I know the job to be done there and I know the men who have already failed at it I also know you are the only person who can possibly complete the work I have started Do you agree now Will you come with me Yes of course Brion said I ll go with you IV I ve never seen anyone quite as angry as that doctor Brion said Can t blame him Ihjel shifted his immense weight and grunted from the console where he was having a coded conversation with the ship s brain He hit the keys quickly and read the answer from the screen You took away his medical moment of glory How many times in his life will he have a chance to nurse back to rugged smiling health the triumphantly exhausted Winner of the Twenties Not many I imagine The wonder of it is how you managed to convince him that you and the ship here could take care of me as well as his hospital could I could never convince him of that Ihjel said But I and the Cultural Relationships Foundation have some powerful friends on Anvhar I m forced to admit I brought a little pressure to bear He leaned back and read the course tape as it streamed out of the printer We have a little time to spare but I would rather spend it waiting at the other end We ll blast as soon as I have you tied down in a stasis field The completeness of the stasis field leaves no impressions on the body or mind In it there is no weight no pressure no pain no sensation of any kind Except for a stasis of very long duration there is no sensation of time To Brion s consciousness Ihjel flipped the switch off with a continuation of the same motion that had turned it on The ship was unchanged only outside of the port was the red shot blankness of jump space How do you feel Ihjel asked Apparently the ship was wondering the same thing Its detector unit hovering impatiently just outside of Brion s stasis field darted down and settled on his bare forearm The doctor back on Anvhar had given the medical section of the ship s brain a complete briefing A quick check of a dozen factors of Brion s metabolism was compared to the expected norm Apparently everything was going well because the only reaction was the expected injection of vitamins and glucose I can t say I m feeling wonderful yet Brion answered levering himself higher on the pillows But every day it s a bit better steady progress I hope so because we have about two weeks before we get to Dis Do you think you ll be back in shape by that time No promises Brion said giving a tentative squeeze to one bicep It should be enough time though Tomorrow I start mild exercise and that will tighten me up again Now tell me more about Dis and what you have to do there I m not going to do it twice so just save your curiosity awhile We re heading for a rendezvous point now to pick up another operator This is going to be a three man team you me and an exobiologist As soon as he is aboard I ll do a complete briefing for you both at the same time What you can do now is get your head into the language box and start working on your Disan You ll want to speak it perfectly by the time we touchdown With an autohypno for complete recall Brion had no difficulty in mastering the grammar and vocabulary of Disan Pronunciation was a different matter altogether Almost all the word endings were swallowed muffled or gargled The language was rich in glottal stops clicks and guttural strangling sounds Ihjel stayed in a different part of the ship when Brion used the voice mirror and analysis scope claiming that the awful noises interfered with his digestion Their ship angled through jump space along its calculated course It kept its fragile human cargo warm fed them and supplied breathable air It had orders to worry about Brion s health so it did checking constantly against its recorded instructions and noting his steady progress Another part of the ship s brain counted microseconds with moronic fixation finally closing a relay when a predetermined number had expired in its heart A light flashed and a buzzer hummed gently but insistently Ihjel yawned put away the report he had been reading and started for the control room He shuddered when he passed the room where Brion was listening to a playback of his Disan efforts Turn off that dying brontosaurus and get strapped in he called through the thin door We re coming to the point of optimum possibility and we ll be dropping back into normal space soon The human mind can ponder the incredible distances between the stars but cannot possibly contain within itself a real understanding of them Marked out on a man s hand an inch is a large unit of measure In interstellar space a cubical area with sides a hundred thousand miles long is a microscopically fine division Light crosses this distance in a fraction of a second To a ship moving with a relative speed far greater than that of light this measuring unit is even smaller Theoretically it appears impossible to find a particular area of this size Technologically it was a repeatable miracle that occurred too often to even be interesting Brion and Ihjel were strapped in when the jump drive cut off abruptly lurching them back into normal space and time They didn t unstrap but just sat and looked at the dimly distant pattern of stars A single sun apparently of fifth magnitude was their only neighbor in this lost corner of the universe They waited while the computer took enough star sights to triangulate a position in three dimensions muttering to itself electronically while it did the countless calculations to find their position A warning bell chimed and the drive cut on and off so quickly that the two acts seemed simultaneous This happened again twice before the brain was satisfied it had made as good a fix as possible and flashed a NAVIGATION POWER OFF light Ihjel unstrapped stretched and made them a meal Ihjel had computed their passage time with precise allowances Less than ten hours after they arrived a powerful signal blasted into their waiting receiver They strapped in again as the NAVIGATION POWER ON signal blinked insistently A ship had paused in flight somewhere relatively near in the vast volume of space It had entered normal space just long enough to emit a signal of radio query on an assigned wave length Ihjel s ship had detected this and instantly responded with a verifying signal The passenger spacer had accepted this assurance and gracefully laid a ten foot metal egg in space As soon as this had cleared its jump field the parent ship vanished towards its destination light years away Ihjel s ship climbed up the signal it had received This signal had been recorded and examined minutely Angle strength and Doppler movement were computed to find course and distance A few minutes of flight were enough to get within range of the far weaker transmitter in the drop capsule Homing on this signal was so simple a human pilot could have done it himself The shining sphere loomed up then vanished out of sight of the viewports as the ship rotated to bring the spacelock into line Magnetic clamps cut in when they made contact Go down and let the bug doctor in Ihjel said I ll stay and monitor the board in case of trouble What do I have to do Get into a suit and open the outer lock Most of the drop sphere is made of inflatable metallic foil so don t bother to look for the entrance Just cut a hole in it with the oversize can opener you ll find in the tool box After doctor Morees gets aboard jettison the thing Only get the radio and locator unit out first it gets used again The tool did look like a giant can opener Brion carefully felt the resilient metal skin that covered the lock entrance until he was sure there was nothing on the other side Then he jabbed the point through and cut a ragged hole in the thin foil doctor Morees boiled out of the sphere knocking Brion aside What s the matter Brion asked There was no radio on the other s suit he couldn t answer But he did shake his fist angrily The helmet ports were opaque so there was no way to tell what expressions went with the gesture Brion shrugged and turned back to salvaging the equipment pack pushing the punctured balloon free and sealing the lock When pressure was pumped back to ship normal he cracked his helmet and motioned the other to do the same You re a pack of dirty lying dogs doctor Morees said when the helmet came off Brion was completely baffled doctor Lea Morees had long dark hair large eyes and a delicately shaped mouth now taut with anger doctor Morees was a woman Are you the filthy swine responsible for this atrocity doctor Morees asked menacingly In the control room Brion said quickly knowing when cowardice was preferable to valor A man named Ihjel There s a lot of him to hate you can have a good time doing it I just joined up myself He was talking to her back as she stormed from the room Brion hurried after her not wanting to miss the first human spark of interest in the trip to date Kidnapped Lied to and forced against my will There is no court in the galaxy that won t give you the maximum sentence and I ll scream with pleasure as they roll your fat body into solitary They shouldn t have sent a woman Ihjel said completely ignoring her words I asked for a highly qualified exobiologist for a difficult assignment Someone young and tough enough to do field work under severe conditions So the recruiting office sends me the smallest female they can find one who ll melt in the first rain I will not Lea shouted Female resiliency is a well known fact and I m in far better condition than the average woman Which has nothing to do with what I m telling you I was hired for a job in the university on Moller s World and signed a contract to that effect Then this bully of an agent tells me the contract has been changed read subparagraph one hundred eighty nine C or some such nonsense and I ll be transhipping He stuffed me into that suffocating basketball without a by your leave and they threw me overboard If that is not a violation of personal privacy Cut a new course Brion Ihjel broke in Find the nearest settled planet and head us there We have to drop this woman and find a man for this job We are going to what is undoubtedly the most interesting planet an exobiologist ever conceived of but we need a man who can take orders and not faint when it gets too hot Brion was lost Ihjel had done all the navigating and Brion had no idea how to begin a search like this Oh no you don t Lea said You don t get rid of me that easily I placed first in my class and most of the five hundred other students were male This is only a man s universe because the men say so What is the name of this garden planet where we are going Dis I ll give you a briefing as soon as I get this ship on course He turned to the controls and Lea slipped out of her suit and went into the lavatory to comb her hair Brion closed his mouth aware suddenly it had been open for a long time Is that what you call applied psychology he asked Not really She was going to go along with the job in the end since she did sign the contract even if she didn t read the fine print but not until she had exhausted her feelings I just shortened the process by switching her onto the male superiority hate Most women who succeed in normally masculine fields have a reflexive antipathy there they have been hit on the head with it so much He fed the course tape into the console and scowled But there was a good chunk of truth in what I said I wanted a young fit and highly qualified biologist from recruiting I never thought they would find a female one and it s too late to send her back now Dis is no place for a woman Why Brion asked as Lea appeared in the doorway Come inside and I ll show you both Ihjel said V Dis Ihjel said consulting a thick file third planet out from its primary Epsilon Eridani The fourth planet is Nyjord remember that because it is going to be very important Dis is a place you need a good reason to visit and no reason at all to leave Too hot too dry the temperature in the temperate zones rarely drops below a hundred Fahrenheit The planet is nothing but scorched rock and burning sand Most of the water is underground and normally inaccessible The surface water is all in the form of briny chemically saturated swamps undrinkable without extensive processing All the facts and figures are here in the folder and you can study them later Right now I want you just to get the idea that this planet is as loathsome and inhospitable as they come 
2194_141235_000004_000009	train-clean-360	So are the people 
none	none	This is a solido of a Disan Lea gasped at the three dimensional representation on the screen Not at the physical aspects of the man as a biologist trained in the specialty of alien life she had seen a lot stranger sights It was the man s pose the expression on his face tensed to leap his lips drawn back to show all of this teeth
2194_141235_000006_000000	train-clean-360	 He looks as if he wanted to kill the photographer she said 
2194_141235_000007_000000	train-clean-360	 He almost did just after the picture was taken 
none	none	Like all Disans he has an overwhelming hatred and loathing of offworlders 
2194_141235_000007_000002	train-clean-360	Not without good reason though 
none	none	His planet was settled completely by chance during the Breakdown I m not sure of the details but the overall picture is clear since the story of their desertion forms the basis of all the myths and animistic religions on Dis
2194_141235_000008_000000	train-clean-360	 Apparently there were large scale mining operations carried on there once the world is rich enough in minerals and mining them is very simple 
2194_141235_000008_000001	train-clean-360	But water came only from expensive extraction processes and I imagine most of the food came from offworld 
none	none	Which was good enough until the settlement was forgotten the way a lot of other planets were during the Breakdown All the records were destroyed in the fighting and the ore carriers were pressed into military service 
2194_141235_000008_000004	train-clean-360	Dis was on its own 
2194_141235_000008_000005	train-clean-360	What happened to the people there is a tribute to the adaptation possibilities of homo sapiens Individuals died usually in enormous pain but the race lived Changed a good deal but still human 
none	none	As the water and food ran out and the extraction machinery broke down they must have made heroic efforts to survive 
2194_141235_000008_000007	train-clean-360	They couldn t do it mechanically but by the time the last machine collapsed enough people were adjusted to the environment to keep the race going 
2194_141235_000009_000000	train-clean-360	 Their descendants are still there completely adapted to the environment 
none	none	Their body temperatures are around a hundred and thirty degrees They have specialized tissue in the gluteal area for storing water These are minor changes compared to the major ones they have done in fitting themselves for this planet 
2194_141235_000009_000004	train-clean-360	I don t know the exact details but the reports are very enthusiastic about symbiotic relationships 
none	none	They assure us that this is the first time homo sapiens has been an active part of either commensalism or inquilinism other than in the role of host
2194_141235_000010_000000	train-clean-360	 Wonderful Lea exclaimed 
none	none	Is it Ihjel scowled
2194_141235_000011_000001	train-clean-360	 Perhaps from the abstract scientific point of view 
2194_141235_000011_000002	train-clean-360	If you can keep notes perhaps you might write a book about it some time 
2194_141235_000011_000003	train-clean-360	But I m not interested 
none	none	I m sure all these morphological changes and disgusting intimacies will fascinate you doctor Morees But while you are counting blood types and admiring your thermometers I hope you will be able to devote a little time to a study of the Disans obnoxious personalities 
2194_141235_000011_000006	train-clean-360	We must either find out what makes these people tick or we are going to have to stand by and watch the whole lot blown up 
2194_141235_000012_000000	train-clean-360	 Going to do what Lea gasped 
2194_141235_000012_000001	train-clean-360	 Destroy them 
2194_141235_000012_000002	train-clean-360	Wipe out this fascinating genetic pool 
none	none	Why Because they are so incredibly loathsome that s why Ihjel said These aboriginal hotheads have managed to lay their hands on some primitive cobalt bombs 
2194_141235_000013_000001	train-clean-360	They want to light the fuse and drop these bombs on Nyjord the next planet 
2194_141235_000013_000002	train-clean-360	Nothing said or done can convince them differently 
2194_141235_000013_000003	train-clean-360	They demand unconditional surrender or else 
none	none	This is impossible for a lot of reasons most important because the Nyjorders would like to keep their planet for their very own 
2194_141235_000013_000005	train-clean-360	They have tried every kind of compromise but none of them works 
2194_141235_000013_000006	train-clean-360	The Disans are out to commit racial suicide 
none	none	A Nyjord fleet is now over Dis and the deadline has almost expired for the surrender of the cobalt bombs The Nyjord ships carry enough H bombs to turn the entire planet into an atomic pile 
2194_141235_000013_000009	train-clean-360	That is what we must stop 
none	none	Brion looked at the solido on the screen trying to make some judgment of the man 
2194_141235_000014_000001	train-clean-360	Bare horny feet 
2194_141235_000014_000002	train-clean-360	A bulky ragged length of cloth around the waist was the only garment 
2194_141235_000014_000003	train-clean-360	What looked like a piece of green vine was hooked over one shoulder 
2194_141235_000014_000004	train-clean-360	From a plaited belt were suspended a number of odd devices made of hand beaten metal drilled stone and looped leather 
none	none	The only recognizable item was a thin knife of unusual design Loops of piping flared bells carved stones tied in senseless patterns of thonging gave the rest of the collection a bizarre appearance Perhaps they had some religious significance But the well worn and handled look of most of them gave Brion an uneasy sensation If they were used what in the universe could they be used for I can t believe it he finally concluded Except for the exotic hardware this lowbrow looks as if he has sunk back into the Stone Age 
2194_141235_000015_000002	train-clean-360	I don t see how his kind can be any real threat to another planet 
none	none	The Nyjorders believe it and that s good enough for me Ihjel said
2194_141235_000016_000001	train-clean-360	 They are paying our Cultural Relationships Foundation a good sum to try and prevent this war 
none	none	Since they are our employers we must do what they ask Brion ignored this large lie since it was obviously designed as an explanation for Lea But he made a mental note to query Ihjel later about the real situation Here are the tech reports Ihjel dropped them on the table
2194_141235_000017_000001	train-clean-360	 Dis has some spacers as well as the cobalt bombs though these aren t the real threat 
none	none	A tramp trader was picked up leaving Dis It had delivered a jump space launcher that can drop those bombs on Nyjord while anchored to the bedrock of Dis 
2194_141235_000017_000004	train-clean-360	While essentially a peaceful and happy people the Nyjorders were justifiably annoyed at this and convinced the tramp s captain to give them some more information It s all here 
none	none	Boiled down it gives a minimum deadline by which time the launcher can be set up and start throwing bombs
2194_141235_000018_000000	train-clean-360	 When is that deadline Lea asked 
2194_141235_000019_000000	train-clean-360	 In ten more days 
none	none	If the situation hasn t been changed drastically by then the Nyjorders are going to wipe all life from the face of Dis I assure you they don t want to do it 
2194_141235_000019_000003	train-clean-360	But they will drop the bombs in order to assure their own survival 
2194_141235_000020_000000	train-clean-360	 What am I supposed to do Lea asked flipping the pages of the report 
none	none	I don t know a thing about nucleonics or jump space 
2194_141235_000020_000002	train-clean-360	I m an exobiologist with a supplementary degree in anthropology 
none	none	What help could I possibly be Ihjel looked down at her stroking his jaw fingers sunk deep into the rolls of flesh
2194_141235_000021_000001	train-clean-360	 My faith in our recruiters is restored he said 
none	none	That s a combination that is probably rare even on Earth You re as scrawny as an underfed chicken but young enough to survive if we keep a close eye on you He cut off Lea s angry protest with a raised hand
2194_141235_000021_000003	train-clean-360	 No more bickering 
none	none	There isn t time The Nyjorders must have lost over thirty agents trying to find the bombs 
2194_141235_000021_000005	train-clean-360	Our foundation has had six people killed including my late predecessor in charge of the project 
2194_141235_000021_000006	train-clean-360	He was a good man but I think he went at this problem the wrong way 
2194_141235_000021_000007	train-clean-360	I think it is a cultural one not a physical one 
2194_141235_000022_000000	train-clean-360	 Run it through again with the power turned up Lea said frowning All I hear is static 
none	none	It s the old problem of genesis 
2194_141235_000023_000001	train-clean-360	Like Newton and the falling apple Levy and the hysteresis in the warp field 
2194_141235_000023_000002	train-clean-360	Everything has a beginning 
2194_141235_000023_000003	train-clean-360	If we can find out why these people are so hell bent on suicide we might be able to change the reasons 
2194_141235_000023_000004	train-clean-360	Not that I intend to stop looking for the bombs or the jump space generator either We are going to try anything that will avert this planetary murder 
none	none	You re a lot brighter than you look Lea said rising and carefully stacking the sheets of the report
2194_141235_000024_000001	train-clean-360	 You can count on me for complete cooperation 
none	none	Now I ll study all this in bed if one of you overweight gentlemen will show me to a room with a strong lock on the inside of the door 
2194_141235_000024_000003	train-clean-360	Don t call me I ll call you when I want breakfast 
none	none	Brion wasn t sure how much of her barbed speech was humor and how much was serious so he said nothing He showed her to an empty cabin she did lock the door then looked for Ihjel The Winner was in the galley adding to his girth with an immense gelatin dessert that filled a good sized tureen Is she short for a native Terran Brion asked
2194_141235_000026_000001	train-clean-360	 The top of her head is below my chin 
2194_141235_000027_000000	train-clean-360	 That s the norm 
2194_141235_000027_000001	train-clean-360	Earth is a reservoir of tired genes 
2194_141235_000027_000002	train-clean-360	Weak backs vermiform appendixes bad eyes 
2194_141235_000027_000003	train-clean-360	If they didn t have the universities and the trained people we need I would never use them 
2194_141235_000028_000000	train-clean-360	 Why did you lie to her about the Foundation 
none	none	Because it s a secret isn t that reason enough Ihjel rumbled angrily scraping the last dregs from the bowl
2194_141235_000029_000001	train-clean-360	 Better eat something 
2194_141235_000029_000002	train-clean-360	Build up the strength 
none	none	The Foundation has to maintain its undercover status if it is going to accomplish anything If she returns to Earth after this it s better that she should know nothing of our real work 
2194_141235_000029_000005	train-clean-360	If she joins up there ll be time enough to tell her 
2194_141235_000029_000006	train-clean-360	But I doubt if she will like the way we operate 
2194_141235_000029_000007	train-clean-360	Particularly since I plan to drop some H bombs on Dis myself if we can t turn off the war 
2194_141235_000030_000000	train-clean-360	 I don t believe it 
2194_141235_000031_000000	train-clean-360	 You heard me correctly 
2194_141235_000031_000001	train-clean-360	Don t bulge your eyes and look moronic As a last resort I ll drop the bombs myself rather than let the Nyjorders do it 
2194_141235_000031_000002	train-clean-360	That might save them 
2194_141235_000032_000000	train-clean-360	 Save them they d all be radiated and dead Brion s voice rose in anger 
2194_141235_000033_000000	train-clean-360	 Not the Disans 
2194_141235_000033_000001	train-clean-360	I want to save the Nyjorders 
none	none	Stop clenching your fists and sit down and have some of this cake 
2194_141235_000033_000003	train-clean-360	It s delicious

none	none	Get it all pat before we land VI Identify yourself please The quiet words from the speaker in no way appeared to coincide with the picture on the screen The spacer that had matched their orbit over Dis had recently been a freighter A quick conversion had tacked the hulking shape of a primary weapons turret on top of her hull The black disc of the immense muzzle pointed squarely at them Ihjel switched open the ship to ship communication channel This is Ihjel Retinal pattern four hundred ninety BJfour sixty seven which is also the code that is supposed to get me through your blockade Do you want to check that pattern There will be no need thank you If you will turn on your recorder I have a message relayed to you from Prime four Recording and out Ihjel said Damn Trouble already and four days to blowup Prime four is our headquarters on Dis This ship carries a cover cargo so we can land at the spaceport This is probably a change of plan and I don t like the smell of it There was something behind Ihjel s grumbling this time and without conscious effort Brion could sense the chilling touch of the other man s angst Trouble was waiting for them on the planet below When the message was typed by the decoder Ihjel hovered over it reading each word as it appeared on the paper When it was finished he only snorted and went below to the galley Brion pulled the message out of the machine and read it IHJEL IHJEL IHJEL SPACEPORT LANDING DANGER NIGHT LANDING PREFERABLE COORDINATES MAP forty six Jninety two MNseventy five REMOTE YOUR SHIP VION WILL MEET END END END Dropping into the darkness was safe enough It was done on instruments and the Disans were thought to have no detection apparatus The altimeter dials spun backwards to zero and a soft vibration was the only indication they had landed All of the cabin lights were off except for the fluorescent glow of the instruments A white speckled grey filled the infra red screen radiation from the still warm sand and stone There were no moving blips on it not the characteristic shape of a shielded atomic generator We re here first Ihjel said opaqueing the ports and turning on the cabin lights They blinked at each other faces damp with perspiration Must you have the ship this hot Lea asked patting her forehead with an already sodden kerchief Stripped of her heavier clothing she looked even tinier to Brion But the thin cloth tunic reaching barely halfway to her knees concealed very little Small she may have appeared to him unfeminine she was not Her breasts were full and high her waist tiny enough to offset the outward curve of her hips Shall I turn around so you can stare at the back too she asked Brion Five days experience had taught him that this type of remark was best ignored It only became worse if he tried to make an intelligent answer Dis is hotter than this cabin he said changing the subject By raising the interior temperature we can at least prevent any sudden shock when we go out I know the theory but it doesn t stop me from sweating she said curtly Best thing you can do is sweat Ihjel said He looked like a glistening captive balloon in shorts Finishing a bottle of beer he took another from the freezer Have a beer No thank you I m afraid it would dissolve the last shreds of tissue and my kidneys would float completely away On Earth we never Get Professor Morees luggage for her Ihjel interrupted Vion s coming there s his signal I m sending this ship up before any of the locals spot it When he cracked the outer port the puff of air struck them like the exhaust from a furnace dry and hot as a tongue of flame Brion heard Lea s gasp in the darkness She stumbled down the ramp and he followed her slowly careful of the weight of packs and equipment he carried The sand still hot from the day burned through his boots Ihjel came last the remote control unit in his hand As soon as they were clear he activated it and the ramp slipped back like a giant tongue As soon as the lock had swung shut the ship lifted and drifted upwards silently towards its orbit a shrinking darkness against the stars There was just enough starlight to see the sandy wastes around them as wave filled as a petrified sea The dark shape of a sand car drew up over a dune and hummed to a stop When the door opened Ihjel stepped towards it and everything happened at once Ihjel broke into a blue nimbus of crackling flame his skin blackening charred He was dead in an instant A second pillar of flame bloomed next to the car and a choking scream was cut off at the moment it began Ihjel died silently Brion was diving even as the electrical discharges still crackled in the air The boxes and packs dropped from him and he slammed against Lea knocking her to the ground He hoped she had the sense to stay there and be quiet This was his only conscious thought the rest was reflex He was rolling over and over as fast as he could The spitting electrical flames flared again playing over the bundles of luggage he had dropped This time Brion was expecting it pressed flat on the ground a short distance away He was facing the darkness away from the sand car and saw the brief blue glow of the ion rifle discharge His own gun was in his hand When Ihjel had given him the missile weapon he had asked no questions but had just strapped it on There had been no thought that he would need it this quickly Holding it firmly before him in both hands he let his body aim at the spot where the glow had been A whiplash of explosive slugs ripped the night air They found their target and something thrashed voicelessly and died In the brief instant after he fired a jarring weight landed on his back and a line of fire circled his throat Normally he fought with a calm mind with no thoughts other than of the contest But Ihjel a friend a man of Anvhar had died a few seconds before and Brion found himself welcoming this physical violence and pain There are many foolish and dangerous things that can be done such as smoking next to high octane fuel and putting fingers into electrical sockets Just as dangerous and equally deadly is physically attacking a Winner of the Twenties Two men hit Brion together though this made very little difference The first died suddenly as hands like steel claws found his neck and in a single spasmodic contraction did such damage to the large blood vessels there that they burst and tiny hemorrhages filled his brain The second man had time for a single scream though he died just as swiftly when those hands closed on his larynx Running in a crouch partially on his knuckles Brion swiftly made a circle of the area gun ready There were no others Only when he touched the softness of Lea s body did the blood anger seep from him He was suddenly aware of the pain and fatigue the sweat soaking his body and the breath rasping in his throat Holstering the gun he ran light fingers over her skull finding a bruised spot on one temple Her chest was rising and falling regularly She had struck her head when he pushed her It had undoubtedly saved her life Sitting down suddenly he let his body relax breathing deeply Everything was a little better now except for the pain at his throat His fingers found a thin strand on the side of his neck with a knobby weight on the end There was another weight on his other shoulder and a thin line of pain across his neck When he pulled on them both the strangler s cord came away in his hand It was thin fiber strong as a wire When it had been pulled around his neck it had sliced the surface skin and flesh like a knife halted only by the corded bands of muscle below Brion threw it from him into the darkness where it had come from He could think again and he carefully kept his thoughts from the men he had killed Knowing it was useless he went to Ihjel s body A single touch of the scorched flesh was enough Behind him Lea moaned with returning consciousness and he hurried on to the sand car stepping over the charred body outside the door The driver slumped dead killed perhaps by the same strangling cord that had sunk into Brion s throat He laid the man gently on the sand and closed the lids over the staring horror of the eyes There was a canteen in the car and he brought it back to Lea My head I ve hurt my head she said groggily Just a bruise he reassured her Drink some of this water and you ll soon feel better Lie back Everything s over for the moment and you can rest Ihjel s dead Lea said with sudden shocked memory They ve killed him What s happened she tensed tried to rise and he pressed her back gently I ll tell you everything Just don t try to get up yet There was an ambush and they killed Vion and the driver of the sand car as well as Ihjel Three men did it and they re all dead now too I don t think there are any more around but if there are I ll hear them coming We re just going to wait a few minutes until you feel better then we re getting out of here in the car Bring the ship down There was a thin note of hysteria in her voice We can t stay here alone We don t know where to go or what to do With Ihjel dead the whole thing s spoiled We have to get out There are some things that can t sound gentle no matter how gently they are said This was one of them I m sorry Lea but the ship is out of our reach right now Ihjel was killed with an ion gun and it fused the control unit into a solid lump We must take the car and get to the city We ll do it now See if you can stand up I ll help you She rose not saying anything and as they walked towards the car a single reddish moon cleared the hills behind them In its light Brion saw a dark line bisecting the rear panel of the sand car He stopped abruptly What s the matter Lea asked The unlocked engine cover could have only one significance and he pushed it open knowing in advance what he would see The attackers had been very thorough and fast In the short time available to them they had killed the driver and the car as well Ruddy light shone on torn wires ripped out connections Repair would be impossible I think we ll have to walk he told her trying to keep the gloom out of his voice This spot is roughly a hundred and fifty kilometres from the city of Hovedstad where we have to go We should be able to We re going to die We can t walk anywhere This whole planet is a death trap Let s get back in the ship The shrillness of hysteria was at the edge of her voice as well as a subtle slurring of sounds Brion didn t try to reason with her or bother to explain She had a concussion from the blow that much was obvious He had her sit and rest while he made what preparations he could for the long walk Clothing first With each passing minute the desert air was growing colder as the day s heat ebbed away Lea was beginning to shiver and he took some heavier clothing from her charred bag and made her pull it on over her light tunic There was little else that was worth carrying the canteen from the car and a first aid kit he found in one of the compartments There were no maps and no radio Navigation was obviously done by compass on this almost featureless desert The car was equipped with an electrically operated gyrocompass of no use to him now But he did use it to check the direction of Hovedstad as he remembered it from the map and found it lined up perfectly with the tracks the car had cut into the sand It had come directly from the city They could find their way by back tracking Time was slipping away He would have liked to bury Ihjel and the men from the car but the night hours were too valuable to be wasted The best he could do was put the three corpses in the car for protection from the Disan animals He locked the door and threw the key as far as he could into the blackness Lea had slipped into a restless sleep and he carefully shook her awake Come Brion said We have a little walking to do VII With the cool air and firmly packed sand under foot walking should have been easy Lea spoiled that The concussion seemed to have temporarily cut off the reasoning part of her brain leaving a direct connection to her vocal cords As she stumbled along only half conscious she mumbled all of her darkest fears that were better left unvoiced Occasionally there was relevancy in her complaints They would lose their way never find the city die of thirst freezing heat or hunger Interspersed and entwined with these were fears from her past that still floated submerged in the timeless ocean of her subconscious Some Brion could understand though he tried not to listen Fears of losing credits not getting the highest grade falling behind a woman alone in a world of men leaving school being lost trampled among the nameless hordes that struggled for survival in the crowded city states of Earth There were other things she was afraid of that made no sense to a man of Anvhar Who were the alkians that seemed to trouble her Or what was canceri Daydle and haydle Who was Manstan whose name kept coming up over and over each time accompanied by a little moan Brion stopped and picked her up in both arms With a sigh she settled against the hard width of his chest and was instantly asleep Even with the additional weight he made better time now and he stretched to his fastest kilometre consuming stride to make good use of these best hours Somewhere on a stretch of gravel and shelving rock he lost the track of the sand car He wasted no time looking for it By carefully watching the glistening stars rise and set he had made a good estimate of the geographic north Dis didn t seem to have a pole star however a boxlike constellation turned slowly around the invisible point of the pole Keeping this positioned in line with his right shoulder guided him on the westerly course he needed When his arms began to grow tired he lowered Lea gently to the ground she didn t wake Stretching for an instant before taking up his burden again Brion was struck by the terrible loneliness of the desert His breath made a vanishing mist against the stars all else was darkness and silence How distant he was from his home his people his planet Even the constellations of the night sky were different He was used to solitude but this was a loneliness that touched some deep buried instinct A shiver that wasn t from the desert cold touched lightly along his spine prickling at the hairs on his neck It was time to go on He shrugged the disquieting sensations off and carefully tied Lea into the jacket he had been wearing Slung like a pack on his back it made the walking easier The gravel gave way to sliding dunes of sand that seemed to continue to infinity It was a painful slipping climb to the top of each one then an equally difficult descent to the black pooled hollow at the foot of the next With the first lightening of the sky in the east he stopped breath rasping in his chest to mark his direction before the stars faded One line scratched in the sand pointed due north a second pointed out the course they should follow When they were aligned to his satisfaction he washed his mouth out with a single swallow of water and sat on the sand next to the still form of the girl Gold fingers of fire searched across the sky wiping out the stars It was magnificent Brion forgot his fatigue in appreciation There should be some way of preserving it A quatrain would be best Short enough to be remembered yet requiring attention and skill to compact everything into it He had scored high with his quatrains in the Twenties This would be a special one Taind his poetry mentor would have to get a copy What are you mumbling about Lea asked looking up at the craggy blackness of his profile against the reddening sky Poem he said Shhh Just a minute It was too much for Lea coming after the tension and dangers of the night She began to laugh laughing even harder when he scowled at her Only when she heard the tinge of growing hysteria did she make an attempt to break off the laughter The sun cleared the horizon washing a sudden warmth over them Lea gasped Your throat s been cut You re bleeding to death Not really he said touching his fingertips lightly against the blood clotted wound that circled his neck Just superficial Depression sat on him as he suddenly remembered the battle and death of the previous night Lea didn t notice his face she was busy digging in the pack he had thrown down He had to use his fingers to massage and force away the grimace of pain that twisted his mouth Memory was more painful than the wound How easily he had killed Three men How close to the surface of the civilized man the animal dwelled In countless matches he had used those holds always drawing back from the exertion of the full killing power They were part of a game part of the Twenties Yet when his friend had been killed he had become a killer himself He believed in nonviolence and the sanctity of life until the first test when he had killed without hesitation More ironic was the fact he really felt no guilt even now Shock at the change yes But no more than that Lift your chin Lea said brandishing the antiseptic applicator she had found in the medicine kit He lifted his chin obligingly and the liquid drew a cool burning line across his neck Antibio pills would do a lot more good since the wound was completely clotted by now but he didn t speak his thoughts aloud For the moment Lea had forgotten herself in taking care of him He put some of the antiseptic on her scalp bruise and she squeaked pulling back They both swallowed the pills That sun is hot already Lea said peeling off her heavy clothing Let s find a nice cool cave or an air cooled saloon to crawl into for the day I don t think there are any here Just sand We have to walk I know we have to walk she interrupted There s no need for a lecture about it You re as seriously cubical as the Bank of Terra Relax Count ten and start again Lea was making empty talk while she listened to the memory of hysteria tittering at the fringes of her brain No time for that We have to keep going Brion climbed slowly to his feet after stowing everything in the pack When he sighted along his marker at the western horizon he saw nothing to mark their course only the marching dunes He helped Lea to her feet and began walking slowly towards them Just hold on a second Lea called after him Where do you think you re going In that direction he said pointing I hoped there would be some landmarks but there aren t We ll have to keep on by dead reckoning The sun will keep us pretty well on course If we aren t there by night the stars will be a better guide All this on an empty stomach How about breakfast I m hungry and thirsty No food He shook the canteen that gurgled emptily It had been only partly filled when he found it The water s low and we ll need it later I need it now she said shortly My mouth tastes like an unemptied ashtray and I m dry as paper Just a single swallow he said after the briefest hesitation This is all we have Lea sipped at it with her eyes closed in appreciation Then he sealed the top and returned it to the pack without taking any himself They were sweating as they started up the first dune The desert was barren of life they were the only things moving under that merciless sun Their shadows pointed the way ahead of them and as the shadows shortened the heat rose It had an intensity Lea had never experienced before a physical weight that pushed at her with a searing hand Her clothing was sodden with perspiration and it trickled burning into her eyes The light and heat made it hard to see and she leaned on the immovable strength of Brion s arm He walked on steadily apparently ignoring the heat and discomfort I wonder if those things are edible or store water Brion s voice was a harsh rasp Lea blinked and squinted at the leathery shape on the summit of the dune Plant or animal it was hard to tell It was the size of a man s head wrinkled and grey as dried out leather knobbed with thick spikes Brion pushed it up with his toe and they had a brief glimpse of a white roundness like a shiny taproot going down into the dune Then the thing contracted pulling itself lower into the sand At the same instant something thin and sharp lashed out through a fold in the skin striking at Brion s boot and withdrawing There was a scratch on the hard plastic beaded with drops of green liquid Probably poison he said digging his toe into the sand This thing is too mean to fool with without a good reason Let s keep going It was before noon when Lea fell down She really wanted to go on but her body wouldn t obey The thin soles of her shoes were no protection against the burning sand and her feet were lumps of raw pain Heat hammered down poured up from the sand and swirled her in an oven of pain The air she gasped in was molten metal that dried and cracked her mouth Each pulse of her heart throbbed blood to the wound in her scalp until it seemed her skull would burst with the agony She had stripped down to the short tunic in spite of Brion s insistence that she keep her body protected from the sun and that clung to her soaked with sweat She tore at it in a desperate effort to breathe There was no escape from the unending heat Though the baked sand burned torture into her knees and hands she couldn t rise It took all her strength not to fall further Her eyes closed and everything swirled in immense circles Brion blinking through slitted eyes saw her go down He lifted her and carried her again as he had the night before The hot touch of her body shocked his bare arms Her skin was flushed pink The tunic was torn open and one pointed breast rose and fell unevenly with the irregularity of her breathing Wiping his palm free of sweat and sand he touched her skin and felt the ominous hot dryness Heat shock all the symptoms Dry flushed skin the ragged breathing Her temperature rising quickly as her body stopped fighting the heat and succumbed There was nothing he could do here to protect her from the heat He measured a tiny portion of the remaining water into her mouth and she swallowed convulsively Her thin clothing was little protection from the sun He could only take her in his arms and keep on towards the horizon An outcropping of rock threw a tiny patch of shade and he walked towards it The ground here shielded from the direct rays of the sun felt almost cool by contrast Lea opened her eyes when he put her down peering up at him through a haze of pain She wanted to apologize to him for her weakness but no words came from the dried membrane of her throat His body above her seemed to swim back and forth in the heat waves swaying like a tree in a high wind Shock drove her eyes open cleared her mind for an instant He really was swaying Suddenly she realized how much she had come to depend on the unending solidity of his strength and now it was failing All over his body the corded muscles contracted in ridges striving to keep him erect She saw his mouth pulled open by the taut cords of his neck and the gaping silent scream was more terrible than any sound Then she herself screamed as his eyes rolled back leaving only the empty white of the eyeballs staring terribly at her He went over back down like a felled tree thudding heavily on the sand Unconscious or dead she couldn t tell She pulled limply at his leg but couldn t drag his immense weight into the shade Brion lay on his back in the sun sweating Lea saw this and knew that he was still alive Yet what was happening She groped for memory in the red haze of her mind but could remember nothing from her medical studies that would explain this On every square inch of his body the sweat glands seethed with sudden activity From every pore oozed great globules of oily liquid far thicker than normal perspiration Brion s arms rippled with motion and Lea gaped horrified as the hairs there writhed and stirred as though endowed with separate life His chest rose and fell rapidly deep gasping breaths racking his body Lea could only stare through the dim redness of unreality and wonder if she was going mad before she died A coughing fit broke the rhythm of his rasping breath and when it was over his breathing was easier The perspiration still covered his body the individual beads touching and forming tiny streams that trickled down his body and vanished in the sand He stirred and rolled onto his side facing her His eyes were open and normal now as he smiled Didn t mean to frighten you It caught me suddenly coming at the wrong season and everything It was a bit of a jar to my system I ll get you some water now there s still a bit left What happened When you looked like that when you fell Take two swallows no more he said holding the open canteen to her mouth Just summer change that s all It happens to us every year on Anvhar only not that violently of course In the winter our bodies store a layer of fat under the skin for insulation and sweating almost ceases completely There are a lot of internal changes too When the weather warms up the process is reversed The fat is metabolized and the sweat glands enlarge and begin working overtime as the body prepares for two months of hard work heat and little sleep I guess the heat here triggered off the summer change early You mean you ve adapted to this terrible planet Just about Though it does feel a little warm I ll need a lot more water soon so we can t remain here Do you think you can stand the sun if I carry you No but I won t feel any better staying here She was light headed scarcely aware of what she said Keep going I guess Keep going As soon as she was out of the shadow of the rock the sunlight burst over her again in a wave of hot pain She fell unconscious at once Brion picked her up and staggered forward After a few yards he began to feel the pull of the sand He knew he was reaching the end of his strength He went more slowly and each dune seemed a bit higher than the one before Giant sand scoured rocks pushed through the dunes here and he had to stumble around them At the base of the largest of these monoliths was a straggling clump of knotted vegetation He passed it by then stopped as something tried to penetrate his heat crazed mind What was it A difference Something about these plants that he hadn t noticed in any of the others he had passed during the day It was almost like defeat to turn and push his clumsy feet backwards in his own footprints to stand blinking helplessly at the plants Yet they were important Some of them had been cut off close to the sand Not broken by any natural cause but cut sharply and squarely by a knife or blade of some sort The cut plants were long dried and dead but a tiny hope flared up in him This was the first sign that other people were actually alive on this heat blasted planet And whatever the plants had been cut for they might be of aid to him Food perhaps drink His hands trembled at the thought as he dropped Lea heavily into the shade of the rock She didn t stir His knife was sharp but most of the strength was gone from his hands Breath rasping in his dried throat he sawed at the tough stem finally cutting it through Raising up the shrub he saw a thick liquid dripping from the severed end He braced his hand against his leg so it wouldn t shake and spill until his cupped palm was full of sap It was wet even a little cool as it evaporated Surely it was mostly life giving water He had a moment s misgiving as he raised it to his lips and instead of drinking it merely touched it with the tip of his tongue At first nothing then a searing pain It stabbed deep into his throat and choked him His stomach heaved and he vomited bitter bile On his knees fighting the waves of pain he lost body fluid he vitally needed Despair was worse than the pain The plant juice must have some use there must be a way of purifying it or neutralizing it But Brion a stranger on this planet would be dead long before he found out how to do this Weakened by the cramps that still tore at him he tried not to realize how close to the end he was Getting the girl on his back seemed an impossible task and for an instant he was tempted to leave her there Yet even as he considered this he shouldered her leaden weight and once more went on Each footstep an effort he followed his own track up the dune Painfully he forced his way to the top and looked at the Disan standing a few feet away They were both too surprised by the sudden encounter to react at once For a breath of time they stared at each other unmoving When they reacted it was the same defense of fear Brion dropped the girl bringing the gun up from the holster in the return of the same motion The Disan jerked a belled tube from his waistband and raised it to his mouth Brion didn t fire A dead man had taught him how to train his empathetic sense and to trust it In spite of the fear that wanted him to jerk the trigger a different sense read the unvoiced emotions of the native Disan There was fear there and hatred Welling up around these was a strong desire not to commit violence this time to communicate instead Brion felt and recognized all this in a fraction of a second He had to act instantly to avoid a tragic happening A jerk of his wrist threw the gun to one side As soon as it was gone he regretted its loss He was gambling their lives on an ability he still was not sure of The Disan had the tube to his mouth when the gun hit the ground He held the pose unmoving thinking Then he accepted Brion s action and thrust the tube back into his waistband Do you have any water Brion asked the guttural Disan words hurting his throat I have water the man said He still didn t move Who are you What are you doing here We re from offplanet We had an accident We want to go to the city The water The Disan looked at the unconscious girl and made his decision Over one shoulder he wore one of the green objects that Brion remembered from the solido He pulled it off and the thing writhed slowly in his hands It was alive a green length a metre long like a noduled section of a thick vine One end flared out into a petal like formation The Disan took a hook shaped object from his waist and thrust it into the petaled orifice When he turned the hook in a quick motion the length of green writhed and curled around his arm He pulled something small and dark out and threw it to the ground extending the twisting green shape towards Brion Put your mouth to the end and drink he said Lea needed the water more but he drank first suspicious of the living water source A hollow below the writhing petals was filling with straw colored water from the fibrous reedy interior He raised it to his mouth and drank The water was hot and tasted swampy Sudden sharp pains around his mouth made him jerk the thing away Tiny glistening white barbs projected from the petals pink tipped now with his blood Brion swung towards the Disan angrily and stopped when he looked at the other man s face His mouth was surrounded by many small white scars The vaede does not like to give up its water but it always does the man said Brion drank again then put the vaede to Lea s mouth She moaned without regaining consciousness her lips seeking reflexively for the life saving liquid When she was satisfied Brion gently drew the barbs from her flesh and drank again The Disan hunkered down on his heels and watched them expressionlessly Brion handed back the vaede then held some of the clothes so that Lea was in their shade He settled to the same position as the native and looked closely at him Squatting immobile on his heels the Disan appeared perfectly comfortable under the flaming sun There was no trace of perspiration on his naked browned skin Long hair fell to his shoulders and startlingly blue eyes stared back at Brion from deepset sockets The heavy kilt around his loins was the only garment he wore Once more the vaede rested over his shoulder still stirring unhappily Around his waist was the same collection of leather stone and brass objects that had been in the solido Two of them now had meaning to Brion the tube and mouthpiece a blowgun of some kind and the specially shaped hook for opening the vaede He wondered if the other strangely formed things had equally practical functions If you accepted them as artifacts with a purpose not barbaric decorations you had to accept their owner as something more than the crude savage he resembled My name is Brion And you You may not have my name Why are you here To kill my people Brion forced away the memory of last night Killing was just what he had done Some expectancy in the man s manner some sensed feeling of hope prompted Brion to speak the truth I m here to stop your people from being killed I believe in the end of the war Prove it Take me to the Cultural Relationships Foundations in the city and I ll prove it I can do nothing here in the desert Except die For the first time there was emotion on the Disan s face He frowned and muttered something to himself There was a fine beading of sweat above his eyebrows now as he fought an internal battle Coming to a decision he rose and Brion stood too Come with me I ll take you to Hovedstad But first you will tell me are you from Nyjord No The nameless Disan merely grunted and turned away Brion shouldered Lea s unconscious body and followed him They walked for two hours the Disan setting a cruel pace before they reached a wasteland of jumbled rock The native pointed to the highest tower of sand eroded stone Wait near this he said Someone will come for you He watched while Brion placed the girl s still body in the shade and passed over the vaede for the last time Just before leaving he turned back hesitating My name is Ulv he said Then he was gone Brion did what he could to make Lea comfortable but it was very little If she didn t get medical attention soon she would be dead Dehydration and shock were uniting to destroy her Just before sunset he heard clanking and the throbbing whine of a sand car s engine coming from the west VIII With each second the noise grew louder coming their way The tracks squeaked as the car turned around the rock spire obviously seeking them out A large carrier big as a truck it stopped before them in a cloud of its own dust and the driver kicked the door open Get in here and fast the man shouted You re letting in all the heat He gunned the engine ready to kick in the gears and looked at them irritatedly Ignoring the driver s nervous instructions Brion carefully placed Lea on the rear seat before he pulled the door shut The car surged forward instantly a blast of icy air pouring from the air cooling vents It wasn t cold in the vehicle but the temperature was at least forty degrees lower than the outer air Brion covered Lea with all their extra clothing to prevent any further shock to her system The driver hunched over the wheel and driving with an intense speed hadn t said a word to them since they had entered Brion looked up as another man stepped from the engine compartment in the rear of the car He was thin harried looking And he was pointing a gun Who are you he said without a trace of warmth in his voice It was a strange reception but Brion was beginning to realize that Dis was a strange planet The other man chewed at his lip nervously while Brion sat relaxed and unmoving He didn t want to startle him into pulling the trigger and he kept his voice pitched low as he answered My name is Brandd We landed from space two nights ago and have been walking in the desert ever since Now don t get excited and shoot the gun when I tell you this but both Vion and Ihjel are dead The man with the gun gasped his eyes widened The driver threw a single frightened look over his shoulder then turned quickly back to the wheel Brion s probe had hit its mark If these men weren t from the Cultural Relationships Foundation they at least knew a lot about it It seemed safe to assume they were C R F men When they were shot the girl and I escaped We were trying to reach the city and contact you You are from the Foundation aren t you Yes Of course the man said lowering the gun He stared glassy eyed into space for a moment nervously working his teeth against his lip Startled at his own inattention he raised the gun again If you re Brandd there s something I want to know Rummaging in his breast pocket with his free hand he brought out a yellow message form He moved his lips as he reread the message Now answer me if you can what are the last three events in the He took a quick look at the paper again in the Twenties Chess finals rifle prone position and fencing playoffs Why The man grunted and slid the pistol back into its holder satisfied I m Faussel he said and waved the message at Brion This is Ihjel s last will and testament relayed to us by the Nyjord blockade control He thought he was going to die and he sure was right Passed on his job to you You re in charge I was Mervv s second in command until he was poisoned I was supposed to work for Ihjel and now I guess I m yours At least until tomorrow when we ll have everything packed and get off this hell planet What do you mean tomorrow Brion asked It s three days to deadline and we still have a job to do Faussel had dropped heavily into one of the seats and he sprang to his feet again clutching the seat back to keep his balance in the swaying car Three days three weeks three minutes what difference does it make His voice rose shrilly with each word and he had to make a definite effort to master himself before he could go on Look You don t know anything about this You just arrived and that s your bad luck My bad luck is being assigned to this death trap and watching the depraved and filthy things the natives do And trying to be polite to them even when they are killing my friends and those Nyjord bombers up there with their hands on the triggers One of those bombardiers is going to start thinking about home and about the cobalt bombs down here and he s going to press that button deadline or no deadline Sit down Faussel Sit down and take a rest There was sympathy in Brion s voice but also the firmness of an order Faussel swayed for a second longer then collapsed He sat with his cheek against the window eyes closed A pulse throbbed visibly in his temple and his lips worked He had been under too much tension for too long a time This was the atmosphere that hung heavily in the air at the C R F building when they arrived Despair and defeat The doctor was the only one who didn t share this mood as he bustled Lea off to the clinic with prompt efficiency He obviously had enough patients to keep his mind occupied With the others the feeling of depression was unmistakable From the instant they had driven through the automatic garage door Brion had swum in this miasma of defeat It was omnipresent and hard to ignore As soon as he had eaten he went with Faussel into what was to have been Ihjel s office Through the transparent walls he could see the staff packing the records crating them for shipment Faussel seemed less nervous now that he was no longer in command Brion rejected any idea he had of letting the man know that he himself was only a novice in the foundation He was going to need all the authority he could muster since they would undoubtedly hate him for what he was going to do Better take notes of this Faussel and have it typed I ll sign it The printed word always carried more weight All preparations for leaving are to be stopped at once Records are to be returned to the files We are going to stay here just as long as we have clearance from the Nyjorders If this operation is unsuccessful we will all leave together when the time expires We will take whatever personal baggage we can carry by hand everything else stays here Perhaps you don t realize we are here to save a planet not file cabinets full of papers Out of the corner of his eye he saw Faussel flush with anger As soon as that is typed bring it back And all the reports as to what has been accomplished on this project That will be all for now Faussel stamped out and a minute later Brion saw the shocked angry looks from the workers in the outer office Turning his back to them he opened the drawers in the desk one after another The top drawer was empty except for a sealed envelope It was addressed to Winner Ihjel Brion looked at it thoughtfully then ripped it open The letter inside was handwritten Ihjel I ve had the official word that you are on the way to relieve me and I am forced to admit I feel only an intense satisfaction You ve had the experience on these outlaw planets and can get along with the odd types I have been specializing in research for the last twenty years and the only reason I was appointed planetary supervisor on Nyjord was because of the observation and application facilities I m the research type not the office type no one has ever denied that You re going to have trouble with the staff so you had better realize that they are all compulsory volunteers Half are clerical people from my staff The others a mixed bag of whoever was close enough to be pulled in on this crash assignment It developed so fast we never saw it coming And I m afraid we ve done little or nothing to stop it We can t get access to the natives here not in the slightest It s frightening They don t fit I ve done Poisson Distributions on a dozen different factors and none of them can be equated The Pareto Extrapolations don t work Our field men can t even talk to the natives and two have been killed trying The ruling class is unapproachable and the rest just keep their mouths shut and walk away I m going to take a chance and try to talk to Lig magte perhaps I can make him see sense I doubt if it will work and there is a chance he will try violence with me The nobility here are very prone to violence If I get back all right you won t see this note Otherwise good by Ihjel Try to do a better job than I did Aston Mervv P S There is a problem with the staff They are supposed to be saviors but without exception they all loathe the Disans I m afraid I do too Brion ticked off the relevant points in the letter He had to find some way of discovering what Pareto Extrapolations were without uncovering his own lack of knowledge The staff would vanish in five minutes if they knew how new he was at the job Poisson Distribution made more sense It was used in physics as the unchanging probability of an event that would be true at all times Such as the numbers of particles that would be given off by a lump of radioactive matter during a short period From the way Mervv used it in his letter it looked as if the societics people had found measurable applications in societies and groups At least on other planets None of the rules seemed to be working on Dis Ihjel had admitted that and Mervv s death had proven it Brion wondered who this Lig magte was who appeared to have killed Mervv A forged cough broke through Brion s concentration and he realized that Faussel had been standing in front of his desk for some minutes Brion looked up and mopped perspiration from his face Your air conditioner seems to be out of order Faussel said Should I have the mechanic look at it There s nothing wrong with the machine I m just adapting to Dis s climate What else do you want Faussel The assistant had a doubting look that he didn t succeed in hiding He also had trouble believing the literal truth He placed the small stack of file folders on the desk These are the reports to date everything we have uncovered about the Disans It s not very much but considering the anti social attitudes on this lousy world it is the best we could do A sudden thought hit him and his eyes narrowed slyly It can t be helped but some of the staff have been wondering out loud about that native that contacted us How did you get him to help you We ve never gotten to first base with these people and as soon as you land you have one working for you You can t stop people from thinking about it you being a newcomer and a stranger After all it looks a little odd He broke off in midsentence as Brion looked at him in cold fury I can t stop people from thinking about it but I can stop them from talking Our job is to contact the Disans and stop this suicidal war I have done more in one day than you all have done since you arrived I have accomplished this because I am better at my work than the rest of you That is all the information any of you are going to receive You are dismissed White with anger Faussel turned on his heel and stamped out to spread the word about what a slave driver the new director was They would then all hate him passionately which was just the way he wanted it He couldn t risk exposure as the tyro he was And perhaps a new emotion other than disgust and defeat might jar them into a little action They certainly couldn t do any worse than they had been doing It was a tremendous amount of responsibility For the first time since setting foot on this barbaric planet Brion had time to stop and think He was taking an awful lot upon himself He knew nothing about this world nor about the powers involved in the conflict Here he sat pretending to be in charge of an organization he had first heard about only a few weeks earlier It was a frightening situation Should he slide out from under There was just one possible answer and that was no Until he found someone else who could do better he seemed to be the one best suited for the job And Ihjel s opinion had to count for something Brion had felt the surety of the man s conviction that Brion was the only one who might possibly succeed in this difficult spot Let it go at that If he had any qualms it would be best to put them behind him Aside from everything else there was a primary bit of loyalty involved Ihjel had been an Anvharian and a Winner Maybe it was a provincial attitude to hold in this big universe Anvhar was certainly far enough away from here but honor is very important to a man who must stand alone He had a debt to Ihjel and he was going to pay it off Once the decision had been made he felt easier There was an intercom on the desk in front of him and he leaned with a heavy thumb on the button labeled Faussel Yes Even through the speaker the man s voice was cold with ill concealed hatred Who is Lig magte And did the former director ever return from seeing him Magte is a title that means roughly noble or lord Lig magte is the local overlord He has an ugly stoneheap of a building just outside the city He seems to be the mouthpiece for the group of magter that are pushing this idiotic war As to your second question I have to answer yes and no We found Director Mervv s head outside the door next morning with all the skin gone We knew who it was because the doctor identified the bridgework in his mouth Do you understand All pretense of control had vanished and Faussel almost shrieked the last words They were all close to cracking up if he was any example Brion broke in quickly That will be all Faussel Just get word to the doctor that I would like to see him as soon as I can He broke the connection and opened the first of the folders By the time the doctor called he had skimmed the reports and was reading the relevant ones in greater detail Putting on his warm coat he went through the outer office The few workers still on duty turned their backs in frigid silence Doctor Stine had a pink and shiny bald head that rose above a thick black beard Brion had liked him at once Anyone with enough firmness of mind to keep a beard in this climate was a pleasant exception after what he had met so far How s the new patient Doctor Stine combed his beard with stubby fingers before answering Diagnosis heat syncope Prognosis complete recovery Condition fair considering the dehydration and extensive sunburn I ve treated the burns and a saline drip is taking care of the other She just missed going into heat shock I have her under sedation now I d like to have her up and helping me tomorrow morning Could she do this with stimulants or drugs She could but I don t like it There might be side factors perhaps long standing debilitation It s a chance A chance we will have to take In less than seventy hours this planet is due for destruction In attempting to avert that tragedy I m expendable as is everyone else here Agreed The doctor grunted deep in his beard and looked Brion s immense frame up and down Agreed he said almost happily It is a distinct pleasure to see something beside black defeat around here I ll go along with you Well you can help me right now I checked the personnel roster and discovered that out of the twenty eight people working here there isn t a physical scientist of any kind other than yourself A scruffy bunch of button pushers and theoreticians Not worth a damn for field work the whole bunch of them The doctor toed the floor switch on a waste receptacle and spat into it with feeling Then I m going to depend on you for some straight answers Brion said This is an un standard operation and the standard techniques just don t begin to make sense Even Poisson Distributions and Pareto Extrapolations don t apply here Stine nodded agreement and Brion relaxed a bit He had just relieved himself of his entire knowledge of societics and it had sounded authentic The more I look at it the more I believe that this is a physical problem something to do with the exotic and massive adjustments the Disans have made to this hellish environment Could this tie up in any way with their absolutely suicidal attitude towards the cobalt bombs Could it Could it doctor Stine paced the floor rapidly on his stocky legs twining his fingers behind his back You are bloody well right it could Someone is thinking at last and not just punching bloody numbers into a machine and sitting and scratching his behind while waiting for the screen to light up with the answers Do you know how Disans exist Brion shook his head The fools here think it disgusting but I call it fascinating They have found ways to join a symbiotic relationship with the life forms on this planet Even a parasitic relationship You must realize that living organisms will do anything to survive Castaways at sea will drink their own urine in their need for water Disgust at this is only the attitude of the overprotected who have never experienced extreme thirst or hunger Well here on Dis you have a planet of castaways Stine opened the door of the pharmacy This talk of thirst makes me dry With economically efficient motions he poured grain alcohol into a beaker thinned it with distilled water and flavored it with some crystals from a bottle He filled two glasses and handed Brion one It didn t taste bad at all What do you mean by parasitic Doctor Aren t we all parasites of the lower life forms Meat animals vegetables and such No no you miss the point I speak of parasitic in the exact meaning of the word You must realize that to a biologist there is no real difference between parasitism symbiosis mutualism biontergasy commensalism Stop stop Brion said Those are just meaningless sounds to me If that is what makes this planet tick I m beginning to see why the rest of the staff has that lost feeling It is just a matter of degree of the same thing Look You have a kind of crustacean living in the lakes here very much like an ordinary crab It has large claws in which it holds anemones tentacled sea animals with no power of motion The crustacean waves these around to gather food and eats the pieces they capture that are too big for them This is biontergasy two creatures living and working together yet each capable of existing alone Now this same crustacean has a parasite living under its shell a degenerated form of a snail that has lost all powers of movement A true parasite that takes food from its host s body and gives nothing in return Inside this snail s gut there is a protozoan that lives off the snail s ingested food Yet this little organism is not a parasite as you might think at first but a symbiote It takes food from the snail but at the same time it secretes a chemical that aids the snail s digestion of the food Do you get the picture All these life forms exist in a complicated interdependence Brion frowned in concentration sipping at the drink It s making some kind of sense now Symbiosis parasitism and all the rest are just ways of describing variations of the same basic process of living together And there is probably a grading and shading between some of these that make the exact relationship hard to define Precisely Existence is so difficult on this world that the competing forms have almost died out There are still a few left preying off the others It was the cooperating and interdependent life forms that really won out in the race for survival I say life forms with intent The creatures here are mostly a mixture of plant and animal like the lichens you have elsewhere The Disans have a creature they call a vaede that they use for water when traveling It has rudimentary powers of motion from its animal part yet uses photosynthesis and stores water like a plant When the Disans drink from it the thing taps their blood streams for food elements I know Brion said wryly I drank from one You can see my scars I m beginning to comprehend how the Disans fit into the physical pattern of their world and I realize it must have all kinds of psychological effects on them Do you think this has any effect on their social organization An important one But maybe I m making too many suppositions now Perhaps your researchers upstairs can tell you better after all this is their field Brion had studied the reports on the social setup and not one word of them made sense They were a solid maze of unknown symbols and cryptic charts Please continue Doctor he insisted The societics reports are valueless so far There are factors missing You are the only one I have talked to so far who can give me any intelligent reports or answers All right then be it on your own head The way I see it you ve got no society here at all just a bunch of rugged individualists Each one for himself getting nourishment from the other life forms of the planet If they have a society it is orientated towards the rest of the planetary life instead of towards other human beings Perhaps that s why your figures don t make sense They are set up for the human societies In their relations with each other these people are completely different What about the magter the upper class types who build castles and are causing all this trouble I have no explanation doctor Stine admitted My theories hold water and seem logical enough up to this point But the magter are the exception and I have no idea why They are completely different from the rest of the Disans Argumentative blood thirsty looking for planetary conquest instead of peace They aren t rulers not in the real sense They hold power because nobody else wants it They grant mining concessions to offworlders because they are the only ones with a sense of property Maybe I m going out on a limb But if you can find out why they are so different you may be onto the clue to our difficulties For the first time since his arrival Brion began to feel a touch of enthusiasm Plus a sense of the remote possibility that there might even be a solution to the deadly problem He drained his glass and stood up I hope you ll wake your patient early Doctor You might be as interested in talking to her as I am If what you told me is true she could well be our key to the answer She is Professor Lea Morees and she is just out from Earth with degrees in exobiology and anthropology and has a head stuffed with vital facts Wonderful Stine said I shall take care of the head not only because it is so pretty but because of its knowledge Though we totter on the edge of atomic destruction I have a strange feeling of optimism for the first time since I landed on this planet IX The guard inside the front entrance of the Foundation building jumped at the thunderous noise and reached for his gun He dropped his hand sheepishly when he realized it was only a sneeze though a gargantuan one Brion came up sniffling huddling down into his coat I m going out before I catch pneumonia he said The guard saluted dumbly and after checking his proximity detector screens he slipped out and the heavy portal thudded shut behind him The street was still warm from the heat of the day and he sighed happily and opened his coat This was partly a reconnaissance trip and partly a way of getting warmed up There was little else he could do in the building the staff had long since retired He had slept for a half an hour and had waked refreshed and ready to work All of the reports he could understand had been read and reread until they were memorized He could use the time now while the rest of them were asleep to get better acquainted with the main city of Dis As he walked the dark streets he realized how alien the Disan way of life was to everything he knew This city Hovedstad literally meant main place in the native language And that s all it was It was only the presence of the offworlders that made it into a city Building after building standing deserted bore the names of mining companies traders space transporters None of them was occupied now Some still had lights burning switched on by automatic apparatus others were as dark as the Disan structures There weren t many of these native constructions and they seemed out of place among the rammed earth and prefab offworld buildings Brion examined one that was dimly illuminated by the light on the corner of VEGAN SMELTERS limited It consisted of a single large room resting right on the ground There were no windows and the whole thing appeared to have been constructed of some sort of woven material plastered with stone hard mud Nothing was blocking the door and he was thinking seriously of going in when he became aware that he was being followed It was only a slight noise almost lost in the night Normally it would never have been noticed but tonight Brion was listening with his entire body Someone was behind him swallowed up in the pools of darkness Brion shrank back against the wall There was very little chance this could be anyone but a Disan He had a sudden memory of Mervv s severed head as it had been discovered outside the door Ihjel had helped him train his empathetic sense and he reached out with it It was difficult working in the dark he could be sure of nothing Was he getting a reaction or just wishing for one Why did it have a ring of familiarity to it A sudden idea struck him Ulv he said very softly This is Brion He crouched ready for any attack I know a voice said softly in the night Do not talk Walk in the direction you were going before Asking questions now would accomplish nothing Brion turned instantly and did as he was bidden The buildings grew further apart until he realized from the sand underfoot that he was back in the planet wide desert It could be a trap he hadn t recognized the voice behind the whisper yet he had to take this chance A darker shape appeared in the dark night near him and a burning hot hand touched his arm lightly I will walk ahead Follow close behind me The words were louder and this time Brion recognized the voice Without waiting for an answer Ulv turned and his dimly seen shape vanished into the darkness Brion moved swiftly after him until they walked side by side over the rolling hills of sand The sand merged into hard baked ground became cracked and scarred with rock filled gulleys They followed a deepening gulley that grew into a good sized ravine When they turned an angle of the ravine Brion saw a weak yellow light coming from an opening in the hard dirt wall Ulv dropped on all fours and vanished through the shoulder wide hole Brion followed him trying to ignore the growing tension and unease he felt Crawling like this head down he was terribly vulnerable He tried to shrug off the feeling mentally blaming it on tense nerves The tunnel was short and opened into a larger chamber A sudden scuffle of feet sounded at the same instant that a wave of empathetic hatred struck him It took vital seconds to fight his way out of the trapping tunnel to roll clear and bring his gun up During those seconds he should have died The Disan poised above him had the short handled stone hammer raised to strike a skull crushing blow Ulv was clutching the man s wrist fighting silently to keep the hammer from falling Neither combatant said a word the rasp of their calloused feet on the sand the only sound Brion backed away from the struggling men his gun centered on the stranger The Disan followed him with burning eyes and dropped the hammer as soon as it was obvious the attack had failed Why did you bring him here he growled at Ulv Why didn t you kill him He is here so we can listen to what he says Gebk He is the one I told you of that I found in the desert We listen to what he says and then we kill him Gebk said with a mirthless grin The remark wasn t meant to be humorous but was made in all seriousness Brion recognized this and knew that there was no danger for the present moment He slid the gun away and for the first time looked around the chamber It was domed in shape and was still hot from the heat of the day Ulv took off the length of cloth he had wrapped around his body against the chill and refolded it as a kilt strapping it on under his belt artifacts He grunted something unintelligible and when a muttered answer came Brion for the first time became aware of the woman and the child The two sat against the far wall squatting on either side of a heap of fibrous plants Both were nude clothed only in the matted hair that fell below their shoulders The belt of strange tools could not be classified as clothing Even the child wore a tiny replica of her mother s Putting down a length of plant she had been chewing the woman shuffled over to the tiny fire that illuminated the room A clay pot stood over it and from this she ladled three bowls of food for the men It smelled atrocious and Brion tried not to taste or smell the sickening mixture while he ate it He used his fingers as did the other men and did not talk while he ate There was no way to tell if the silence was ritual or habit It gave him a chance for a closer look at the Disan way of living The cave was obviously hand made tool marks could be clearly seen in the hard clay of the walls except in the portion opposite the entrance This was covered with a network of roots rising out of the floor and vanishing into the roof of earth above Perhaps this was the reason for the cave s existence The thin roots had been carefully twisted and plaited together until they formed a single swollen root in the center as thick as a man s arm From this hung four of the vaedes Ulv had placed his there before he sat down The teeth must have instantly sunk in for it hung unsupported another link in the Disan life cycle This appeared to be the source of the vaede s water that nourished the people Brion was aware of eyes upon him and turned and smiled at the little girl She couldn t have been over six years old but she was already a Disan in every way She neither returned his smile nor changed her expression unchildlike in its stolidity Her hands and jaw never stopped as she worked on the lengths of fibrous plant her mother had placed before her The child split them with a small tool and removed a pod of some kind This was peeled partially by scraping with a different tool and partially by working between her teeth It took long minutes to remove the tough rind the results seemed scarcely worth it A tiny wriggling object was finally disclosed which the girl instantly swallowed She then began working on the next pod Ulv put down his clay bowl and belched I brought you to the city as I told you I would he said Have you done as you said you would What did he promise Gebk asked That he would stop the war Have you stopped it I am trying to stop it Brion said But it is not that easy I ll need some help It is your life that needs saving yours and your families If you would help me What is the truth Ulv broke in savagely All I hear is difference and there is no longer any way to tell truth For as long as always we have done as the magter say We bring them food and they give us the metal and sometimes water when we need it As long as we do as they ask they do not kill us They live the wrong way but I have had bronze from them for my tools They have told us that they are getting a world for us from the sky people and that is good It has always been known that the sky people are evil in every way and only good can come from killing them Gebk said Brion stared back at the two Disans and their obvious hatred Then why didn t you kill me Ulv he asked That first time in the desert or tonight when you stopped Gebk I could have But there was something more important What is the truth Can we believe as we have always done Or should we listen to this He threw a small sheet of plastic to Brion no bigger than the palm of his hand A metal button was fastened to one corner of the wafer and a simple drawing was imbedded in the wafer Brion held it to the light and saw a picture of a man s hand squeezing the button between thumb and forefinger It was a subminiaturized playback mechanical pressure on the case provided enough current to play the recorded message The plastic sheet vibrated acting as a loudspeaker Though the voice was thin and scratchy the words were clearly audible It was an appeal for the Disan people not to listen to the magter It explained that the magter had started a war that could have only one ending the destruction of Dis Only if the magter were thrown down and their weapons discovered could there be any hope Are these words true Ulv asked
2404_141240_000035_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes Brion said 
none	none	They are perhaps true Gebk said but there is nothing that we can do I was with my brother when these word things fell out of the sky and he listened to one and took it to the magter to ask them They killed him as he should have known they would do The magter kill us if they know we listen to the words And the words tell us we will die if we listen to the magter Ulv shouted his voice cracking Not with fear but with frustration at the attempt to reconcile two opposite points of view Up until this time his world had consisted of black and white values with very few shadings of difference in between There are things you can do that will stop the war without hurting yourself or the magter Brion said searching for a way to enlist their aid Tell us Ulv grunted There would be no war if the magter could be contacted made to listen to reason They are killing you all You could tell me how to talk to the magter how I could understand them No one can talk to the magter the woman broke in If you say something different they will kill you as they killed Gebk s brother So they are easy to understand That is the way they are They do not change She put the length of plant she had been softening for the child back into her mouth Her lips were deeply grooved and scarred from a lifetime of this work her teeth at the sides worn almost to the bone Mor is right Ulv said You do not talk to magter What else is there to do Brion looked at the two men before he spoke and shifted his weight The motion brought his fingertips just a few inches from his gun The magter have bombs that will destroy Nyjord this is the next planet a star in your sky If I can find where the bombs are I will have them taken away and there will be no war You want to aid the devils in the sky against our own people Gebk shouted half rising Ulv pulled him back to the ground but there was no more warmth in his voice as he spoke You are asking too much You will leave now Will you help me though Will you help stop the war Brion asked aware he had gone too far but unable to stop Their anger was making them forget the reasons for his being there You ask too much Ulv said again Go back now We will talk about it Will I see you again How can I reach you We will find you if we wish to talk to you was all Ulv said If they decided he was lying he would never see them again There was nothing he could do about it I have made up my mind Gebk said rising to his feet and drawing his cloth up until it covered his shoulders You are lying and this is all a lie of the sky people If I see you again I will kill you He stepped to the tunnel and was gone There was 
2404_141240_000023_000001	train-clean-360	nothing more 
none	none	to be said Brion went out next checking carefully to be sure that Gebk really had left and Ulv guided him to the spot where the lights of Hovedstad were visible He did not speak during their return journey and vanished without a word Brion shivered in the night chill of the air and wrapped his coat more tightly around himself Depressed he walked back towards the warmer streets of the city It was dawn when he reached the Foundation building a new guard was at the front entrance No amount of hammering or threats could convince the man to open until Faussel came down yawning and blinking with sleep He was starting some complaint when Brion cut him off curtly and ordered him to finish dressing and report for work at once Still feeling elated Brion hurried into his office and cursed the overly efficient character who had turned on his air conditioner to chill the room again When he turned it off this time he removed enough vital parts to keep it out of order for the duration When Faussel came in he was still yawning behind his fist obviously a low morning sugar type Before you fall on your face go out and get some coffee Brion said Two cups I ll have a cup too That won t be necessary Faussel said drawing himself up stiffly I ll call the canteen if you wish some He said it in the iciest tone he could manage this early in the morning In his enthusiasm Brion had forgotten the hate campaign he had directed against himself Suit yourself he said shortly getting back into the role But the next time you yawn there ll be a negative entry in your service record If that s clear you can brief me on this organization s visible relations with the Disans How do they take us Faussel choked and swallowed a yawn I believe they look on the C R F people as some species of simpleton sir They hate all offworlders memory of their desertion has been passed on verbally for generations So by their one to one logic we should either hate back or go away We stay instead And give them food water medicine and artifacts Because of this they let us remain on sufferance I imagine they consider us do gooder idiots and as long as we cause no trouble they ll let us stay He was struggling miserably to suppress a yawn so Brion turned his back and gave him a chance to get it out What about the Nyjorders How much do they know of our work Brion looked out the window at dusty buildings outlined in purple against the violent colors of the desert sunrise Nyjord is a cooperating planet and has full knowledge at all executive levels They are giving us all the aid they can Well now is the time to ask for more Can I contact the commander of the blockading fleet There is a scrambler connection right through to him I ll set it up Faussel bent over the desk and punched a number into the phone controls The screen flowed with the black and white patterns of the scrambler That s all Faussel Brion said I want privacy for this talk What s the commander s name Professor Krafft he s a physicist They have no military men at all so they called him in for the construction of the bombs and energy weapons He s still in charge Faussel yawned extravagantly as he went out the door The Professor Commander was very old with wispy grey hair and a network of wrinkles surrounding his eyes His image shimmered then cleared as the scrambler units aligned You must be Brion Brandd he said I have to tell you how sorry we all are that your friend Ihjel and the two others had to die after coming so far to help us I m sure you are very happy to have had a friend like that Why yes of course Brion said reaching for the scattered fragments of his thought processes It took an effort to remember the first conflict now that he was worrying about the death of a planet It s very kind of you to mention it But I would like to find out a few things from you if I could Anything at all we are at your disposal Before we begin though I shall pass on the thanks of our council for your aid in joining us Even if we are eventually forced to drop the bombs we shall never forget that your organization did everything possible to avert the disaster Once again Brion was caught off balance For an instant he wondered if Krafft was being insincere then recognized the baseness of this thought The completeness of the man s humanity was obvious and compelling The thought passed through Brion s mind that now he had an additional reason for wanting the war ended without destruction on either side He very much wanted to visit Nyjord and see these people on their home grounds Professor Krafft waited patiently and silently while Brion pulled his thoughts together and answered I still hope that this thing can be stopped in time That s what I wanted to talk to you about I want to see Lig magte and I thought it would be better if I had a legitimate reason Are you in contact with him Krafft shook his head No not really in contact When this trouble started I sent him a transceiver so we could talk directly But he has delivered his ultimatum speaking for the magter The only terms he will hear are unconditional surrender His receiver is on but he has said that is the only message he will answer Not much chance of him ever being told that Brion said There was at one time I hope you realize Brion that the decision to bomb Dis was not easily arrived at A great many people myself included voted for unconditional surrender We lost the vote by a very small margin Brion was getting used to these philosophical body blows and he rolled with the punches now Are there any of your people left on this planet Or do you have any troops I can call on for help This is still a remote possibility but if I do find out where the bombs or the launchers are a surprise raid would knock them out We have no people left in Hovedstad now all the ones who weren t evacuated were killed But there are commando teams standing by here to make a landing if the weapons are detected The Disans must depend on secrecy to protect their armament since we have both the manpower and the technology to reach any objective We also have technicians and other volunteers looking for the weapon sites They have not been successful as yet and most of them were killed soon after landing Krafft hesitated for a moment There is another group you should know about you will need all the factors Some of our people are in the desert outside of Hovedstad We do not officially approve of them though they have a good deal of popular support They are mostly young men operating as raiders killing and destroying with very little compunction They are attempting to uncover the weapons by sheer strength of arms This was the best news yet Brion controlled his voice and kept his expression calm when he spoke I don t know how far I can stretch your cooperation but could you possibly tell me how to get in touch with them Kraft allowed himself a small smile I ll give you the wave length on which you can reach their radio They call themselves the Nyjord army When you talk to them you can do me a favor Pass on a message Just to prove things aren t bad enough they ve become a little worse One of our technical crews has detected jump space energy transmissions in the planetary crust The Disans are apparently testing their projector sooner than we had estimated Our deadline has been revised by one day I m afraid there are only two days left before you must evacuate His eyes were large with compassion I m sorry I know this will make your job that much harder Brion didn t want to think about the loss of a full day from his already close deadline Have you told the Disans this yet No Krafft told him The decision was reached a few minutes before your call It is going on the radio to Lig magte now Can you cancel the transmission and let me take the message in person I can do that Krafft thought for a moment But it would surely mean your death at their hands They have no hesitation in killing any of our people I would prefer to send it by radio If you do that you will be interfering with my plans and perhaps destroying them under the guise of saving my life Isn t my life my own to dispose of as I will For the first time Professor Krafft was upset I m sorry terribly sorry I m letting my concern and worry wash over into my public affairs Of course you may do as you please I could never think of stopping you He turned and said something inaudible offscreen The call is cancelled The responsibility is yours All our wishes for success go with you End of transmission End of transmission Brion said and the screen went dark Faussel he shouted into the intercom Get me the best and fastest sand car we have a driver who knows his way around and two men who can handle a gun and know how to take orders We re going to get some positive action at last X
2404_141240_000003_000000	train-clean-360	 It s suicide the taller guard grumbled 
2404_141240_000004_000000	train-clean-360	 Mine not yours so don t worry about it Brion barked at him Your job is to remember your orders and keep them straight Now let s hear them again 
2404_141240_000005_000000	train-clean-360	The guard rolled his eyes up in silent rebellion and repeated in a toneless voice We stay here in the car and keep the motor running while you go inside the stone pile there 
none	none	We don t let anybody in the car and we try and keep them clear of the car short of shooting them that is 
2404_141240_000005_000002	train-clean-360	We don t come in no matter what happens or what it looks like but wait for you here 
2404_141240_000005_000003	train-clean-360	Unless you call on the radio in which case we come in with the automatics going and shoot the place up and it doesn t matter who we hit 
2404_141240_000005_000004	train-clean-360	This will be done only as a last resort 
2404_141240_000006_000000	train-clean-360	 See if you can t arrange that last resort thing the other guard said patting the heavy blue barrel of his weapon 
none	none	I meant that last resort Brion said angrily
2404_141240_000007_000001	train-clean-360	 If any guns go off without my permission you will pay for it and pay with your necks 
2404_141240_000007_000002	train-clean-360	I want that clearly understood 
2404_141240_000007_000003	train-clean-360	You are here as a rear guard and a base for me to get back to 
none	none	This is my operation and mine alone unless I call you in Understood 
2404_141240_000008_000000	train-clean-360	He waited until all three men had nodded in agreement then checked the charge on his gun it was fully loaded 
2404_141240_000008_000001	train-clean-360	It would be foolish to go in unarmed but he had to 
none	none	One gun wouldn t save him 
2404_141240_000008_000003	train-clean-360	He put it aside 
2404_141240_000008_000004	train-clean-360	The button radio on his collar was working and had a strong enough signal to get through any number of walls 
2404_141240_000008_000005	train-clean-360	He took off his coat threw open the door and stepped out into the searing brilliance of the Disan noon 
2404_141240_000009_000000	train-clean-360	There was only the desert silence broken by the steady throb of the car s motor behind him 
2404_141240_000009_000001	train-clean-360	Stretching away to the horizon in every direction was the eternal desert of sand 
2404_141240_000009_000002	train-clean-360	The keep stood nearby solitary a massive pile of black rock 
2404_141240_000009_000003	train-clean-360	Brion plodded closer watching for any motion from the walls 
2404_141240_000009_000004	train-clean-360	Nothing stirred 
2404_141240_000009_000005	train-clean-360	The high walled irregularly shaped construction sat in a ponderous silence 
2404_141240_000009_000006	train-clean-360	Brion was sweating now only partially from the heat 
2404_141240_000010_000000	train-clean-360	He circled the thing looking for a gate 
none	none	There wasn t one at ground level 
2404_141240_000010_000002	train-clean-360	A slanting cleft in the stone could be climbed easily but it seemed incredible that this might be the only entrance 
2404_141240_000010_000003	train-clean-360	A complete circuit proved that it was 
2404_141240_000010_000004	train-clean-360	Brion looked unhappily at the slanting and broken ramp then cupped his hands and shouted loudly 
2404_141240_000011_000000	train-clean-360	 I m coming up 
2404_141240_000011_000001	train-clean-360	Your radio doesn t work any more 
2404_141240_000011_000002	train-clean-360	I m bringing the message from Nyjord that you have been waiting to hear This was a slight bending of the truth without fracturing it 
2404_141240_000011_000003	train-clean-360	There was no answer just the hiss of wind blown sand against the rock and the mutter of the car in the background 
2404_141240_000011_000004	train-clean-360	He started to climb 
2404_141240_000012_000000	train-clean-360	The rock underfoot was crumbling and he had to watch where he put his feet 
2404_141240_000012_000001	train-clean-360	At the same time he fought a constant impulse to look up watching for anything falling from above 
2404_141240_000012_000002	train-clean-360	Nothing happened 
2404_141240_000012_000003	train-clean-360	When he reached the top of the wall he was breathing hard sweat moistened his body 
2404_141240_000012_000004	train-clean-360	There was still no one in sight 
2404_141240_000013_000001	train-clean-360	There was still no one in sight 
2404_141240_000012_000005	train-clean-360	He stood on an unevenly shaped wall that appeared to circle the building 
2404_141240_000012_000006	train-clean-360	Instead of having a courtyard inside it the wall was the outer face of the structure the domed roof rising from it 
2404_141240_000012_000007	train-clean-360	At varying intervals dark openings gave access to the interior 
2404_141240_000012_000008	train-clean-360	When Brion looked down the sand car was just a dun colored bump in the desert already far behind him 
2404_141240_000013_000000	train-clean-360	Stooping he went through the nearest door 
none	none	There was still no one in sight 
2404_141240_000013_000002	train-clean-360	The room inside was something out of a madman s funhouse It was higher than it was wide irregular in shape and more like a hallway than a room 
2404_141240_000013_000003	train-clean-360	At one end it merged into an incline that became a stairwell 
2404_141240_000013_000004	train-clean-360	At the other it ended in a hole that vanished in darkness below 
2404_141240_000013_000005	train-clean-360	Light of sorts filtered in through slots and holes drilled into the thick stone wall 
2404_141240_000013_000006	train-clean-360	Everything was built of the same crumble textured but strong rock 
none	none	Brion took the stairs 
2404_141240_000013_000008	train-clean-360	After a number of blind passages and wrong turns he saw a stronger light ahead and went on 
2404_141240_000013_000009	train-clean-360	There was food metal even artifacts of the unusual Disan design in the different rooms he passed through 
2404_141240_000013_000010	train-clean-360	Yet no people 
2404_141240_000013_000011	train-clean-360	The light ahead grew stronger and the last passageway opened and swelled out until it led into the large central chamber 
2404_141240_000014_000000	train-clean-360	This was the heart of the strange structure 
2404_141240_000014_000001	train-clean-360	All the rooms passageways and halls existed just to give form to this gigantic chamber 
2404_141240_000014_000002	train-clean-360	The walls rose sharply the room being circular in cross section and growing narrower towards the top 
2404_141240_000014_000003	train-clean-360	It was a truncated cone since there was no ceiling a hot blue disk of sky cast light on the floor below 
none	none	On the floor stood a knot of men who stared at Brion 
2404_141240_000016_000000	train-clean-360	Out of the corner of his eyes and with the very periphery of his consciousness he was aware of the rest of the room barrels stores machinery a radio transceiver various bundles and heaps that made no sense at first glance 
2404_141240_000016_000001	train-clean-360	There was no time to look closer 
none	none	Every fraction of his attention was focused on the muffled and hooded men He had found the enemy 
2404_141240_000018_000000	train-clean-360	Everything that had happened to him so far on Dis had been preparation for this moment 
2404_141240_000018_000001	train-clean-360	The attack in the desert the escape the dreadful heat of sun and sand 
2404_141240_000018_000002	train-clean-360	All this had tempered and prepared him 
2404_141240_000018_000003	train-clean-360	It had been nothing in itself 
2404_141240_000018_000004	train-clean-360	Now the battle would begin in earnest 
2404_141240_000019_000000	train-clean-360	None of this was conscious in his mind 
2404_141240_000019_000001	train-clean-360	His fighter s reflexes bent his shoulders curved his hands before him as he walked softly in balance ready to spring in any direction 
none	none	Yet none of this was really necessary 
2404_141240_000019_000003	train-clean-360	All the danger so far was nonphysical 
2404_141240_000019_000004	train-clean-360	When he did give conscious thought to the situation he stopped startled 
none	none	What was wrong here None of the men had moved or made a sound How could he even know they were men 
2404_141240_000019_000008	train-clean-360	They were so muffled and wrapped in cloth that only their eyes were exposed 
none	none	No doubt however existed in Brion s mind 
2404_141240_000020_000001	train-clean-360	In spite of muffled cloth and silence he knew them for what they were 
2404_141240_000020_000002	train-clean-360	The eyes were empty of expression and unmoving yet were filled with the same negative emptiness as those of a bird of prey 
2404_141240_000020_000003	train-clean-360	They could look on life death and the rending of flesh with the same lack of interest and compassion 
2404_141240_000020_000004	train-clean-360	All this Brion knew in an instant of time without words being spoken 
2404_141240_000020_000005	train-clean-360	Between the time he lifted one foot and walked a step he understood what he had to face 
2404_141240_000020_000006	train-clean-360	There could be no doubt not to an empathetic 
2404_141240_000021_000000	train-clean-360	From the group of silent men poured a frost white wave of unemotion An empathetic shares what other men feel 
2404_141240_000021_000001	train-clean-360	He gets his knowledge of their reaction by sensing lightly their emotions the surges of interest hate love fear desire the sweep of large and small sensations that accompany all thought and action 
2404_141240_000021_000002	train-clean-360	The empathetic is always aware of this constant and silent surge whether he makes the effort to understand it or not 
2404_141240_000021_000003	train-clean-360	He is like a man glancing across the open pages of a tableful of books 
2404_141240_000021_000004	train-clean-360	He can see that the type words paragraphs thoughts are there even without focusing his attention to understand any of it 
2404_141240_000022_000000	train-clean-360	Then how does the man feel when he glances at the open books and sees only blank pages 
2404_141240_000022_000001	train-clean-360	The books are there the words are not 
2404_141240_000022_000002	train-clean-360	He turns the pages of one of the others flipping the pages searching for meaning 
2404_141240_000022_000003	train-clean-360	There is no meaning 
none	none	All of the pages are blank This was the way in which the magter were blank without emotions There was a barely sensed surge and return that must have been neural impulses on a basic level the automatic adjustments of nerve and muscle that keep an organism alive Nothing more 
2404_141240_000023_000002	train-clean-360	Brion reached for other sensations but there was nothing there to grasp 
2404_141240_000023_000003	train-clean-360	Either these men were without emotions or they were able to block them from his detection it was impossible to tell which 
2404_141240_000024_000000	train-clean-360	Very little time had passed while Brion made these discoveries 
2404_141240_000024_000001	train-clean-360	The knot of men still looked at him silent and unmoving 
2404_141240_000024_000002	train-clean-360	They weren t expectant their attitude could not have been called one of interest 
2404_141240_000024_000003	train-clean-360	But he had come to them and now they waited to find out why 
2404_141240_000024_000004	train-clean-360	Any questions or statements they spoke would be superfluous so they didn t speak 
2404_141240_000024_000005	train-clean-360	The responsibility was his 
none	none	I have come to talk with Lig magte 
2404_141240_000025_000001	train-clean-360	Who is he Brion didn t like the tiny sound his voice made in the immense room 
2404_141240_000026_000000	train-clean-360	One of the men gave a slight motion to draw attention to himself None of the others moved 
2404_141240_000026_000001	train-clean-360	They still waited 
2404_141240_000027_000000	train-clean-360	 I have a message for you Brion said speaking slowly to fill the silence of the room and the emptiness of his thoughts 
none	none	This had to be handled right 
2404_141240_000027_000002	train-clean-360	But what was right 
2404_141240_000027_000003	train-clean-360	 I m from the Foundation in the city as you undoubtedly know 
none	none	I ve been talking to the people of Nyjord 
2404_141240_000027_000005	train-clean-360	They have a message for you 
2404_141240_000028_000000	train-clean-360	The silence grew longer 
none	none	Brion had no intention of making this a monologue 
2404_141240_000028_000002	train-clean-360	He needed facts to operate to form an opinion 
2404_141240_000028_000003	train-clean-360	Looking at the silent forms was telling him nothing 
2404_141240_000028_000004	train-clean-360	Time stretched taut and finally Lig magte spoke 
none	none	The Nyjorders are going to surrender It was an impossibly strange sentence Brion had never realized before how much of the content of speech was made up of emotion If the man had given it a positive emphasis perhaps said it with enthusiasm it would have meant Success 
2404_141240_000030_000002	train-clean-360	The enemy is going to surrender 
2404_141240_000030_000003	train-clean-360	This wasn t the meaning 
2404_141240_000031_000000	train-clean-360	With a rising inflection on the end it would have been a question Are they going to surrender It was neither of these 
none	none	The sentence carried no other message than that contained in the simplest meanings of the separate words 
2404_141240_000031_000002	train-clean-360	It had intellectual connotations but these could only be gained from past knowledge not from the sound of the words 
none	none	There was only one message they were prepared to receive from Nyjord 
2404_141240_000031_000004	train-clean-360	Therefore Brion was bringing the message If that was not the message Brion was bringing the men here were not interested 
2404_141240_000032_000000	train-clean-360	This was the vital fact 
none	none	If they were not interested he could have no further value to them Since he came from the enemy he was the enemy 
2404_141240_000032_000003	train-clean-360	Therefore he would be killed 
2404_141240_000032_000004	train-clean-360	Because this was vital to his existence Brion took the time to follow the thought through 
2404_141240_000032_000005	train-clean-360	It made logical sense and logic was all he could depend on now 
2404_141240_000032_000006	train-clean-360	He could be talking to robots or alien creatures for all the human response he was receiving 
2404_141240_000033_000000	train-clean-360	 You can t win this war all you can do is hurry your own deaths He said this with as much conviction as he could realizing at the same time that it was wasted effort 
2404_141240_000033_000001	train-clean-360	No flicker of response stirred in the men before him 
none	none	The Nyjorders know you have the cobalt bombs and they have detected your jump space projector 
2404_141240_000033_000003	train-clean-360	They can t take any more chances 
2404_141240_000033_000004	train-clean-360	They have pushed the deadline closer by an entire day 
none	none	There are one and a half days left before the bombs fall and you are all destroyed 
2404_141240_000033_000006	train-clean-360	Do you realize what that means 
none	none	Is that the message Lig magte asked Yes Brion said 
2404_141240_000036_000000	train-clean-360	Two things saved his life then 
2404_141240_000036_000001	train-clean-360	He had guessed what would happen as soon as they had his message though he hadn t been sure 
2404_141240_000036_000002	train-clean-360	But even the suspicion had put him on his guard 
2404_141240_000036_000003	train-clean-360	This combined with the reflexes of a Winner of the Twenties was barely enough to enable him to survive 
2404_141240_000037_000000	train-clean-360	From frozen mobility Lig magte had catapulted into headlong attack As he leaped forward he drew a curved double edged blade from under his robes 
2404_141240_000037_000001	train-clean-360	It plunged unerringly through the spot where Brion s body had been an instant before 
2404_141240_000038_000000	train-clean-360	There had been no time to tense his muscles and jump just the space of time to relax them and fall to one side 
none	none	His reasoning mind joined the battle as he hit the floor 
2404_141240_000038_000002	train-clean-360	Lig magte plunged by him turning and bringing the knife down at the same time 
2404_141240_000038_000003	train-clean-360	Brion s foot lashed out and caught the other man s leg sending him sprawling 
2404_141240_000039_000000	train-clean-360	They were both on their feet at the same instant facing each other Brion now had his hands clasped before him in the unarmed man s best defense against a knife the two arms protecting the body the two hands joined to beat aside the knife arm from whichever direction it came 
2404_141240_000039_000001	train-clean-360	The Disan hunched low flipped the knife quickly from hand to hand then thrust it again at Brion s midriff 
2404_141240_000040_000000	train-clean-360	Only by the merest fractional margin did Brion evade the attack for the second time 
2404_141240_000040_000001	train-clean-360	Lig magte fought with utter violence 
none	none	Every action was as intense as possible deadly and thorough 
2404_141240_000040_000003	train-clean-360	There could be only one end to this unequal contest if Brion stayed on the defensive The man with the knife had to win 
2404_141240_000041_000000	train-clean-360	With the next charge Brion changed tactics 
2404_141240_000041_000001	train-clean-360	He leaped inside the thrust clutching for the knife arm 
none	none	A burning slice of pain cut across his arm then his fingers clutched the tendoned wrist 
2404_141240_000041_000003	train-clean-360	They clamped down hard grinding shut compressing with the tightening intensity of a closing vise 
2404_141240_000042_000000	train-clean-360	It was all he could do simply to hold on 
2404_141240_000042_000001	train-clean-360	There was no science in it just his greater strength from exercise and existence on a heavier planet 
2404_141240_000042_000002	train-clean-360	All of this strength went to his clutching hand because he held his own life in that hand forcing away the knife that wanted to terminate it forever 
2404_141240_000042_000003	train-clean-360	Nothing else mattered neither the frightening force of the knees that thudded into his body nor the hooked fingers that reached for his eyes to tear them out 
2404_141240_000042_000004	train-clean-360	He protected his face as well as he could while the nails tore furrows through his flesh and the cut on his arm bled freely 
none	none	These were only minor things to be endured 
2404_141240_000042_000006	train-clean-360	His life depended on the grasp of the fingers of his right hand 
none	none	There was a sudden immobility as Brion succeeded in clutching Lig magte s other arm It was a good grip and he could hold the arm immobilized 
2404_141240_000043_000002	train-clean-360	They had reached stasis standing knee to knee their faces only a few inches apart 
2404_141240_000043_000003	train-clean-360	The muffling cloth had fallen from the Disan s face during the struggle and empty frigid eyes stared into Brion s 
2404_141240_000043_000004	train-clean-360	No flicker of emotion crossed the harsh planes of the other man s face 
2404_141240_000043_000005	train-clean-360	A great puckered white scar covered one cheek and pulled up a corner of the mouth in a cheerless grimace 
2404_141240_000043_000006	train-clean-360	It was false there was still no expression here even when the pain must be growing more intense 
2404_141240_000044_000000	train-clean-360	Brion was winning if none of the watchers broke the impasse His greater weight and strength counted now 
2404_141240_000044_000001	train-clean-360	The Disan would have to drop the knife before his arm was dislocated at the shoulder He didn t do it 
none	none	With sudden horror Brion realized that he wasn t going to drop it no matter what happened 
2404_141240_000045_000000	train-clean-360	A dull hideous snap jerked through the Disan s body and the arm hung limp and dead 
2404_141240_000045_000001	train-clean-360	No expression crossed the man s face 
2404_141240_000045_000002	train-clean-360	The knife was still locked in the fingers of the paralyzed hand 
none	none	With his other hand Lig magte reached across and started to pry the blade loose ready to continue the battle one handed 
2404_141240_000045_000004	train-clean-360	Brion raised his foot and kicked the knife free sending it spinning across the room 
2404_141240_000046_000000	train-clean-360	Lig magte made a fist of his good hand and crashed it into Brion s groin 
2404_141240_000046_000001	train-clean-360	He was still fighting as if nothing had changed 
2404_141240_000046_000002	train-clean-360	Brion backed slowly away from the man 
2404_141240_000046_000003	train-clean-360	 Stop it he said 
none	none	You can t win now 
2404_141240_000046_000005	train-clean-360	It s impossible He called to the other men who were watching the unequal battle with expressionless immobility 
2404_141240_000046_000006	train-clean-360	No one answered him 
none	none	With a terrible sinking sensation Brion then realized what would happen and what he had to do Lig magte was as heedless of his own life as he was of the life of his planet 
2404_141240_000047_000002	train-clean-360	He would press the attack no matter what damage was done to him 
2404_141240_000047_000003	train-clean-360	Brion had an insane vision of him breaking the man s other arm fracturing both his legs and the limbless broken creature still coming forward 
2404_141240_000047_000004	train-clean-360	Crawling rolling teeth bared since they were the only remaining weapon 
2404_141240_000048_000000	train-clean-360	There was only one way to end it 
2404_141240_000048_000001	train-clean-360	Brion feinted and the Lig magte s arm moved clear of his body 
2404_141240_000048_000002	train-clean-360	The engulfing cloth was thin and through it Brion could see the outlines of the Disan s abdomen and rib cage the clear location of the great nerve ganglion 
none	none	It was the death blow of kara te Brion had never used it on a man In practice he had broken heavy boards splintering them instantly with the short precise stroke 
2404_141240_000049_000002	train-clean-360	The stiffened hand moving forward in a sudden surge all the weight and energy of his body concentrated in his joined fingertips 
none	none	Plunging deep into the other s flesh 
2404_141240_000050_000000	train-clean-360	Killing not by accident or in sudden anger 
2404_141240_000050_000001	train-clean-360	Killing because this was the only way the battle could possibly end 
2404_141240_000051_000000	train-clean-360	Like a ruined tower of flesh the Disan crumpled and fell 
none	none	Dripping blood exhausted Brion stood over the body of Lig magte and stared at the dead man s allies 
2404_141240_000053_000000	train-clean-360	Death filled the room 
none	none	XI Facing the silent Disans Brion s thoughts hurtled about in sweeping circles There would be no more than an instant s tick of time before the magter avenged themselves bloodily and completely He felt a fleeting regret for not having brought his gun then abandoned the thought There was no time for regrets what could he do now The silent watchers hadn t attacked instantly and Brion realized that they couldn t be positive yet that Lig magte had been killed Only Brion himself knew the deadliness of that blow Their lack of knowledge might buy him a little more time Lig magte is unconscious but he will revive quickly Brion said pointing at the huddled body As the eyes turned automatically to follow his finger he began walking slowly towards the exit I did not want to do this but he forced me to because he wouldn t listen to reason Now I have something else to show you something that I hoped it would not be necessary to reveal He was saying the first words that came into his head trying to keep them distracted as long as possible He must appear to be only going across the room that was the feeling he must generate There was even time to stop for a second and straighten his rumpled clothing and brush the sweat from his eyes Talking easily walking slowly towards the hall that led out of the chamber He was halfway there when the spell broke and the rush began One of the magter knelt and touched the body and shouted a single word Dead Brion hadn t waited for the official announcement At the first movement of feet he dived headlong for the shelter of the exit There was a spatter of tiny missiles on the wall next to him and he had a brief glimpse of raised blowguns before the wall intervened He went up the dimly lit stairs three at a time The pack was just behind him voiceless and deadly He could not gain on them if anything they were closing the distance as he pushed his already tired body to the utmost There was no subtlety or trick he could use now just straightforward flight back the way he had come A single slip on the irregular steps and it would be all over There was someone ahead of him If the woman had waited a few seconds more he would certainly have been killed but instead of slashing at him as he went by the doorway she made the mistake of rushing to the center of the stairs the knife ready to impale him as he came up Without slowing Brion fell onto his hands and easily dodged under the blow As he passed he twisted and seized her around the waist picking her from the ground When her legs lifted from under her the woman screamed the first human sound Brion had heard in this human anthill His pursuers were just behind him and he hurled the woman into them with all his strength They fell in a tangle and Brion used the precious seconds gained to reach the top of the building There must have been other stairs and exits because one of the magter stood between Brion and the way down out of this trap armed and ready to kill him if he tried to pass As he ran towards the executioner Brion flicked on his collar radio and shouted into it I m in trouble here Can you The guards in the car must have been waiting for this message Before he had finished there was the thud of a high velocity slug hitting flesh and the Disan spun and fell blood soaking his shoulder Brion leaped over him and headed for the ramp The next one is me hold your fire he called Both guards must have had their telescopic sights zeroed on the spot They let Brion pass then threw in a hail of semi automatic fire that tore chunks from the stone and screamed away in noisy ricochets Brion didn t try to see if anyone was braving this hail of covering fire he concentrated his energies on making as quick and erratic a descent as he could Above the sounds of the firing he heard the car motor howl as it leaped forward With their careful aim spoiled the gunners switched to full automatic and unleashed a hailstorm of flying metal that bracketed the top of the tower Cease firing Brion gasped into the radio as he ran The driver was good and timed his arrival with exactitude The car reached the base of the tower at the same instant Brion did and he burst through the door while it was still moving No orders were necessary He fell headlong onto a seat as the car swung in a dust raising turn and ground into high gear back to the city Reaching over carefully the tall guard gently extracted a bit of pointed wood and fluff from a fold of Brion s pants He cracked open the car door and just as delicately threw it out I knew that thing didn t touch you he said since you are still among the living They ve got a poison on those blowgun darts that takes all of twelve seconds to work Lucky Lucky Brion was beginning to realize just how lucky he was to be out of the trap alive And with information Now that he knew more about the magter he shuddered at his innocence in walking alone and unarmed into the tower Skill had helped him survive but better than average luck had been necessary Curiosity had gotten him in brashness and speed had taken him out He was exhausted battered and bloody but cheerfully happy The facts about the magter were arranging themselves into a theory that might explain their attempt at racial suicide It just needed a little time to be put into shape A pain cut across his arm and he jumped startled pieces of his thoughts crashing into ruin around him The gunner had cracked the first aid box and was swabbing his arm with antiseptic The knife wound was long but not deep Brion shivered while the bandage was going on then quickly slipped into his coat The air conditioner whined industriously bringing down the temperature There was no attempt to follow the car When the black tower had dropped over the horizon the guards relaxed ran cleaning rods through their guns and compared marksmanship All of their antagonism towards Brion was gone they actually smiled at him He had given them the first chance to shoot back since they had been on this planet The ride was uneventful and Brion was scarcely aware of it A theory was taking form in his mind It was radical and startling yet it seemed to be the only one that fitted the facts He pushed at it from all sides but if there were any holes he couldn t find them What it needed was dispassionate proving or disproving There was only one person on Dis who was qualified to do this Lea was working in the lab when he came in bent over a low power binocular microscope Something small limbless and throbbing was on the slide She glanced up when she heard his footsteps smiling warmly when she recognized him Fatigue and pain had drawn her face her skin glistening with burn ointment was chapped and peeling I must look a wreck she said putting the back of her hand to her cheek Something like a well oiled and lightly cooked piece of beef She lowered her arm suddenly and took his hand in both of hers Her palms were warm and slightly moist Thank you Brion was all she could say Her society on Earth was highly civilized and sophisticated able to discuss any topic without emotion and without embarrassment This was fine in most circumstances but made it difficult to thank a person for saving your life However you tried to phrase it it came out sounding like a last act speech from a historical play There was no doubt however as to what she meant Her eyes were large and dark the pupils dilated by the drugs she had been given They could not lie nor could the emotions he sensed He did not answer just held her hand an instant longer How do you feel he asked concerned His conscience twinged as he remembered that he was the one who had ordered her out of bed and back to work today I should be feeling terrible she said with an airy wave of her hand But I m walking on top of the world I m so loaded with pain killers and stimulants that I m high as the moon All the nerves to my feet feel turned off it s like walking on two balls of fluff Thanks for getting me out of that awful hospital and back to work Brion was suddenly sorry for having driven her from her sick bed Don t be sorry Lea said apparently reading his mind but really seeing only his sudden ashamed expression I m feeling no pain Honestly I feel a little light headed and foggy at times nothing more And this is the job I came here to do In fact well it s almost impossible to tell you just how fascinating it all is It was almost worth getting baked and parboiled for She swung back to the microscope centering the specimen with a turn of the stage adjustment screw Poor Ihjel was right when he said this planet was exobiologically fascinating This is a gastropod a lot like Odostomia but it has parasitical morphological changes so profound that There s something else I remember Brion said interrupting her enthusiastic lecture only half of which he could understand Didn t Ihjel also hope that you would give some study to the natives as well as their environment The problem is with the Disans not with the local wild life But I am studying them Lea insisted The Disans have attained an incredibly advanced form of commensalism Their lives are so intimately connected and integrated with the other life forms that they must be studied in relation to their environment I doubt if they show as many external physical changes as little eating foot Odostomia on the slide here but there will surely be a number of psychological changes and adjustments that will crop up One of these might be the explanation of their urge for planetary suicide That may be true but I don t think so Brion said I went on a little expedition this morning and found something that has more immediate relevancy For the first time Lea became aware of his slightly battered condition Her drug grooved mind could only follow a single idea at a time and had over looked the significance of the bandage and dirt I ve been visiting Brion said forestalling the question on her lips The magter are the ones who are responsible for causing the trouble and I had to see them up close before I could make any decisions It wasn t a very pleasant thing but I found out what I wanted to know They are different in every way from the normal Disans I ve compared them I ve talked to Ulv the native who saved us in the desert and I can understand him He is not like us in many ways he certainly couldn t be living in this oven but he is still undeniably human He gave us drinking water when we needed it then brought help The magter the upper class lords of Dis are the direct opposite As cold blooded and ruthless a bunch of murderers as you can possibly imagine They tried to kill me when they met me without reason Their clothes habits dwellings manners everything about them differs from that of the normal Disan More important the magter are as coldly efficient and inhuman as a reptile They have no emotions no love no hate no anger no fear nothing Each of them is a chilling bundle of thought processes and reactions with all the emotions removed Aren t you exaggerating Lea asked After all you can t be sure It might just be part of their training not to reveal any emotional state Everyone must experience emotional states whether they like it or not That s my main point Everyone does except the magter I can t go into all the details now so you ll just have to take my word for it Even at the point of death they have no fear or hatred It may sound impossible but it is true Lea tried to shake the knots from her drug hazed mind I m dull today she said You ll have to excuse me If these rulers had no emotional responses that might explain their present suicidal position But an explanation like this raises more new problems than it supplies answers to the old ones How did they get this way It doesn t seem humanly possible to be without emotions of some kind Just my point Not humanly possible I think these ruling class Disans aren t human at all like the other Disans I think they are alien creatures robots or androids anything except men I think they are living in disguise among the normal human dwellers At first Lea started to smile then her feeling changed when she saw his face You are serious she asked Never more so I realize it must sound as if I ve had my brains bounced around too much this morning Yet this is the only idea I can come up with that fits all of the facts Look at the evidence yourself One simple thing stands out clearly and must be considered first if any theory is to hold up That is the magters complete indifference to death their own or anyone else s Is that normal to mankind No but I can find a couple of explanations that I would rather explore first before dragging in an alien life form There may have been a mutation or an inherited disease that has deformed or warped their minds Wouldn t that be sort of self eliminating Brion asked Anti survival People who die before puberty would find it a little difficult to pass on a mutation to their children But let s not beat this one point to death it s the totality of these people that I find so hard to accept Any one thing might be explained away but not the collection of them What about their complete lack of emotion Or their manner of dress and their secrecy in general The ordinary Disan wears a cloth kilt while the magter cover themselves as completely as possible They stay in their black towers and never go out except in groups Their dead are always removed so they can t be examined In every way they act like a race apart and I think they are Granted for the moment that this outlandish idea might be true how did they get here And why doesn t anyone know about it besides them Easily enough explained Brion insisted There are no written records on this planet After the Breakdown when the handful of survivors were just trying to exist here the aliens could have landed and moved in Any interference could have been wiped out Once the population began to grow the invaders found they could keep control by staying separate so their alien difference wouldn t be noticed Why should that bother them Lea asked If they are so indifferent to death they can t have any strong thoughts on public opinion or alien body odor Why would they bother with such a complex camouflage And if they arrived from another planet what has happened to the scientific ability that brought them here Peace Brion said I don t know enough to be able even to guess at answers to half your questions I m just trying to fit a theory to the facts And the facts are clear The magter are so inhuman they would give me nightmares if I were sleeping these days What we need is more evidence Then get it Lea said with finality I m not telling you to turn murderer but you might try a bit of grave digging Give me a scalpel and one of your friends stretched out on a slab and I ll quickly tell you what he is or is not She turned back to the microscope and bent over the eyepiece That was really the only way to hack the Gordian knot Dis had only thirty six more hours to live so individual deaths shouldn t be of any concern He had to find a dead magter and if none was obtainable in the proper condition he had to get one of them by violence For a planetary savior he was personally doing in an awful lot of the citizenry He stood behind Lea looking down at her thoughtfully while she worked The back of her neck lightly covered with gently curling hair was turned toward him With one of the about face shifts the mind is capable of his thoughts flipped from death to life and he experienced a strong desire to caress this spot lightly to feel the yielding texture of female flesh Plunging his hands deep into his pockets he walked quickly to the door Get some rest soon he called to her I doubt if those bugs will give you the answer I m going now to see if I can get the full sized specimen you want The truth could be anywhere I ll stay on these until you come back she said not looking up from the microscope Up under the roof was a well equipped communications room Brion had taken a quick look at it when he had first toured the building The duty operator had earphones on though only one of the phones covered an ear and was monitoring through the bands His shoeless feet were on the edge of the table and he was eating a thick sandwich held in his free hand His eyes bulged when he saw Brion in the doorway and he jumped into a flurry of action Hold the pose Brion told him it doesn t bother me And if you make any sudden moves you are liable to break a phone electrocute yourself or choke to death Just see if you can set the transceiver on this frequency for me Brion wrote the number on a scratch pad and slid it over to the operator It was the frequency Professor Commander Krafft had given him for the radio of the illegal terrorists the Nyjord army The operator plugged in a handset and gave it to Brion Circuit open he mumbled around a mouthful of still unswallowed sandwich This is Brandd director of the C R F Come in please He went on repeating this for more than ten minutes before he got an answer What do you want I have a message of vital urgency for you and I would also like your help Do you want any more information on the radio No Wait there we ll get in touch with you after dark The carrier wave went dead Thirty five hours to the end of the world and all he could do was wait XII 
2404_141242_000003_000000	train-clean-360	On Brion s desk when he came in were two neat piles of paper 
2404_141242_000003_000001	train-clean-360	As he sat down and reached for them he was conscious of an arctic coldness in the air a frigid blast 
none	none	It was coming from the air conditioner grill which was now covered by welded steel bars The control unit was sealed shut Someone was either being very funny or very efficient Either way it was cold 
2404_141242_000003_000006	train-clean-360	Brion kicked at the cover plate until it buckled then bent it aside 
2404_141242_000003_000007	train-clean-360	After a careful look into the interior he disconnected one wire and shorted it to another

2404_141242_000004_000001	train-clean-360	 What do you have there Brion asked 
none	none	Faussel managed to straighten out his face and brought the folders to the desk arranging them on the piles already there These are the progress reports you asked for from all units Details to date conclusions suggestions et cetera And the other pile Brion pointed Offplanet correspondence commissary invoices requisitions He straightened the edges of the stack while he answered
2404_141242_000007_000001	train-clean-360	 Daily reports hospital log His voice died away and stopped as Brion carefully pushed the stack off the edge of the desk into the wastebasket 
none	none	In other words red tape Brion said

2404_141242_000009_000000	train-clean-360	One by one the progress reports followed the first stack into the basket until the desk was clear 
none	none	Nothing 
2404_141242_000009_000002	train-clean-360	It was just what he had expected 
none	none	But there had always been the off chance that one of the specialists could come up with a new approach 
2404_141242_000009_000004	train-clean-360	They hadn t they were all too busy specializing 
2404_141242_000010_000000	train-clean-360	Outside the sky was darkening

none	none	There was nothing else Brion could do until the Nyjord rebels made contact Irritation bit at him At least Lea was doing something constructive he could look in on her He opened the door to the lab with a feeling of pleasant anticipation 
2404_141242_000011_000001	train-clean-360	It froze and shattered instantly 
2404_141242_000011_000002	train-clean-360	Her microscope was hooded and she was gone 
none	none	She s having dinner he thought or she s in the hospital The hospital was on the floor below and he went there first
2404_141242_000012_000000	train-clean-360	 Of course she s here doctor Stine grumbled

2404_141242_000016_000006	train-clean-360	So don t look forward to too much efficiency 
none	none	I never did Brion said to the retreating back Lea s room was dark illuminated only by the light of Dis s moon slanting in through the window Brion let himself in and closed the door behind him 
2404_141242_000018_000002	train-clean-360	Walking quietly he went over to the bed 
none	none	Lea was sleeping soundly her breathing gentle and regular 
2404_141242_000018_000004	train-clean-360	A night s sleep now would do as much good as all the medication 
2404_141242_000019_000000	train-clean-360	He should have gone then instead he sat down in the chair placed next to the head of the bed 
2404_141242_000019_000001	train-clean-360	The guards knew where he was he could wait here just as well as any place else 
2404_141242_000020_000000	train-clean-360	It was a stolen moment of peace on a world at the brink of destruction 
2404_141242_000020_000001	train-clean-360	He was grateful for it 
none	none	Everything looked less harsh in the moonlight and he rubbed some of the tension from his eyes Lea s face was ironed smooth by the light beautiful and young a direct contrast to everything else on this poisonous world 
2404_141242_000020_000003	train-clean-360	Her hand was outside of the covers and he took it in his own obeying a sudden impulse 
none	none	Looking out of the window at the desert in the distance he let the peace wash over him forcing himself to forget for the moment that in one more day life would be stripped from this planet Later when he looked back at Lea he saw that her eyes were open though she hadn t moved How long had she been awake He jerked his hand away from hers feeling suddenly guilty
2404_141242_000022_000000	train-clean-360	 Is the boss man looking after the serfs to see if they re fit for the treadmills in the morning she asked 
2404_141242_000022_000001	train-clean-360	It was the kind of remark she had used with such frequency in the ship though it didn t sound quite as harsh now 
2404_141242_000022_000002	train-clean-360	And she was smiling 
2404_141242_000022_000003	train-clean-360	Yet it reminded him too well of her superior attitude towards rubes from the stellar sticks Here he might be the director but on ancient Earth he would be only one more gaping lead footed yokel 
none	none	How do you feel he asked realizing and hating the triteness of the words even as he said them Terrible I ll be dead by morning Reach me a piece of fruit from that bowl will you 
2404_141242_000024_000003	train-clean-360	My mouth tastes like an old boot heel 
2404_141242_000024_000004	train-clean-360	I wonder how fresh fruit ever got here 
none	none	Probably a gift to the working classes from the smiling planetary murderers on Nyjord She took the apple Brion gave her and bit into it
2404_141242_000025_000001	train-clean-360	 Did you ever think of going to Earth 
2404_141242_000026_000000	train-clean-360	Brion was startled 
2404_141242_000026_000001	train-clean-360	This was too close to his own thoughts about planetary backgrounds 
2404_141242_000026_000002	train-clean-360	There couldn t possibly be a connection though 
2404_141242_000026_000003	train-clean-360	 Never he told her 
none	none	Up until a few months ago I never even considered leaving Anvhar The Twenties are such a big thing at home that it is hard to imagine that anything else exists while you are still taking part in them Spare me the Twenties she pleaded After listening to you and Ihjel I know far more about them than I shall ever care to know But what about Anvhar itself Do you have big city states as Earth does
2404_141242_000028_000000	train-clean-360	 Nothing like that 
none	none	For its size it has a very small population No big cities at all I guess the largest centers of population are around the schools packing plants things like that
2404_141242_000029_000000	train-clean-360	 Any exobiologists there Lea asked with a woman s eternal ability to make any general topic personal 
none	none	At the universities I suppose though I wouldn t know for sure And you must realize that when I say no big cities I also mean no little cities 
2404_141242_000030_000001	train-clean-360	We aren t organized that way at all 
none	none	I imagine the basic physical unit is the family and the circle of friends Friends get important quickly since the family breaks up when children are still relatively young Something in the genes I suppose we all enjoy being alone 
2404_141242_000030_000005	train-clean-360	I suppose you might call it an inbred survival trait 
2404_141242_000031_000000	train-clean-360	 Up to a point she said biting delicately into the apple 
2404_141242_000031_000001	train-clean-360	 Carry that sort of thing too far and you end up with no population at all A certain amount of proximity is necessary for that 
none	none	Of course it is 
2404_141242_000032_000001	train-clean-360	And there must be some form of recognized relationship or control that or complete promiscuity 
2404_141242_000032_000002	train-clean-360	On Anvhar the emphasis is on personal responsibility and that seems to take care of the problem 
none	none	If we didn t have an adult way of looking at things our kind of life would be impossible Individuals are brought together either by accident or design and with this proximity must be some certainty of relations You re losing me Lea protested Either I m still foggy from the dope or you are suddenly unable to speak a word of less than four syllables 
2404_141242_000033_000002	train-clean-360	You know whenever this happens with you I get the distinct impression that you are trying to cover up something For Occam s sake be specific 
2404_141242_000033_000003	train-clean-360	Bring me together two of these hypothetical individuals and tell me what happens 
none	none	Brion took a deep breath He was in over his head and far from shore
2404_141242_000034_000002	train-clean-360	 Well take a bachelor like myself 
2404_141242_000034_000003	train-clean-360	Since I like cross country skiing I make my home in this big house our family has right at the edge of the Broken Hills 
none	none	In summer I looked after a drumtum herd but after slaughtering my time was my own all winter I did a lot of skiing and used to work for the Twenties Sometimes I would go visiting Then again people would drop in on me houses are few and far between on Anvhar 
2404_141242_000034_000007	train-clean-360	We don t even have locks on our doors 
2404_141242_000034_000008	train-clean-360	You accept and give hospitality without qualification 
2404_141242_000034_000009	train-clean-360	Whoever comes 
2404_141242_000034_000010	train-clean-360	Male female in groups or just traveling alone 
2404_141242_000035_000000	train-clean-360	 I get the drift 
2404_141242_000035_000001	train-clean-360	Life must be dull for a single girl on your iceberg planet 
none	none	She must surely have to stay home a lot
2404_141242_000036_000000	train-clean-360	 Only if she wants to 
2404_141242_000036_000001	train-clean-360	Otherwise she can go wherever she wishes and be welcomed as another individual 
none	none	I suppose it is out of fashion in the rest of the galaxy and would probably raise a big laugh on Earth but a platonic disinterested friendship between man and woman is an accepted thing on Anvhar Sounds exceedingly dull If you are all such cool and distant friends how do babies get made Brion felt his ears reddening not sure if he was being teased or not
2404_141242_000038_000001	train-clean-360	 The same damn way they get made any place else 
2404_141242_000038_000002	train-clean-360	But it s not just a reflexive process like a couple of rabbits that happen to meet under the same bush 
none	none	It s the woman s choice to indicate if she is interested in marriage Is marriage the only thing your women are interested in Marriage or anything else 
2404_141242_000040_000001	train-clean-360	That s up to the girl 
none	none	We have a special problem on Anvhar probably the same thing occurs on every planet where the human race has made a massive adaptation Not all unions are fertile and there is always a large percentage of miscarriages A large number of births are conceived by artificial insemination Which is all right when you can t have babies normally 
2404_141242_000040_000006	train-clean-360	But most women have an emotional bias towards having their husband s children 
none	none	And there is only one way to find out if this is possible Lea s eyes widened Are you suggesting that your girls see if a man can father children before considering marriage Of course Otherwise Anvhar would have been depopulated centuries ago 
2404_141242_000042_000002	train-clean-360	Therefore the woman does the choosing 
none	none	If she is interested in a man she says so If she is not interested the man would never think of suggesting anything 
2404_141242_000042_000005	train-clean-360	It s a lot different from other planets but so is our planet Anvhar 
2404_141242_000042_000006	train-clean-360	It works well for us which is the only test that applies 
none	none	Just about the opposite of Earth Lea told him dropping the apple core into a dish and carefully licking the tips of her fingers
2404_141242_000043_000001	train-clean-360	 I guess you Anvharians would describe Earth as a planetary hotbed of sexuality 
2404_141242_000043_000002	train-clean-360	The reverse of your system and going full blast all the time 
2404_141242_000043_000003	train-clean-360	There are far too many people there for comfort 
2404_141242_000043_000004	train-clean-360	Birth control came late and is still being fought if you can possibly imagine that 
none	none	There are just too many of the archaic religions still around as well as crackbrained ideas that have been long entrenched in custom 
2404_141242_000043_000006	train-clean-360	The world s overcrowded 
2404_141242_000043_000007	train-clean-360	Men women children a boiling mob wherever you look 
2404_141242_000043_000008	train-clean-360	And all of the physically mature ones seem to be involved in the Great Game of Love 
2404_141242_000043_000009	train-clean-360	The male is always the aggressor 
2404_141242_000043_000010	train-clean-360	Not physically at least not often and women take the most outrageous kinds of flattery for granted 
2404_141242_000043_000011	train-clean-360	At parties there are always a couple of hot breaths of passion fanning your neck 
2404_141242_000043_000012	train-clean-360	A girl has to keep her spike heels filed sharp 
none	none	She has to what
2404_141242_000045_000000	train-clean-360	 A figure of speech Brion 
2404_141242_000045_000001	train-clean-360	Meaning you fight back all the time if you don t want to be washed under by the flood 
none	none	Sounds rather Brion weighed the word before he said it but could find none other suitable repellent
2404_141242_000047_000000	train-clean-360	 From your point of view it would be 
none	none	I m afraid we get so used to it that we even take it for granted 
2404_141242_000047_000002	train-clean-360	Sociologically speaking She stopped and looked at Brion s straight back and almost rigid posture 
none	none	Her eyes widened and her mouth opened in an unspoken oh of sudden realization
2404_141242_000048_000000	train-clean-360	 I m being a fool she said 
2404_141242_000048_000001	train-clean-360	 You weren t speaking generally at all 
none	none	You had a very specific subject in mind Namely me Please Lea you must understand But I do She laughed
2404_141242_000050_000001	train-clean-360	 All the time I thought you were being a frigid and hard hearted lump of ice you were really being very sweet 
none	none	Just playing the game in good old Anvharian style 
2404_141242_000050_000003	train-clean-360	Waiting for a sign from me 
none	none	We d still be playing by different rules if you hadn t had more sense than I and finally realized that somewhere along the line we must have got our signals mixed 
2404_141242_000050_000005	train-clean-360	And I thought you were some kind of frosty offworld celibate She let her hand go out and her fingers rustled through his hair 
2404_141242_000050_000006	train-clean-360	Something she had been wanting to do for a long time 
none	none	I had to he said trying to ignore the light touch of her fingers
2404_141242_000051_000001	train-clean-360	 Because I thought so much of you I couldn t have done anything to insult you 
2404_141242_000051_000002	train-clean-360	Such as forcing my attentions on you 
none	none	Until I began to worry where the insult would lie since I knew nothing about your planet s mores Well you know now she said very softly The men aggress Now that I understand I think I like your way better 
2404_141242_000052_000003	train-clean-360	But I m still not sure of all the rules 
none	none	Do I explain that yes Brion I like you so very much You are more man in one great big wide shouldered lump than I have ever met before It s not quite the time or the place to discuss marriage but I would certainly like His arms were around her holding her to him Her hands clasped him and their lips sought each other s in the darkness
2404_141242_000054_000000	train-clean-360	 Gently she whispered 
none	none	I bruise easily XIII He wouldn t come in sir Just hammered on the door and said I m here tell Brandd Good enough Brion said fitting his gun in the holster and sliding the extra clips into his pocket I m going out now and I should return before dawn Get one of the wheeled stretchers down here from the hospital I ll want it waiting when I get back Outside the street was darker than he remembered Brion frowned and his hand moved towards his gun Someone had put all the nearby lights out of commission There was just enough illumination from the stars to enable him to make out the dark bulk of a sand car Brion Brandd a voice spoke harshly from the car Get in The motor roared as soon as he had closed the door Without lights the sand car churned a path through the city and out into the desert Though the speed picked up the driver still drove in the dark feeling his way with a light touch on the controls The ground rose and when they reached the top of a mesa he killed the engine Neither the driver nor Brion had spoken a word since they left A switch snapped and the instrument lights came on In their dim glow Brion could just make out the other man s hawklike profile When he moved Brion saw that his figure was cruelly shortened Either accident or a mutated gene had warped his spine hunching him forward in eternally bent supplication Warped bodies were rare his was the first Brion had ever seen He wondered what series of events had kept him from medical attention all his life This might explain the bitterness and pain in the man s voice Did the mighty brains on Nyjord bother to tell you that they have chopped another day off the deadline the man asked That this world is about to come to an end Yes I know Brion said That s why I m asking your group for help Our time is running out too fast The man didn t answer he merely grunted and gave his full attention to the radar pings and glowing screen The electronic senses reached out as he made a check on all the search frequencies to see if they were being followed Where are we going Brion asked Out into the desert The driver made a vague wave of his hand Headquarters of the army Since the whole thing will be blown up in another day I guess I can tell you it s the only camp we have All the cars men and weapons are based there And Hys He s the man in charge Tomorrow it will be all gone along with this cursed planet What s your business with us Shouldn t I be telling Hys that Suit yourself Satisfied with the instrument search the driver kicked the car to life again and churned on across the desert But we re a volunteer army and we have no secrets from each other Just from the fools at home who are going to kill this world There was a bitterness in his words that he made no attempt to conceal They fought among themselves and put off a firm decision so long that now they are forced to commit murder From what I had heard I thought that it was the other way around They call your Nyjord army terrorists We are Because we are an army and we re at war The idealists at home only understood that when it was too late If they had backed us in the beginning we would have blown open every black castle on Dis searched until we found those bombs But that would have meant wanton destruction and death They wouldn t consider that Now they are going to kill everyone destroy everything He flicked on the panel lights just long enough to take a compass bearing and Brion saw the tortured unhappiness in his twisted body It s not over yet Brion said There is more than a day left and I think I m onto something that might stop the war without any bombs being dropped You re in charge of the Cultural Relationships Free Bread and Blankets Foundation aren t you What good can your bunch do when the shooting starts None But maybe we can put off the shooting If you are trying to insult me don t bother My irritation quotient is very high The driver merely grunted at this slowing down as they ran through a field of broken rock What is it you want he asked We want to make a detailed examination of one of the magter Alive or dead it doesn t make any difference You wouldn t happen to have one around No We ve fought with them often enough but always on their home grounds They keep all their casualties and a good number of ours What good will it do you anyway A dead one won t tell you where the bombs or the jump space projector is I don t see why I should explain that to you unless you are in charge You are Hys aren t you The driver gave an angry sound and then was silent while he drove Finally he asked What makes you think that Call it a hunch You don t act very much like a sand car driver for one thing Of course your army may be all generals and no privates but I doubt it I also know that time has almost run out for all of us This is a long ride and it would be a complete waste of time if you just sat out in the desert and waited for me By driving me yourself you could make your mind up before we arrived Could have a decision ready as to whether you are going to help me or not Are you Yes I m Hys But you still haven t answered my question What do you want the body for We re going to cut it open and take a good long look I don t think the magter are human They are something living among men and disguised as men but still not human Secret aliens Hys exploded the words in a mixture of surprise and disgust Perhaps The examination will tell us that You re either stupid or incompetent Hys said bitterly The heat of Dis has cooked your brains in your head I ll be no part of this kind of absurd plan You must Brion said surprised at his own calmness He could sense the other man s interest hidden behind his insulting manner I don t even have to give you my reasons In another day this world ends and you have no way to stop it I just might have an idea that could work and you can t afford to take any chances not if you are really sincere Either you are a murderer killing Disans for pleasure or you honestly want to stop the war Which is it You ll have your body all right Hys grated hurling the car viciously around a spire of rock Not that it will accomplish anything but I can find no fault with killing another magter We can fit your operation into our plans without any trouble This is the last night and I have sent every one of my teams out on raids We re breaking into as many magter towers as possible before dawn There is a slim chance that we might uncover something It s really just shooting in the dark but it s all we can do now My own team is waiting and you can ride along with us The others left earlier We re going to hit a small tower on this side of the city We raided it once before and captured a lot of small arms they had stored there There is a good chance that they may have been stupid enough to store something there again Sometimes the magter seem to suffer from a complete lack of imagination You have no idea just how right you are Brion told him The sand car slowed down now as they approached a slab sided mesa that rose vertically from the desert They crunched across broken rocks leaving no tracks A light blinked on the dashboard and Hys stopped instantly and killed the engine They climbed out stretching and shivering in the cold desert night It was dark walking in the shadow of the cliff and they had to feel their way along a path through the tumbled boulders A sudden blaze of light made Brion wince and shield his eyes Near him on the ground was the humming shape of a cancellation projector sending out a fan shaped curtain of vibration that absorbed all the light rays falling upon it This incredible blackness made a lightproof wall for the recessed hollow at the foot of the cliff In this shelter under the overhang of rock were three open sand cars They were large and armor plated warlike in their scarred grey paint Men sprawled talked and polished their weapons Everything stopped when Hys and Brion appeared Load up Hys called out We re going to attack now same plan I outlined earlier Get Telt over here In talking to his own men some of the harshness was gone from his voice The tall soldiers of Nyjord moved in ready obeyance of their commander They loomed over his bent figure most of them twice as tall as he but there was no hesitation in jumping when he commanded They were the body of the Nyjord striking force he was the brains A square cut compact man rolled up to Hys and saluted with a leisurely flick of his hand He was weighted and slung about with packs and electronic instruments His pockets bulged with small tools and spare parts This is Telt Hys said to Brion He ll take care of you Telt s my personal technical squad He goes along on all my operations with his meters to test the interiors of the Disan forts So far he s found no trace of a jump space generator or excess radioactivity that might indicate a bomb Since he s useless and you re useless you both take care of each other Use the car we came in Telt s wide face split in a froglike grin his voice was hoarse and throaty Wait Just wait Someday those needles gonna flicker and all our troubles be over What you want me to do with the stranger Supply him with a corpse one of the magter Hys said Take it wherever he wants and then report back here Hys scowled at Telt Someday your needles will flicker Poor fool this is the last day He turned away and waved the men into their sand cars He likes me Telt said attaching a final piece of equipment You can tell because he calls me names like that He s a great man Hys is but they never found out until it was too late Hand me that meter will you Brion followed the technician out to the car and helped him load his equipment aboard When the larger cars appeared out of the darkness Telt swung around after them They snaked forward in a single line through the rocks until they came to the desert of rolling sand dunes Then they spread out in line abreast and rushed towards their goal Telt hummed to himself hoarsely as he drove He broke off suddenly and looked at Brion What you want the dead Dis for A theory Brion answered sluggishly He had been half napping in the chair taking the opportunity for some rest before the attack I m still looking for a way to avert the end You and Hys Telt said with satisfaction Couple of idealists Trying to stop a war you didn t start They never would listen to Hys He told them in the beginning exactly what would happen and he was right They always thought his ideas were crooked like him Growing up alone in the hill camp with his back too twisted and too old to be fixed when he finally did come out Ideas twisted the same way Made himself an authority on war Hah War on Nyjord that s like being an ice cube specialist in hell But he knew all about it though they never would let him use what he knew Put granddaddy Krafft in charge instead But Hys is in charge of an army now All volunteers too few of them and too little money Too little and too damned late to do any good I ll tell you we did our best but it could never be good enough And for this we get called butchers There was a catch in Telt s voice now an undercurrent of emotion he couldn t suppress At home they think we like to kill Think we re insane They can t understand we re doing the only thing that has to be done He broke off as he quickly locked on the brakes and killed the engine The line of sand cars had come to a stop Ahead just visible over the dunes was the summit of a dark tower We walk from here Telt said standing and stretching We can take our time because the other boys go in first soften things up Then you and I head for the sub cellar for a radiation check and find you a handsome corpse Walking at first then crawling when the dunes no longer shielded them they crept up on the Disan keep Dark figures moved ahead of them stopping only when they reached the crumbling black walls They didn t use the ascending ramp but made their way up the sheer outside face of the ramparts Line throwers Telt whispered Anchor themselves when the missile hits have some kind of quick setting goo Then we go up the filament with a line climbing motor Hys invented them Is that the way you and I are going in Brion asked No we get out of the climbing I told you we hit this rock once before I know the layout inside He was moving while he talked carefully pacing the distance around the base of the tower Should be right about here High pitched keening sliced the air and the top of the magter building burst into flame Automatic weapons hammered above them Something fell silently through the night and hit heavily on the ground near them Attack s started Telt shouted We have to get through now while all the creepies are fighting it out on top He pulled a plate shaped object from one of his bags and slapped it hard against the wall It hung there He twisted the back of it pulled something and waved Brion to the ground Shaped charge Should blow straight in but you never can tell The ground jumped under them and the ringing thud was a giant fist punching through the wall A cloud of dust and smoke rolled clear and they could see the dark opening in the rock a tunnel driven into the wall by the directional force of the explosion Telt shone a light through the hole at the crumbled chamber inside Nothing to worry about from anybody who was leaning against this wall But let s get in and out of this black beehive before the ones upstairs come down to investigate Shattered rock was thick on the floor and they skidded and tumbled over it Telt pointed the way with his light down a sharply angled ramp Underground chambers in the rock They always store their stuff down there A smoking black sphere arced out of the tunnel s mouth hitting at their feet Telt just gaped but even as it hit the floor Brion was jumping forward He caught it with the side of his foot kicking it back into the dark opening of the tunnel Telt hit the ground next to him as the orange flame of an explosion burst below Bits of shrapnel rattled from the ceiling and wall behind them Grenades Telt gasped They ve only used them once before can t have many Gotta warn Hys He plugged a throat mike into the transmitter on his tack and spoke quickly into it There was a stirring below and Brion poured a rain of fire into the tunnel They re catching it bad on top too We gotta pull out Go first and I ll cover you I came for my Disan I m not leaving until I get one You re crazy You re dead if you stay Telt was scrambling back towards the crumbled entrance as he talked His back was turned when Brion fired The magter had appeared silently as the shadow of death They charged without a sound running with expressionless faces into the bullets Two died at once curling and folding the third one fell at Brion s feet Shot pierced dying but not yet dead Leaving a crimson track it hunched closer lifting its knife to Brion He didn t move How many times must you murder a man Or was it a man His mind and body rebelled against the killing and he was almost ready to accept death himself rather than kill again Telt s bullets tore through the body and it dropped with grim finality There s your corpse now get it out of here Telt screeched Between them they worked the sodden weight of the dead magter through the hole their exposed backs crawling with the expectation of instant death No further attack came as they ran from the tower other than a grenade that exploded too far behind them to do any harm One of the armored sand cars circled the keep headlights blazing keeping up a steady fire from its heavy weapons The attackers climbed into it as they beat a retreat Telt and Brion dragged the Disan behind them struggling through the loose sand towards the circling car Telt glanced over his shoulder and broke into a shambling run They re following us he gasped The first time they ever chased us after a raid They must know we have the body Brion said Leave it behind Telt choked Too heavy to carry anyway I d rather leave you Brion said sharply Let me have it He pulled the corpse away from the unresisting Telt and heaved it across his own shoulders Now use your gun to cover us Telt threw a rain of slugs back towards the dark figures following them The driver of the sand car must have seen the flare of their fire because the truck turned and started towards them It braked in a choking cloud of dust and ready hands reached to pull them up Brion pushed the body in ahead of himself and scrambled after it The truck engine throbbed and they churned away into the blackness away from the gutted tower You know that was more like kind of a joke when I said I d leave the corpse behind Telt told Brion You didn t believe me did you Yes Brion said holding the dead weight of the magter against the truck s side I thought you meant it Ahhh Telt protested you re as bad as Hys You take things too seriously Brion suddenly realized that he was wet with blood his clothing sodden His stomach rose at the thought and he clutched the edge of the sand car Killing like this was too personal Talking abstractedly about a body was one thing but murdering a man then lifting his dead flesh and feeling his blood warm upon you is an entirely different matter But the magter weren t human he knew that The thought was only mildly comforting After they had reached the other waiting sand cars the raiding party split up Each one goes in a different direction Telt said so they can t track us to the base He clipped a piece of paper next to the compass and kicked the motor into life We ll make a big U in the desert and end up in Hovedstad I got the course here Then I ll dump you and your friends and beat it back to our camp You re not still burned at me for what I said are you Are you Brion didn t answer He was staring fixedly out of the side window What s doing Telt asked Brion pointed out at the rushing darkness Over there he said pointing to the growing light on the horizon Dawn Telt said Lotta rain on your planet Didn t you ever see the sun come up before Not on the last day of a world Lock it up Telt grumbled You give me the crawls I know they re going to be blasted But at least I know I did everything I could to stop it How do you think they are going to be feeling at home on Nyjord from tomorrow on Maybe we can still stop it Brion said shrugging off the feeling of gloom Telt s only answer was a wordless sound of disgust By the time they had cut a large loop in the desert the sun was well up in the sky the daily heat begun Their course took them through a chain of low flinty hills that cut their speed almost to zero They ground ahead in low gear while Telt sweated and cursed struggling with the controls Then they were on firm sand and picking up speed towards the city As soon as Brion saw Hovedstad clearly he felt a clutch of fear From somewhere in the city a black plume of smoke was rising It could have been one of the deserted buildings aflame a minor blaze Yet the closer they came the greater his tension grew Brion didn t dare put it into words himself it was Telt who vocalized the thought A fire or something Coming from your area somewhere close to your building Within the city they saw the first signs of destruction Broken rubble on the streets The smell of greasy smoke in their nostrils More and more people appeared going in the same direction they were The normally deserted streets of Hovedstad were now almost crowded Disans obvious by their bare shoulders mixed with the few offworlders who still remained Brion made sure the tarpaulin was well wrapped around the body before they pushed the sand car slowly through the growing crowd I don t like all this publicity Telt complained looking at the people It s the last day or I d be turning back They know our cars we ve raided them often enough Turning a corner he braked suddenly mouth agape Ahead was destruction Black broken rubble had been churned into desolation It was still smoking pink tongues of flame licking over the ruins A fragment of wall fell with a rumbling crash It s your building the Foundation building Telt shouted They ve been here ahead of us must have used the radio to call a raid They did a job explosive of some kind Hope was dead Dis was dead In the ruin ahead mixed and broken with other rubble were the bodies of all the people who had trusted him Lea beautiful and cruelly dead Lea Doctor Stine his patients Faussel all of them He had kept them on this planet and now they were dead Every one of them Dead Murderer XIV Life was ended Brion s mind contained nothing but despair and the pain of irretrievable loss If his brain had been completely the master of his body he would have died there for at that moment there was no will to live Unaware of this his heart continued to beat and the regular motion of his lungs drew in the dreadful sweetness of the smoke tainted air With automatic directness his body lived on What you gonna do Telt asked even his natural exuberation stilled by this Brion only shook his head as the words penetrated What could he do What could possibly be done Follow me a voice said in guttural Disan through the opening of a rear window The speaker was lost in the crowd before they could turn Aware now Brion saw a native move away from the edge of the crowd and turn to look in their direction It was Ulv Turn the car that way He punched Telt s arm and pointed Do it slowly and don t draw any attention to us For a moment there was hope which he kept himself from considering The building was gone and the people in it all dead That fact had to be faced What s going on Telt asked Who was that talked in the window A native that one up ahead He saved my life in the desert and I think he is on our side Even though he s a native Disan he can understand facts that the magter can t He knows what will happen to this planet Brion was talking to fill his brain with words so he wouldn t begin to have hope There was no hope possible Ulv moved slowly and naturally through the streets never looking back They followed as far behind as they dared yet still keeping him in sight Fewer people were about here among the deserted offworld storehouses Ulv vanished into one of these LIGHT METALS TRUST limited the sign read above the door Telt slowed the car Don t stop here Brion said Drive around the corner and pull up Brion climbed out of the car with an ease he did not feel No one was in sight now in either direction Walking slowly back to the corner he checked the street they had just left Hot silent and empty A sudden blackness appeared where the door of the warehouse had been and the sudden flickering motion of a hand Brion signaled Telt to start and jumped into the already moving sand car Into that open door quickly before anyone sees us The car rumbled down a ramp into the dark interior and the door slid shut behind them Ulv What is it Where are you Brion called blinking in the murky interior A grey form appeared beside him I am here Did you There was no way to finish the sentence I heard of the raid The magter called together all of us they could to help them carry explosive I went along I could not stop them and there was no time to warn anyone in the building Then they are all dead Yes Ulv nodded All except one I knew I could perhaps save one I was not sure who So I took the woman you were with in the desert she is here now She was hurt but not badly when I brought her out Guilty relief flooded through Brion He shouldn t exult not with the death of everyone in the Foundation still fresh in his mind But at that instant he was happy Let me see her he said to Ulv He was seized by the sudden fear that there might be a mistake Perhaps Ulv had saved a different woman Ulv led the way across the empty loading bay Brion followed closely fighting down the temptation to tell him to hurry When he saw that Ulv was heading towards an office in the far wall he could control himself no longer and ran on ahead It was Lea lying unconscious on a couch Sweat beaded her face and she moaned and stirred without opening her eyes I gave her sover then wrapped her in cloth so no one would know Ulv said Telt was close behind them looking in through the open door Sover is a drug they take from one of their plants he said We got a lot of experience with it A little makes a good knock out drug but it s deadly poison in large doses I got the antidote in the car wait and I ll get it He went out Brion sat next to Lea and wiped her face clean of dirt and perspiration The dark shadows under her eyes were almost black now and her elfin face seemed even thinner But she was alive that was the important thing Some of the tension drained away from Brion and he could think again There was still the job to do After this last experience Lea should be in a hospital bed But this was impossible He would have to drag her to her feet and put her back to work The answer might still be found Each second ticked away another fraction of the planet s life Good as new in a minute Telt said banging down the heavy med box He watched intently as Ulv left the room Hys should know about this renegade Might be useful as a spy or for information though of course it s too late now to do anything so the hell with it He pulled a pistol shaped hypodermic gun from the box and dialed a number on the side Now if you ll roll her sleeve up I ll bring her back to life He pressed the bell shaped sterilizing muzzle against her skin and pulled the trigger The hypo gun hummed briefly ending its cycle with a loud click Does it work fast Brion asked Couple of minutes Just let her be and she ll come to by herself Ulv was in the doorway Killer he hissed His blowgun was in his hand half raised to his mouth He s been in the car he s seen it Telt shouted and grabbed for his gun Brion sprang between them raising his hands Stop it No more killing he shouted in Disan Then he shook his fist at Telt Fire that gun and I ll stuff it down your throat I ll handle this He turned to face Ulv who hadn t brought the blowgun any closer to his lips This was a good sign the Disan was still uncertain You have seen the body in the car Ulv So you must have seen that it is that of a magter I killed him myself because I would rather kill one or ten or even a hundred men than have everyone on this planet destroyed I killed him in a fair fight and now I am going to examine his body There is something very strange and different about the magter you know that yourself If I can find out what it is perhaps we can make them stop this war and not bomb Nyjord Ulv was still angry but he lowered the blowgun a little I wish there were no offworlders he said I wish that none of you had ever come Nothing was wrong until you started coming The magter were the strongest and they killed but they also helped Now they want to fight a war with your weapons and for this you are going to kill my world And you want me to help you Not me yourself Brion said wearily There s no going back that s the one thing we can t do Maybe Dis would have been better off without offplanet contact Maybe not In any case you have to forget about that You have contact now with the rest of the galaxy for better or for worse You ve got a problem to solve and I m here to help you solve it Seconds ticked by as Ulv unmoving fought with questions that were novel to his life Could killing stop death Could he help his people by helping strangers to fight and kill them His world had changed and he didn t like it He must make a giant effort to change with it Abruptly he pushed the blowgun into a thong at his waist turned and strode out Too much for my nerves Telt said settling his gun back in the holster You don t know how happy I m gonna be when this whole damn thing is over Even if the planet goes bang I don t care I m finished He walked out to the sand car keeping a careful eye on the Disan crouched against the wall Brion turned back to Lea whose eyes were open staring at the ceiling He went to her Running she said and her voice had a toneless emptiness that screamed louder than any emotion They ran by the open door of my room and I could see them when they killed doctor Stine Just butchered him like an animal chopping him down Then one came into the room and that s all I remember She turned her head slowly and looked at Brion What happened Why am I here They re dead he told her All of them After the raid the Disans blew up the building You re the only one that survived That was Ulv who came into your room the Disan we met in the desert He brought you away and hid you here in the city When do we leave she asked in the same empty tones turning her face to the wall When do we get off this planet Today is the last day The deadline is midnight Krafft will have a ship pick us up when we are ready But we still have our job to do I ve got that body You re going to have to examine it We must find out about the magter Nothing can be done now except leave Her voice was a dull monotone There is only so much that a person can do and I ve done it Please have the ship come I want to leave now Brion bit his lip in helpless frustration Nothing seemed to penetrate the apathy into which she had sunk Too much shock too much terror in too short a time He took her chin in his hand and turned her head to face him She didn t resist but her eyes were shining with tears tears trickled down her cheeks Take me home Brion please take me home He could only brush her sodden hair back from her face and force himself to smile at her The moments of time were running out faster and faster and he no longer knew what to do The examination had to be made yet he couldn t force her He looked for the med box and saw that Telt had taken it back to the sand car There might be something in it that could help a tranquilizer perhaps Telt had some of his instruments open on the chart table and was examining a tape with a pocket magnifier when Brion entered He jumped nervously and put the tape behind his back then relaxed when he saw who it was I thought you were the creepie out there coming for a look he whispered Maybe you trust him but I can t afford to Can t even use the radio I m getting out of here now I have to tell Hys Tell him what Brion asked sharply What is all the mystery about Telt handed him the magnifier and tape Look at that recording tape from my scintillation counter Red verticals are five minute intervals the wiggly black horizontal line is the radioactivity level All this where the line goes up and down that s when we were driving out to the attack Varying hot level of the rock and ground What s the big peak in the middle That coincides exactly with our visit to the house of horrors When we went through the hole in the bottom of the tower He couldn t keep the excitement out of his voice Does it mean that I don t know I m not sure I have to compare it with the other tapes back at base It could be the stone of the tower some of these heavy rocks have got a high natural count There maybe could be a box of instruments there with fluorescent dials Or it might be one of those tactical atom bombs they threw at us already Some arms runner sold them a few Or it could be the cobalt bombs It could be Telt said packing his instruments swiftly A badly shielded bomb or an old one with a crack in the skin could give a trace like that Just a little radon leaking out would do it Why don t you call Hys on the radio and let him know I don t want Granddaddy Krafft s listening posts to hear about it This is our job if I m right And I have to check my old tapes to make sure But it s gonna be worth a raid I can feel that in my bones Let s unload your corpse He helped Brion with the clumsy wrapped bundle then slipped into the driver s seat Hold it Brion said Do you have anything in the med box I can use for Lea She seems to have cracked Not hysterical but withdrawn Won t listen to reason won t do anything but lie there and ask to go home Got the potion here Telt said cracking the med box Slaughter syndrome is what our medic calls it Hit a lot of our boys Grow up all your life hating the idea of violence and it goes rough when you have to start killing people Guys break up break down go to pieces lots of different ways The medic mixed up this stuff Don t know how it works probably tranquilizers and some of the cortex drugs But it peels off recent memories Maybe for the last ten twelve hours You can t get upset about what you don t remember He pulled out a sealed package Directions on the box Good luck Luck Brion said and shook the technician s calloused hand Let me know if the traces are strong enough to be bombs He checked the street to make sure it was clear then pressed the door button The sand car churned out into the brilliant sunshine and was gone the throb of its motor dying in the distance Brion closed the door and went back to Lea Ulv was still crouched against the wall There was a one shot disposable hypodermic in the box Lea made no protest when he broke the seal and pressed the needle against her arm She sighed and her eyes closed again When he saw she was resting easily he dragged in the tarpaulin wrapped body of the magter A work bench ran along one wall and he struggled the corpse up onto it He unwrapped the tarpaulin and the sightless eyes stared accusingly up into his Using his knife Brion cut away the loose blood soaked clothing Strapped under the clothes around the man s waist was the familiar collection of Disan artifacts This could have significance either way Human or humanoid the creature would still have to live on Dis Brion threw it aside along with the clothing Nude pierced bloody the corpse lay before him In every external physical detail the man was human Brion s theory was becoming more preposterous with each discovery If the magter weren t alien how could he explain their complete lack of emotions A mutation of some kind He didn t see how it was possible There had to be something alien about the dead man before him The future of a world rested on this flimsy hope If Telt s lead to the bombs proved to be false there would be no hope left at all Lea was still unconscious when he looked at her again There was no way of telling how long the coma would last He would probably have to waken her out of it but he didn t want to do it too early It took an effort to control his impatience even though he knew the drug needed time in which to work He finally decided on at least a minimum of an hour before he should try to disturb her That would be noon twelve hours before destruction One thing he should do was to get in touch with Professor Commander Krafft Maybe it was being defeatist but he had to make sure that they had a way off this planet if the mission failed Krafft had installed a relay radio that would forward calls from his personal set If this relay had been in the Foundation building contact was broken This had to be found out before it was too late Brion thumbed on his radio and sent the call The reply came back instantly This is fleet communications Will you please keep this circuit open Commander Krafft is waiting for this call and it is being put directly through to him now Krafft s voice broke in while the operator was still talking Who is making this call is it anyone from the Foundation The old man s voice was shaky with emotion Brandd here I have Lea Morees with me No more Are there no other survivors from the disaster that destroyed your building That s it other than us it s a complete loss With the building and all the instruments gone I have no way to contact our ship in orbit Can you arrange to get us out of here if necessary Give me your location A ship is coming now I don t need a ship now Brion interrupted Don t send it until I call If there is a way to stop your destruction I ll find it So I m staying to the last minute if necessary Krafft was silent There was only the crackle of an open mike and the sound of breathing That is your decision he said finally I ll have a ship standing by But won t you let us take Miss Morees out now No I need her here We are still working looking for What answer can you find that could possibly avert destruction now His tone was between hope and despair Brion couldn t help him If I succeed you ll know Otherwise that will be the end of it End of Transmission He switched the radio off Lea was sleeping easily when he looked at her and there was still a good part of the hour left before he could wake her How could he put it to use She would need tools instruments to examine the corpse and there were certainly none here Perhaps he could find some in the ruins of the Foundation building With this thought he had the sudden desire to see the wreckage up close There might be other survivors He had to find out If he could talk to the men he had seen working there Ulv was still crouched against the wall in the outer room He looked up angrily when Brion came over but said nothing Will you help me again Brion asked Stay and watch the girl while I go out I ll be back at noon Ulv didn t answer I am still looking for the way to save Dis Brion added Go I ll watch the girl Ulv spat words in impotent fury I do not know what to do You may be right Go She will be safe with me Brion slipped out into the deserted street and half running half walking made his way towards the rubble that had been the Cultural Relationships Foundation He used a different course from the one they had come by striking first towards the outer edge of the city Once there he could swing and approach from the other side so there would be no indication where he had come from The magter might be watching and he didn t want to lead them to Lea and the stolen body Turning a corner he saw a sand car stopped in the street ahead There was something familiar about the lines of it It could be the one he and Telt had used but he wasn t sure He looked around but the dusty packed dirt street was white and empty shimmering in silence under the sun Staying close to the wall and watching carefully Brion slipped towards the car When he came close behind it he was positive it was the one he had been in the night before What was it doing here Silence and heat filled the street Windows and doors were empty and there was no motion in their shadows Putting his foot on a bogey wheel he reached up and grabbed the searing metal rim of the open window He pulled himself up and stared at Telt s smiling face Smiling in death The lips pulled back to reveal the grinning teeth the eyes bursting from the head the features swollen and contorted from the deadly poison A tiny tufted dart of wood stuck in the brown flesh on the side of his neck XV Brion hurled himself backward and sprawled flat in the dust and filth of the road No poison dart sought him out the empty silence still reigned Telt s murderers had come and gone Moving quickly using the bulk of the car as a shield he opened the door and slipped inside They had done a thorough job of destruction All of the controls had been battered into uselessness the floor was a junk heap of crushed equipment intertwined with loops of recording tape bulging like mechanical intestines A gutted machine destroyed like its driver It was easy enough to reconstruct what had happened The car had been seen when they entered the city probably by some of the magter who had destroyed the Foundation building They had not seen where it had gone or Brion would surely be dead by now But they must have spotted it when Telt tried to leave the city and stopped it in the most effective way possible a dart through the open window into the unsuspecting driver s neck Telt dead The brutal impact of the man s death had driven all thought of its consequences from Brion s mind Now he began to realize Telt had never sent word of his discovery of the radioactive trace to the Nyjord army He had been afraid to use the radio and had wanted to tell Hys in person and to show him the tape Only now the tape was torn and mixed with all the others the brain that could have analyzed it dead Brion looked at the dangling entrails of the radio and spun for the door Running swiftly and erratically he fled from the sand car His own survival and the possible survival of Dis depended on his not being seen near it He must contact Hys and pass on the information Until he did that he was the only offworlder on Dis who knew which magter tower might contain the world destroying bombs Once out of sight of the sand car he went more slowly wiping the sweat from his streaming face He hadn t been seen leaving the car and he wasn t being followed The streets here weren t familiar but he checked his direction by the sun and walked at a steady fast pace towards the destroyed building More of the native Disans were in the streets now They all noticed him some even stopped and scowled fiercely at him With his emphatic awareness he felt their anger and hatred A knot of men radiated death and he put his hand on his gun as he passed them Two of them had their blowguns ready but didn t use them By the time he had turned the next corner he was soaked with nervous perspiration Ahead was the rubble of the destroyed building Grounded next to it was the tapered form of a spacer s pinnace Two men had come from the open lock and were standing at the edge of the burnt area Brion s boots grated loudly on the broken wreckage The men turned quickly towards him guns raised Both of them carried ion rifles They relaxed when they saw his offworld clothes Bloody damned savages one of them growled He was a heavy planet man a squashed down column of muscle and gristle whose head barely reached Brion s chest A pushed back cap had the crossed slide rule symbol of ship s computer man Can t blame them I guess the second man said He wore purser s insignia His features were different but with the same compacted body the two men were as physically alike as twins Probably from the same home planet They re gonna get their whole world blown out from under them at midnight Looks as if the poor slob in the streets finally realized what is happening Hope we re in jump space by then I saw Estrada s World get it and I don t want to see that again not twice in one lifetime The computer man was looking closely at Brion head tilted sideways to see his face You need transportation offworld he asked We re the last ship at the port and we re going to boil out of here as soon as the rest of our cargo is aboard We ll give you a lift if you need it Only by a tremendous effort at control did Brion conceal the destroying sorrow that overwhelmed him when he looked at that shattered wasteland the graveyard of so many No he said That won t be necessary I m in touch with the blockading fleet and they ll pick me up before midnight You from Nyjord the purser growled No Brion said still only half aware of the men But there is trouble with my own ship He realized that they were looking intently at him that he owed them some kind of explanation I thought I could find a way to stop the war Now I m not so sure He hadn t intended to be so frank with the spacemen but the words had been uppermost in his thoughts and had simply slipped out The computer man started to say something but his shipmate speared him in the side with his elbow We blast soon and I don t like the way these Disans are looking at us The captain said to find out what caused the fire then get the hell back So
2194_141248_000021_000000	train-clean-360	 let s go 
none	none	Don t miss your ship the computer man said to Brion and he started for the pinnace Then he hesitated and turned Sure there s nothing we can do for you Sorrow would accomplish nothing Brion fought to sweep the dregs of emotion from his mind and to think clearly You can help me he said I could use a scalpel or any other surgical instrument you might have Lea would need those Then he remembered Telt s undelivered message Do you have a portable radio transceiver I can pay you for it The computer man vanished inside the rocket and reappeared a minute later with a small package There s a scalpel and a magnetized tweezers in here all I could find in the med kit Hope they ll do He reached inside and swung out the metal case of a self contained transceiver Take this it s got plenty of range even on the longer frequencies He raised his hand at Brion s offer to pay My donation he said If you can save this planet I ll give you the whole pinnace as well We ll tell the captain we lost the radio in some trouble with the natives Isn t that right Moneybags He prodded the purser in the chest with a finger that would have punched a hole through a weaker man I read you loud and clear the purser said I ll make out an invoice so stating back in the ship They were both in the pinnace then and Brion had to move fast to get clear of the takeoff blast A sense of obligation the spacemen had felt it too The realization of this raised Brion s spirits a bit as he searched through the rubble for anything useful He recognized part of a wall still standing as a corner of the laboratory Poking through the ruins he unearthed broken instruments and a single battered case that had barely missed destruction Inside was the binocular microscope the right tube bent its lenses cracked and obscured The left eyepiece still seemed to be functioning Brion carefully put it back in the case He looked at his watch It was almost noon These few pieces of equipment would have to do for the dissection Watched suspiciously by the onlooking Disans he started back to the warehouse It was a long circuitous walk since he didn t dare give any clues to his destination Only when he was positive he had not been observed or followed did he slip through the building s entrance locking the door behind him Lea s frightened eyes met his when he went into the office A friendly smile here among the cannibals she called Her strained expression gave the lie to the cheeriness of her words What has happened Since I woke up the great stone face over there she pointed to Ulv has been telling me exactly nothing What s the last thing you can remember Brion asked carefully He didn t want to tell her too much lest this bring on the shock again Ulv had shown great presence of mind in not talking to her If you must know Lea said I remember quite a lot Brion Brandd I shan t go into details since this sort of thing is best kept from the natives For the record then I can recall going to sleep after you left And nothing since then It s weird I went to sleep in that lumpy hospital bed and woke up on this couch feeling simply terrible With him just sitting there and scowling at me Won t you please tell me what is going on A partial truth was best saving all of the details that he could for later The magter attacked the Foundation building he said They are getting angry at all offworlders now You were still knocked out by a sleeping drug so Ulv helped bring you here It s afternoon now Of the last day She sounded horrified While I m playing Sleeping Beauty the world is coming to an end Was anyone hurt in the attack Or killed There were a number of casualties and plenty of trouble Brion said He had to get her off the subject Walking over to the corpse he threw back the cover from its face But this is more important right now It s one of the magter I have a scalpel and some other things here will you perform an autopsy Lea huddled back on the couch her arms around herself looking chilled in spite of the heat of the day What happened to the people at the building she asked in a thin voice The injection had removed her memories of the tragedy but echoes of the strain and shock still reverberated in her mind and body I feel so exhausted Please tell me what happened I have the feeling you re hiding something Brion sat next to her and took her hands in his not surprised to find them cold Looking into her eyes he tried to give her some of his strength It wasn t very nice he said You were shaken up by it I imagine that s why you feel the way you do now But Lea you ll have to take my word for this Don t ask any more questions There s nothing we can do now about it But we can still find out about the magter Will you examine the corpse She started to ask something then changed her mind When she dropped her eyes Brion felt the thin shiver that went through her body There s something terribly wrong she said I know that I guess I ll have to take your word that it s best not to ask questions Help me up will you darling My legs are absolutely liquid Leaning on him with his arm around her supporting most of her weight she went slowly across to the corpse She looked down and shuddered Not what you would call a natural death she said Ulv watched intently as she took the scalpel out of its holder You don t have to look at this she told him in halting Disan Not if you don t want to I want to he told her not taking his eyes from the body I have never seen a magter dead before or without covering like an ordinary person He continued to stare fixedly Find me some drinking water will you Brion Lea said And spread the tarp under the body These things are quite messy After drinking the water she seemed stronger and could stand without holding onto the table with both hands Placing the tip of the scalpel just below the magter s breast bone she made the long post mortem incision down to the pubic symphysis The great body length wound gaped open like a red mouth Across the table Ulv shuddered but didn t avert his eyes One by one she removed the internal organs Once she looked up at Brion then quickly returned to work The silence stretched on and on until Brion had to break it Tell me can t you Have you found out anything His words snapped the thin strand of her strength and she staggered back to the couch and collapsed onto it Her bloodstained hands hung over the side making a strangely terrible contrast to the whiteness of her skin I m sorry Brion she said But there s nothing nothing at all There are minor differences organic changes I ve never seen before his liver is tremendous for one thing But changes like this are certainly consistent within the pattern of homo sapiens as adapted to a different planet He s a man Changed adapted modified but still just as human as you or I How can you be sure Brion broke in You haven t examined him completely have you She shook her head Then go on The other organs His brain A microscopic examination Here he said pushing the microscope case towards her with both hands She dropped her head onto her forearms and sobbed Leave me alone can t you I m tired and sick and fed up with this awful planet Let them die I don t care Your theory is false useless Admit that And let me wash the filth from my hands Sobbing drowned out her words Brion stood over her and drew a shuddering breath Was he wrong He didn t dare think about that He had to go on Looking down at the thinness of her bent back with the tiny projections of her spine showing through the thin cloth he felt an immense pity a pity he couldn t surrender to This thin helpless frightened woman was his only resource She had to work He had to make her work Ihjel had done it used projective empathy to impress his emotions upon Brion Now Brion must do it with Lea He had had some sessions in the art but not nearly enough to make him proficient Nevertheless he had to try Strength was what Lea needed Aloud he said simply You can do it You have the will and the strength to finish And silently his mind cried out the order to obey to share his power now that hers was drained and finished Only when she lifted her face and he saw the dried tears did he realize that he had succeeded You will go on he asked quietly Lea merely nodded and rose to her feet She shuffled like a sleepwalker jerked along by invisible strings Her strength wasn t her own and the situation reminded him unhappily of that last event of the Twenties when he had experienced the same kind of draining activity She wiped her hands roughly on her clothes and opened the microscope case The slides are all broken she said This will do Brion told her crashing his heel through the glass partition Shards tinkled and crashed to the floor He took some of the bigger pieces and broke them to rough squares that would fit under the clips on the stage Lea accepted them without a word Putting a drop of the magter s blood on the slide she bent over the eyepiece Her hands shook when she tried to adjust the focusing Using low power she examined the specimen squinting through the angled tube Once she turned the sub stage mirror a bit to catch the light streaming in the window Brion stood behind her fists clenched forceably controlling his anxiety What do you see he finally blurted out Phagocytes platelets leucocytes everything seems normal Her voice was dull exhausted her eyes blinking with fatigue as she stared into the tube Anger at defeat burned through Brion Even faced with failure he refused to accept it He reached over her shoulder and savagely twisted the turret of microscope until the longest lens was in position If you can t see anything try the high power It s there I know it s there I ll get you a tissue specimen He turned back to the disemboweled cadaver His back was turned and he did not see that sudden stiffening of her shoulders or the sudden eagerness that seized her fingers as they adjusted the focus But he did feel the wave of emotion that welled from her impinging directly on his empathetic sense What is it he called to her as if she had spoken aloud Something something here she said in this leucocyte It s not normal structure but it s familiar I ve seen something like it before but I just can t remember She turned away from the microscope and unthinkingly pressed her gory knuckles to her forehead I know I ve seen it before Brion squinted into the deserted microscope and made out a dim shape in the center of the field It stood out sharply when he focused the white jellyfish shape of a single celled leucocyte To his untrained eye there was nothing unusual about it He couldn t know what was strange when he had no idea of what was normal Do you see those spherical green shapes grouped together Lea asked Before Brion could answer she gasped I remember now Her fatigue was forgotten in her excitement Icerya purchasi that was the name something like that It s a coccid a little scale insect It had those same shapes collected together within its individual cells What do they mean What is the connection with Dis I don t know she said it s just that they look so similar And I never saw anything like this in a human cell before In the coccids the green particles grow into a kind of yeast that lives within the insect Not a parasite but a real symbiote Her eyes opened wide as she caught the significance of her own words A symbiote and Dis was the world where symbiosis and parasitism had become more advanced and complex than on any other planet Lea s thoughts spun around this fact and chewed at the fringes of the logic Brion could sense her concentration and absorption He did nothing to break the mood Her hands were clenched her eyes staring unseeingly at the wall as her mind raced Brion and Ulv were quiet watching her waiting for her conclusions The pieces were falling into shape at last Lea opened her clenched hands and smoothed them on her sodden skirt She blinked and turned to Brion Is there a tool box here she asked Her words were so unexpected that Brion could not answer for a moment Before he could say anything she spoke again Not hand tools that would take too long Could you find anything like a power saw That would be ideal She turned back to the microscope and he didn t try to question her Ulv was still looking at the body of the magter and had understood nothing of what they had said Brion went out into the loading bay There was nothing he could use on the ground floor so he took the stairs to the floor above A corridor here passed by a number of rooms All of the doors were locked including one with the hopeful sign TOOL ROOM on it He battered at the metal door with his shoulder without budging it As he stepped back to look for another way in he glanced at his watch Two o clock In ten hours the bombs would fall on Dis The need for haste tore at him Yet there could be no noise someone in the street might hear it He quickly stripped off his shirt and wrapped it in a loose roll around the barrel of his gun extending it in a loose tube in front of the barrel Holding the rolled cloth in his left hand he jammed the gun up tight against the door the muzzle against the lock The single shot was only a dull thud inaudible outside of the building Pieces of broken mechanism jarred and rattled inside the lock and the door swung open When he came back Lea was standing by the body He held the small power saw with a rotary blade Will this do he asked Runs on its own battery almost fully charged too Perfect she answered You re both going to have to help me She switched into the Disan language Ulv would you find some place where you can watch the street without being seen Signal me when it is empty I m afraid this saw is going to make a lot of noise Ulv nodded and went out into the bay where he climbed a heap of empty crates so he could peer through the small windows set high in the wall He looked carefully in both directions then waved to her to go ahead Stand to one side and hold the cadaver s chin Brion she said Hold it firmly so the head doesn t shake around when I cut This is going to be a little gruesome I m sorry But it ll be the fastest way to cut the bone The saw bit into the skull Once Ulv waved them into silence and shrank back himself into the shadows next to the window They waited impatiently until he gave them the sign to continue again Brion held steady while the saw cut a circle completely around the skull Finished Lea said and the saw dropped from her limp fingers to the floor She massaged life back into her hands before she finished the job Carefully and delicately she removed the cap of bone from the magter s head exposing his brain to the shaft of light from the window You were right all the time Brion she said There is your alien XVI Ulv joined them as they looked down at the exposed brain of the magter The thing was so clearly evident that even Ulv noticed it I have seen dead animals and my people dead with their heads open but I have never seen anything like that before he said What is it Brion asked The invader the alien you were looking for Lea told him The magter s brain was only two thirds of what would have been its normal size Instead of filling the skull completely it shared the space with a green amorphous shape This was ridged somewhat like a brain but the green shape had still darker nodules and extensions Lea took her scalpel and gently prodded the dark moist mass It reminds me very much of something that I ve seen before on Earth she said The green fly Drepanosiphum platanoides and an unusual organ it has called the pseudova Now that I have seen this growth in the magter s skull I can think of a positive parallel The fly Drepanosiphum also had a large green organ only it fills half of the body cavity instead of the head Its identity puzzled biologists for years and they had a number of complex theories to explain it Finally someone managed to dissect and examine it The pseudova turned out to be a living plant a yeastlike growth that helps with the green fly s digestion It produces enzymes that enable the fly to digest the great amounts of sugar it gets from plant juice That s not unusual Brion said puzzled Termites and human beings are a couple of other creatures whose digestion is helped by internal flora What s the difference in the green fly Reproduction mainly All the other gut living plants have to enter the host and establish themselves as outsiders permitted to remain as long as they are useful The green fly and its yeast plant have a permanent symbiotic relationship that is essential to the existence of both The plant spores appear in many places throughout the fly s body but they are always in the germ cells Every egg cell has some and every egg that grows to maturity is infected with the plant spores The continuation of the symbiosis is unbroken and guaranteed Do you think those green spheres in the magter s blood cells could be the same kind of thing Brion asked I m sure of it Lea said It must be the same process There are probably green spheres throughout the magters bodies spores or offspring of those things in their brains Enough will find their way to the germ cells to make sure that every young magter is infected at birth While the child is growing so is the symbiote Probably a lot faster since it seems to be a simpler organism I imagine it is well established in the brain pan within the first six months of the infant s life But why Brion asked What does it do I m only guessing now but there is plenty of evidence that gives us an idea of its function I m willing to bet that the symbiote itself is not a simple organism it s probably an amalgam of plant and animal like most of the other creatures on Dis The thing is just too complex to have developed since mankind has been on this planet The magter must have caught the symbiotic infection eating some Disan animal The symbiote lived and flourished in its new environment well protected by a bony skull in a long lived host In exchange for food oxygen and comfort the brain symbiote must generate hormones and enzymes that enable the magter to survive Some of these might aid digestion enabling the magter to eat any plant or animal life they can lay their hands on The symbiote might produce sugars scavenge the blood of toxins there are so many things it could do Things it must have done since the magter are obviously the dominant life form on this planet They paid a high price for the symbiote but it didn t matter to race survival until now Did you notice that the magter s brain is no smaller than normal It must be or how else could that brain symbiote fit in inside the skull with it Brion said If the magter s total brain were smaller in volume than normal it could fit into the remaining space in the cranial hollow But the brain is full sized it is just that part of it is missing absorbed by the symbiote The frontal lobes Brion said with sudden realization This hellish growth has performed a prefrontal lobotomy It s done even more than that Lea said separating the convolutions of the gray matter with her scalpel to uncover a green filament beneath These tendrils penetrate further back into the brain but always remain in the cerebrum The cerebellum appears to be untouched Apparently just the higher functions of mankind have been interfered with selectively Destruction of the frontal lobes made the magter creatures without emotions or ability for really abstract thought Apparently they survived better without these There must have been some horrible failures before the right balance was struck The final product is a man plant animal symbiote that is admirably adapted for survival on this disaster world No emotions to cause complications or desires that might interfere with pure survival Complete ruthlessness mankind has always been strong on this anyway so it didn t take much of a push The other Disans like Ulv here managed to survive without turning into such a creature So why was it necessary for the magter to go so far Nothing is necessary in evolution you know that Lea said Many variations are possible and all the better ones continue You might say that Ulv s people survive but the magter survive better If offworld contact hadn t been re established I imagine that the magter would slowly have become the dominant race Only they won t have the chance now It looks as though they have succeeded in destroying both races with their suicidal urge That s the part that doesn t make sense Brion said The magter have survived and climbed right to the top of the evolutionary heap here Yet they are suicidal How does it happen they haven t been wiped out before this Individually they have been aggressive to the point of suicide They will attack anything and everything with the same savage lack of emotion Luckily there are no bigger animals on this planet So where they have died as individuals their utter ruthlessness has guaranteed their survival as a group Now they are faced with a problem that is too big for their half destroyed minds to handle Their personal policy has become their planetary policy and that s never a very smart thing They are like men with knives who have killed all the men who were only armed with stones Now they are facing men with guns and they are going to keep charging and fighting until they are all dead It s a perfect case of the utter impartiality of the forces of evolution Men infected by this Disan life form were the dominant creatures on this planet The creature in the magters brains was a true symbiote then giving something and receiving something making a union of symbiotes where all were stronger together than any could be separately Now this is changed The magter brain cannot understand the concept of racial death in a situation where it must understand to be able to survive Therefore the brain creature is no longer a symbiote but a parasite And as a parasite it must be destroyed Brion broke in We re not fighting shadows any more he exulted We ve found the enemy and it s not the magter at all Just a sort of glorified tapeworm that is too stupid to know when it is killing itself off Does it have a brain can it think I doubt it very much Lea said A brain would be of absolutely no use to it So even if it originally possessed reasoning powers they would be gone by now Symbiotes or parasites that live internally like this always degenerate to an absolute minimum of functions Tell me about it What is this thing Ulv broke in prodding the soft form of the brain symbiote He had heard all their excited talk but had not understood a word Explain it to him will you Lea as best you can Brion said looking at her and he realized how exhausted she was And sit down while you do it you re long overdue for a rest I m going to try He broke off when he looked at his watch It was after four in the afternoon less than eight hours to go What was he to do Enthusiasm faded as he realized that only half of the problem was solved The bombs would drop on schedule unless the Nyjorders could understand the significance of this discovery Even if they understood would it make any difference to them The threat of the hidden cobalt bombs would not be changed With this thought came the guilty realization that he had forgotten completely about Telt s death Even before he contacted the Nyjord fleet he must tell Hys and his rebel army what had happened to Telt and his sand car Also about the radioactive traces They couldn t be checked against the records now to see how important they might be but Hys might make another raid on the strength of the suspicion This call wouldn t take long then he would be free to tackle Professor Commander Krafft Carefully setting the transmitter on the frequency of the rebel army he sent out a call to Hys There was no answer When he switched to receive all he heard was static There was always a chance the set was broken He quickly twisted the transmitter to the frequency of his personal radio then whistled in the microphone The received signal was so loud that it hurt his ears He tried to call Hys again and was relieved to get a response this time Brion Brandd here Can you read me I want to talk to Hys at once It came as a shock that it was Professor Commander Krafft who answered I m sorry Brion but it s impossible to talk to Hys We are monitoring his frequency and your call was relayed to me Hys and his rebels lifted ship about half an hour ago and are already on the way back to Nyjord Are you ready to leave now It will soon become dangerous to make any landings Even now I will have to ask for volunteers to get you out of there Hys and the rebel army gone Brion assimilated the thought He had been thrown off balance when he realized he was talking to Krafft If they re gone well then there s nothing I can do about it he said I was going to call you so I can talk to you now Listen and try to understand You must cancel the bombing I ve found out about the magter found what causes their mental aberration If we can correct that we can stop them from attacking Nyjord Can they be corrected by midnight tonight Krafft broke in He was abrupt and sounded almost angry Even saints get tired No of course not Brion frowned at the microphone realizing the talk was going all wrong but not knowing how to remedy it But it won t take too long I have evidence here that will convince you that what I say is the truth I believe you without seeing it Brion The trace of anger was gone from Krafft s voice now and it was heavy with fatigue and defeat I ll admit you are probably right A little while ago I admitted to Hys too that he was probably right in his original estimation of the correct way to tackle the problem of Dis We have made a lot of mistakes and in making them we have run out of time I m afraid that is the only fact that is relevant now The bombs fall at twelve and even then they may drop too late A ship is already on its way from Nyjord with my replacement I exceeded my authority by running a day past the maximum the technicians gave me I realize now I was gambling the life of my own world in the vain hope I could save Dis They can t be saved They re dead I won t hear any more about it You must listen I must destroy the planet below me that is what I must do That fact will not be changed by anything you say All the offworlders other than your party are gone I m sending a ship down now to pick you up As soon as that ship lifts I am going to drop the first bombs Now tell me where you are so they can come for you Don t threaten me Krafft Brion shook his fist at the radio in an excess of anger You re a killer and a world destroyer don t try to make yourself out as anything else I have the knowledge to avert this slaughter and you won t listen to me And I know where the cobalt bombs are in the magter tower that Hys raided last night Get those bombs and there is no need to drop any of your own I m sorry Brion I appreciate what you re trying to do but at the same time I know the futility of it I m not going to accuse you of lying but do you realize how thin your evidence sounds from this end First a dramatic discovery of the cause of the magters intransigency Then when that had no results you suddenly remember that you know where the bombs are The best kept magter secret I don t know for sure but there is a very good chance it is so Brion said trying to repair his defenses Telt made readings he had other records of radioactivity in this same magter keep proof that something is there But Telt is dead now the records destroyed Don t you see He broke off realizing how vague and unprovable his case was This was defeat The radio was silent with just the hum of the carrier wave as Krafft waited for him to continue When Brion did speak his voice was empty of all hope Send your ship down he said tiredly We re in a building that belonged to the Light Metals Trust limited a big warehouse of some kind I don t know the address here but I m sure you have someone there who can find it We ll be waiting for you You win Krafft He turned off the radio XVII Do you mean what you said about giving up Lea asked Brion realized that she had stopped talking to Ulv some time ago and had been listening to his conversation with Krafft He shrugged trying to put his feeling into words We ve tried and almost succeeded But if they won t listen what can we do What can one man possibly do against a fleet loaded with H bombs As if in answer to the question Ulv s voice drowned him out the harsh Disan words slashing the silence of the room Kill you the enemy he said Kill you umedvirk He shouted the last word and his hand flashed to his belt In a single swift motion he lifted his blowgun and placed it to his lips A tiny dart quivered in the already dead flesh of the creature in the magter s skull The action had all the symbolism of a broken lance the declaration of war Ulv understands it a lot better than you might think Lea said He knows things about symbiosis and mutualism that would get him a job as a lecturer in any university on Earth He knows just what the brain symbiote is and what it does They even have a word for it one that never appeared in our Disan language lessons A life form that you can live with or cooperate with is called medvirk One that works to destroy you is umedvirk He also understands that life forms can change and be medvirk or umedvirk at different times He has just decided that the brain symbiote is umedvirk and he is out to kill it So will the rest of the Disans as soon as he can show them the evidence and explain You re sure of this Brion asked interested in spite of himself Positive The Disans have an absolute attitude towards survival you should realize that Not the same as the magter but not much different in the results They will kill the brain symbiotes even if it means killing every magter who harbors one If that is the case we can t leave now Brion said With these words it suddenly became clear what he had to do The ship is coming down now from the fleet Get in it and take the body of the magter I won t go Where will you be she asked shocked Fighting the magter My presence on the planet means that Krafft won t keep his threat to drop the bombs any earlier than the midnight deadline That would be deliberately murdering me I doubt if my presence past midnight will stop him but it should keep the bombs away at least until then What will you accomplish besides committing suicide Lea pleaded You just told me how a single man can t stop the bombs What will happen to you at midnight I ll be dead but in spite of that I can t run away Not now I must do everything possible right up until the last instant Ulv and I will go to the magter tower try to find out if the bombs are there He will fight on our side now He may even know more about the bombs things that he didn t want to tell me before We can get help from his people Some of them must know where the bombs are being native to this planet Lea started to say something but he rushed on drowning out her words You have just as big a job Show the magter to Krafft explain the significance of the brain parasite to him Try to get him to talk to Hys about the last raid Try to get him to hold off the attack I ll keep the radio with me and as soon as I know anything I ll call in This is all last resort finger in the dike kind of stuff but it is all we can do Because if we do nothing it means the end of Dis Lea tried to argue with him but he wouldn t listen to her He only kissed her and with a lightness he did not feel tried to convince her that everything would be all right In their hearts they both knew it wouldn t be but they left it that way because it was the least painful solution A sudden rumbling shook the building and the windows darkened as a ship settled in the street outside The Nyjord crew came in with guns pointed alert for anything After a little convincing they took the cadaver as well as Lea when they lifted ship Brion watched the spacer become a pinpoint in the sky and vanish He tried to shake off the feeling that this was the last time he would see any of them Let s get out of here fast he told Ulv picking up the radio before anyone comes around to see why the ship landed What will you do Ulv asked as they went down the street towards the desert What can we do in the few hours we have left He pointed at the sun nearing the horizon Brion shifted the weight of the radio to his other hand before replying Get to the magter tower we raided last night that s the best chance The bombs might be there Unless you know where the bombs are Ulv shook his head I do not know but some of my people may We will capture a magter then kill him so they can all see the umedvirk Then they will tell us everything they know The tower first then for bombs or a sample magter What s the fastest way we can get there Ulv frowned in thought If you can drive one of the cars the offworlders use I know where there are some locked in buildings in this city None of my people know how they are made to move I can work them let s go Chance was with them this time The first sand car they found still had the keys in the lock It was battery powered but contained a full charge Much quieter than the heavy atomic cars it sped smoothly out of the city and across the sand Ahead of them the sun sank in a red wave of color It was six o clock By the time they reached the tower it was seven and Brion s nerves felt as if they were writhing under his skin Even though it looked like suicide attacking the tower brought blessed relief It was movement and action and for moments at a time he forgot the bombs hanging over his head The attack was nerve rackingly anticlimactic They used the main entrance Ulv ranging soundlessly ahead There was no one in sight Once inside they crept down towards the lower rooms where the radiation had been detected Only gradually did they realize that the magter tower was completely empty Everyone gone Ulv grunted sniffing the air in every room that they passed Many magter were here earlier but they are gone now Do they often desert their towers Brion asked Never I have never heard of it happening before I can think of no reason why they should do a thing like this Well I can Brion told him They would leave their home if they took something with them of greater value The bombs If the bombs were hidden here they might move them after the attack Sudden fear hit him Or they might move them because it is time to take them to the launcher Let s get out of here the quickest way we can I smell air from outside Ulv said coming from down there This cannot be because the magter have no entrances this low in their towers We blasted one in earlier that could be it Can you find it Moonlight shone ahead as they turned an angle of the corridor and stars were visible through the gaping opening in the wall It looks bigger than it was Brion said as if the magter had enlarged it He looked through and saw the tracks on the sand outside As if they had enlarged it to bring something bulky up from below and carried it away in whatever made those tracks Using the opening themselves they ran back to the sand car Brion ground it fiercely around and turned the headlights on the tracks There were the marks of a sand car s treads half obscured by thin unmarked wheel tracks He turned off the lights and forced himself to move slowly and to do an accurate job A quick glimpse at his watch showed him there were four hours left to go The moonlight was bright enough to illuminate the tracks Driving with one hand he turned on the radio transmitter already set for Krafft s wave length When the operator acknowledged his signal Brion reported what they had discovered and his conclusions Get that message to Commander Krafft now I can t wait to talk to him I m following the tracks He killed the transmission and stamped on the accelerator The sand car churned and bounced down the track They are going to the mountains Ulv said some time later as the tracks still pointed straight ahead There are caves there and many magter have been seen near them that is what I have heard The guess was correct Before nine o clock the ground humped into a range of foothills and the darker masses of mountains could be seen behind them rising up to obscure the stars Stop the car here Ulv said The caves begin not too far ahead There may be magter watching or listening so we must go quietly Brion followed the deep cut grooves carrying the radio Ulv came and went on both sides silently as a shadow scouting for hidden watchers As far as he could discover there were none By nine thirty Brion realized they had deserted the sand car too soon The tracks wound on and on and seemed to have no end They passed some caves which Ulv pointed out to him but the tracks never stopped Time was running out and the nightmare stumbling through the darkness continued More caves ahead Ulv said Go quietly They came cautiously to the crest of a hill as they had done so many times already and looked into the shallow valley beyond Sand covered the valley floor and the light of the setting moon shone over the tracks at a flat angle marking them off sharply as lines of shadow They ran straight across the sandy valley and disappeared into the dark mouth of a cave on the far side Sinking back behind the hilltop Brion covered the pilot light with his hand and turned on the transmitter Ulv stayed above him staring at the opening of the cave This is an important message Brion whispered into the mike Please record He repeated this for thirty seconds glancing at his watch to make sure of the time since the seconds of waiting stretched to minutes in his brain Then as clearly as possible without raising his voice above a whisper he told of the discovery of the tracks and the cave The bombs may or may not be in here but we are going in to find out I ll leave my personal transmitter here with the broadcast power turned on so you can home on its signal That will give you a directional beacon to find the cave I m taking the other radio in it has more power If we can t get back to the entrance I ll try a signal from inside I doubt if you will hear it because of the rock but I ll try End of transmission Don t try to answer me because I have the receiver turned off There are no earphones on this set and the speaker would be too loud here He switched off held his thumb on the button for an instant then flicked it back on Good by Lea he said and killed the power for good They circled and reached the rocky wall of the cliff Creeping silently in the shadows they slipped up on the dark entrance of the cave Nothing moved ahead and there was no sound from the entrance of the cave Brion glanced at his watch and was instantly sorry Ten thirty The last shelter concealing them was five metres from the cave They started to rise to rush the final distance when Ulv suddenly waved Brion down He pointed to his nose then to the cave He could smell the magter there A dark figure separated itself from the greater darkness of the cave mouth Ulv acted instantly He stood up and his hand went to his mouth air hissed faintly through the tube in his hand Without a sound the magter folded and fell to the ground Before the body hit Ulv crouched low and rushed in There was the sudden scuffling of feet on the floor then silence Brion walked in gun ready and alert not knowing what he would find His toe pushed against a body on the ground and from the darkness Ulv whispered There were only two We can go on now Finding their way through the cave was a maddening torture They had no light nor would they dare use one if they had There were no wheel marks to follow on the stone floor Without Ulv s sensitive nose they would have been completely lost The cave branched and rejoined and they soon lost all sense of direction Walking was almost impossible They had to grope with their hands before them like blind men Stumbling and falling against the rock their fingers were soon throbbing and raw from brushing against the rough walls Ulv followed the scent of the magter that hung in the air where they had passed When it grew thin he knew they had left the frequently used tunnels and entered deserted ones They could only retrace their steps and start again in a different direction More maddening than the walking was the way time was running out Inexorably the glowing hands crept around the face of Brion s watch until they stood at fifteen minutes before twelve There is a light ahead Ulv whispered and Brion almost gasped with relief They moved slowly and silently until they stood concealed by the darkness looking out into a domed chamber brightly lit by glowing tubes What is it Ulv asked blinking in the painful wash of illumination after the long darkness Brion had to fight to control his voice to stop from shouting The cage with the metal webbing is a jump space generator The pointed silver shapes next to it are bombs of some kind probably the cobalt bombs We ve found it His first impulse was to instantly send the radio call that would stop the waiting fleet of H bombers But an unconvincing message would be worse than no message at all He had to describe exactly what he saw here so the Nyjorders would know he wasn t lying What he told them had to fit exactly with the information they already had about the launcher and the bombs The launcher had been jury rigged from a ship s jump space generator that was obvious The generator and its controls were neatly cased and mounted Cables ran from them to a roughly constructed cage of woven metal straps hammered and bent into shape by hand Three technicians were working on the equipment Brion wondered what sort of blood thirsty war lovers the magter had found to handle the bombing for them Then he saw the chains around their necks and the bloody wounds on their backs He still found it difficult to have any pity for them They had obviously been willing to accept money to destroy another planet or they wouldn t have been working here They had probably rebelled only when they had discovered how suicidal the attack would be Thirteen minutes to midnight Cradling the radio against his chest Brion rose to his feet He had a better view of the bombs now There were twelve of them alike as eggs from the same deadly clutch Pointed like the bow of a spacer each one swept smoothly back for its two metres of length to a sharply chopped off end They were obviously incomplete the war heads of rockets One had its base turned towards him and he saw six projecting studs that could be used to attach it to the missing rocket A circular inspection port was open in the flat base of the bomb This was enough With this description the Nyjorders would know he couldn t be lying about finding the bombs Once they realized this they couldn t destroy Dis without first trying to neutralize them Brion carefully counted fifty paces before he stopped He was far enough from the cavern so he couldn t be heard and an angle of the cave cut off all light from behind him With carefully controlled movements he turned on the power switched the set to transmit and checked the broadcast frequency All correct Then slowly and clearly he described what he had seen in the cavern behind him He kept his voice emotionless recounting facts leaving out anything that might be considered an opinion It was six minutes before midnight when he finished He thumbed the switch to receive and waited There was only silence Slowly the empty quality of the silence penetrated his numbed mind There were no crackling atmospherics nor hiss of static even when he turned the power full on The mass of rock and earth of the mountain above was acting as a perfect grounding screen absorbing his signal even at maximum output They hadn t heard him The Nyjord fleet didn t know that the cobalt bombs had been discovered before their launching The attack would go ahead as planned Even now the bomb bay doors were opening armed H bombs hung above the planet held in place only by their shackles In a few minutes the signal would be given and the shackles would spring open the bombs drop clear Killers Brion shouted into the microphone You wouldn t listen to reason you wouldn t listen to Hys or me or to any voice that suggested an alternative to complete destruction You are going to destroy Dis and it s not necessary There were a lot of ways you could have stopped it You didn t do any of them and now it s too late You ll destroy Dis and in turn this will destroy Nyjord Ihjel said that and now I believe him You re just another damned failure in a galaxy full of failures He raised the radio above his head and sent it crashing into the rock floor Then he was running back to Ulv trying to run away from the realization that he too had tried and failed The people on the surface of Dis had less than two minutes left to live They didn t get my message Brion said to Ulv The radio won t work this far underground Then the bombs will fall Ulv asked looking searchingly at Brion s face in the dim reflected light from the cavern Unless something happens that we know nothing about the bombs will fall They said nothing after that they simply waited The three technicians in the cavern were also aware of the time They were calling to each other and trying to talk to the magter The emotionless parasite ridden brains of the magter saw no reason to stop work and they attempted to beat the men back to their tasks In spite of the blows they didn t go they only gaped in horror as the clock hands moved remorselessly towards twelve Even the magter dimly felt some of the significance of the occasion They stopped too and waited The hour hand touched twelve on Brion s watch then the minute hand The second hand closed the gap and for a tenth of a second the three hands were one Then the second hand moved on Brion s immediate sensation of relief was washed away by the chilling realization that he was deep underground Sound and seismic waves were slow and the flare of atomic explosions couldn t be seen here If the bombs had been dropped at twelve they wouldn t know it at once A distant rumble filled the air A moment later the ground heaved under them and the lights in the cavern flickered Fine dust drifted down from the roof above Ulv turned to him but Brion looked away He could not face the accusation in the Disan s eyes

none	none	They had been killed the invisible death of radiation must already be penetrating into the caves but they also had the chance for vengeance 
2194_141248_000002_000003	train-clean-360	Swiftly they brought their work to completion with a speed and precision they had concealed before 
none	none	What are those offworlders doing Ulv asked Brion stirred from his lethargy of defeat and looked across the cavern floor The men had a wheeled handtruck and were rolling one of the atomic warheads onto it 
2194_141248_000004_000002	train-clean-360	They pushed it over to the latticework of the jump field 
none	none	They are going to bomb Nyjord now just as Nyjord bombed Dis That machine will hurl the bombs in a special way to the other planet Will you stop them Ulv asked He had his deadly blowgun in his hand and his face was an expressionless mask Brion almost smiled at the irony of the situation 
2194_141248_000007_000001	train-clean-360	In spite of everything he had done to prevent it Nyjord had dropped the bombs And this act alone may have destroyed their own planet 
none	none	Brion had it within his power now to stop the launching in the cavern 
2194_141248_000007_000003	train-clean-360	Should he Should he save the lives of his killers 
none	none	Or should he practice the ancient blood oath that had echoed and destroyed down through the ages An eye for an eye a tooth for a tooth It would be so simple 
2194_141248_000007_000005	train-clean-360	He literally had to do nothing 
2194_141248_000007_000006	train-clean-360	The score would be even and his and the Disans death avenged 
none	none	Did Ulv have his blowgun ready to kill Brion with if he should try to stop the launchings Or had he misread the Disan entirely Will you stop them Ulv he asked How large was mankind s sense of obligation 
2194_141248_000010_000001	train-clean-360	The caveman first had this feeling for his mate then for his family 
none	none	It grew until men fought and died for the abstract ideas of cities and nations then for whole planets Would the time ever come when men might realize that the obligation should be to the largest and most encompassing reality of all mankind 
2194_141248_000010_000004	train-clean-360	And beyond that to life of all kinds 
none	none	Brion saw this idea not in words but as a reality When he posed the question to himself in this way he found that it stated clearly its inherent answer 
2194_141248_000011_000002	train-clean-360	He pulled his gun out and as he did he wondered what Ulv s answer might be 
none	none	Nyjord is medvirk Ulv said raising his blowgun and sending a dart across the cavern 
2194_141248_000012_000001	train-clean-360	It struck one of the technicians who gasped and fell to the floor 
2194_141248_000013_000000	train-clean-360	Brion s shots crashed into the control board shorting and destroying it removing the menace to Nyjord for all time 
none	none	Medvirk Ulv had said 
2194_141248_000014_000001	train-clean-360	A life form that cooperates and aids other life forms 
2194_141248_000014_000002	train-clean-360	It may kill in self defense but it is essentially not a killer or destroyer 
none	none	Ulv had a lifetime of knowledge about the interdependency of life He grasped the essence of the idea and ignored all the verbal complications and confusions He had killed the magter who were his own people because they were umedvirk against life And he had saved his enemies because they were medvirk 
2194_141248_000015_000000	train-clean-360	With this realization came the painful knowledge that the planet and the people that had produced this understanding were dead 
none	none	In the cavern the magter saw the destruction of their plans and the cave mouth from which the bullets had come Silently they rushed to kill their enemy a concerted wave of emotionless fury Brion and Ulv fought back Even the knowledge that he was doomed no matter what happened could not resign Brion to death at the hands of the magter To Ulv the decision was much easier He was simply killing umedvirk 
2194_141248_000017_000004	train-clean-360	A believer in life he destroyed the anti life 
2194_141248_000018_000000	train-clean-360	They retreated into the darkness still firing 
none	none	The magter had lights and ion rifles and were right behind them Knowing the caverns better than the men they chased the pursuers circled Brion saw lights ahead and dragged Ulv to a stop They know their way through these caves and we don t he said If we try to run they ll just shoot us down 
2194_141248_000019_000001	train-clean-360	Let s find a spot we can defend and settle into it 
none	none	Back here Ulv gave a tug in the right direction there is a cave with only one entrance and that is very narrow Let s go Running as silently as they could in the darkness they reached the deadend cavern without being seen What noise they made was lost in other footsteps that sounded and echoed through the connecting caves 
2194_141248_000022_000002	train-clean-360	Once inside they found cover behind a ridge and waited The end was certain 
none	none	The magter ran swiftly into their cave flashing his light into all the places of concealment 
2194_141248_000023_000001	train-clean-360	The beam passed over the two hidden men and at the same instant Brion fired 
none	none	The shot boomed loudly as the magter fell a shot that would surely have been heard by the others Before anyone else came into the cave Brion ran over and grabbed the still functioning light Propping it on the rocks so it shone on the entrance he hurried back to shelter beside Ulv 
2194_141248_000024_000002	train-clean-360	They waited for the attack 
2194_141248_000025_000000	train-clean-360	It was not long in coming 
2194_141248_000025_000001	train-clean-360	Two magter rushed in and died 
none	none	More were outside Brion knew and he wondered how long it would be before they remembered the grenades and rolled one into their shelter An indistinct murmur sounded outside and sharp explosions In their hiding place Brion and Ulv crouched low and wondered why the attack didn t come 
2194_141248_000026_000002	train-clean-360	Then one of the magter came in the entrance but Brion hesitated before shooting 
none	none	The man had backed in firing behind him as he came Ulv had no compunctions about killing only his darts couldn t penetrate the magter s thick clothing 
2194_141248_000028_000001	train-clean-360	As the magter turned Ulv s breath pulsed once and death stung the back of the other man s hand He collapsed into a crumpled heap 
2194_141248_000029_000000	train-clean-360	 Don t shoot a voice called from outside the cave and a man stepped through the swirling dust and smoke to stand in the beam from the light 
none	none	Brion clutched wildly at Ulv s arm dragging the blowgun from the Disan s mouth 
2194_141248_000031_000000	train-clean-360	The man in the light wore a protective helmet thick boots and a pouch hung uniform 
2194_141248_000032_000000	train-clean-360	He was a Nyjorder 
2194_141248_000033_000000	train-clean-360	The realization was almost impossible to accept 
2194_141248_000033_000001	train-clean-360	Brion had heard the bombs fall 
none	none	Yet the Nyjord soldier was here 
2194_141248_000033_000003	train-clean-360	The two facts couldn t be accepted together 
2194_141248_000034_000000	train-clean-360	 Would you keep a hold on his arm sir just in case the soldier said glancing warily at Ulv s blowpipe 
2194_141248_000034_000001	train-clean-360	 I know what those darts can do He pulled a microphone from one of his pockets and spoke into it 
2194_141248_000035_000000	train-clean-360	More soldiers crowded into the cave and Professor Commander Krafft came in behind them 
none	none	He looked strangely out of keeping in the dusty combat uniform The gun was even more incongruous in his blue veined hand After giving the pistol to the nearest soldier with an air of relief he stumbled quickly over to Brion and took his hand It is a profound and sincere pleasure to meet you in person he said And your friend Ulv as well
2194_141248_000037_000000	train-clean-360	 Would you kindly explain what is going on Brion said thickly 
none	none	He was obsessed by the strange feeling that none of this could possibly be happening We will always remember you as the man who saved us from ourselves Krafft said once again the professor instead of the commander What Brion wants are facts Grandpa not speeches Hys said 
2194_141248_000039_000001	train-clean-360	The bent form of the leader of the rebel Nyjord army pushed through the crowd of taller men until he stood next to Krafft 
none	none	Simply stated Brion your plan succeeded Krafft relayed your message to me and as soon as I heard it I turned back and met him on his ship I m sorry that Telt s dead but he found what we were looking for I couldn t ignore his report of radioactive traces Your girl friend arrived with the hacked up corpse at the same time I did and we all took a long look at the green leech in its skull Her explanation of what it is made significant sense We were already carrying out landings when we had your call about something having been stored in the magter tower 
2194_141248_000039_000009	train-clean-360	After that it was just a matter of following tracks and the transmitter you planted 
none	none	But the explosions at midnight Brion broke in I heard them You were supposed to Hys laughed
2194_141248_000041_000001	train-clean-360	 Not only you but the magter in this cave 
none	none	We figured they would be armed and the cave strongly defended So at midnight we dropped a few large chemical explosive bombs at the entrance 
2194_141248_000041_000004	train-clean-360	Enough to kill the guards without bringing the roof down 
none	none	We also hoped that the magter deeper in would leave their posts or retreat from the imagined radiation 
2194_141248_000041_000006	train-clean-360	And they did 
2194_141248_000041_000007	train-clean-360	It worked like a charm 
2194_141248_000041_000008	train-clean-360	We came in quietly and took them by surprise Made a clean sweep killed the ones we couldn t capture 
none	none	One of the renegade jump space technicians was still alive Krafft said He told us about your stopping the bombs aimed at Nyjord the two of you None of the Nyjorders there could add anything to his words not even the cynical Hys But Brion could empathize their feelings the warmth of their intense relief and happiness It was a sensation he would never forget There is no more war Brion translated for Ulv knowing that the Disan had understood nothing of the explanation As he said it he realized that there was one glaring error in the story You couldn t have done it Brion said You landed on this planet before you had my message about the tower That means you still expected the magter to be sending their bombs to Nyjord and you made the landings in spite of this knowledge
2194_141248_000046_000000	train-clean-360	 Of course Professor Krafft said astonished at Brion s lack of understanding 
2194_141248_000046_000001	train-clean-360	 What else could we do 
2194_141248_000046_000002	train-clean-360	The magter are sick 
none	none	Hys laughed aloud at Brion s baffled expression You have to understand Nyjord psychology he said
2194_141248_000047_000002	train-clean-360	 When it was a matter of war and killing my planet could never agree on an intelligent course War is so alien to our philosophy that it couldn t even be considered correctly 
none	none	That s the trouble with being a vegetable eater in a galaxy of carnivores 
2194_141248_000047_000004	train-clean-360	You re easy prey for the first one that lands on your back 
none	none	Any other planet would have jumped on the magter with both feet and shaken the bombs out of them We fumbled it so long it almost got both worlds killed 
2194_141248_000047_000007	train-clean-360	Your mind parasite drew us back from the brink 
none	none	I don t understand Brion said
2194_141248_000049_000000	train-clean-360	 A simple matter of definition 
none	none	Before you came we had no way to deal with the magter here on Dis They really were alien to us Nothing they did made sense and nothing we did seemed to have the slightest effect on them But you discovered that they were sick and that s something we know how to handle We re united again my rebel army was instantly absorbed into the rest of the Nyjord forces by mutual agreement 
2194_141248_000049_000005	train-clean-360	Doctors and nurses are on the way here now Plans were put under way to evacuate what part of the population we could until the bombs were found 
2194_141248_000049_000006	train-clean-360	The planet is united again and working hard 
none	none	Because the magter are sick infected by a destructive life form Brion asked
2194_141248_000051_000000	train-clean-360	 Exactly so Professor Krafft said 
2194_141248_000051_000001	train-clean-360	 We are civilized after all You can t expect us to fight a war and you surely can t expect us to ignore the plight of sick neighbors 
none	none	No you surely can t Brion said sitting down heavily He looked at Ulv to whom the speech had been incomprehensible Beyond him Hys wore his most cynical expression as he considered the frailties of his people Hys Brion called out you translate all that into Disan and explain to Ulv I wouldn t dare XIX Dis was a floating golden ball looking like a schoolroom globe in space No clouds obscured its surface and from this distance it seemed warm and attractive set against the cold darkness Brion almost wished he were back there now as he sat shivering inside the heavy coat He wondered how long it would be before his confused body temperature controls decided to turn off the summer adjustment He hoped it wouldn t be as sudden or as drastic as turning it on had been Delicate as a dream Lea s reflection swam in space next to the planet She had come up quietly behind him in the spaceship s corridor only her gentle breath and mirrored face telling him she was there He turned quickly and took her hands in his You re looking infinitely better he said Well I should she said pushing back her hair in an unconscious gesture with her hand I ve been doing nothing but lying in the ship s hospital while you were having such a fine time this last week Rushing around down there shooting all the magter Just gassing them he told her The Nyjorders can t bring themselves to kill any more even if it does raise their own casualty rate In fact they are having difficulty restraining the Disans led by Ulv who are happily killing any magter they see as being pure umedvirk What will they do when they have all those frothing magter madmen They don t know yet he said They won t really know until they see what an adult magter is like with his brain parasite dead and gone They re having better luck with the children If they catch them early enough the parasite can be destroyed before it has done too much damage Lea shuddered delicately and let herself lean against him I m not that sturdy yet let s sit down while we talk There was a couch opposite the viewport where they could sit and still see Dis I hate to think of a magter deprived of his symbiote she said If his system can stand the shock I imagine there will be nothing left except a brainless hulk This is one series of experiments I don t care to witness I rest secure in the knowledge that the Nyjorders will find the most humane solution I m sure they will Brion said Now what about us she said disconcertingly leaning back in his arms I must say you have the highest body temperature of any one I have ever touched It s positively exciting This jarred Brion even more He didn t have her ability to put past horrors out of the mind by substituting present pleasures Well just what about us he said with masterful inappropriateness She smiled as she leaned against him You weren t as vague as that the night in the hospital room I seem to remember a few other things you said And did You can t claim you re completely indifferent to me Brion Brandd So I m only asking you what any outspoken Anvharian girl would Where do we go from here Get married There was a definite pleasure in holding her slight body in his arms and feeling her hair against his cheek They both sensed it and this awareness made his words sound that much more ugly Lea darling You know how important you are to me but you certainly realize that we could never get married Her body stiffened and she tore herself away from him Why you great fat egotistical slab of meat What do you mean by that I like you Lea we have plenty of fun and games together but surely you realize that you aren t the kind of girl one takes home to mother Lea hold on he said You know better than to say a thing like that What I said has nothing to do with how I feel towards you But marriage means children and you are biologist enough to know about Earth s genes Intolerant yokel she cried slapping his face He didn t move or attempt to stop her I expected better from you with all your pretensions of understanding But all you can think of are the horror stories about the worn out genes of Earth You re the same as every other big strapping bigot from the frontier planets I know how you look down on our small size our allergies and haemophilia and all the other weaknesses that have been bred back and preserved by the race You hate But that s not what I meant at all he interrupted shocked his voice drowning hers out Yours are the strong genes the viable strains mine are the deadly ones A child of mine would kill itself and you in a natural birth if it managed to live to term You re forgetting that you are the original homo sapiens I m a recent mutation Lea was frozen by his words They revealed a truth she had known but would never permit herself to consider Earth is home the planet where mankind developed he said The last few thousand years you may have been breeding weaknesses back into the genetic pool But that s nothing compared to the hundred millions of years that it took to develop man How many newborn babies live to be a year of age on Earth Why almost all of them A fraction of one per cent die each year I can t recall exactly how many Earth is home he said again gently When men leave home they can adapt to different planets but a price must be paid A terrible price is in dead infants The successful mutations live the failures die Natural selection is a brutally simple affair When you look at me you see a success I have a sister a success too Yet my mother had six other children who died when they were still babies And several others that never came to term You know about these things don t you Lea I know I know she said sobbing into her hands He held her now and she didn t pull away I know it all as a biologist but I am so awfully tired of being a biologist and top of my class and a mental match for any man When I think about you I do it as a woman and can t admit any of this I need someone Brion and I needed you so much because I loved you She paused and wiped her eyes You re going home aren t you Back to Anvhar When I can t wait too long he said unhappily Aside from my personal wants I find myself remembering that I m a part of Anvhar When you think of the number of people who suffered and died or adapted so that I could be sitting here now well it s a little frightening I suppose it doesn t make sense logically that I should feel indebted to them But I do Anything I do now or in the next few years won t be as important as getting back to Anvhar And I won t be going back with you It was a flat statement the way she said it not a question No you won t be he said There is nothing on Anvhar for you Lea was looking out of the port at Dis and her eyes were dry now Way back in my deeply buried unconscious I think I knew it would end this way she said If you think your little lecture on the Origins of Man was a novelty it wasn t It just reminded me of a number of things my glands had convinced me to forget In a way I envy you your weightlifter wife to be and your happy kiddies But not very much Very early in life I resigned myself to the fact that there was no one on Earth I would care to marry I always had these teen age dreams of a hero from space who would carry me off and I guess I slipped you into the pattern without realizing it I m old enough now to face the fact that I like my work more than a banal marriage and I ll probably end up a frigid and virtuous old maid with more degrees and titles than you have shot putting records As they looked through the port Dis began slowly to contract Their ship drew away from it heading towards Nyjord They sat apart without touching now Leaving Dis meant leaving behind something they had shared They had been strangers together there on a strange world For a brief time their lifelines had touched That time was over now Don t we look happy Hys said shambling towards them Fall dead and make me even happier then Lea snapped bitterly Hys ignored the acid tone of her words and sat down on the couch next to them Since leaving command of his rebel Nyjord army he seemed much mellower Going to keep on working for the Cultural Relationships Foundation Brion he asked You re the kind of man we need Brion s eyes widened as the meaning of the last words penetrated Are you in the C R F Field agent for Nyjord he said I hope you don t think those helpless office types like Faussel or Mervv really represented us there They just took notes and acted as a front and cover for the organization Nyjord is a fine planet but a gentle guiding hand behind the scenes is needed to help them find their place in the galaxy before they are pulverized What s your dirty game Hys Lea asked scowling I ve had enough hints to suspect for a long time that there was more to the C R F than the sweetness and light part I have seen Are you people egomaniacs power hungry or what That s the first charge that would be leveled at us if our activities were publicly known Hys told her That s why we do most of our work under cover The best fact I can give you to counter the charge is money Just where do you think we get the funds for an operation this size He smiled at their blank looks You ll see the records later so there won t be any doubt The truth is that all our funds are donated by planets we have helped Even a tiny percentage of a planetary income is large add enough of them together and you have enough money to help other planets And voluntary gratitude is a perfect test if you stop to think about it You can t talk people into liking what you have done They have to be convinced There have always been people on C R F worlds who knew about our work and agreed with it enough to see that we are kept in funds Why are you telling me all this super secret stuff Lea asked Isn t that obvious We want you to keep on working for us You can name whatever salary you like as I ve said there is no shortage of ready cash Hys glanced quickly at them both and delivered the clinching argument I hope Brion will go on working with us too He is the kind of field agent we desperately need and it is almost impossible to find Just show me where to sign Lea said and there was life in her voice once again I wouldn t exactly call it blackmail Brion smiled but I suppose if you people can juggle planetary psychologies you must find that individuals can be pushed around like chessmen Though you should realize that very little pushing is required this time Will you sign on Hys asked I must go back to Anvhar Brion said but there really is no pressing hurry Earth said Lea is overpopulated enough as it is seventy two HOURS IN HELL Dis was a harsh inhospitable dangerous place and the Magter made it worse They might have been human once but they were something else now The Magter had only one desire Kill Kill everything themselves their planet the universe if they could Brion Brandd was sent in at the eleventh hour His mission was to save Dis but it looked as though he was going to preside over its annihilation PLANET OF THE DAMNED HARRY HARRISON End of the
