CONVERT OF THE MISSION THE INDISCRETION OF ELSBETH THE DEVOTION OF ENRIQUEZ INTRODUCTION The life of Bret Harte divides itself without adventitious forcing into four quite distinct parts First we have the precocious boyhood with its eager response to the intellectual stimulation of cultured parents young Bret Harte assimilated Greek with amazing facility devoured voraciously the works of Shakespeare Dickens Irving Froissart Cervantes Fielding and with creditable success attempted various forms of composition Then compelled by economic necessity he left school at thirteen and for three years worked first in a lawyer s office and then in a merchant s counting house The second period that of his migration to California includes all that is permanently valuable of Harte s literary output Arriving in California in eighteen fifty four he was successively a school teacher drug store clerk express messenger typesetter and itinerant journalist He worked for a while on the NORTHERN CALIFORNIA from which he was dismissed for objecting editorially to the contemporary California sport of murdering Indians then on the GOLDEN ERA eighteen fifty seven where he achieved his first moderate acclaim In this latter year he married Anne Griswold of New York In eighteen sixty four he was given the secretaryship of the California mint a virtual sinecure and he was enabled do a great deal of writing The first volume of his poems THE LOST GALLEON AND OTHER TALES CONDENSED NOVELS much underrated parodies and THE BOHEMIAN PAPERS were published in eighteen sixty seven One year later THE OVERLAND MONTHLY which had aspirations of becoming the ATLANTIC MONTHLY of the West was established and Harte was appointed its first editor For it he wrote most of what still remains valid as literature THE LUCK OF ROARING CAMP THE OUTCASTS OF POKER FLAT PLAIN LANGUAGE FROM TRUTHFUL JAMES among others The combination of Irvingesque romantic glamor and Dickensian bitter sweet humor applied to picturesquely novel material with the addition of a trick ending was fantastically popular Editors began to clamor for his stories the University of California appointed him Professor of recent literature and the ATLANTIC MONTHLY offered him the practically unprecedented sum of ten thousand dollars for exclusive rights to one year s literary output Harte s star was briefly in the ascendant However Harte had accumulated a number of debts and his editorial policies excellent in themselves but undiplomatically executed were the cause of a series of arguments with the publisher of the OVERLAND MONTHLY Fairly assured of profitable pickings in the East he left California permanently as it proved The East however was financially unappreciative Harte wrote an unsuccessful novel and collaborated with Mark Twain on an unremunerative play His attempts to increase his income by lecturing were even less rewarding From his departure from California in eighteen seventy two to his death thirty years later Harte s struggles to regain financial stability were unremitting and to these efforts is due the relinquishment of his early ideal of a peculiarly characteristic Western American literature Henceforth Harte accepted as Prof Hicks remarks the role of entertainer and as an entertainer he survived for thirty years his death as an artist The final period extends from eighteen seventy eight when he managed to get himself appointed consul to Crefeld in Germany to nineteen oh two when he died of a throat cancer He left for Crefeld without his wife or son perhaps intending as his letters indicate to call them to him when circumstances allowed but save for a few years prior to his death the separation for whatever complex of reasons remained permanent Harte however continued to provide for them as liberally as he was able In Crefeld Harte wrote A LEGEND OF SAMMERSTANDT VIEWS FROM A GERMAN SPION and UNSER KARL In eighteen eighty he transferred to the more lucrative consulship of Glasgow and ROBIN GRAY a tale of Scottish life is the product of his stay there In eighteen eighty five he was dismissed from his consulship probably for political reasons though neglect of duty was charged against him He removed to London where he remained for most part until his death Bret Harte never really knew the life of the mining camp His mining experiences were too fragmentary and consequently his portraits of mining life are wholly impressionistic No one Mark Twain wrote can talk the quartz dialect correctly without learning it with pick and shovel and drill and fuse Yet Twain added elsewhere Bret Harte got his California and his Californians by unconscious absorption and put both of them into his tales alive That is perhaps the final comment Much could be urged against Harte s stories the glamor they throw over the life they depict is largely fictitious their pathetic endings are obviously stylized their technique is overwhelmingly derivative Nevertheless so excellent a critic as Chesterton maintained that There are more than nine hundred and ninety nine excellent reasons which we could all have for admiring the work of Bret Harte The figure is perhaps exaggerated but there are many reasons for admiration First Harte originated a new and incalculably influential type of story the romantically picturesque human interest story He created the local color story Prof Blankenship remarks or at least popularized it and he gave new form and intent to the short story Character motivating action is central to this type of story rather than mood dominating incident Again Harte s style is really an eminently skilful one admirably suited to his subjects He can manage the humorous or the pathetic excellently and his restraint in each is more remarkable than his excesses His sentences have both force and flow his backgrounds are crisply but carefully sketched his characters and caricatures have their own logical consistency Finally granted the desirability of the theatric finale it is necessary to admit that Harte always rings down his curtain dramatically and effectively ARTHUR ZEIGER M A 
1746-143015-0000	train-other-500	THE LUCK OF ROARING CAMP There was commotion in Roaring Camp It could not have been a fight for in eighteen fifty that was not novel enough to have called together the entire settlement
1746-143015-0001	train-other-500	The ditches and claims were not only deserted but Tuttle s grocery had contributed its gamblers who it will be remembered calmly continued their game the day that French Pete and Kanaka Joe shot each other to death
none	none	 over the bar in the front room 
1746-143015-0002	train-other-500	The whole camp was collected before a rude cabin on the outer edge of the clearing
none	none	 Conversation was carried on in a low tone 
1746-143015-0003	train-other-500	but the name of a woman was frequently repeated It was a name familiar enough in the camp Cherokee Sal Perhaps the less said of her the better She was a coarse and it is to be feared a very sinful woman
none	none	 But at that time she was the only woman in Roaring Camp and was just then lying in sore extremity 
1746-143015-0004	train-other-500	when she most needed the ministration of her own sex Dissolute abandoned and irreclaimable she was yet suffering a martyrdom hard enough to bear even when veiled by sympathizing womanhood
1746-143015-0005	train-other-500	but now terrible in her loneliness The primal curse had come to her in that original isolation which must have made the punishment of the first transgression so dreadful It was perhaps part of the expiation of her sin
1746-143015-0006	train-other-500	that at a moment when she most lacked her sex s intuitive tenderness and care
none	none	 she met only the half contemptuous faces of her masculine associates Yet a few of the spectators were I think touched by her sufferings 
1746-143015-0007	train-other-500	Sandy Tipton thought it was rough on Sal and in the contemplation of her condition for a moment rose superior to the fact that he had an ace and two bowers in his sleeve It will be seen also that the situation was novel
none	none	 Deaths were by no means uncommon in Roaring Camp but a birth was a new thing People had been dismissed the camp effectively finally and with no possibility of return but this was the first time that anybody had been introduced AB INITIO 
1746-143015-0009	train-other-500	Hence the excitement You go in there Stumpy said a prominent citizen known as Kentuck addressing one of the loungers Go in there and see what you kin do You ve had experience in them things
1746-143015-0010	train-other-500	Perhaps there was a fitness in the selection Stumpy in other climes had been the putative head of two families in fact it was owing to some legal informality in these proceedings that Roaring Camp a city of refuge
1746-143015-0011	train-other-500	was indebted to his company The crowd approved the choice and Stumpy was wise enough to bow to the majority The door closed on the extempore surgeon and midwife and Roaring Camp sat down outside smoked its pipe and awaited the issue
1746-143015-0012	train-other-500	The assemblage numbered about a hundred men One or two of these were actual fugitives from justice some were criminal and all were reckless Physically they exhibited no indication of their past lives and character
1746-143015-0013	train-other-500	The greatest scamp had a Raphael face with a profusion of blonde hair Oakhurst a gambler had the melancholy air and intellectual abstraction of a Hamlet the coolest and most courageous man
none	none	 was scarcely over five feet in height with a soft voice and an embarrassed timid manner 
1746-143015-0014	train-other-500	The term roughs applied to them was a distinction rather than a definition
none	none	 Perhaps in the minor details of fingers toes ears et cetera 
1746-143015-0015	train-other-500	the camp may have been deficient but these slight omissions did not detract from their aggregate force The strongest man had but three fingers on his right hand the best shot had but one eye
1746-143015-0016	train-other-500	Such was the physical aspect of the men that were dispersed around the cabin
none	none	 The camp lay in a triangular valley between two hills and a river 
1746-143015-0017	train-other-500	The only outlet was a steep trail over the summit of a hill that faced the cabin now illuminated by the rising moon The suffering woman might have seen it from the rude bunk whereon she lay
1746-143015-0018	train-other-500	seen it winding like a silver thread until it was lost in the stars above A fire of withered pine boughs added sociability to the gathering
none	none	 By degrees the natural levity of Roaring Camp returned 
1746-143015-0019	train-other-500	Bets were freely offered and taken regarding the result Three to five that Sal would get through with it even that the child would survive side bets as to the sex and complexion of the coming stranger
none	none	 In the midst of an excited discussion an exclamation came from 
1746-143015-0020	train-other-500	those nearest the door and the camp stopped to listen Above the swaying and moaning of the pines the swift rush of the river and the crackling of the fire
none	none	 rose a sharp querulous cry a cry unlike anything heard before in the camp 
1746-143015-0021	train-other-500	The pines stopped moaning
none	none	 the river ceased to rush and the fire to crackle 
1746-143015-0022	train-other-500	It seemed as if Nature had stopped to listen too The camp rose to its feet as one man It was proposed to explode a barrel of gunpowder
1746-143015-0023	train-other-500	but in consideration of the situation of the mother better counsels prevailed
none	none	 and only a few revolvers were discharged 
1746-143015-0024	train-other-500	for whether owing to the rude surgery of the camp or some other reason Cherokee Sal was sinking fast Within an hour she had climbed as it were that rugged road that led to the stars
1746-143015-0025	train-other-500	and so passed out of Roaring Camp its sin and shame forever I do not think that the announcement disturbed them much except in speculation as to the fate of the child Can he live now was asked of Stumpy
1746-143015-0026	train-other-500	The answer was doubtful The only other being of Cherokee Sal s sex and maternal condition in the settlement was an ass There was some conjecture as to fitness but the experiment was tried It was less problematical
1746-143015-0027	train-other-500	than the ancient treatment of Romulus and Remus and apparently as successful When these details were completed which exhausted another hour the door was opened and the anxious crowd of men
none	none	 who had already formed themselves into a queue entered in single file 
1746-143015-0028	train-other-500	Beside the low bunk or shelf on which the figure of the mother was starkly outlined below the blankets stood a pine table On this a candle box was placed and within it
none	none	 swathed in staring red flannel 
1746-143015-0029	train-other-500	lay the last arrival at Roaring Camp Beside the candle box was placed a hat Its use was soon indicated Gentlemen said Stumpy with a singular mixture of authority and EX OFFICIO complacency
1746-143015-0030	train-other-500	gentlemen will please pass in at the front door round the table and out at the back door Them as wishes to contribute anything toward the orphan will find a hat handy The first man entered with his hat on
1746-143015-0031	train-other-500	he uncovered however as he looked about him
none	none	 and so unconsciously set an example to the next In such communities 
1746-143015-0032	train-other-500	good and bad actions are catching As the procession filed in comments were audible criticisms addressed perhaps rather to Stumpy in the character of showman Is that him Mighty small specimen
none	none	 Has n t more n got the color 
1746-143015-0033	train-other-500	Ain t bigger nor a derringer
none	none	 The contributions were as characteristic 
1746-143015-0034	train-other-500	A silver tobacco box a doubloon a navy revolver silver mounted a gold specimen a very beautifully embroidered lady s handkerchief from Oakhurst the gambler
1746-143015-0035	train-other-500	a diamond breastpin a diamond ring
none	none	 suggested by the pin with the remark from the giver that 
1746-143015-0036	train-other-500	he saw that pin and went two diamonds better a slung shot a Bible contributor not detected a golden spur a silver teaspoon the initials I regret to say were not the giver s a pair of surgeon s shears
1746-143015-0037	train-other-500	a lancet a Bank of England note for five pounds and about two hundred dollars in loose gold and silver coin
none	none	 During these proceedings Stumpy maintained a silence as impassive as the dead on his left 
1746-143015-0038	train-other-500	a gravity as inscrutable as that of the newly born on his right Only one incident occurred to break the monotony of the curious procession As Kentuck bent over the candle box
1746-143015-0039	train-other-500	half curiously the child turned and in a spasm of pain caught at his groping finger and held it fast for a moment Kentuck looked foolish and embarrassed
none	none	 Something like a blush tried to assert itself in his weather beaten cheek 
1746-143015-0040	train-other-500	The damned little cuss he said as he extricated his finger with perhaps more tenderness and care than he might have been deemed capable of showing He held that finger a little apart from its fellows as he went out
none	none	 and examined it curiously The examination provoked the same original remark in regard to the child 
1746-143015-0041	train-other-500	In fact he seemed to enjoy repeating it
none	none	 He rastled with my finger he remarked to Tipton holding up the member 
1746-143015-0042	train-other-500	the damned little cuss It was four o clock before the camp sought repose A light burnt in the cabin where the watchers sat for Stumpy did not go to bed that night Nor did Kentuck
1746-143015-0043	train-other-500	He drank quite freely and related with great gusto his experience invariably ending with his characteristic condemnation of the newcomer
none	none	 It seemed to relieve him of any unjust implication of sentiment 
1746-143015-0044	train-other-500	and Kentuck had the weaknesses of the nobler sex When everybody else had gone to bed
none	none	 he walked down to the river and whistled reflectingly 
1746-143015-0045	train-other-500	Then he walked up the gulch past the cabin still whistling with demonstrative unconcern
none	none	 At a large redwood tree he paused and retraced his steps 
1746-143015-0046	train-other-500	and again passed the cabin Halfway down to the river s bank he again paused and then returned and knocked at the door It was opened by Stumpy How goes it said Kentuck looking past Stumpy toward the candle box
1746-143015-0047	train-other-500	All serene replied Stumpy Anything up Nothing There was a pause an embarrassing one Stumpy still holding the door Then Kentuck had recourse to his finger which he held up to Stumpy
1746-143015-0048	train-other-500	Rastled with it the
none	none	 damned little cuss 
1746-143015-0049	train-other-500	he said and retired The next day Cherokee Sal had such rude sepulture as Roaring Camp afforded
none	none	 After her body had been committed to the hillside there was a formal meeting of the camp to discuss what should be done with her infant A resolution to adopt it was unanimous and enthusiastic But an animated discussion in regard to the manner and feasibility of providing for its wants at once sprang up It was remarkable that the argument partook of none of those fierce personalities with which discussions were usually conducted at Roaring Camp Tipton proposed that they should send the child to Red Dog a distance of forty miles where female attention could be procured 
1746-143015-0050	train-other-500	But the unlucky suggestion met with fierce and unanimous opposition It was evident that no plan which entailed parting from their new acquisition would for a moment be entertained Besides said Tom Ryder
1746-143015-0051	train-other-500	them fellows at Red Dog would swap it and ring in somebody else on us A disbelief in the honesty of other camps prevailed at Roaring Camp as in other places
none	none	 The introduction of a female nurse in the camp 
1746-143015-0052	train-other-500	also met with objection It was argued that no decent woman could be prevailed to accept Roaring Camp as her home and the speaker urged that they didn t want any more of the other kind This unkind allusion to the defunct mother
none	none	 harsh as it may seem 
1746-143015-0053	train-other-500	was the first spasm of propriety the first symptom of the camp s regeneration Stumpy advanced nothing Perhaps he felt a certain delicacy in interfering with the selection of a possible successor in office
1746-143015-0054	train-other-500	But when questioned he averred stoutly that he and Jinny the mammal before alluded to could manage to rear the child There was something original independent and heroic about the plan that pleased the camp
1746-143015-0055	train-other-500	Stumpy was retained Certain articles were sent for to Sacramento Mind said the treasurer as he pressed a bag of gold dust into the expressman s hand the best that can be got lace you know and filigree work and frills
1746-143015-0056	train-other-500	damn the cost Strange to say the child thrived Perhaps the invigorating climate of the mountain camp was compensation for material deficiencies Nature took the foundling to her broader breast
1746-143015-0057	train-other-500	In that rare atmosphere of the Sierra foothills that air pungent with balsamic odor that ethereal cordial at once bracing and exhilarating he may have found food and nourishment
none	none	 or a subtle chemistry that transmuted ass s milk to lime and phosphorus Stumpy inclined to the belief that it was the latter and good nursing 
1746-143015-0058	train-other-500	Me and that ass he would say has been father and mother to him Don t you he would add apostrophizing the helpless bundle before him never go back on us
1746-143015-0059	train-other-500	By the time he was a month old the necessity of giving him a name became apparent He had generally been known as The Kid Stumpy s Boy The Coyote
1746-143015-0060	train-other-500	an allusion to his vocal powers and even by Kentuck s endearing diminutive of The damned little cuss But these were felt to be vague and unsatisfactory and were at last dismissed under another influence
1746-143015-0061	train-other-500	Gamblers and adventurers are generally superstitious and Oakhurst one day declared that the baby had brought the luck to Roaring Camp It was certain that of late they had been successful Luck
none	none	 was the name agreed upon with the prefix of Tommy for greater convenience 
1746-143015-0062	train-other-500	No allusion was made to the mother and the father was unknown It s better said the philosophical Oakhurst to take a fresh deal all round
1746-143015-0063	train-other-500	Call him Luck and start him fair A day was accordingly set apart for the christening What was meant by this ceremony the reader may imagine who has already gathered some idea
1746-143015-0064	train-other-500	of the reckless irreverence of Roaring Camp The master of ceremonies was one Boston a noted wag and the occasion seemed to promise the greatest facetiousness This ingenious satirist
1746-143015-0065	train-other-500	had spent two days in preparing a burlesque of the Church service with pointed local allusions The choir was properly trained and Sandy Tipton was to stand godfather
1746-143015-0066	train-other-500	But after the procession had marched to the grove with music and banners and the child had been deposited before a mock altar Stumpy stepped before the expectant crowd
none	none	 It ain t my style to spoil fun boys said the little man stoutly 
1746-143015-0067	train-other-500	eyeing the faces around him but it strikes me that this thing ain t exactly on the squar It s playing it pretty low down on this yer baby to ring in fun on him that he ain t goin to understand
1746-143015-0068	train-other-500	And ef there s goin to be any godfathers round I d like to see who s got any better rights than me A silence followed Stumpy s speech
none	none	 To the credit of all humorists be it said that the first man to acknowledge its justice was the satirist thus stopped of his fun 
1746-143015-0069	train-other-500	But said Stumpy quickly following up his advantage we re here for a christening and we ll have it I proclaim you Thomas Luck according to the laws of the United States and the State of California
1746-143015-0070	train-other-500	so help me God It was the first time that the name of the Deity had been otherwise uttered than profanely in the camp The form of christening was perhaps even more ludicrous than the satirist had conceived
1746-143015-0071	train-other-500	but strangely enough nobody saw it and nobody laughed Tommy was christened as seriously as he would have been under a Christian roof and cried and was comforted
none	none	 in as orthodox fashion And so the work of regeneration began in Roaring Camp 
1746-143015-0072	train-other-500	Almost imperceptibly a change came over the settlement The cabin assigned to Tommy Luck or The Luck as he was more frequently called first showed signs of improvement
1746-143015-0073	train-other-500	It was kept scrupulously clean and whitewashed Then it was boarded clothed and papered The rose wood cradle packed eighty miles by mule had in Stumpy s way of putting it sorter killed the rest of the furniture
1746-143015-0074	train-other-500	So the rehabilitation of the cabin became a necessity The men who were in the habit of lounging in at Stumpy s to see how The Luck got on seemed to appreciate the change
none	none	 and in self defense the rival establishment of Tuttle s grocery bestirred itself and imported a carpet and mirrors The reflections of the latter on the appearance of Roaring Camp tended to produce stricter habits of personal cleanliness 
1746-143015-0075	train-other-500	Again Stumpy imposed a kind of quarantine upon those who aspired to the honor and privilege of holding The Luck It was a cruel mortification to Kentuck
none	none	 who in the carelessness of a large nature and the habits of frontier life had begun to regard all garments as a second cuticle 
1746-143015-0076	train-other-500	which like a snake s only sloughed off through decay to be debarred this privilege from certain prudential reasons Yet such was the subtle influence of innovation that he thereafter appeared regularly every afternoon in a clean shirt and face
none	none	 still shining from his ablutions 
1746-143015-0077	train-other-500	Nor were moral and social sanitary laws neglected Tommy
none	none	 who was supposed to spend his whole existence in a persistent attempt to repose 
1746-143015-0078	train-other-500	must not be disturbed by noise
none	none	 The shouting and yelling which had gained the camp its infelicitous title were not permitted within hearing distance of Stumpy s 
1746-143015-0079	train-other-500	The men conversed in whispers or smoked with Indian gravity Profanity was tacitly given up in these sacred precincts and throughout the camp a popular form of expletive known as
none	none	 D n the luck 
1746-143015-0080	train-other-500	and Curse the luck was abandoned as having a new personal bearing Vocal music was not interdicted being supposed to have a soothing tranquilizing quality and one song
1746-143015-0081	train-other-500	sung by Man o War Jack an English sailor from her Majesty s Australian colonies was quite popular as a lullaby It was a lugubrious recital of the exploits of the Arethusa Seventy four
none	none	 in a muffled minor ending with a prolonged dying fall at the burden of each verse On b oo o ard of the Arethusa It was a fine sight to see Jack holding The Luck rocking from side to side as if with the motion of a ship and crooning forth this naval ditty Either through the peculiar rocking of Jack or the length of his song it contained ninety stanzas and was continued with conscientious deliberation to the bitter end the lullaby generally had the desired effect At such times the men would lie at full length under the trees in the soft summer twilight 
1746-143015-0082	train-other-500	smoking their pipes and drinking in the melodious utterances An indistinct idea that this was pastoral happiness pervaded the camp This ere kind o think
1746-143015-0083	train-other-500	said the Cockney Simmons meditatively reclining on his elbow is evingly It reminded him of Greenwich On the long summer days
1746-143015-0084	train-other-500	The Luck was usually carried to the gulch from whence the golden store of Roaring Camp was taken There on a blanket spread over pine boughs he would lie while the men were working in the ditches below
none	none	 Latterly there was a rude attempt to decorate this bower with flowers and sweet smelling shrubs and generally some one would bring him a cluster of wild honeysuckles azaleas or the painted blossoms of Las Mariposas 
1746-143015-0085	train-other-500	The men had suddenly awakened to the fact that there were beauty and significance in these trifles
none	none	 which they had so long trodden carelessly beneath their feet A flake of glittering mica a 
1746-143015-0086	train-other-500	fragment of variegated quartz a bright pebble from the bed of the creek became beautiful to eyes thus cleared and strengthened
none	none	 and were invariably pat aside for The Luck 
1746-143015-0087	train-other-500	It was wonderful how many treasures the woods and hillsides yielded that would do for Tommy Surrounded by playthings such as never child out of fairyland had before it is to be hoped that Tommy was content
1746-143015-0088	train-other-500	He appeared to be serenely happy albeit there was an infantine gravity about him
none	none	 a contemplative light in his round gray eyes 
1746-143015-0089	train-other-500	that sometimes worried Stumpy He was always tractable and quiet and it is recorded that once having crept beyond his corral a hedge of tessellated pine boughs which surrounded his bed
1746-143015-0090	train-other-500	he dropped over the bank on his head in the soft earth
none	none	 and remained with his mottled legs in the air in that position for at least five minutes with unflinching gravity He was extricated without a murmur 
1746-143015-0091	train-other-500	I hesitate to record the many other instances of his sagacity which rest unfortunately upon the statements of prejudiced friends
none	none	 Some of them were not without a tinge of superstition 
1746-143015-0092	train-other-500	I crep up the bank just now said Kentuck one day in a breathless state of excitement
none	none	 and dern my skin if he was a talking to a jay bird as was a sittin on his lap There they was just as free and sociable as anything you please a jawin at each other just like two cherrybums Howbeit whether creeping over the pine boughs or lying lazily on his back blinking at the leaves above him 
1746-143015-0093	train-other-500	to him the birds sang the squirrels chattered and the flowers bloomed Nature was his nurse and playfellow For him she would let slip between the leaves golden shafts of sunlight that fell just within his grasp

Oakhurst gambler stepped into the main street of Poker Flat on the morning of the twenty third of November eighteen fifty he was conscious of a change in its moral atmosphere since the preceding night Two or three men conversing earnestly together ceased as he approached and exchanged significant glances There was a Sabbath lull in the air which in a settlement unused to Sabbath influences looked ominous mister Oakhurst s calm handsome face betrayed small concern in these indications Whether he was conscious of any predisposing cause was another question I reckon they re after somebody he reflected likely it s me He returned to his pocket the handkerchief with which he had been whipping away the red dust of Poker Flat from his neat boots and quietly discharged his mind of any further conjecture In point of fact Poker Flat was after somebody It had lately suffered the loss of several thousand dollars two valuable horses and a prominent citizen It was experiencing a spasm of virtuous reaction quite as lawless and ungovernable as any of the acts that had provoked it A secret committee had determined to rid the town of all improper persons This was done permanently in regard of two men who were then hanging from the boughs of a sycamore in the gulch and temporarily in the banishment of certain other objectionable characters I regret to say that some of these were ladies It is but due to the sex however to state that their impropriety was professional and it was only in such easily established standards of evil that Poker Flat ventured to sit in judgment mister Oakhurst was right in supposing that he was included in this category A few of the committee had urged hanging him as a possible example and a sure method of reimbursing themselves from his pockets of the sums he had won from them It s agin justice said Jim Wheeler to let this yer young man from Roaring Camp an entire stranger carry away our money But a crude sentiment of equity residing in the breasts of those who had been fortunate enough to win from mister Oakhurst overruled this narrower local prejudice mister Oakhurst received his sentence with philosophic calmness none the less coolly that he was aware of the hesitation of his judges He was too much of a gambler not to accept Fate With him life was at best an uncertain game and he recognized the usual percentage in favor of the dealer A body of armed men accompanied the deported wickedness of Poker Flat to the outskirts of the settlement Besides mister Oakhurst who was known to be a coolly desperate man and for whose intimidation the armed escort was intended the expatriated party consisted of a young woman familiarly known as the Duchess another who had won the title of Mother Shipton and Uncle Billy a suspected sluice robber and confirmed drunkard The cavalcade provoked no comments from the spectators nor was any word uttered by the escort Only when the gulch which marked the uttermost limit of Poker Flat was reached the leader spoke briefly and to the point The exiles were forbidden to return at the peril of their lives As the escort disappeared their pent up feelings found vent in a few hysterical tears from the Duchess some bad language from Mother Shipton and a Parthian volley of expletives from Uncle Billy The philosophic Oakhurst alone remained silent He listened calmly to Mother Shipton s desire to cut somebody s heart out to the repeated statements of the Duchess that she would die in the road and to the alarming oaths that seemed to be bumped out of Uncle Billy as he rode forward With the easy good humor characteristic of his class he insisted upon exchanging his own riding horse Five Spot for the sorry mule which the Duchess rode But even this act did not draw the party into any closer sympathy The young woman readjusted her somewhat draggled plumes with a feeble faded coquetry Mother Shipton eyed the possessor of Five Spot with malevolence and Uncle Billy included the whole party in one sweeping anathema The road to Sandy Bar a camp that not having as yet experienced the regenerating influences of Poker Flat consequently seemed to offer some invitation to the emigrants lay over a steep mountain range It was distant a day s severe travel In that advanced season the party soon passed out of the moist temperate regions of the foothills into the dry cold bracing air of the Sierras The trail was narrow and difficult At noon the Duchess rolling out of her saddle upon the ground declared her intention of going no farther and the party halted The spot was singularly wild and impressive A wooded amphitheater surrounded on three sides by precipitous cliffs of naked granite sloped gently toward the crest of another precipice that overlooked the valley It was undoubtedly the most suitable spot for a camp had camping been advisable But mister Oakhurst knew that scarcely half the journey to Sandy Bar was accomplished and the party were not equipped or provisioned for delay This fact he pointed out to his companions curtly with a philosophic commentary on the folly of throwing up their hand before the game was played out But they were furnished with liquor which in this emergency stood them in place of food fuel rest and prescience In spite of his remonstrances it was not long before they were more or less under its influence Uncle Billy passed rapidly from a bellicose state into one of stupor the Duchess became maudlin and Mother Shipton snored mister Oakhurst alone remained erect leaning against a rock calmly surveying them mister Oakhurst did not drink It interfered with a profession which required coolness impassiveness and presence of mind and in his own language he couldn t afford it As he gazed at his recumbent fellow exiles the loneliness begotten of his pariah trade his habits of life his very vices for the first time seriously oppressed him He bestirred himself in dusting his black clothes washing his hands and face and other acts characteristic of his studiously neat habits and for a moment forgot his annoyance The thought of deserting his weaker and more pitiable companions never perhaps occurred to him Yet he could not help feeling the want of that excitement which singularly enough was most conducive to that calm equanimity for which he was notorious He looked at the gloomy walls that rose a thousand feet sheer above the circling pines around him at the sky ominously clouded at the valley below already deepening into shadow And doing so suddenly he heard his own name called A horseman slowly ascended the trail In the fresh open face of the newcomer mister Oakhurst recognized Tom Simson otherwise known as the Innocent of Sandy Bar He had met him some months before over a little game and had with perfect equanimity won the entire fortune amounting to some forty dollars of that guileless youth After the game was finished mister Oakhurst drew the youthful speculator behind the door and thus addressed him Tommy you re a good little man but you can t gamble worth a cent Don t try it over again He then handed him his money back pushed him gently from the room and so made a devoted slave of Tom Simson There was a remembrance of this in his boyish and enthusiastic greeting of mister Oakhurst He had started he said to go to Poker Flat to seek his fortune Alone No not exactly alone in fact a giggle he had run away with Piney Woods Didn t mister Oakhurst remember Piney She that used to wait on the table at the Temperance House They had been engaged a long time but old Jake Woods had objected and so they had run away and were going to Poker Flat to be married and here they were And they were tired out and how lucky it was they had found a place to camp and company All this the Innocent delivered rapidly while Piney a stout comely damsel of fifteen emerged from behind the pine tree where she had been blushing unseen and rode to the side of her lover mister Oakhurst seldom troubled himself with sentiment still less with propriety but he had a vague idea that the situation was not fortunate He retained however his presence of mind sufficiently to kick Uncle Billy who was about to say something and Uncle Billy was sober enough to recognize in mister Oakhurst s kick a superior power that would not bear trifling He then endeavored to dissuade Tom Simson from delaying further but in vain He even pointed out the fact that there was no provision nor means of making a camp But unluckily the Innocent met this objection by assuring the party that he was provided with an extra mule loaded with provisions and by the discovery of a rude attempt at a log house near the trail Piney can stay with missus Oakhurst said the Innocent pointing to the Duchess and I can shift for myself Nothing but mister Oakhurst s admonishing foot saved Uncle Billy from bursting into a roar of laughter As it was he felt compelled to retire up the canyon until he could recover his gravity There he confided the joke to the tall pine trees with many slaps of his leg contortions of his face and the usual profanity But when he returned to the party he found them seated by a fire for the air had grown strangely chill and the sky overcast in apparently amicable conversation Piney was actually talking in an impulsive girlish fashion to the Duchess who was listening with an interest and animation she had not shown for many days The Innocent was holding forth apparently with equal effect to mister Oakhurst and Mother Shipton who was actually relaxing into amiability Is this yer a damned picnic said Uncle Billy with inward scorn as he surveyed the sylvan group the glancing firelight and the tethered animals in the foreground Suddenly an idea mingled with the alcoholic fumes that disturbed his brain It was apparently of a jocular nature for he felt impelled to slap his leg again and cram his fist into his mouth As the shadows crept slowly up the mountain a slight breeze rocked the tops of the pine trees and moaned through their long and gloomy aisles The ruined cabin patched and covered with pine boughs was set apart for the ladies As the lovers parted they unaffectedly exchanged a kiss so honest and sincere that it might have been heard above the swaying pines The frail Duchess and the malevolent Mother Shipton were probably too stunned to remark upon this last evidence of simplicity and so turned without a word to the hut The fire was replenished the men lay down before the door and in a few minutes were asleep mister Oakhurst was a light sleeper Toward morning he awoke benumbed and cold As he stirred the dying fire the wind which was now blowing strongly brought to his cheek that which caused the blood to leave it snow He started to his feet with the intention of awakening the sleepers for there was no time to lose But turning to where Uncle Billy had been lying he found him gone A suspicion leaped to his brain and a curse to his lips He ran to the spot where the mules had been tethered they were no longer there The tracks were already rapidly disappearing in the snow The momentary excitement brought mister Oakhurst back to the fire with his usual calm He did not waken the sleepers The Innocent slumbered peacefully with a smile on his good humored freckled face the virgin Piney slept beside her frailer sisters as sweetly as though attended by celestial guardians and mister Oakhurst drawing his blanket over his shoulders stroked his mustaches and waited for the dawn It came slowly in a whirling mist of snowflakes that dazzled and confused the eye What could be seen of the landscape appeared magically changed He looked over the valley and summed up the present and future in two words snowed in A careful inventory of the provisions which fortunately for the party had been stored within the hut and so escaped the felonious fingers of Uncle Billy disclosed the fact that with care and prudence they might last ten days longer That is said mister Oakhurst sotto voce to the Innocent if you re willing to board us If you ain t and perhaps you d better not you can wait till Uncle Billy gets back with provisions For some occult reason mister Oakhurst could not bring himself to disclose Uncle Billy s rascality and so offered the hypothesis that he had wandered from the camp and had accidentally stampeded the animals He dropped a warning to the Duchess and Mother Shipton who of course knew the facts of their associate s defection They ll find out the truth about us all when they find out anything he added significantly and there s no good frightening them now Tom Simson not only put all his worldly store at the disposal of mister Oakhurst but seemed to enjoy the prospect of their enforced seclusion We ll have a good camp for a week and then the snow ll melt and we ll all go back together The cheerful gaiety of the young man and mister Oakhurst s calm infected the others The Innocent with the aid of pine boughs extemporized a thatch for the roofless cabin and the Duchess directed Piney in the rearrangement of the interior with a taste and tact that opened the blue eyes of that provincial maiden to their fullest extent I reckon now you re used to fine things at Poker Flat said Piney The Duchess turned away sharply to conceal something that reddened her cheeks through its professional tint and Mother Shipton requested Piney not to chatter But when mister Oakhurst returned from a weary search for the trail he heard the sound of happy laughter echoed from the rocks He stopped in some alarm and his thoughts first naturally reverted to the whisky which he had prudently cached And yet it don t somehow sound like whisky said the gambler It was not until he caught sight of the blazing fire through the still blinding storm and the group around it that he settled to the conviction that it was square fun Whether mister Oakhurst had cached his cards with the whisky as something debarred the free access of the community I cannot say It was certain that in Mother Shipton s words he didn t say cards once during that evening Haply the time was beguiled by an accordion produced somewhat ostentatiously by Tom Simson from his pack Notwithstanding some difficulties attending the manipulation of this instrument Piney Woods managed to pluck several reluctant melodies from its keys to an accompaniment by the Innocent on a pair of bone castanets But the crowning festivity of the evening was reached in a rude camp meeting hymn which the lovers joining hands sang with great earnestness and vociferation I fear that a certain defiant tone and Covenanter s swing to its chorus rather than any devotional quality caused it speedily to infect the others who at last joined in the refrain I m proud to live in the service of the Lord And I m bound to die in His army The pines rocked the storm eddied and whirled above the miserable group and the flames of their altar leaped heavenward as if in token of the vow At midnight the storm abated the rolling clouds parted and the stars glittered keenly above the sleeping camp mister Oakhurst whose professional habits had enabled him to live on the smallest possible amount of sleep in dividing the watch with Tom Simson somehow managed to take upon himself the greater part of that duty He excused himself to the Innocent by saying that he had often been a week without sleep Doing what asked Tom Poker replied Oakhurst sententiously when a man gets a streak of luck nigger luck he don t get tired The luck gives in first Luck continued the gambler reflectively is a mighty queer thing All you know about it for certain is that it s bound to change And it s finding out when it s going to change that makes you We ve had a streak of bad luck since we left Poker Flat you come along and slap you get into it too If you can hold your cards right along you re all right For added the gambler with cheerful irrelevance I m proud to live in the service of the Lord And I m bound to die in His army The third day came and the sun looking through the white curtained valley saw the outcasts divide their slowly decreasing store of provisions for the morning meal It was one of the peculiarities of that mountain climate that its rays diffused a kindly warmth over the wintry landscape as if in regretful commiseration of the past But it revealed drift on drift of snow piled high around the hut a hopeless uncharted trackless sea of white lying below the rocky shores to which the castaways still clung Through the marvelously clear air the smoke of the pastoral village of Poker Flat rose miles away Mother Shipton saw it and from a remote pinnacle of her rocky fastness hurled in that direction a final malediction It was her last vituperative attempt and perhaps for that reason was invested with a certain degree of sublimity It did her good she privately informed the Duchess Just you go out there and cuss and see She then set herself to the task of amusing the child as she and the Duchess were pleased to call Piney Piney was no chicken but it was a soothing and original theory of the pair thus to account for the fact that she didn t swear and wasn t improper When night crept up again through the gorges the reedy notes of the accordion rose and fell in fitful spasms and long drawn gasps by the flickering campfire But music failed to fill entirely the aching void left by insufficient food and a new diversion was proposed by Piney storytelling Neither mister Oakhurst nor his female companions caring to relate their personal experiences this plan would have failed too but for the Innocent Some months before he had chanced upon a stray copy of mister Pope s ingenious translation of the ILIAD He now proposed to narrate the principal incidents of that poem having thoroughly mastered the argument and fairly forgotten the words in the current vernacular of Sandy Bar And so for the rest of that night the Homeric demigods again walked the earth Trojan bully and wily Greek wrestled in the winds and the great pines in the canyon seemed to bow to the wrath of the son of Peleus mister Oakhurst listened with quiet satisfaction Most especially was he interested in the fate of Ash heels as the Innocent persisted in denominating the swift footed Achilles So with small food and much of Homer and the accordion a week passed over the heads of the outcasts The sun again forsook them and again from leaden skies the snowflakes were sifted over the land Day by day closer around them drew the snowy circle until at last they looked from their prison over drifted walls of dazzling white that towered twenty feet above their heads It became more and more difficult to replenish their fires even from the fallen trees beside them now half hidden in the drifts And yet no one complained The lovers turned from the dreary prospect and looked into each other s eyes and were happy mister Oakhurst settled himself coolly to the losing game before him The Duchess more cheerful than she had been assumed the care of Piney Only Mother Shipton once the strongest of the party seemed to sicken and fade At midnight on the tenth day she called Oakhurst to her side I m going she said in a voice of querulous weakness but don t say anything about it Don t waken the kids Take the bundle from under my head and open it mister Oakhurst did so It contained Mother Shipton s rations for the last week untouched Give em to the child she said pointing to the sleeping Piney You ve starved yourself said the gambler That s what they call it said the woman querulously as she lay down again and turning her face to the wall passed quietly away The accordion and the bones were put aside that day and Homer was forgotten When the body of Mother Shipton had been committed to the snow mister Oakhurst took the Innocent aside and showed him a pair of snowshoes which he had fashioned from the old pack saddle There s one chance in a hundred to save her yet he said pointing to Piney but it s there he added pointing toward Poker Flat If you can reach there in two days she s safe And you asked Tom Simson I ll stay here was the curt reply The lovers parted with a long embrace You are not going too said the Duchess as she saw mister Oakhurst apparently waiting to accompany him As far as the canyon he replied He turned suddenly and kissed the Duchess leaving her pallid face aflame and her trembling limbs rigid with amazement Night came but not mister Oakhurst It brought the storm again and the whirling snow Then the Duchess feeding the fire found that someone had quietly piled beside the hut enough fuel to last a few days longer The tears rose to her eyes but she hid them from Piney The women slept but little In the morning looking into each other s faces they read their fate Neither spoke but Piney accepting the position of the stronger drew near and placed her arm around the Duchess s waist They kept this attitude for the rest of the day That night the storm reached its greatest fury and rending asunder the protecting pines invaded the very hut Toward morning they found themselves unable to feed the fire which gradually died away As the embers slowly blackened the Duchess crept closer to Piney and broke the silence of many hours Piney can you pray No dear said Piney simply The Duchess without knowing exactly why felt relieved and putting her head upon Piney s shoulder spoke no more And so reclining the younger and purer pillowing the head of her soiled sister upon her virgin breast they fell asleep The wind lulled as if it feared to waken them Feathery drifts of snow shaken from the long pine boughs flew like white winged birds and settled about them as they slept The moon through the rifted clouds looked down upon what had been the camp But all human stain all trace of earthly travail was hidden beneath the spotless mantle mercifully flung from above They slept all that day and the next nor did they waken when voices and footsteps broke the silence of the camp And when pitying fingers brushed the snow from their wan faces you could scarcely have told from the equal peace that dwelt upon them which was she that had sinned Even the law of Poker Flat recognized this and turned away leaving them still locked in each other s arms But at the head of the gulch on one of the largest pine trees they found the deuce of clubs pinned to the bark with a bowie knife It bore the following written in pencil in a firm hand BENEATH THIS TREE LIES THE BODY OF JOHN OAKHURST WHO STRUCK A STREAK OF BAD LUCK ON THE twenty threeD OF NOVEMBER eighteen fifty AND HANDED IN HIS CHECKS ON THE sevenTH DECEMBER eighteen fifty And pulseless and cold with a Derringer by his side and a bullet in his heart though still calm as in life beneath the snow lay he who was at once the strongest and yet the weakest of the outcasts of Poker Flat MIGGLES We were eight including the driver We had not spoken during the passage of the last six miles since the jolting of the heavy vehicle over the roughening road had spoiled the Judge s last poetical quotation The tall man beside the Judge was asleep his arm passed through the swaying strap and his head resting upon it altogether a limp helpless looking object as if he had hanged himself and been cut down too late The French lady on the back seat was asleep too yet in a half conscious propriety of attitude shown even in the disposition of the handkerchief which she held to her forehead and which partially veiled her face The lady from Virginia City traveling with her husband had long since lost all individuality in a wild confusion of ribbons veils furs and shawls There was no sound but the rattling of wheels and the dash of rain upon the roof Suddenly the stage stopped and we became dimly aware of voices The driver was evidently in the midst of an exciting colloquy with someone in the road a colloquy of which such fragments as bridge gone twenty feet of water can t pass were occasionally distinguishable above the storm Then came a lull and a mysterious voice from the road shouted the parting adjuration Try Miggles s We caught a glimpse of our leaders as the vehicle slowly turned of a horseman vanishing through the rain and we were evidently on our way to Miggles s Who and where was Miggles The Judge our authority did not remember the name and he knew the country thoroughly The Washoe traveler thought Miggles must keep a hotel We only knew that we were stopped by high water in front and rear and that Miggles was our rock of refuge A ten minutes splashing through a tangled by road scarcely wide enough for the stage and we drew up before a barred and boarded gate in a wide stone wall or fence about eight feet high Evidently Miggles s and evidently Miggles did not keep a hotel The driver got down and tried the gate It was securely locked Miggles O Miggles No answer Migg ells You Miggles continued the driver with rising wrath Migglesy joined the expressman persuasively O Miggy Mig But no reply came from the apparently insensate Miggles The Judge who had finally got the window down put his head out and propounded a series of questions which if answered categorically would have undoubtedly elucidated the whole mystery but which the driver evaded by replying that if we didn t want to sit in the coach all night we had better rise up and sing out for Miggles So we rose up and called on Miggles in chorus then separately And when we had finished a Hibernian fellow passenger from the roof called for Maygells whereat we all laughed While we were laughing the driver cried Shoo We listened To our infinite amazement the chorus of Miggles was repeated from the other side of the wall even to the final and supplemental Maygells Extraordinary echo said the Judge Extraordinary damned skunk roared the driver contemptuously Come out of that Miggles and show yourself Be a man Miggles Don t hide in the dark I wouldn t if I were you Miggles continued Yuba Bill now dancing about in an excess of fury Miggles continued the voice O Miggles My good man mister Myghail said the Judge softening the asperities of the name as much as possible Consider the inhospitality of refusing shelter from the inclemency of the weather to helpless females Really my dear sir But a succession of Miggles ending in a burst of laughter drowned his voice Yuba Bill hesitated no longer Taking a heavy stone from the road he battered down the gate and with the expressman entered the enclosure We followed Nobody was to be seen In the gathering darkness all that we could distinguish was that we were in a garden from the rosebushes that scattered over us a minute spray from their dripping leaves and before a long rambling wooden building Do you know this Miggles asked the Judge of Yuba Bill No nor don t want to said Bill shortly who felt the Pioneer Stage Company insulted in his person by the contumacious Miggles But my dear sir expostulated the Judge as he thought of the barred gate Lookee here said Yuba Bill with fine irony hadn t you better go back and sit in the coach till yer introduced I m going in and he pushed open the door of the building A long room lighted only by the embers of a fire that was dying on the large hearth at its farther extremity the walls curiously papered and the flickering firelight bringing out its grotesque pattern somebody sitting in a large armchair by the fireplace All this we saw as we crowded together into the room after the driver and expressman Hello be you Miggles said Yuba Bill to the solitary occupant The figure neither spoke nor stirred Yuba Bill walked wrathfully toward it and turned the eye of his coach lantern upon its face It was a man s face prematurely old and wrinkled with very large eyes in which there was that expression of perfectly gratuitous solemnity which I had sometimes seen in an owl s The large eyes wandered from Bill s face to the lantern and finally fixed their gaze on that luminous object without further recognition Bill restrained himself with an effort Miggles Be you deaf You ain t dumb anyhow you know and Yuba Bill shook the insensate figure by the shoulder To our great dismay as Bill removed his hand the venerable stranger apparently collapsed sinking into half his size and an undistinguishable heap of clothing Well dern my skin said Bill looking appealingly at us and hopelessly retiring from the contest The Judge now stepped forward and we lifted the mysterious invertebrate back into his original position Bill was dismissed with the lantern to reconnoiter outside for it was evident that from the helplessness of this solitary man there must be attendants near at hand and we all drew around the fire The Judge who had regained his authority and had never lost his conversational amiability standing before us with his back to the hearth charged us as an imaginary jury as follows It is evident that either our distinguished friend here has reached that condition described by Shakespeare as the sere and yellow leaf or has suffered some premature abatement of his mental and physical faculties Whether he is really the Miggles Here he was interrupted by Miggles O Miggles Migglesy Mig and in fact the whole chorus of Miggles in very much the same key as it had once before been delivered unto us We gazed at each other for a moment in some alarm The Judge in particular vacated his position quickly as the voice seemed to come directly over his shoulder The cause however was soon discovered in a large magpie who was perched upon a shelf over the fireplace and who immediately relapsed into a sepulchral silence which contrasted singularly with his previous volubility It was undoubtedly his voice which we had heard in the road and our friend in the chair was not responsible for the discourtesy Yuba Bill who re entered the room after an unsuccessful search was loath to accept the explanation and still eyed the helpless sitter with suspicion He had found a shed in which he had put up his horses but he came back dripping and skeptical Thar ain t nobody but him within ten mile of the shanty and that ar damned old skeesicks knows it But the faith of the majority proved to be securely based Bill had scarcely ceased growling before we heard a quick step upon the porch the trailing of a wet skirt the door was flung open and with flash of white teeth a sparkle of dark eyes and an utter absence of ceremony or diffidence a young woman entered shut the door and panting leaned back against it Oh if you please I m Miggles And this was Miggles this bright eyed full throated young woman whose wet gown of coarse blue stuff could not hide the beauty of the feminine curves to which it clung from the chestnut crown of whose head topped by a man s oilskin sou wester to the little feet and ankles hidden somewhere in the recesses of her boy s brogans all was grace this was Miggles laughing at us too in the most airy frank offhand manner imaginable You see boys said she quite out of breath and holding one little hand against her side quite unheeding the speechless discomfiture of our party or the complete demoralization of Yuba Bill whose features had relaxed into an expression of gratuitous and imbecile cheerfulness you see boys I was mor n two miles away when you passed down the road I thought you might pull up here and so I ran the whole way knowing nobody was home but Jim and and I m out of breath and that lets me out And here Miggles caught her dripping oilskin hat from her head with a mischievous swirl that scattered a shower of raindrops over us attempted to put back her hair dropped two hairpins in the attempt laughed and sat down beside Yuba Bill with her hands crossed lightly on her lap The Judge recovered himself first and essayed an extravagant compliment I ll trouble you for that thar harpin said Miggles gravely Half a dozen hands were eagerly stretched forward the missing hairpin was restored to its fair owner and Miggles crossing the room looked keenly in the face of the invalid The solemn eyes looked back at hers with an expression we had never seen before Life and intelligence seemed to struggle back into the rugged face Miggles laughed again it was a singularly eloquent laugh and turned her black eyes and white teeth once more toward us This afflicted person is hesitated the Judge Jim said Miggles Your father No Brother No Husband Miggles darted a quick half defiant glance at the two lady passengers who I had noticed did not participate in the general masculine admiration of Miggles and said gravely No it s Jim There was an awkward pause The lady passengers moved closer to each other the Washoe husband looked abstractedly at the fire and the tall man apparently turned his eyes inward for self support at this emergency But Miggles s laugh which was very infectious broke the silence Come she said briskly you must be hungry Who ll bear a hand to help me get tea She had no lack of volunteers In a few moments Yuba Bill was engaged like Caliban in bearing logs for this Miranda the expressman was grinding coffee on the veranda to myself the arduous duty of slicing bacon was assigned and the Judge lent each man his good humored and voluble counsel And when Miggles assisted by the Judge and our Hibernian deck passenger set the table with all the available crockery we had become quite joyous in spite of the rain that beat against windows the wind that whirled down the chimney the two ladies who whispered together in the corner or the magpie who uttered a satirical and croaking commentary on their conversation from his perch above In the now bright blazing fire we could see that the walls were papered with illustrated journals arranged with feminine taste and discrimination The furniture was extemporized and adapted from candle boxes and packing cases and covered with gay calico or the skin of some animal The armchair of the helpless Jim was an ingenious variation of a flour barrel There was neatness and even a taste for the picturesque to be seen in the few details of the long low room The meal was a culinary success But more it was a social triumph chiefly I think owing to the rare tact of Miggles in guiding the conversation asking all the questions herself yet bearing throughout a frankness that rejected the idea of any concealment on her own part so that we talked of ourselves of our prospects of the journey of the weather of each other of everything but our host and hostess It must be confessed that Miggles s conversation was never elegant rarely grammatical and that at times she employed expletives the use of which had generally been yielded to our sex But they were delivered with such a lighting up of teeth and eyes and were usually followed by a laugh a laugh peculiar to Miggles so frank and honest that it seemed to clear the moral atmosphere Once during the meal we heard a noise like the rubbing of a heavy body against the outer walls of the house This was shortly followed by a scratching and sniffling at the door That s Joaquin said Miggles in reply to our questioning glances would you like to see him Before we could answer she had opened the door and disclosed a half grown grizzly who instantly raised himself on his haunches with his forepaws hanging down in the popular attitude of mendicancy and looked admiringly at Miggles with a very singular resemblance in his manner to Yuba Bill That s my watch dog said Miggles in explanation Oh he don t bite she added as the two lady passengers fluttered into a corner Does he old Toppy the latter remark being addressed directly to the sagacious Joaquin I tell you what boys continued Miggles after she had fed and closed the door on URSA MINOR you were in big luck that Joaquin wasn t hanging round when you dropped in tonight Where was he asked the Judge With me said Miggles Lord love you he trots round with me nights like as if he was a man We were silent for a few moments and listened to the wind Perhaps we all had the same picture before us of Miggles walking through the rainy woods with her savage guardian at her side The Judge I remember said something about Una and her lion but Miggles received it as she did other compliments with quiet gravity Whether she was altogether unconscious of the admiration she excited she could hardly have been oblivious of Yuba Bill s adoration I know not but her very frankness suggested a perfect sexual equality that was cruelly humiliating to the younger members of our party The incident of the bear did not add anything in Miggles s favor to the opinions of those of her own sex who were present In fact the repast over a chillness radiated from the two lady passengers that no pine boughs brought in by Yuba Bill and cast as a sacrifice upon the hearth could wholly overcome Miggles felt it and suddenly declaring that it was time to turn in offered to show the ladies to their bed in an adjoining room You boys will have to camp out here by the fire as well as you can she added for thar ain t but the one room Our sex by which my dear sir I allude of course to the stronger portion of humanity has been generally relieved from the imputation of curiosity or a fondness for gossip Yet I am constrained to say that hardly had the door closed on Miggles than we crowded together whispering snickering smiling and exchanging suspicions surmises and a thousand speculations in regard to our pretty hostess and her singular companion I fear that we even hustled that imbecile paralytic who sat like a voiceless Memnon in our midst gazing with the serene indifference of the Past in his passionate eyes upon our wordy counsels In the midst of an exciting discussion the door opened again and Miggles re entered But not apparently the same Miggles who a few hours before had flashed upon us Her eyes were downcast and as she hesitated for a moment on the threshold with a blanket on her arm she seemed to have left behind her the frank fearlessness which had charmed us a moment before Coming into the room she drew a low stool beside the paralytic s chair sat down drew the blanket over her shoulders and saying If it s all the same to you boys as we re rather crowded I ll stop here tonight took the invalid s withered hand in her own and turned her eyes upon the dying fire An instinctive feeling that this was only premonitory to more confidential relations and perhaps some shame at our previous curiosity kept us silent The rain still beat upon the roof wandering gusts of wind stirred the embers into momentary brightness until in a lull of the elements Miggles suddenly lifted up her head and throwing her hair over her shoulder turned her face upon the group and asked Is there any of you that knows me There was no reply Think again I lived at Marysville in fifty three Everybody knew me there and everybody had the right to know me I kept the Polka saloon until I came to live with Jim That s six years ago Perhaps I ve changed some The absence of recognition may have disconcerted her She turned her head to the fire again and it was some seconds before she again spoke and then more rapidly Well you see I thought some of you must have known me There s no great harm done anyway What I was going to say was this Jim here she took his hand in both of hers as she spoke used to know me if you didn t and spent a heap of money upon me I reckon he spent all he had And one day it s six years ago this winter Jim came into my back room sat down on my sofy like as you see him in that chair and never moved again without help He was struck all of a heap and never seemed to know what ailed him The doctors came and said as how it was caused all along of his way of life for Jim was mighty free and wild like and that he would never get better and couldn t last long anyway They advised me to send him to Frisco to the hospital for he was no good to anyone and would be a baby all his life Perhaps it was something in Jim s eye perhaps it was that I never had a baby but I said No I was rich then for I was popular with everybody gentlemen like yourself sir came to see me and I sold out my business and bought this yer place because it was sort of out of the way of travel you see and I brought my baby here With a woman s intuitive tact and poetry she had as she spoke slowly shifted her position so as to bring the mute figure of the ruined man between her and her audience hiding in the shadow behind it as if she offered it as a tacit apology for her actions Silent and expressionless it yet spoke for her helpless crushed and smitten with the Divine thunderbolt it still stretched an invisible arm around her Hidden in the darkness but still holding his hand she went on It was a long time before I could get the hang of things about yer for I was used to company and excitement I couldn t get any woman to help me and a man I dursen t trust but what with the Indians hereabout who d do odd jobs for me and having everything sent from the North Fork Jim and I managed to worry through The Doctor would run up from Sacramento once in a while He d ask to see Miggles s baby as he called Jim and when he d go away he d say Miggles you re a trump God bless you and it didn t seem so lonely after that But the last time he was here he said as he opened the door to go Do you know Miggles your baby will grow up to be a man yet and an honor to his mother but not here Miggles not here And I thought he went away sad and and and here Miggles s voice and head were somehow both lost completely in the shadow The folks about here are very kind said Miggles after a pause coming a little into the light again The men from the fork used to hang around here until they found they wasn t wanted and the women are kind and don t call I was pretty lonely until I picked up Joaquin in the woods yonder one day when he wasn t so high and taught him to beg for his dinner and then thar s Polly that s the magpie she knows no end of tricks and makes it quite sociable of evenings with her talk and so I don t feel like as I was the only living being about the ranch And Jim here said Miggles with her old laugh again and coming out quite into the firelight Jim why boys you would admire to see how much he knows for a man like him Sometimes I bring him flowers and he looks at em just as natural as if he knew em and times when we re sitting alone I read him those things on the wall Why Lord said Miggles with her frank laugh I ve read him that whole side of the house this winter There never was such a man for reading as Jim Why asked the Judge do you not marry this man to whom you have devoted your youthful life Well you see said Miggles it would be playing it rather low down on Jim to take advantage of his being so helpless And then too if we were man and wife now we d both know that I was bound to do what I do now of my own accord But you are young yet and attractive It s getting late said Miggles gravely and you d better all turn in Good night boys and throwing the blanket over her head Miggles laid herself down beside Jim s chair her head pillowed on the low stool that held his feet and spoke no more The fire slowly faded from the hearth we each sought our blankets in silence and presently there was no sound in the long room but the pattering of the rain upon the roof and the heavy breathing of the sleepers It was nearly morning when I awoke from a troubled dream The storm had passed the stars were shining and through the shutterless window the full moon lifting itself over the solemn pines without looked into the room It touched the lonely figure in the chair with an infinite compassion and seemed to baptize with a shining flood the lowly head of the woman whose hair as in the sweet old story bathed the feet of him she loved It even lent a kindly poetry to the rugged outline of Yuba Bill half reclining on his elbow between them and his passengers with savagely patient eyes keeping watch and ward And then I fell asleep and only woke at broad day with Yuba Bill standing over me and All aboard ringing in my ears Coffee was waiting for us on the table but Miggles was gone We wandered about the house and lingered long after the horses were harnessed but she did not return It was evident that she wished to avoid a formal leave taking and had so left us to depart as we had come After we had helped the ladies into the coach we returned to the house and solemnly shook hands with the paralytic Jim as solemnly settling him back into position after each handshake Then we looked for the last time around the long low room at the stool where Miggles had sat and slowly took our seats in the waiting coach The whip cracked and we were off But as we reached the highroad Bill s dexterous hand laid the six horses back on their haunches and the stage stopped with a jerk For there on a little eminence beside the road stood Miggles her hair flying her eyes sparkling her white handkerchief waving and her white teeth flashing a last good by We waved our hats in return And then Yuba Bill as if fearful of further fascination madly lashed his horses forward and we sank back in our seats We exchanged not a word until we reached the North Fork and the stage drew up at the Independence House Then the Judge leading we walked into the barroom and took our places gravely at the bar Are your glasses charged gentlemen said the Judge solemnly taking off his white hat They were Well then here s to MIGGLES GOD BLESS HER Perhaps He had Who knows TENNESSEE S PARTNER I do not think that we ever knew his real name Our ignorance of it certainly never gave us any social inconvenience for at Sandy Bar in eighteen fifty four most men were christened anew Sometimes these appellatives were derived from some distinctiveness of dress as in the case of Dungaree Jack or from some peculiarity of habit as shown in Saleratus Bill so called from an undue proportion of that chemical in his daily bread or for some unlucky slip as exhibited in The Iron Pirate a mild inoffensive man who earned that baleful title by his unfortunate mispronunciation of the term iron pyrites Perhaps this may have been the beginning of a rude heraldry but I am constrained to think that it was because a man s real name in that day rested solely upon his own unsupported statement Call yourself Clifford do you said Boston addressing a timid newcomer with infinite scorn hell is full of such Cliffords He then introduced the unfortunate man whose name happened to be really Clifford as Jay bird Charley an unhallowed inspiration of the moment that clung to him ever after But to return to Tennessee s Partner whom we never knew by any other than this relative title that he had ever existed as a separate and distinct individuality we only learned later It seems that in eighteen fifty three he left Poker Flat to go to San Francisco ostensibly to procure a wife He never got any farther than Stockton At that place he was attracted by a young person who waited upon the table at the hotel where he took his meals One morning he said something to her which caused her to smile not unkindly to somewhat coquettishly break a plate of toast over his upturned serious simple face and to retreat to the kitchen He followed her and emerged a few moments later covered with more toast and victory That day week they were married by a justice of the peace and returned to Poker Flat I am aware that something more might be made of this episode but I prefer to tell it as it was current at Sandy Bar in the gulches and barrooms where all sentiment was modified by a strong sense of humor Of their married felicity but little is known perhaps for the reason that Tennessee then living with his Partner one day took occasion to say something to the bride on his own account at which it is said she smiled not unkindly and chastely retreated this time as far as Marysville where Tennessee followed her and where they went to housekeeping without the aid of a justice of the peace Tennessee s Partner took the loss of his wife simply and seriously as was his fashion But to everybody s surprise when Tennessee one day returned from Marysville without his Partner s wife she having smiled and retreated with somebody else Tennessee s Partner was the first man to shake his hand and greet him with affection The boys who had gathered in the canyon to see the shooting were naturally indignant Their indignation might have found vent in sarcasm but for a certain look in Tennessee s Partner s eye that indicated a lack of humorous appreciation In fact he was a grave man with a steady application to practical detail which was unpleasant in a difficulty Meanwhile a popular feeling against Tennessee had grown up on the Bar He was known to be a gambler he was suspected to be a thief In these suspicions Tennessee s Partner was equally compromised his continued intimacy with Tennessee after the affair above quoted could only be accounted for on the hypothesis of a copartnership of crime At last Tennessee s guilt became flagrant One day he overtook a stranger on his way to Red Dog The stranger afterward related that Tennessee beguiled the time with interesting anecdote and reminiscence but illogically concluded the interview in the following words And now young man I ll trouble you for your knife your pistols and your money You see your weppings might get you into trouble at Red Dog and your money s a temptation to the evilly disposed I think you said your address was San Francisco I shall endeavor to call It may be stated here that Tennessee had a fine flow of humor which no business preoccupation could wholly subdue This exploit was his last Red Dog and Sandy Bar made common cause against the highwayman Tennessee was hunted in very much the same fashion as his prototype the grizzly As the toils closed around him he made a desperate dash through the Bar emptying his revolver at the crowd before the Arcade Saloon and so on up Grizzly Canyon but at its farther extremity he was stopped by a small man on a gray horse The men looked at each other a moment in silence Both were fearless both self possessed and independent and both types of a civilization that in the seventeenth century would have been called heroic but in the nineteenth simply reckless What have you got there I call said Tennessee quietly Two bowers and an ace said the stranger as quietly showing two revolvers and a bowie knife That takes me returned Tennessee and with this gamblers epigram he threw away his useless pistol and rode back with his captor It was a warm night The cool breeze which usually sprang up with the going down of the sun behind the chaparral crested mountain was that evening withheld from Sandy Bar The little canyon was stifling with heated resinous odors and the decaying driftwood on the Bar sent forth faint sickening exhalations The feverishness of day and its fierce passions still filled the camp Lights moved restlessly along the bank of the river striking no answering reflection from its tawny current Against the blackness of the pines the windows of the old loft above the express office stood out staringly bright and through their curtainless panes the loungers below could see the forms of those who were even then deciding the fate of Tennessee And above all this etched on the dark firmament rose the Sierra remote and passionless crowned with remoter passionless stars The trial of Tennessee was conducted as fairly as was consistent with a judge and jury who felt themselves to some extent obliged to justify in their verdict the previous irregularities of arrest and indictment The law of Sandy Bar was implacable but not vengeful The excitement and personal feeling of the chase were over with Tennessee safe in their hands they were ready to listen patiently to any defense which they were already satisfied was insufficient There being no doubt in their own minds they were willing to give the prisoner the benefit of any that might exist Secure in the hypothesis that he ought to be hanged on general principles they indulged him with more latitude of defense than his reckless hardihood seemed to ask The Judge appeared to be more anxious than the prisoner who otherwise unconcerned evidently took a grim pleasure in the responsibility he had created I don t take any hand in this yer game had been his invariable but good humored reply to all questions The Judge who was also his captor for a moment vaguely regretted that he had not shot him on sight that morning but presently dismissed this human weakness as unworthy of the judicial mind Nevertheless when there was a tap at the door and it was said that Tennessee s Partner was there on behalf of the prisoner he was admitted at once without question Perhaps the younger members of the jury to whom the proceedings were becoming irksomely thoughtful hailed him as a relief For he was not certainly an imposing figure Short and stout with a square face sunburned into a preternatural redness clad in a loose duck jumper and trousers streaked and splashed with red soil his aspect under any circumstances would have been quaint and was now even ridiculous As he stooped to deposit at his feet a heavy carpetbag he was carrying it became obvious from partially developed legends and inscriptions that the material with which his trousers had been patched had been originally intended for a less ambitious covering Yet he advanced with great gravity and after having shaken the hand of each person in the room with labored cordiality he wiped his serious perplexed face on a red bandanna handkerchief a shade lighter than his complexion laid his powerful hand upon the table to steady himself and thus addressed the Judge I was passin by he began by way of apology and I thought I d just step in and see how things was gittin on with Tennessee thar my pardner It s a hot night I disremember any sich weather before on the Bar He paused a moment but nobody volunteering any other meteorological recollection he again had recourse to his pocket handkerchief and for some moments mopped his face diligently Have you anything to say in behalf of the prisoner said the Judge finally Thet s it said Tennessee s Partner in a tone of relief I come yar as Tennessee s pardner knowing him nigh on four year off and on wet and dry in luck and out o luck His ways ain t allers my ways but thar ain t any p ints in that young man thar ain t any liveliness as he s been up to as I don t know And you sez to me sez you confidential like and between man and man sez you Do you know anything in his behalf and I sez to you sez I confidential like as between man and man What should a man know of his pardner Is this all you have to say asked the Judge impatiently feeling perhaps that a dangerous sympathy of humor was beginning to humanize the Court Thet s so continued Tennessee s Partner It ain t for me to say anything agin him And now what s the case Here s Tennessee wants money wants it bad and doesn t like to ask it of his old pardner Well what does Tennessee do He lays for a stranger and he fetches that stranger And you lays for HIM and you fetches HIM and the honors is easy And I put it to you bein a far minded man and to you gentlemen all as far minded men ef this isn t so Prisoner said the Judge interrupting have you any questions to ask this man No no continued Tennessee s Partner hastily I play this yer hand alone To come down to the bedrock it s just this Tennessee thar has played it pretty rough and expensive like on a stranger and on this yer camp And now what s the fair thing Some would say more some would say less Here s seventeen hundred dollars in coarse gold and a watch it s about all my pile and call it square And before a hand could be raised to prevent him he had emptied the contents of the carpetbag upon the table For a moment his life was in jeopardy One or two men sprang to their feet several hands groped for hidden weapons and a suggestion to throw him from the window was only overridden by a gesture from the Judge Tennessee laughed And apparently oblivious of the excitement Tennessee s Partner improved the opportunity to mop his face again with his handkerchief When order was restored and the man was made to understand by the use of forcible figures and rhetoric that Tennessee s offense could not be condoned by money his face took a more serious and sanguinary hue and those who were nearest to him noticed that his rough hand trembled slightly on the table He hesitated a moment as he slowly returned the gold to the carpetbag as if he had not yet entirely caught the elevated sense of justice which swayed the tribunal and was perplexed with the belief that he had not offered enough Then he turned to the Judge and saying This yer is a lone hand played alone and without my pardner he bowed to the jury and was about to withdraw when the Judge called him back If you have anything to say to Tennessee you had better say it now For the first time that evening the eyes of the prisoner and his strange advocate met Tennessee smiled showed his white teeth and saying Euchred old man held out his hand Tennessee s Partner took it in his own and saying I just dropped in as I was passin to see how things was gettin on let the hand passively fall and adding that it was a warm night again mopped his face with his handkerchief and without another word withdrew The two men never again met each other alive For the unparalleled insult of a bribe offered to Judge Lynch who whether bigoted weak or narrow was at least incorruptible firmly fixed in the mind of that mythical personage any wavering determination of Tennessee s fate and at the break of day he was marched closely guarded to meet it at the top of Marley s Hill How he met it how cool he was how he refused to say anything how perfect were the arrangements of the committee were all duly reported with the addition of a warning moral and example to all future evildoers in the RED DOG CLARION by its editor who was present and to whose vigorous English I cheerfully refer the reader But the beauty of that midsummer morning the blessed amity of earth and air and sky the awakened life of the free woods and hills the joyous renewal and promise of Nature and above all the infinite Serenity that thrilled through each was not reported as not being a part of the social lesson And yet when the weak and foolish deed was done and a life with its possibilities and responsibilities had passed out of the misshapen thing that dangled between earth and sky the birds sang the flowers bloomed the sun shone as cheerily as before and possibly the RED DOG CLARION was right Tennessee s Partner was not in the group that surrounded the ominous tree But as they turned to disperse attention was drawn to the singular appearance of a motionless donkey cart halted at the side of the road As they approached they at once recognized the venerable Jenny and the two wheeled cart as the property of Tennessee s Partner used by him in carrying dirt from his claim and a few paces distant the owner of the equipage himself sitting under a buckeye tree wiping the perspiration from his glowing face In answer to an inquiry he said he had come for the body of the diseased if it was all the same to the committee He didn t wish to hurry anything he could wait He was not working that day and when the gentlemen were done with the diseased he would take him Ef thar is any present he added in his simple serious way as would care to jine in the fun l they kin come Perhaps it was from a sense of humor which I have already intimated was a feature of Sandy Bar perhaps it was from something even better than that but two thirds of the loungers accepted the invitation at once It was noon when the body of Tennessee was delivered into the hands of his Partner As the cart drew up to the fatal tree we noticed that it contained a rough oblong box apparently made from a section of sluicing and half filled with bark and the tassels of pine The cart was further decorated with slips of willow and made fragrant with buckeye blossoms When the body was deposited in the box Tennessee s Partner drew over it a piece of tarred canvas and gravely mounting the narrow seat in front with his feet upon the shafts urged the little donkey forward The equipage moved slowly on at that decorous pace which was habitual with Jenny even under less solemn circumstances The men half curiously half jestingly but all good humoredly strolled along beside the cart some in advance some a little in the rear of the homely catafalque But whether from the narrowing of the road or some present sense of decorum as the cart passed on the company fell to the rear in couples keeping step and otherwise assuming the external show of a formal procession Jack Folinsbee who had at the outset played a funeral march in dumb show upon an imaginary trombone desisted from a lack of sympathy and appreciation not having perhaps your true humorist s capacity to be content with the enjoyment of his own fun The way led through Grizzly Canyon by this time clothed in funereal drapery and shadows The redwoods burying their moccasined feet in the red soil stood in Indian file along the track trailing an uncouth benediction from their bending boughs upon the passing bier A hare surprised into helpless inactivity sat upright and pulsating in the ferns by the roadside as the cortege went by Squirrels hastened to gain a secure outlook from higher boughs and the bluejays spreading their wings fluttered before them like outriders until the outskirts of Sandy Bar were reached and the solitary cabin of Tennessee s Partner Viewed under more favorable circumstances it would not have been a cheerful place The unpicturesque site the rude and unlovely outlines the unsavory details which distinguish the nest building of the California miner were all here with the dreariness of decay superadded A few paces from the cabin there was a rough enclosure which in the brief days of Tennessee s Partner s matrimonial felicity had been used as a garden but was now overgrown with fern As we approached it we were surprised to find that what we had taken for a recent attempt at cultivation was the broken soil about an open grave The cart was halted before the enclosure and rejecting the offers of assistance with the same air of simple self reliance he had displayed throughout Tennessee s Partner lifted the rough coffin on his back and deposited it unaided within the shallow grave He then nailed down the board which served as a lid and mounting the little mound of earth beside it took off his hat and slowly mopped his face with his handkerchief This the crowd felt was a preliminary to speech and they disposed themselves variously on stumps and boulders and sat expectant When a man began Tennessee s Partner slowly has been running free all day what s the natural thing for him to do Why to come home And if he ain t in a condition to go home what can his best friend do Why bring him home And here s Tennessee has been running free and we brings him home from his wandering He paused and picked up a fragment of quartz rubbed it thoughtfully on his sleeve and went on It ain t the first time that I ve packed him on my back as you see d me now It ain t the first time that I brought him to this yer cabin when he couldn t help himself it ain t the first time that I and Jinny have waited for him on yon hill and picked him up and so fetched him home when he couldn t speak and didn t know me And now that it s the last time why he paused and rubbed the quartz gently on his sleeve you see it s sort of rough on his pardner And now gentlemen he added abruptly picking up his long handled shovel the fun l s over and my thanks and Tennessee s thanks to you for your trouble Resisting any proffers of assistance he began to fill in the grave turning his back upon the crowd that after a few moments hesitation gradually withdrew As they crossed the little ridge that hid Sandy Bar from view some looking back thought they could see Tennessee s Partner his work done sitting upon the grave his shovel between his knees and his face buried in his red bandanna handkerchief But it was argued by others that you couldn t tell his face from his handkerchief at that distance and this point remained undecided In the reaction that followed the feverish excitement of that day Tennessee s Partner was not forgotten A secret investigation had cleared him of any complicity in Tennessee s guilt and left only a suspicion of his general sanity Sandy Bar made a point of calling on him and proffering various uncouth but well meant kindnesses But from that day his rude health and great strength seemed visibly to decline and when the rainy season fairly set in and the tiny grass blades were beginning to peep from the rocky mound above Tennessee s grave he took to his bed One night when the pines beside the cabin were swaying in the storm and trailing their slender fingers over the roof and the roar and rush of the swollen river were heard below Tennessee s Partner lifted his head from the pillow saying It is time to go for Tennessee I must put Jinny in the cart and would have risen from his bed but for the restraint of his attendant Struggling he still pursued his singular fancy There now steady Jinny steady old girl How dark it is Look out for the ruts and look out for him too old gal Sometimes you know when he s blind drunk he drops down right in the trail Keep on straight up to the pine on the top of the hill Thar I told you so thar he is coming this way too all by himself sober and his face a shining Tennessee Pardner And so they met THE IDYL OF RED GULCH Sandy was very drunk He was lying under an azalea bush in pretty much the same attitude in which he had fallen some hours before How long he had been lying there he could not tell and didn t care how long he should lie there was a matter equally indefinite and unconsidered A tranquil philosophy born of his physical condition suffused and saturated his moral being The spectacle of a drunken man and of this drunken man in particular was not I grieve to say of sufficient novelty in Red Gulch to attract attention Earlier in the day some local satirist had erected a temporary tombstone at Sandy s head bearing the inscription Effects of McCorkle s whisky kills at forty rods with a hand pointing to McCorkle s saloon But this I imagine was like most local satire personal and was a reflection upon the unfairness of the process rather than a commentary upon the impropriety of the result With this facetious exception Sandy had been undisturbed A wandering mule released from his pack had cropped the scant herbage beside him and sniffed curiously at the prostrate man a vagabond dog with that deep sympathy which the species have for drunken men had licked his dusty boots and curled himself up at his feet and lay there blinking one eye in the sunlight with a simulation of dissipation that was ingenious and doglike in its implied flattery of the unconscious man beside him Meanwhile the shadows of the pine trees had slowly swung around until they crossed the road and their trunks barred the open meadow with gigantic parallels of black and yellow Little puffs of red dust lifted by the plunging hoofs of passing teams dispersed in a grimy shower upon the recumbent man The sun sank lower and lower and still Sandy stirred not And then the repose of this philosopher was disturbed as other philosophers have been by the intrusion of an unphilosophical sex Miss Mary as she was known to the little flock that she had just dismissed from the log schoolhouse beyond the pines was taking her afternoon walk Observing an unusually fine cluster of blossoms on the azalea bush opposite she crossed the road to pluck it picking her way through the red dust not without certain fierce little shivers of disgust and some feline circumlocution And then she came suddenly upon Sandy Of course she uttered the little staccato cry of her sex But when she had paid that tribute to her physical weakness she became overbold and halted for a moment at least six feet from this prostrate monster with her white skirts gathered in her hand ready for flight But neither sound nor motion came from the bush With one little foot she then overturned the satirical headboard and muttered Beasts an epithet which probably at that moment conveniently classified in her mind the entire male population of Red Gulch For Miss Mary being possessed of certain rigid notions of her own had not perhaps properly appreciated the demonstrative gallantry for which the Californian has been so justly celebrated by his brother Californians and had as a newcomer perhaps fairly earned the reputation of being stuck up As she stood there she noticed also that the slant sunbeams were heating Sandy s head to what she judged to be an unhealthy temperature and that his hat was lying uselessly at his side To pick it up and to place it over his face was a work requiring some courage particularly as his eyes were open Yet she did it and made good her retreat But she was somewhat concerned on looking back to see that the hat was removed and that Sandy was sitting up and saying something The truth was that in the calm depths of Sandy s mind he was satisfied that the rays of the sun were beneficial and healthful that from childhood he had objected to lying down in a hat that no people but condemned fools past redemption ever wore hats and that his right to dispense with them when he pleased was inalienable This was the statement of his inner consciousness Unfortunately its outward expression was vague being limited to a repetition of the following formula Su shine all ri Wasser maar eh Wass up su shine Miss Mary stopped and taking fresh courage from her vantage of distance asked him if there was anything that he wanted Wass up Wasser maar continued Sandy in a very high key Get up you horrid man said Miss Mary now thoroughly incensed get up and go home Sandy staggered to his feet He was six feet high and Miss Mary trembled He started forward a few paces and then stopped Wass I go home for he suddenly asked with great gravity Go and take a bath replied Miss Mary eying his grimy person with great disfavor To her infinite dismay Sandy suddenly pulled off his coat and vest threw them on the ground kicked off his boots and plunging wildly forward darted headlong over the hill in the direction of the river Goodness heavens the man will be drowned said Miss Mary and then with feminine inconsistency she ran back to the schoolhouse and locked herself in That night while seated at supper with her hostess the blacksmith s wife it came to Miss Mary to ask demurely if her husband ever got drunk Abner responded missus Stidger reflectively let s see Abner hasn t been tight since last lection Miss Mary would have liked to ask if he preferred lying in the sun on these occasions and if a cold bath would have hurt him but this would have involved an explanation which she did not then care to give So she contented herself with opening her gray eyes widely at the red cheeked missus Stidger a fine specimen of Southwestern efflorescence and then dismissed the subject altogether The next day she wrote to her dearest friend in Boston I think I find the intoxicated portion of this community the least objectionable I refer my dear to the men of course I do not know anything that could make the women tolerable In less than a week Miss Mary had forgotten this episode except that her afternoon walks took thereafter almost unconsciously another direction She noticed however that every morning a fresh cluster of azalea blossoms appeared among the flowers on her desk This was not strange as her little flock were aware of her fondness for flowers and invariably kept her desk bright with anemones syringas and lupines but on questioning them they one and all professed ignorance of the azaleas A few days later Master Johnny Stidger whose desk was nearest to the window was suddenly taken with spasms of apparently gratuitous laughter that threatened the discipline of the school All that Miss Mary could get from him was that someone had been looking in the winder Irate and indignant she sallied from her hive to do battle with the intruder As she turned the corner of the schoolhouse she came plump upon the quondam drunkard now perfectly sober and inexpressibly sheepish and guilty looking These facts Miss Mary was not slow to take a feminine advantage of in her present humor But it was somewhat confusing to observe also that the beast despite some faint signs of past dissipation was amiable looking in fact a kind of blond Samson whose corn colored silken beard apparently had never yet known the touch of barber s razor or Delilah s shears So that the cutting speech which quivered on her ready tongue died upon her lips and she contented herself with receiving his stammering apology with supercilious eyelids and the gathered skirts of uncontamination When she re entered the schoolroom her eyes fell upon the azaleas with a new sense of revelation And then she laughed and the little people all laughed and they were all unconsciously very happy It was on a hot day and not long after this that two short legged boys came to grief on the threshold of the school with a pail of water which they had laboriously brought from the spring and that Miss Mary compassionately seized the pail and started for the spring herself At the foot of the hill a shadow crossed her path and a blue shirted arm dexterously but gently relieved her of her burden Miss Mary was both embarrassed and angry If you carried more of that for yourself she said spitefully to the blue arm without deigning to raise her lashes to its owner you d do better In the submissive silence that followed she regretted the speech and thanked him so sweetly at the door that he stumbled Which caused the children to laugh again a laugh in which Miss Mary joined until the color came faintly into her pale cheek The next day a barrel was mysteriously placed beside the door and as mysteriously filled with fresh spring water every morning Nor was this superior young person without other quiet attentions Profane Bill driver of the Slumgullion Stage widely known in the newspapers for his gallantry in invariably offering the box seat to the fair sex had excepted Miss Mary from this attention on the ground that he had a habit of cussin on upgrades and gave her half the coach to herself Jack Hamlin a gambler having once silently ridden with her in the same coach afterward threw a decanter at the head of a confederate for mentioning her name in a barroom The overdressed mother of a pupil whose paternity was doubtful had often lingered near this astute Vestal s temple never daring to enter its sacred precincts but content to worship the priestess from afar With such unconscious intervals the monotonous procession of blue skies glittering sunshine brief twilights and starlit nights passed over Red Gulch Miss Mary grew fond of walking in the sedate and proper woods Perhaps she believed with missus Stidger that the balsamic odors of the firs did her chest good for certainly her slight cough was less frequent and her step was firmer perhaps she had learned the unending lesson which the patient pines are never weary of repeating to heedful or listless ears And so one day she planned a picnic on Buckeye Hill and took the children with her Away from the dusty road the straggling shanties the yellow ditches the clamor of restless engines the cheap finery of shop windows the deeper glitter of paint and colored glass and the thin veneering which barbarism takes upon itself in such localities what infinite relief was theirs The last heap of ragged rock and clay passed the last unsightly chasm crossed how the waiting woods opened their long files to receive them How the children perhaps because they had not yet grown quite away from the breast of the bounteous Mother threw themselves face downward on her brown bosom with uncouth caresses filling the air with their laughter and how Miss Mary herself felinely fastidious and intrenched as she was in the purity of spotless skirts collar and cuffs forgot all and ran like a crested quail at the head of her brood until romping laughing and panting with a loosened braid of brown hair a hat hanging by a knotted ribbon from her throat she came suddenly and violently in the heart of the forest upon the luckless Sandy The explanations apologies and not overwise conversation that ensued need not be indicated here It would seem however that Miss Mary had already established some acquaintance with this ex drunkard Enough that he was soon accepted as one of the party that the children with that quick intelligence which Providence gives the helpless recognized a friend and played with his blond beard and long silken mustache and took other liberties as the helpless are apt to do And when he had built a fire against a tree and had shown them other mysteries of woodcraft their admiration knew no bounds At the close of two such foolish idle happy hours he found himself lying at the feet of the schoolmistress gazing dreamily in her face as she sat upon the sloping hillside weaving wreaths of laurel and syringa in very much the same attitude as he had lain when first they met Nor was the similitude greatly forced The weakness of an easy sensuous nature that had found a dreamy exaltation in liquor it is to be feared was now finding an equal intoxication in love I think that Sandy was dimly conscious of this himself I know that he longed to be doing something slaying a grizzly scalping a savage or sacrificing himself in some way for the sake of this sallow faced gray eyed schoolmistress As I should like to present him in a heroic attitude I stay my hand with great difficulty at this moment being only withheld from introducing such an episode by a strong conviction that it does not usually occur at such times And I trust that my fairest reader who remembers that in a real crisis it is always some uninteresting stranger or unromantic policeman and not Adolphus who rescues will forgive the omission So they sat there undisturbed the woodpeckers chattering overhead and the voices of the children coming pleasantly from the hollow below What they said matters little What they thought which might have been interesting did not transpire The woodpeckers only learned how Miss Mary was an orphan how she left her uncle s house to come to California for the sake of health and independence how Sandy was an orphan too how he came to California for excitement how he had lived a wild life and how he was trying to reform and other details which from a woodpecker s viewpoint undoubtedly must have seemed stupid and a waste of time But even in such trifles was the afternoon spent and when the children were again gathered and Sandy with a delicacy which the schoolmistress well understood took leave of them quietly at the outskirts of the settlement it had seemed the shortest day of her weary life As the long dry summer withered to its roots the school term of Red Gulch to use a local euphuism dried up also In another day Miss Mary would be free and for a season at least Red Gulch would know her no more She was seated alone in the schoolhouse her cheek resting on her hand her eyes half closed in one of those daydreams in which Miss Mary I fear to the danger of school discipline was lately in the habit of indulging Her lap was full of mosses ferns and other woodland memories She was so preoccupied with these and her own thoughts that a gentle tapping at the door passed unheard or translated itself into the remembrance of far off woodpeckers When at last it asserted itself more distinctly she started up with a flushed cheek and opened the door On the threshold stood a woman the self assertion and audacity of whose dress were in singular contrast to her timid irresolute bearing Miss Mary recognized at a glance the dubious mother of her anonymous pupil Perhaps she was disappointed perhaps she was only fastidious but as she coldly invited her to enter she half unconsciously settled her white cuffs and collar and gathered closer her own chaste skirts It was perhaps for this reason that the embarrassed stranger after a moment s hesitation left her gorgeous parasol open and sticking in the dust beside the door and then sat down at the farther end of a long bench Her voice was husky as she began I heerd tell that you were goin down to the Bay tomorrow and I couldn t let you go until I came to thank you for your kindness to my Tommy Tommy Miss Mary said was a good boy and deserved more than the poor attention she could give him Thank you miss thank ye cried the stranger brightening even through the color which Red Gulch knew facetiously as her war paint and striving in her embarrassment to drag the long bench nearer the schoolmistress I thank you miss for that and if I am his mother there ain t a sweeter dearer better boy lives than him And if I ain t much as says it thar ain t a sweeter dearer angeler teacher lives than he s got Miss Mary sitting primly behind her desk with a ruler over her shoulder opened her gray eyes widely at this but said nothing It ain t for you to be complimented by the like of me I know she went on hurriedly It ain t for me to be comin here in broad day to do it either but I come to ask a favor not for me miss not for me but for the darling boy Encouraged by a look in the young schoolmistress s eye and putting her lilac gloved hands together the fingers downward between her knees she went on in a low voice You see miss there s no one the boy has any claim on but me and I ain t the proper person to bring him up I thought some last year of sending him away to Frisco to school but when they talked of bringing a schoolma am here I waited till I saw you and then I knew it was all right and I could keep my boy a little longer And O miss he loves you so much and if you could hear him talk about you in his pretty way and if he could ask you what I ask you now you couldn t refuse him It is natural she went on rapidly in a voice that trembled strangely between pride and humility it s natural that he should take to you miss for his father when I first knew him was a gentleman and the boy must forget me sooner or later and so I ain t goin to cry about that For I come to ask you to take my Tommy God bless him for the bestest sweetest boy that lives to to take him with you She had risen and caught the young girl s hand in her own and had fallen on her knees beside her I ve money plenty and it s all yours and his Put him in some good school where you can go and see him and help him to to to forget his mother Do with him what you like The worst you can do will be kindness to what he will learn with me Only take him out of this wicked life this cruel place this home of shame and sorrow You will I know you will won t you You will you must not you cannot say no You will make him as pure as gentle as yourself and when he has grown up you will tell him his father s name the name that hasn t passed my lips for years the name of Alexander Morton whom they call here Sandy Miss Mary do not take your hand away Miss Mary speak to me You will take my boy Do not put your face from me I know it ought not to look on such as me Miss Mary my God be merciful she is leaving me Miss Mary had risen and in the gathering twilight had felt her way to the open window She stood there leaning against the casement her eyes fixed on the last rosy tints that were fading from the western sky There was still some of its light on her pure young forehead on her white collar on her clasped white hands but all fading slowly away The suppliant had dragged herself still on her knees beside her I know it takes time to consider I will wait here all night but I cannot go until you speak Do not deny me now You will I see it in your sweet face such a face as I have seen in my dreams I see it in your eyes Miss Mary you will take my boy The last red beam crept higher suffused Miss Mary s eyes with something of its glory flickered and faded and went out The sun had set on Red Gulch In the twilight and silence Miss Mary s voice sounded pleasantly I will take the boy Send him to me tonight The happy mother raised the hem of Miss Mary s skirts to her lips She would have buried her hot face in its virgin folds but she dared not She rose to her feet Does this man know of your intention asked Miss Mary suddenly No nor cares He has never even seen the child to know it Go to him at once tonight now Tell him what you have done Tell him I have taken his child and tell him he must never see see the child again Wherever it may be he must not come wherever I may take it he must not follow There go now please I m weary and have much yet to do They walked together to the door On the threshold the woman turned Good night She would have fallen at Miss Mary s feet But at the same moment the young girl reached out her arms caught the sinful woman to her own pure breast for one brief moment and then closed and locked the door It was with a sudden sense of great responsibility that Profane Bill took the reins of the Slumgullion Stage the next morning for the schoolmistress was one of his passengers As he entered the highroad in obedience to a pleasant voice from the inside he suddenly reined up his horses and respectfully waited as Tommy hopped out at the command of Miss Mary Not that bush Tommy the next Tommy whipped out his new pocketknife and cutting a branch from a tall azalea bush returned with it to Miss Mary All right now All right And the stage door closed on the Idyl of Red Gulch BROWN OF CALAVERAS A subdued tone of conversation and the absence of cigar smoke and boot heels at the windows of the Wingdam stagecoach made it evident that one of the inside passengers was a woman A disposition on the part of loungers at the stations to congregate before the window and some concern in regard to the appearance of coats hats and collars further indicated that she was lovely All of which mister Jack Hamlin on the box seat noted with the smile of cynical philosophy Not that he depreciated the sex but that he recognized therein a deceitful element the pursuit of which sometimes drew mankind away from the equally uncertain blandishments of poker of which it may be remarked that mister Hamlin was a professional exponent So that when he placed his narrow boot on the wheel and leaped down he did not even glance at the window from which a green veil was fluttering but lounged up and down with that listless and grave indifference of his class which was perhaps the next thing to good breeding With his closely buttoned figure and self contained air he was a marked contrast to the other passengers with their feverish restlessness and boisterous emotion and even Bill Masters a graduate of Harvard with his slovenly dress his overflowing vitality his intense appreciation of lawlessness and barbarism and his mouth filled with crackers and cheese I fear cut but an unromantic figure beside this lonely calculator of chances with his pale Greek face and Homeric gravity The driver called All aboard and mister Hamlin returned to the coach His foot was upon the wheel and his face raised to the level of the open window when at the same moment what appeared to him to be the finest eyes in the world suddenly met his He quietly dropped down again addressed a few words to one of the inside passengers effected an exchange of seats and as quietly took his place inside mister Hamlin never allowed his philosophy to interfere with decisive and prompt action I fear that this irruption of Jack cast some restraint upon the other passengers particularly those who were making themselves most agreeable to the lady One of them leaned forward and apparently conveyed to her information regarding mister Hamlin s profession in a single epithet Whether mister Hamlin heard it or whether he recognized in the informant a distinguished jurist from whom but a few evenings before he had won several thousand dollars I cannot say His colorless face betrayed no sign his black eyes quietly observant glanced indifferently past the legal gentleman and rested on the much more pleasing features of his neighbor An Indian stoicism said to be an inheritance from his maternal ancestor stood him in good service until the rolling wheels rattled upon the river gravel at Scott s Ferry and the stage drew up at the International Hotel for dinner The legal gentleman and a member of Congress leaped out and stood ready to assist the descending goddess while Colonel Starbottle of Siskiyou took charge of her parasol and shawl In this multiplicity of attention there was a momentary confusion and delay Jack Hamlin quietly opened the OPPOSITE door of the coach took the lady s hand with that decision and positiveness which a hesitating and undecided sex know how to admire and in an instant had dexterously and gracefully swung her to the ground and again lifted her to the platform An audible chuckle on the box I fear came from that other cynic Yuba Bill the driver Look keerfully arter that baggage Kernel said the expressman with affected concern as he looked after Colonel Starbottle gloomily bringing up the rear of the triumphant procession to the waiting room mister Hamlin did not stay for dinner His horse was already saddled and awaiting him He dashed over the ford up the gravelly hill and out into the dusty perspective of the Wingdam road like one leaving pleasant fancy behind him The inmates of dusty cabins by the roadside shaded their eyes with their hands and looked after him recognizing the man by his horse and speculating what was up with Comanche Jack Yet much of this interest centered in the horse in a community where the time made by French Pete s mare in his run from the Sheriff of Calaveras eclipsed all concern in the ultimate fate of that worthy The sweating flanks of his gray at length recalled him to himself He checked his speed and turning into a by road sometimes used as a cutoff trotted leisurely along the reins hanging listlessly from his fingers As he rode on the character of the landscape changed and became more pastoral Openings in groves of pine and sycamore disclosed some rude attempts at cultivation a flowering vine trailed over the porch of one cabin and a woman rocked her cradled babe under the roses of another A little farther on mister Hamlin came upon some barelegged children wading in the willowy creek and so wrought upon them with a badinage peculiar to himself that they were emboldened to climb up his horse s legs and over his saddle until he was fain to develop an exaggerated ferocity of demeanor and to escape leaving behind some kisses and coin And then advancing deeper into the woods where all signs of habitation failed he began to sing uplifting a tenor so singularly sweet and shaded by a pathos so subduing and tender that I wot the robins and linnets stopped to listen mister Hamlin s voice was not cultivated the subject of his song was some sentimental lunacy borrowed from the Negro minstrels but there thrilled through all some occult quality of tone and expression that was unspeakably touching Indeed it was a wonderful sight to see this sentimental blackleg with a pack of cards in his pocket and a revolver at his back sending his voice before him through the dim woods with a plaint about his Nelly s grave in a way that overflowed the eyes of the listener A sparrow hawk fresh from his sixth victim possibly recognizing in mister Hamlin a kindred spirit stared at him in surprise and was fain to confess the superiority of man With a superior predatory capacity HE couldn t sing But mister Hamlin presently found himself again on the highroad and at his former pace Ditches and banks of gravel denuded hillsides stumps and decayed trunks of trees took the place of woodland and ravine and indicated his approach to civilization Then a church steeple came in sight and he knew that he had reached home In a few moments he was clattering down the single narrow street that lost itself in a chaotic ruin of races ditches and tailings at the foot of the hill and dismounted before the gilded windows of the Magnolia saloon Passing through the long barroom he pushed open a green baize door entered a dark passage opened another door with a passkey and found himself in a dimly lighted room whose furniture though elegant and costly for the locality showed signs of abuse The inlaid center table was overlaid with stained disks that were not contemplated in the original design The embroidered armchairs were discolored and the green velvet lounge on which mister Hamlin threw himself was soiled at the foot with the red soil of Wingdam mister Hamlin did not sing in his cage He lay still looking at a highly colored painting above him representing a young creature of opulent charms It occurred to him then for the first time that he had never seen exactly that kind of a woman and that if he should he would not probably fall in love with her Perhaps he was thinking of another style of beauty But just then someone knocked at the door Without rising he pulled a cord that apparently shot back a bolt for the door swung open and a man entered The newcomer was broad shouldered and robust a vigor not borne out in the face which though handsome was singularly weak and disfigured by dissipation He appeared to be also under the influence of liquor for he started on seeing mister Hamlin and said I thought Kate was here stammered and seemed confused and embarrassed mister Hamlin smiled the smile which he had before worn on the Wingdam coach and sat up quite refreshed and ready for business You didn t come up on the stage continued the newcomer did you No replied Hamlin I left it at Scott s Ferry It isn t due for half an hour yet But how s luck Brown Damn bad said Brown his face suddenly assuming an expression of weak despair I m cleaned out again Jack he continued in a whining tone that formed a pitiable contrast to his bulky figure can t you help me with a hundred till tomorrow s cleanup You see I ve got to send money home to the old woman and you ve won twenty times that amount from me The conclusion was perhaps not entirely logical but Jack overlooked it and handed the sum to his visitor The old woman business is about played out Brown he added by way of commentary why don t you say you want to buck agin faro You know you ain t married Fact sir said Brown with a sudden gravity as if the mere contact of the gold with the palm of the hand had imparted some dignity to his frame I ve got a wife a damned good one too if I do say it in the States It s three year since I ve seen her and a year since I ve writ to her When things is about straight and we get down to the lead I m going to send for her And Kate queried mister Hamlin with his previous smile mister Brown of Calaveras essayed an archness of glance to cover his confusion which his weak face and whisky muddled intellect but poorly carried out and said Damn it Jack a man must have a little liberty you know But come what do you say to a little game Give us a show to double this hundred Jack Hamlin looked curiously at his fatuous friend Perhaps he knew that the man was predestined to lose the money and preferred that it should flow back into his own coffers rather than any other He nodded his head and drew his chair toward the table At the same moment there came a rap upon the door It s Kate said mister Brown mister Hamlin shot back the bolt and the door opened But for the first time in his life he staggered to his feet utterly unnerved and abashed and for the first time in his life the hot blood crimsoned his colorless cheeks to his forehead For before him stood the lady he had lifted from the Wingdam coach whom Brown dropping his cards with a hysterical laugh greeted as My old woman by thunder They say that missus Brown burst into tears and reproaches of her husband I saw her in eighteen fifty seven at Marysville and disbelieve the story And the WINGDAM CHRONICLE of the next week under the head of Touching Reunion said One of those beautiful and touching incidents peculiar to California life occurred last week in our city The wife of one of Wingdam s eminent pioneers tired of the effete civilization of the East and its inhospitable climate resolved to join her noble husband upon these golden shores Without informing him of her intention she undertook the long journey and arrived last week The joy of the husband may be easier imagined than described The meeting is said to have been indescribably affecting We trust her example may be followed Whether owing to missus Brown s influence or to some more successful speculations mister Brown s financial fortune from that day steadily improved He bought out his partners in the Nip and Tuck lead with money which was said to have been won at poker a week or two after his wife s arrival but which rumor adopting missus Brown s theory that Brown had forsworn the gaming table declared to have been furnished by mister Jack Hamlin He built and furnished the Wingdam House which pretty missus Brown s great popularity kept overflowing with guests He was elected to the Assembly and gave largess to churches A street in Wingdam was named in his honor Yet it was noted that in proportion as he waxed wealthy and fortunate he grew pale thin and anxious As his wife s popularity increased he became fretful and impatient The most uxorious of husbands he was absurdly jealous If he did not interfere with his wife s social liberty it was because it was maliciously whispered that his first and only attempt was met by an outburst from missus Brown that terrified him into silence Much of this kind of gossip came from those of her own sex whom she had supplanted in the chivalrous attentions of Wingdam which like most popular chivalry was devoted to an admiration of power whether of masculine force or feminine beauty It should be remembered too in her extenuation that since her arrival she had been the unconscious priestess of a mythological worship perhaps not more ennobling to her womanhood than that which distinguished an older Greek democracy I think that Brown was dimly conscious of this But his only confidant was Jack Hamlin whose INFELIX reputation naturally precluded any open intimacy with the family and whose visits were infrequent It was midsummer and a moonlit night and missus Brown very rosy large eyed and pretty sat upon the piazza enjoying the fresh incense of the mountain breeze and it is to be feared another incense which was not so fresh nor quite as innocent Beside her sat Colonel Starbottle and Judge Boompointer and a later addition to her court in the shape of a foreign tourist She was in good spirits What do you see down the road inquired the gallant Colonel who had been conscious for the last few minutes that missus Brown s attention was diverted Dust said missus Brown with a sigh Only Sister Anne s flock of sheep The Colonel whose literary recollections did not extend farther back than last week s paper took a more practical view It ain t sheep he continued it s a horseman Judge ain t that Jack Hamlin s gray But the Judge didn t know and as missus Brown suggested the air was growing too cold for further investigations they retired to the parlor mister Brown was in the stable where he generally retired after dinner Perhaps it was to show his contempt for his wife s companions perhaps like other weak natures he found pleasure in the exercise of absolute power over inferior animals He had a certain gratification in the training of a chestnut mare whom he could beat or caress as pleased him which he couldn t do with missus Brown It was here that he recognized a certain gray horse which had just come in and looking a little farther on found his rider Brown s greeting was cordial and hearty mister Hamlin s somewhat restrained But at Brown s urgent request he followed him up the back stairs to a narrow corridor and thence to a small room looking out upon the stable yard It was plainly furnished with a bed a table a few chairs and a rack for guns and whips This yer s my home Jack said Brown with a sigh as he threw himself upon the bed and motioned his companion to a chair Her room s t other end of the hall It s more n six months since we ve lived together or met except at meals It s mighty rough papers on the head of the house ain t it he said with a forced laugh But I m glad to see you Jack damn glad and he reached from the bed and again shook the unresponsive hand of Jack Hamlin I brought ye up here for I didn t want to talk in the stable though for the matter of that it s all round town Don t strike a light We can talk here in the moonshine Put up your feet on that winder and sit here beside me Thar s whisky in that jug mister Hamlin did not avail himself of the information Brown of Calaveras turned his face to the wall and continued If I didn t love the woman Jack I wouldn t mind But it s loving her and seeing her day arter day goin on at this rate and no one to put down the brake that s what gits me But I m glad to see ye Jack damn glad In the darkness he groped about until he had found and wrung his companion s hand again He would have detained it but Jack slipped it into the buttoned breast of his coat and asked listlessly How long has this been going on Ever since she came here ever since the day she walked into the Magnolia I was a fool then Jack I m a fool now but I didn t know how much I loved her till then And she hasn t been the same woman since But that ain t all Jack and it s what I wanted to see you about and I m glad you ve come It ain t that she doesn t love me any more it ain t that she fools with every chap that comes along for perhaps I staked her love and lost it as I did everything else at the Magnolia and perhaps foolin is nateral to some women and thar ain t no great harm done cept to the fools But Jack I think I think she loves somebody else Don t move Jack don t move if your pistol hurts ye take it off It s been more n six months now that she s seemed unhappy and lonesome and kinder nervous and scared like And sometimes I ve ketched her lookin at me sort of timid and pitying And she writes to somebody And for the last week she s been gathering her own things trinkets and furbelows and jew lry and Jack I think she s goin off I could stand all but that To have her steal away like a thief He put his face downward to the pillow and for a few moments there was no sound but the ticking of a clock on the mantel mister Hamlin lit a cigar and moved to the open window The moon no longer shone into the room and the bed and its occupant were in shadow What shall I do Jack said the voice from the darkness The answer came promptly and clearly from the window side Spot the man and kill him on sight But Jack He s took the risk But will that bring HER back Jack did not reply but moved from the window toward the door Don t go yet Jack light the candle and sit by the table It s a comfort to see ye if nothin else Jack hesitated and then complied He drew a pack of cards from his pocket and shuffled them glancing at the bed But Brown s face was turned to the wall When mister Hamlin had shuffled the cards he cut them and dealt one card on the opposite side of the table and toward the bed and another on his side of the table for himself The first was a deuce his own card a king He then shuffled and cut again This time dummy had a queen and himself a four spot Jack brightened up for the third deal It brought his adversary a deuce and himself a king again Two out of three said Jack audibly What s that Jack said Brown Nothing Then Jack tried his hand with dice but he always threw sixes and his imaginary opponent aces The force of habit is sometimes confusing Meanwhile some magnetic influence in mister Hamlin s presence or the anodyne of liquor or both brought surcease of sorrow and Brown slept mister Hamlin moved his chair to the window and looked out on the town of Wingdam now sleeping peacefully its harsh outlines softened and subdued its glaring colors mellowed and sobered in the moonlight that flowed over all In the hush he could hear the gurgling of water in the ditches and the sighing of the pines beyond the hill Then he looked up at the firmament and as he did so a star shot across the twinkling field Presently another and then another The phenomenon suggested to mister Hamlin a fresh augury If in another fifteen minutes another star should fall He sat there watch in hand for twice that time but the phenomenon was not repeated The clock struck two and Brown still slept mister Hamlin approached the table and took from his pocket a letter which he read by the flickering candlelight It contained only a single line written in pencil in a woman s hand Be at the corral with the buggy at three The sleeper moved uneasily and then awoke Are you there Jack Yes Don t go yet I dreamed just now Jack dreamed of old times I thought that Sue and me was being married agin and that the parson Jack was who do you think you The gambler laughed and seated himself on the bed the paper still in his hand It s a good sign ain t it queried Brown I reckon Say old man hadn t you better get up The old man thus affectionately appealed to rose with the assistance of Hamlin s outstretched hand Smoke Brown mechanically took the proffered cigar Light Jack had twisted the letter into a spiral lit it and held it for his companion He continued to hold it until it was consumed and dropped the fragment a fiery star from the open window He watched it as it fell and then returned to his friend Old man he said placing his hands upon Brown s shoulders in ten minutes I ll be on the road and gone like that spark We won t see each other agin but before I go take a fool s advice sell out all you ve got take your wife with you and quit the country It ain t no place for you nor her Tell her she must go make her go if she won t Don t whine because you can t be a saint and she ain t an angel Be a man and treat her like a woman Don t be a damn fool Good by He tore himself from Brown s grasp and leaped down the stairs like a deer At the stable door he collared the half sleeping hostler and backed him against the wall Saddle my horse in two minutes or I ll The ellipsis was frightfully suggestive The missis said you was to have the buggy stammered the man Damn the buggy The horse was saddled as fast as the nervous hands of the astounded hostler could manipulate buckle and strap Is anything up mister Hamlin said the man who like all his class admired the elan of his fiery patron and was really concerned in his welfare Stand aside The man fell back With an oath a bound and clatter Jack was into the road In another moment to the man s half awakened eyes he was but a moving cloud of dust in the distance toward which a star just loosed from its brethren was trailing a stream of fire But early that morning the dwellers by the Wingdam turnpike miles away heard a voice pure as a skylark s singing afield They who were asleep turned over on their rude couches to dream of youth and love and olden days Hard faced men and anxious gold seekers already at work ceased their labors and leaned upon their picks to listen to a romantic vagabond ambling away against the rosy sunrise HIGH WATER MARK When the tide was out on the Dedlow Marsh its extended dreariness was patent Its spongy low lying surface sluggish inky pools and tortuous sloughs twisting their slimy way eel like toward the open bay were all hard facts So were the few green tussocks with their scant blades their amphibious flavor and unpleasant dampness And if you choose to indulge your fancy although the flat monotony of the Dedlow Marsh was not inspiring the wavy line of scattered drift gave an unpleasant consciousness of the spent waters and made the dead certainty of the returning tide a gloomy reflection which no present sunshine could dissipate The greener meadowland seemed oppressed with this idea and made no positive attempt at vegetation until the work of reclamation should be complete In the bitter fruit of the low cranberry bushes one might fancy he detected a naturally sweet disposition curdled and soured by an injudicious course of too much regular cold water The vocal expression of the Dedlow Marsh was also melancholy and depressing The sepulchral boom of the bittern the shriek of the curlew the scream of passing brent the wrangling of quarrelsome teal the sharp querulous protest of the startled crane and syllabled complaint of the killdeer plover were beyond the power of written expression Nor was the aspect of these mournful fowls at all cheerful and inspiring Certainly not the blue heron standing mid leg deep in the water obviously catching cold in a reckless disregard of wet feet and consequences nor the mournful curlew the dejected plover or the low spirited snipe who saw fit to join him in his suicidal contemplation nor the impassive kingfisher an ornithological Marius reviewing the desolate expanse nor the black raven that went to and fro over the face of the marsh continually but evidently couldn t make up his mind whether the waters had subsided and felt low spirited in the reflection that after all this trouble he wouldn t be able to give a definite answer On the contrary it was evident at a glance that the dreary expanse of Dedlow Marsh told unpleasantly on the birds and that the season of migration was looked forward to with a feeling of relief and satisfaction by the full grown and of extravagant anticipation by the callow brood But if Dedlow Marsh was cheerless at the slack of the low tide you should have seen it when the tide was strong and full When the damp air blew chilly over the cold glittering expanse and came to the faces of those who looked seaward like another tide when a steel like glint marked the low hollows and the sinuous line of slough when the great shell incrusted trunks of fallen trees arose again and went forth on their dreary purposeless wanderings drifting hither and thither but getting no farther toward any goal at the falling tide or the day s decline than the cursed Hebrew in the legend when the glossy ducks swung silently making neither ripple nor furrow on the shimmering surface when the fog came in with the tide and shut out the blue above even as the green below had been obliterated when boatmen lost in that fog paddling about in a hopeless way started at what seemed the brushing of mermen s fingers on the boat s keel or shrank from the tufts of grass spreading around like the floating hair of a corpse and knew by these signs that they were lost upon Dedlow Marsh and must make a night of it and a gloomy one at that then you might know something of Dedlow Marsh at high water Let me recall a story connected with this latter view which never failed to recur to my mind in my long gunning excursions upon Dedlow Marsh Although the event was briefly recorded in the county paper I had the story in all its eloquent detail from the lips of the principal actor I cannot hope to catch the varying emphasis and peculiar coloring of feminine delineation for my narrator was a woman but I ll try to give at least its substance She lived midway of the great slough of Dedlow Marsh and a good sized river which debouched four miles beyond into an estuary formed by the Pacific Ocean on the long sandy peninsula which constituted the southwestern boundary of a noble bay The house in which she lived was a small frame cabin raised from the marsh a few feet by stout piles and was three miles distant from the settlements upon the river Her husband was a logger a profitable business in a county where the principal occupation was the manufacture of lumber It was the season of early spring when her husband left on the ebb of a high tide with a raft of logs for the usual transportation to the lower end of the bay As she stood by the door of the little cabin when the voyagers departed she noticed a cold look in the southeastern sky and she remembered hearing her husband say to his companions that they must endeavor to complete their voyage before the coming of the southwesterly gale which he saw brewing And that night it began to storm and blow harder than she had ever before experienced and some great trees fell in the forest by the river and the house rocked like her baby s cradle But however the storm might roar about the little cabin she knew that one she trusted had driven bolt and bar with his own strong hand and that had he feared for her he would not have left her This and her domestic duties and the care of her little sickly baby helped to keep her mind from dwelling on the weather except of course to hope that he was safely harbored with the logs at Utopia in the dreary distance But she noticed that day when she went out to feed the chickens and look after the cow that the tide was up to the little fence of their garden patch and the roar of the surf on the south beach though miles away she could hear distinctly And she began to think that she would like to have someone to talk with about matters and she believed that if it had not been so far and so stormy and the trail so impassable she would have taken the baby and have gone over to Ryckman s her nearest neighbor But then you see he might have returned in the storm all wet with no one to see to him and it was a long exposure for baby who was croupy and ailing But that night she never could tell why she didn t feel like sleeping or even lying down The storm had somewhat abated but she still sat and sat and even tried to read I don t know whether it was a Bible or some profane magazine that this poor woman read but most probably the latter for the words all ran together and made such sad nonsense that she was forced at last to put the book down and turn to that dearer volume which lay before her in the cradle with its white initial leaf as yet unsoiled and try to look forward to its mysterious future And rocking the cradle she thought of everything and everybody but still was wide awake as ever It was nearly twelve o clock when she at last lay down in her clothes How long she slept she could not remember but she awoke with a dreadful choking in her throat and found herself standing trembling all over in the middle of the room with her baby clasped to her breast and she was saying something The baby cried and sobbed and she walked up and down trying to hush it when she heard a scratching at the door She opened it fearfully and was glad to see it was only old Pete their dog who crawled dripping with water into the room She would like to have looked out not in the faint hope of her husband s coming but to see how things looked but the wind shook the door so savagely that she could hardly hold it Then she sat down a little while and then walked up and down a little while and then she lay down again a little while Lying close by the wall of the little cabin she thought she heard once or twice something scrape slowly against the clapboards like the scraping of branches Then there was a little gurgling sound like the baby made when it was swallowing then something went click click and cluck cluck so that she sat up in bed When she did so she was attracted by something else that seemed creeping from the back door toward the center of the room It wasn t much wider than her little finger but soon it swelled to the width of her hand and began spreading all over the floor It was water She ran to the front door and threw it wide open and saw nothing but water She ran to the back door and threw it open and saw nothing but water She ran to the side window and throwing that open she saw nothing but water Then she remembered hearing her husband once say that there was no danger in the tide for that fell regularly and people could calculate on it and that he would rather live near the bay than the river whose banks might overflow at any time But was it the tide So she ran again to the back door and threw out a stick of wood It drifted away toward the bay She scooped up some of the water and put it eagerly to her lips It was fresh and sweet It was the river and not the tide It was then O God be praised for his goodness she did neither faint nor fall it was then blessed be the Saviour for it was his merciful hand that touched and strengthened her in this awful moment that fear dropped from her like a garment and her trembling ceased It was then and thereafter that she never lost her self command through all the trials of that gloomy night She drew the bedstead toward the middle of the room and placed a table upon it and on that she put the cradle The water on the floor was already over her ankles and the house once or twice moved so perceptibly and seemed to be racked so that the closet doors all flew open Then she heard the same rasping and thumping against the wall and looking out saw that a large uprooted tree which had lain near the road at the upper end of the pasture had floated down to the house Luckily its long roots dragged in the soil and kept it from moving as rapidly as the current for had it struck the house in its full career even the strong nails and bolts in the piles could not have withstood the shock The hound had leaped upon its knotty surface and crouched near the roots shivering and whining A ray of hope flashed across her mind She drew a heavy blanket from the bed and wrapping it about the babe waded in the deepening waters to the door As the tree swung again broadside on making the little cabin creak and tremble she leaped on to its trunk By God s mercy she succeeded in obtaining a footing on its slippery surface and twining an arm about its roots she held in the other her moaning child Then something cracked near the front porch and the whole front of the house she had just quitted fell forward just as cattle fall on their knees before they lie down and at the same moment the great redwood tree swung round and drifted away with its living cargo into the black night For all the excitement and danger for all her soothing of her crying babe for all the whistling of the wind for all the uncertainty of her situation she still turned to look at the deserted and water swept cabin She remembered even then and she wonders how foolish she was to think of it at that time that she wished she had put on another dress and the baby s best clothes and she kept praying that the house would be spared so that he when he returned would have something to come to and it wouldn t be quite so desolate and how could he ever know what had become of her and baby And at the thought she grew sick and faint But she had something else to do besides worrying for whenever the long roots of her ark struck an obstacle the whole trunk made half a revolution and twice dipped her in the black water The hound who kept distracting her by running up and down the tree and howling at last fell off at one of these collisions He swam for some time beside her and she tried to get the poor beast up on the tree but he acted silly and wild and at last she lost sight of him forever Then she and her baby were left alone The light which had burned for a few minutes in the deserted cabin was quenched suddenly She could not then tell whither she was drifting The outline of the white dunes on the peninsula showed dimly ahead and she judged the tree was moving in a line with the river It must be about slack water and she had probably reached the eddy formed by the confluence of the tide and the overflowing waters of the river Unless the tide fell soon there was present danger of her drifting to its channel and being carried out to sea or crushed in the floating drift That peril averted if she were carried out on the ebb toward the bay she might hope to strike one of the wooded promontories of the peninsula and rest till daylight Sometimes she thought she heard voices and shouts from the river and the bellowing of cattle and bleating of sheep Then again it was only the ringing in her ears and throbbing of her heart She found at about this time that she was so chilled and stiffened in her cramped position that she could scarcely move and the baby cried so when she put it to her breast that she noticed the milk refused to flow and she was so frightened at that that she put her head under her shawl and for the first time cried bitterly When she raised her head again the boom of the surf was behind her and she knew that her ark had again swung round She dipped up the water to cool her parched throat and found that it was salt as her tears There was a relief though for by this sign she knew that she was drifting with the tide It was then the wind went down and the great and awful silence oppressed her There was scarcely a ripple against the furrowed sides of the great trunk on which she rested and around her all was black gloom and quiet She spoke to the baby just to hear herself speak and to know that she had not lost her voice She thought then it was queer but she could not help thinking it how awful must have been the night when the great ship swung over the Asiatic peak and the sounds of creation were blotted out from the world She thought too of mariners clinging to spars and of poor women who were lashed to rafts and beaten to death by the cruel sea She tried to thank God that she was thus spared and lifted her eyes from the baby who had fallen into a fretful sleep Suddenly away to the southward a great light lifted itself out of the gloom and flashed and flickered and flickered and flashed again Her heart fluttered quickly against the baby s cold cheek It was the lighthouse at the entrance of the bay As she was yet wondering the tree suddenly rolled a little dragged a little and then seemed to lie quiet and still She put out her hand and the current gurgled against it The tree was aground and by the position of the light and the noise of the surf aground upon the Dedlow Marsh Had it not been for her baby who was ailing and croupy had it not been for the sudden drying up of that sensitive fountain she would have felt safe and relieved Perhaps it was this which tended to make all her impressions mournful and gloomy As the tide rapidly fell a great flock of black brent fluttered by her screaming and crying Then the plover flew up and piped mournfully as they wheeled around the trunk and at last fearlessly lit upon it like a gray cloud Then the heron flew over and around her shrieking and protesting and at last dropped its gaunt legs only a few yards from her But strangest of all a pretty white bird larger than a dove like a pelican but not a pelican circled around and around her At last it lit upon a rootlet of the tree quite over her shoulder She put out her hand and stroked its beautiful white neck and it never appeared to move It stayed there so long that she thought she would lift up the baby to see it and try to attract her attention But when she did so the child was so chilled and cold and had such a blue look under the little lashes which it didn t raise at all that she screamed aloud and the bird flew away and she fainted Well that was the worst of it and perhaps it was not so much after all to any but herself For when she recovered her senses it was bright sunlight and dead low water There was a confused noise of guttural voices about her and an old squaw singing an Indian hushaby and rocking herself from side to side before a fire built on the marsh before which she the recovered wife and mother lay weak and weary Her first thought was for her baby and she was about to speak when a young squaw who must have been a mother herself fathomed her thought and brought her the mowitch pale but living in such a queer little willow cradle all bound up just like the squaw s own young one that she laughed and cried together and the young squaw and the old squaw showed their big white teeth and glinted their black eyes and said Plenty get well skeena mowitch wagee man come plenty soon and she could have kissed their brown faces in her joy And then she found that they had been gathering berries on the marsh in their queer comical baskets and saw the skirt of her gown fluttering on the tree from afar and the old squaw couldn t resist the temptation of procuring a new garment and came down and discovered the wagee woman and child And of course she gave the garment to the old squaw as you may imagine and when HE came at last and rushed up to her looking about ten years older in his anxiety she felt so faint again that they had to carry her to the canoe For you see he knew nothing about the flood until he met the Indians at Utopia and knew by the signs that the poor woman was his wife And at the next high tide he towed the tree away back home although it wasn t worth the trouble and built another house using the old tree for the foundation and props and called it after her Mary s Ark But you may guess the next house was built above high water mark And that s all Not much perhaps considering the malevolent capacity of the Dedlow Marsh But you must tramp over it at low water or paddle over it at high tide or get lost upon it once or twice in the fog as I have to understand properly Mary s adventure or to appreciate duly the blessings of living beyond High Water Mark A LONELY RIDE As I stepped into the Slumgullion stage I saw that it was a dark night a lonely road and that I was the only passenger Let me assure the reader that I have no ulterior design in making this assertion A long course of light reading has forewarned me what every experienced intelligence must confidently look for from such a statement The storyteller who willfully tempts Fate by such obvious beginnings who is to the expectant reader in danger of being robbed or half murdered or frightened by an escaped lunatic or introduced to his ladylove for the first time deserves to be detected I am relieved to say that none of these things occurred to me The road from Wingdam to Slumgullion knew no other banditti than the regularly licensed hotelkeepers lunatics had not yet reached such depth of imbecility as to ride of their own free will in California stages and my Laura amiable and long suffering as she always is could not I fear have borne up against these depressing circumstances long enough to have made the slightest impression on me I stood with my shawl and carpetbag in hand gazing doubtingly on the vehicle Even in the darkness the red dust of Wingdam was visible on its roof and sides and the red slime of Slumgullion clung tenaciously to its wheels I opened the door the stage creaked easily and in the gloomy abyss the swaying straps beckoned me like ghostly hands to come in now and have my sufferings out at once I must not omit to mention the occurrence of a circumstance which struck me as appalling and mysterious A lounger on the steps of the hotel who I had reason to suppose was not in any way connected with the stage company gravely descended and walking toward the conveyance tried the handle of the door opened it expectorated in the carriage and returned to the hotel with a serious demeanor Hardly had he resumed his position when another individual equally disinterested impassively walked down the steps proceeded to the back of the stage lifted it expectorated carefully on the axle and returned slowly and pensively to the hotel A third spectator wearily disengaged himself from one of the Ionic columns of the portico and walked to the box remained for a moment in serious and expectorative contemplation of the boot and then returned to his column There was something so weird in this baptism that I grew quite nervous

none	none	A number of infinitesimal annoyances winding up with the resolute persistency of the clerk at the stage office to enter my name misspelt on the waybill had not predisposed me to cheerfulness The inmates of the Eureka House from a social viewpoint were not attractive There was the prevailing opinion so common to many honest people that a serious style of deportment and conduct toward a stranger indicates high gentility and elevated station Obeying this principle all hilarity ceased on my entrance to supper and general remark merged into the safer and uncompromising chronicle of several bad cases of diphtheria then epidemic at Wingdam When I left the dining room with an odd feeling that I had been supping exclusively on mustard and tea leaves I stopped a moment at the parlor door A piano harmoniously related to the dinner bell tinkled responsive to a diffident and uncertain touch On the white wall the shadow of an old and sharp profile was bending over several symmetrical and shadowy curls I sez to Mariar Mariar sez I Praise to the face is open disgrace I heard no more Dreading some susceptibility to sincere expression on the subject of female loveliness I walked away checking the compliment that otherwise might have risen unbidden to my lips and have brought shame and sorrow to the household It was with the memory of these experiences resting heavily upon me that I stood hesitatingly before the stage door The driver about to mount was for a moment illuminated by the open door of the hotel He had the wearied look which was the distinguishing expression of Wingdam Satisfied that I was properly waybilled and receipted for he took no further notice of me I looked longingly at the box seat but he did not respond to the appeal I flung my carpetbag into the chasm dived recklessly after it and before I was fairly seated with a great sigh a creaking of unwilling springs complaining bolts and harshly expostulating axle we moved away Rather the hotel door slipped behind the sound of the piano sank to rest and the night and its shadows moved solemnly upon us To say it was dark expressed but faintly the pitchy obscurity that encompassed the vehicle The roadside trees were scarcely distinguishable as deeper masses of shadow I knew them only by the peculiar sodden odor that from time to time sluggishly flowed in at the open window as we rolled by We proceeded slowly so leisurely that leaning from the carriage I more than once detected the fragrant sigh of some astonished cow whose ruminating repose upon the highway we had ruthlessly disturbed But in the darkness our progress more the guidance of some mysterious instinct than any apparent volition of our own gave an indefinable charm of security to our journey that a moment s hesitation or indecision on the part of the driver would have destroyed I had indulged a hope that in the empty vehicle I might obtain that rest so often denied me in its crowded condition It was a weak delusion When I stretched out my limbs it was only to find that the ordinary conveniences for making several people distinctly uncomfortable were distributed throughout my individual frame At last resting my arms on the straps by dint of much gymnastic effort I became sufficiently composed to be aware of a more refined species of torture The springs of the stage rising and falling regularly produced a rhythmical beat which began to absorb my attention painfully Slowly this thumping merged into a senseless echo of the mysterious female of the hotel parlor and shaped itself into this awful and benumbing axiom Praise to the face is open disgrace Praise to the face is open disgrace Inequalities of the road only quickened its utterance or drawled it to an exasperating length It was of no use to consider the statement seriously It was of no use to except to it indignantly It was of no use to recall the many instances where praise to the face had redounded to the everlasting honor of praiser and bepraised of no use to dwell sentimentally on modest genius and courage lifted up and strengthened by open commendation of no use to except to the mysterious female to picture her as rearing a thin blooded generation on selfish and mechanically repeated axioms all this failed to counteract the monotonous repetition of this sentence There was nothing to do but to give in and I was about to accept it weakly as we too often treat other illusions of darkness and necessity for the time being when I became aware of some other annoyance that had been forcing itself upon me for the last few moments How quiet the driver was 
639_143022_000010_000000	train-clean-360	Was there any driver 
none	none	Had I any reason to suppose that he was not lying gagged and bound on the roadside and the highwayman with blackened face who did the thing so quietly driving me whither The thing is perfectly feasible And what is this fancy now being jolted out of me A story It s of no use to keep it back particularly in this abysmal vehicle and here it comes I am a Marquis a French Marquis French because the peerage is not so well known and the country is better adapted to romantic incident a Marquis because the democratic reader delights in the nobility My name is something LIGNY I am coming from Paris to my country seat at saint Germain It is a dark night and I fall asleep and tell my honest coachman Andre not to disturb me and dream of an angel The carriage at last stops at the chateau It is so dark that when I alight I do not recognize the face of the footman who holds the carriage door But what of that PESTE I am heavy with sleep The same obscurity also hides the old familiar indecencies of the statues on the terrace but there is a door and it opens and shuts behind me smartly Then I find myself in a trap in the presence of the brigand who has quietly gagged poor Andre and conducted the carriage thither There is nothing for me to do as a gallant French Marquis but to say PARBLEU draw my rapier and die valorously I am found a week or two after outside a deserted cabaret near the barrier with a hole through my ruffled linen and my pockets stripped No on second thoughts I am rescued rescued by the angel I have been dreaming of who is the assumed daughter of the brigand but the real daughter of an intimate friend Looking from the window again in the vain hope of distinguishing the driver I found my eyes were growing accustomed to the darkness I could see the distant horizon defined by India inky woods relieving a lighter sky A few stars widely spaced in this picture glimmered sadly I noticed again the infinite depth of patient sorrow in their serene faces and I hope that the vandal who first applied the flippant twinkle to them may not be driven melancholy mad by their reproachful eyes I noticed again the mystic charm of space that imparts a sense of individual solitude to each integer of the densest constellation involving the smallest star with immeasurable loneliness Something of this calm and solitude crept over me and I dozed in my gloomy cavern When I awoke the full moon was rising Seen from my window it had an indescribably unreal and theatrical effect It was the full moon of NORMA that remarkable celestial phenomenon which rises so palpably to a hushed audience and a sublime andante chorus until the CASTA DIVA is sung the inconstant moon that then and thereafter remains fixed in the heavens as though it were a part of the solar system inaugurated by Joshua Again the white robed Druids filed past me again I saw that improbable mistletoe cut from that impossible oak and again cold chills ran down my back with the first strain of the recitative The thumping springs essayed to beat time and the private box like obscurity of the vehicle lent a cheap enchantment to the view But it was a vast improvement upon my past experience and I hugged the fond delusion My fears for the driver were dissipated with the rising moon A familiar sound had assured me of his presence in the full possession of at least one of his most important functions Frequent and full expectoration convinced me that his lips were as yet not sealed by the gag of highwaymen and soothed my anxious ear With this load lifted from my mind and assisted by the mild presence of Diana who left as when she visited Endymion much of her splendor outside my cavern I looked around the empty vehicle On the forward seat lay a woman s hairpin I picked it up with an interest that however soon abated There was no scent of the roses to cling to it still not even of hair oil No bend or twist in its rigid angles betrayed any trait of its wearer s character I tried to think that it might have been Mariar s I tried to imagine that confining the symmetrical curls of that girl it might have heard the soft compliments whispered in her ears which provoked the wrath of the aged female But in vain It was reticent and unswerving in its upright fidelity and at last slipped listlessly through my fingers I had dozed repeatedly waked on the threshold of oblivion by contact with some of the angles of the coach and feeling that I was unconsciously assuming in imitation of a humble insect of my childish recollection that spherical shape which could best resist those impressions when I perceived that the moon riding high in the heavens had begun to separate the formless masses of the shadowy landscape Trees isolated in clumps and assemblages changed places before my window The sharp outlines of the distant hills came back as in daylight but little softened in the dry cold dewless air of a California summer night I was wondering how late it was and thinking that if the horses of the night traveled as slowly as the team before us Faustus might have been spared his agonizing prayer when a sudden spasm of activity attacked my driver A succession of whip snappings like a pack of Chinese crackers broke from the box before me The stage leaped forward and when I could pick myself from under the seat a long white building had in some mysterious way rolled before my window It must be Slumgullion As I descended from the stage I addressed the driver I thought you changed horses on the road So we did Two hours ago That s odd I didn t notice it

to go to When a knot of us young fellows would recite what splendid opportunities we resigned to go and how sorry our friends were to have us leave and show daguerreotypes and locks of hair and talk of Mary and Susan the man of no account used to sit by and listen with a pained mortified expression on his plain face and say nothing I think he had nothing to say He had no associates except when we patronized him and in point of fact he was a good deal of sport to us He was always seasick whenever we had a capful of wind He never got his sea legs on either And I never shall forget how we all laughed when Rattler took him the piece of pork on a string and But you know that time honored joke And then we had such a splendid lark with him Miss Fanny Twinkler couldn t bear the sight of him and we used to make Fagg think that she had taken a fancy to him and send him little delicacies and books from the cabin You ought to have witnessed the rich scene that took place when he came up stammering and very sick to thank her Didn t she flash up grandly and beautifully and scornfully So like Medora Rattler said Rattler knew Byron by heart and wasn t old Fagg awfully cut up But he got over it and when Rattler fell sick at Valparaiso old Fagg used to nurse him You see he was a good sort of fellow but he lacked manliness and spirit He had absolutely no idea of poetry I ve seen him sit stolidly by mending his old clothes when Rattler delivered that stirring apostrophe of Byron s to the ocean He asked Rattler once quite seriously if he thought Byron was ever seasick I don t remember Rattler s reply but I know we all laughed very much and I have no doubt it was something good for Rattler was smart When the SKYSCRAPER arrived at San Francisco we had a grand feed We agreed to meet every year and perpetuate the occasion Of course we didn t invite Fagg Fagg was a steerage passenger and it was necessary you see now we were ashore to exercise a little discretion But Old Fagg as we called him he was only about twenty five years old by the way was the source of immense amusement to us that day It appeared that he had conceived the idea that he could walk to Sacramento and actually started off afoot We had a good time and shook hands with one another all around and so parted Ah me only eight years ago and yet some of those hands then clasped in amity have been clenched at each other or have dipped furtively in one another s pockets I know that we didn t dine together the next year because young Barker swore he wouldn t put his feet under the same mahogany with such a very contemptible scoundrel as that Mixer and Nibbles who borrowed money at Valparaiso of young Stubbs who was then a waiter in a restaurant didn t like to meet such people When I bought a number of shares in the Coyote Tunnel at Mugginsville in fifty four I thought I d take a run up there and see it I stopped at the Empire Hotel and after dinner I got a horse and rode round the town and out to the claim One of those individuals whom newspaper correspondents call our intelligent informant and to whom in all small communities the right of answering questions is tacitly yielded was quietly pointed out to me Habit had enabled him to work and talk at the same time and he never pretermitted either He gave me a history of the claim and added You see stranger he addressed the bank before him gold is sure to come out er that theer claim he put in a comma with his pick but the old pro pri e tor he wriggled out the word and the point of his pick warn t of much account a long stroke of the pick for a period He was green and let the boys about here jump him and the rest of his sentence was confided to his hat which he had removed to wipe his manly brow with his red bandanna I asked him who was the original proprietor His name war Fagg I went to see him He looked a little older and plainer He had worked hard he said and was getting on so so I took quite a liking to him and patronized him to some extent Whether I did so because I was beginning to have a distrust for such fellows as Rattler and Mixer is not necessary for me to state You remember how the Coyote Tunnel went in and how awfully we shareholders were done Well the next thing I heard was that Rattler who was one of the heaviest shareholders was up at Mugginsville keeping bar for the proprietor of the Mugginsville Hotel and that old Fagg had struck it rich and didn t know what to do with his money All this was told me by Mixer who had been there settling up matters and likewise that Fagg was sweet upon the daughter of the proprietor of the aforesaid hotel And so by hearsay and letter I eventually gathered that old Robins the hotel man was trying to get up a match between Nellie Robins and Fagg Nellie was a pretty plump and foolish little thing and would do just as her father wished I thought it would be a good thing for Fagg if he should marry and settle down that as a married man he might be of some account So I ran up to Mugginsville one day to look after things It did me an immense deal of good to make Rattler mix my drinks for me Rattler the gay brilliant and unconquerable Rattler who had tried to snub me two years ago I talked to him about old Fagg and Nellie particularly as I thought the subject was distasteful He never liked Fagg and he was sure he said that Nellie didn t Did Nellie like anybody else He turned around to the mirror behind the bar and brushed up his hair I understood the conceited wretch I thought I d put Fagg on his guard and get him to hurry up matters I had a long talk with him You could see by the way the poor fellow acted that he was badly stuck He sighed and promised to pluck up courage to hurry matters to a crisis Nellie was a good girl and I think had a sort of quiet respect for old Fagg s unobtrusiveness But her fancy was already taken captive by Rattler s superficial qualities which were obvious and pleasing I don t think Nellie was any worse than you or I We are more apt to take acquaintances at their apparent value than their intrinsic worth It s less trouble and except when we want to trust them quite as convenient The difficulty with women is that their feelings are apt to get interested sooner than ours and then you know reasoning is out of the question This is what old Fagg would have known had he been of any account But he wasn t So much the worse for him It was a few months afterward and I was sitting in my office when in walked old Fagg I was surprised to see him down but we talked over the current topics in that mechanical manner of people who know that they have something else to say but are obliged to get at it in that formal way After an interval Fagg in his natural manner said I m going home Going home Yes that is I think I ll take a trip to the Atlantic States I came to see you as you know I have some little property and I have executed a power of attorney for you to manage my affairs I have some papers I d like to leave with you Will you take charge of them Yes I said But what of Nellie His face fell He tried to smile and the combination resulted in one of the most startling and grotesque effects I ever beheld At length he said I shall not marry Nellie that is he seemed to apologize internally for the positive form of expression I think that I had better not David Fagg I said with sudden severity you re of no account To my astonishment his face brightened Yes said he that s it I m of no account But I always knew it You see I thought Rattler loved that girl as well as I did and I knew she liked him better than she did me and would be happier I dare say with him But then I knew that old Robins would have preferred me to him as I was better off and the girl would do as he said and you see I thought I was kinder in the way and so I left But he continued as I was about to interrupt him for fear the old man might object to Rattler I ve lent him enough to set him up in business for himself in Dogtown A pushing active brilliant fellow you know like Rattler can get along and will soon be in his old position again and you needn t be hard on him you know if he doesn t Good by I was too much disgusted with his treatment of that Rattler to be at all amiable but as his business was profitable I promised to attend to it and he left A few weeks passed The return steamer arrived and a terrible incident occupied the papers for days afterward People in all parts of the State conned eagerly the details of an awful shipwreck and those who had friends aboard went away by themselves and read the long list of the lost under their breath I read of the gifted the gallant the noble and loved ones who had perished and among them I think I was the first to read the name of David Fagg For the man of no account had gone home MLISS CHAPTER I Just where the Sierra Nevada begins to subside in gentler undulations and the rivers grow less rapid and yellow on the side of a great red mountain stands Smith s Pocket Seen from the red road at sunset in the red light and the red dust its white houses look like the outcroppings of quartz on the mountainside The red stage topped with red shirted passengers is lost to view half a dozen times in the tortuous descent turning up unexpectedly in out of the way places and vanishing altogether within a hundred yards of the town It is probably owing to this sudden twist in the road that the advent of a stranger at Smith s Pocket is usually attended with a peculiar circumstance Dismounting from the vehicle at the stage office the too confident traveler is apt to walk straight out of town under the impression that it lies in quite another direction It is related that one of the tunnel men two miles from town met one of these self reliant passengers with a carpetbag umbrella Harper s Magazine and other evidences of Civilization and Refinement plodding along over the road he had just ridden vainly endeavoring to find the settlement of Smith s Pocket An observant traveler might have found some compensation for his disappointment in the weird aspect of that vicinity There were huge fissures on the hillside and displacements of the red soil resembling more the chaos of some primary elemental upheaval than the work of man while halfway down a long flume straddled its narrow body and disproportionate legs over the chasm like an enormous fossil of some forgotten antediluvian At every step smaller ditches crossed the road hiding in their sallow depths unlovely streams that crept away to a clandestine union with the great yellow torrent below and here and there were the ruins of some cabin with the chimney alone left intact and the hearthstone open to the skies The settlement of Smith s Pocket owed its origin to the finding of a pocket on its site by a veritable Smith Five thousand dollars were taken out of it in one half hour by Smith Three thousand dollars were expended by Smith and others in erecting a flume and in tunneling And then Smith s Pocket was found to be only a pocket and subject like other pockets to depletion Although Smith pierced the bowels of the great red mountain that five thousand dollars was the first and last return of his labor The mountain grew reticent of its golden secrets and the flume steadily ebbed away the remainder of Smith s fortune Then Smith went into quartz mining then into quartz milling then into hydraulics and ditching and then by easy degrees into saloonkeeping Presently it was whispered that Smith was drinking a great deal then it was known that Smith was a habitual drunkard and then people began to think as they are apt to that he had never been anything else But the settlement of Smith s Pocket like that of most discoveries was happily not dependent on the fortune of its pioneer and other parties projected tunnels and found pockets So Smith s Pocket became a settlement with its two fancy stores its two hotels its one express office and its two first families Occasionally its one long straggling street was overawed by the assumption of the latest San Francisco fashions imported per express exclusively to the first families making outraged Nature in the ragged outline of her furrowed surface look still more homely and putting personal insult on that greater portion of the population to whom the Sabbath with a change of linen brought merely the necessity of cleanliness without the luxury of adornment Then there was a Methodist Church and hard by a Monte Bank and a little beyond on the mountainside a graveyard and then a little schoolhouse The Master as he was known to his little flock sat alone one night in the schoolhouse with some open copybooks before him carefully making those bold and full characters which are supposed to combine the extremes of chirographical and moral excellence and had got as far as Riches are deceitful and was elaborating the noun with an insincerity of flourish that was quite in the spirit of his text when he heard a gentle tapping The woodpeckers had been busy about the roof during the day and the noise did not disturb his work But the opening of the door and the tapping continuing from the inside caused him to look up He was slightly startled by the figure of a young girl dirty and shabbily clad Still her great black eyes her coarse uncombed lusterless black hair falling over her sunburned face her red arms and feet streaked with the red soil were all familiar to him It was Melissa Smith Smith s motherless child What can she want here thought the master Everybody knew Mliss as she was called throughout the length and height of Red Mountain Everybody knew her as an incorrigible girl Her fierce ungovernable disposition her mad freaks and lawless character were in their way as proverbial as the story of her father s weaknesses and as philosophically accepted by the townsfolk She wrangled with and fought the schoolboys with keener invective and quite as powerful arm She followed the trails with a woodman s craft and the master had met her before miles away shoeless stockingless and bareheaded on the mountain road The miners camps along the stream supplied her with subsistence during these voluntary pilgrimages in freely offered alms Not but that a larger protection had been previously extended to Mliss The reverend Joshua McSnagley stated preacher had placed her in the hotel as servant by way of preliminary refinement and had introduced her to his scholars at Sunday school But she threw plates occasionally at the landlord and quickly retorted to the cheap witticisms of the guests and created in the Sabbath school a sensation that was so inimical to the orthodox dullness and placidity of that institution that with a decent regard for the starched frocks and unblemished morals of the two pink and white faced children of the first families the reverend gentleman had her ignominiously expelled Such were the antecedents and such the character of Mliss as she stood before the master It was shown in the ragged dress the unkempt hair and bleeding feet and asked his pity It flashed from her black fearless eyes and commanded his respect I come here tonight she said rapidly and boldly keeping her hard glance on his because I knew you was alone I wouldn t come here when them gals was here I hate em and they hates me That s why You keep school don t you I want to be teached If to the shabbiness of her apparel and uncomeliness of her tangled hair and dirty face she had added the humility of tears the master would have extended to her the usual moiety of pity and nothing more But with the natural though illogical instincts of his species her boldness awakened in him something of that respect which all original natures pay unconsciously to one another in any grade And he gazed at her the more fixedly as she went on still rapidly her hand on that door latch and her eyes on his My name s Mliss Mliss Smith You can bet your life on that My father s Old Smith Old Bummer Smith that s what s the matter with him Mliss Smith and I m coming to school Well said the master Accustomed to be thwarted and opposed often wantonly and cruelly for no other purpose than to excite the violent impulses of her nature the master s phlegm evidently took her by surprise She stopped she began to twist a lock of her hair between her fingers and the rigid line of upper lip drawn over the wicked little teeth relaxed and quivered slightly Then her eyes dropped and something like a blush struggled up to her cheek and tried to assert itself through the splashes of redder soil and the sunburn of years Suddenly she threw herself forward calling on God to strike her dead and fell quite weak and helpless with her face on the master s desk crying and sobbing as if her heart would break The master lifted her gently and waited for the paroxysm to pass When with face still averted she was repeating between her sobs the MEA CULPA of childish penitence that she d be good she didn t mean to et cetera it came to him to ask her why she had left Sabbath school Why had she left the Sabbath school why Oh yes What did he McSnagley want to tell her she was wicked for What did he tell her that God hated her for If God hated her what did she want to go to Sabbath school for SHE didn t want to be beholden to anybody who hated her Had she told McSnagley this Yes she had The master laughed It was a hearty laugh and echoed so oddly in the little schoolhouse and seemed so inconsistent and discordant with the sighing of the pines without that he shortly corrected himself with a sigh The sigh was quite as sincere in its way however and after a moment of serious silence he asked about her father Her father What father Whose father What had he ever done for her Why did the girls hate her Come now what made the folks say Old Bummer Smith s Mliss when she passed Yes oh yes She wished he was dead she was dead everybody was dead and her sobs broke forth anew The master then leaning over her told her as well as he could what you or I might have said after hearing such unnatural theories from childish lips only bearing in mind perhaps better than you or I the unnatural facts of her ragged dress her bleeding feet and the omnipresent shadow of her drunken father Then raising her to her feet he wrapped his shawl around her and bidding her come early in the morning he walked with her down the road There he bade her good night The moon shone brightly on the narrow path before them He stood and watched the bent little figure as it staggered down the road and waited until it had passed the little graveyard and reached the curve of the hill where it turned and stood for a moment a mere atom of suffering outlined against the far off patient stars Then he went back to his work But the lines of the copybook thereafter faded into long parallels of never ending road over which childish figures seemed to pass sobbing and crying into the night Then the little schoolhouse seeming lonelier than before he shut the door and went home The next morning Mliss came to school Her face had been washed and her coarse black hair bore evidence of recent struggles with the comb in which both had evidently suffered The old defiant look shone occasionally in her eyes but her manner was tamer and more subdued Then began a series of little trials and self sacrifices in which master and pupil bore an equal part and which increased the confidence and sympathy between them Although obedient under the master s eye at times during recess if thwarted or stung by a fancied slight Mliss would rage in ungovernable fury and many a palpitating young savage finding himself matched with his own weapons of torment would seek the master with torn jacket and scratched face and complaints of the dreadful Mliss There was a serious division among the townspeople on the subject some threatening to withdraw their children from such evil companionship and others as warmly upholding the course of the master in his work of reclamation Meanwhile with a steady persistence that seemed quite astonishing to him on looking back afterward the master drew Mliss gradually out of the shadow of her past life as though it were but her natural progress down the narrow path on which he had set her feet the moonlit night of their first meeting Remembering the experience of the evangelical McSnagley he carefully avoided that Rock of Ages on which that unskillful pilot had shipwrecked her young faith But if in the course of her reading she chanced to stumble upon those few words which have lifted such as she above the level of the older the wiser and the more prudent if she learned something of a faith that is symbolized by suffering and the old light softened in her eyes it did not take the shape of a lesson A few of the plainer people had made up a little sum by which the ragged Mliss was enabled to assume the garments of respect and civilization and often a rough shake of the hand and words of homely commendation from a red shirted and burly figure sent a glow to the cheek of the young master and set him to thinking if it was altogether deserved Three months had passed from the time of their first meeting and the master was sitting late one evening over the moral and sententious copies when there came a tap at the door and again Mliss stood before him She was neatly clad and clean faced and there was nothing perhaps but the long black hair and bright black eyes to remind him of his former apparition Are you busy she asked Can you come with me and on his signifying his readiness in her old willful way she said Come then quick They passed out of the door together and into the dark road As they entered the town the master asked her whither she was going She replied To see my father It was the first time he had heard her call him by that filial title or indeed anything more than Old Smith or the Old Man It was the first time in three months that she had spoken of him at all and the master knew she had kept resolutely aloof from him since her great change Satisfied from her manner that it was fruitless to question her purpose he passively followed In out of the way places low groggeries restaurants and saloons in gambling hells and dance houses the master preceded by Mliss came and went In the reeking smoke and blasphemous outcries of low dens the child holding the master s hand stood and anxiously gazed seemingly unconscious of all in the one absorbing nature of her pursuit Some of the revelers recognizing Mliss called to the child to sing and dance for them and would have forced liquor upon her but for the interference of the master Others recognizing him mutely made way for them to pass So an hour slipped by Then the child whispered in his ear that there was a cabin on the other side of the creek crossed by the long flume where she thought he still might be Thither they crossed a toilsome half hour s walk but in vain They were returning by the ditch at the abutment of the flume gazing at the lights of the town on the opposite bank when suddenly sharply a quick report rang out on the clear night air The echoes caught it and carried it round and round Red Mountain and set the dogs to barking all along the streams Lights seemed to dance and move quickly on the outskirts of the town for a few moments the stream rippled quite audibly beside them a few stones loosened themselves from the hillside and splashed into the stream a heavy wind seemed to surge the branches of the funereal pines and then the silence seemed to fall thicker heavier and deadlier The master turned toward Mliss with an unconscious gesture of protection but the child had gone Oppressed by a strange fear he ran quickly down the trail to the river s bed and jumping from boulder to boulder reached the base of Red Mountain and the outskirts of the village Midway of the crossing he looked up and held his breath in awe For high above him on the narrow flume he saw the fluttering little figure of his late companion crossing swiftly in the darkness He climbed the bank and guided by a few lights moving about a central point on the mountain soon found himself breathless among a crowd of awe stricken and sorrowful men Out from among them the child appeared and taking the master s hand led him silently before what seemed a ragged hole in the mountain Her face was quite white but her excited manner gone and her look that of one to whom some long expected event had at last happened an expression that to the master in his bewilderment seemed almost like relief The walls of the cavern were partly propped by decaying timbers The child pointed to what appeared to be some ragged castoff clothes left in the hole by the late occupant The master approached nearer with his flaming dip and bent over them It was Smith already cold with a pistol in his hand and a bullet in his heart lying beside his empty pocket CHAPTER II The opinion which McSnagley expressed in reference to a change of heart supposed to be experienced by Mliss was more forcibly described in the gulches and tunnels It was thought there that Mliss had struck a good lead So when there was a new grave added to the little enclosure and at the expense of the master a little board and inscription put above it the RED MOUNTAIN BANNER came out quite handsomely and did the fair thing to the memory of one of our oldest Pioneers alluding gracefully to that bane of noble intellects and otherwise genteelly shelving our dear brother with the past He leaves an only child to mourn his loss says the BANNER who is now an exemplary scholar thanks to the efforts of the reverend mister McSnagley The reverend McSnagley in fact made a strong point of Mliss s conversion and indirectly attributing to the unfortunate child the suicide of her father made affecting allusions in Sunday school to the beneficial effects of the silent tomb and in this cheerful contemplation drove most of the children into speechless horror and caused the pink and white scions of the first families to howl dismally and refuse to be comforted The long dry summer came As each fierce day burned itself out in little whiffs of pearl gray smoke on the mountain summits and the upspringing breeze scattered its red embers over the landscape the green wave which in early spring upheaved above Smith s grave grew sere and dry and hard In those days the master strolling in the little churchyard of a Sabbath afternoon was sometimes surprised to find a few wild flowers plucked from the damp pine forests scattered there and oftener rude wreaths hung upon the little pine cross Most of these wreaths were formed of a sweet scented grass which the children loved to keep in their desks intertwined with the plumes of the buckeye the syringa and the wood anemone and here and there the master noticed the dark blue cowl of the monkshood or deadly aconite There was something in the odd association of this noxious plant with these memorials which occasioned a painful sensation to the master deeper than his esthetic sense One day during a long walk in crossing a wooded ridge he came upon Mliss in the heart of the forest perched upon a prostrate pine on a fantastic throne formed by the hanging plumes of lifeless branches her lap full of grasses and pine burrs and crooning to herself one of the Negro melodies of her younger life Recognizing him at a distance she made room for him on her elevated throne and with a grave assumption of hospitality and patronage that would have been ridiculous had it not been so terribly earnest she fed him with pine nuts and crab apples The master took that opportunity to point out to her the noxious and deadly qualities of the monkshood whose dark blossoms he saw in her lap and extorted from her a promise not to meddle with it as long as she remained his pupil This done as the master had tested her integrity before he rested satisfied and the strange feeling which had overcome him on seeing them died away Of the homes that were offered Mliss when her conversion became known the master preferred that of missus Morpher a womanly and kindhearted specimen of Southwestern efflorescence known in her maidenhood as the Per rairie Rose Being one of those who contend resolutely against their own natures missus Morpher by a long series of self sacrifices and struggles had at last subjugated her naturally careless disposition to principles of order which she considered in common with mister Pope as Heaven s first law But she could not entirely govern the orbits of her satellites however regular her own movements and even her own Jeemes sometimes collided with her Again her old nature asserted itself in her children Lycurgus dipped into the cupboard between meals and Aristides came home from school without shoes leaving those important articles on the threshold for the delight of a barefooted walk down the ditches Octavia and Cassandra were keerless of their clothes So with but one exception however much the Prairie Rose might have trimmed and pruned and trained her own matured luxuriance the little shoots came up defiantly wild and straggling That one exception was Clytemnestra Morpher aged fifteen She was the realization of her mother s immaculate conception neat orderly and dull It was an amiable weakness of missus Morpher to imagine that Clytie was a consolation and model for Mliss Following this fallacy missus Morpher threw Clytie at the head of Mliss when she was bad and set her up before the child for adoration in her penitential moments It was not therefore surprising to the master to hear that Clytie was coming to school obviously as a favor to the master and as an example for Mliss and others For Clytie was quite a young lady Inheriting her mother s physical peculiarities and in obedience to the climatic laws of the Red Mountain region she was an early bloomer The youth of Smith s Pocket to whom this kind of flower was rare sighed for her in April and languished in May Enamored swains haunted the schoolhouse at the hour of dismissal A few were jealous of the master Perhaps it was this latter circumstance that opened the master s eyes to another He could not help noticing that Clytie was romantic that in school she required a great deal of attention that her pens were uniformly bad and wanted fixing that she usually accompanied the request with a certain expectation in her eye that was somewhat disproportionate to the quality of service she verbally required that she sometimes allowed the curves of a round plump white arm to rest on his when he was writing her copies that she always blushed and flung back her blond curls when she did so I don t remember whether I have stated that the master was a young man it s of little consequence however he had been severely educated in the school in which Clytie was taking her first lesson and on the whole withstood the flexible curves and factitious glance like the fine young Spartan that he was Perhaps an insufficient quality of food may have tended to this asceticism He generally avoided Clytie but one evening when she returned to the schoolhouse after something she had forgotten and did not find it until the master walked home with her I hear that he endeavored to make himself particularly agreeable partly from the fact I imagine that his conduct was adding gall and bitterness to the already overcharged hearts of Clytemnestra s admirers The morning after this affecting episode Mliss did not come to school Noon came but not Mliss Questioning Clytie on the subject it appeared that they had left the school together but the willful Mliss had taken another road The afternoon brought her not In the evening he called on missus Morpher whose motherly heart was really alarmed mister Morpher had spent all day in search of her without discovering a trace that might lead to her discovery Aristides was summoned as a probable accomplice but that equitable infant succeeded in impressing the household with his innocence missus Morpher entertained a vivid impression that the child would yet be found drowned in a ditch or what was almost as terrible muddied and soiled beyond the redemption of soap and water Sick at heart the master returned to the schoolhouse As he lit his lamp and seated himself at his desk he found a note lying before him addressed to himself in Mliss s handwriting It seemed to be written on a leaf torn from some old memorandum book and to prevent sacrilegious trifling had been sealed with six broken wafers Opening it almost tenderly the master read as follows RESPECTED SIR When you read this I am run away Never to come back NEVER NEVER NEVER You can give my beeds to Mary Jennings and my Amerika s Pride a highly colored lithograph from a tobacco box to Sally Flanders But don t you give anything to Clytie Morpher Don t you dare to Do you know what my opinion is of her it is this she is perfekly disgustin That is all and no more at present from Yours respectfully MELISSA SMITH The master sat pondering on this strange epistle till the moon lifted its bright face above the distant hills and illuminated the trail that led to the schoolhouse beaten quite hard with the coming and going of little feet Then more satisfied in mind he tore the missive into fragments and scattered them along the road At sunrise the next morning he was picking his way through the palmlike fern and thick underbrush of the pine forest starting the hare from its form and awakening a querulous protest from a few dissipated crows who had evidently been making a night of it and so came to the wooded ridge where he had once found Mliss There he found the prostrate pine and tasseled branches but the throne was vacant As he drew nearer what might have been some frightened animal started through the crackling limbs It ran up the tossed arms of the fallen monarch and sheltered itself in some friendly foliage The master reaching the old seat found the nest still warm looking up in the intertwining branches he met the black eyes of the errant Mliss They gazed at each other without speaking She was first to break the silence What do you want she asked curtly The master had decided on a course of action I want some crab apples he said humbly Sha n t have em go away Why don t you get em of Clytemnerestera It seemed to be a relief to Mliss to express her contempt in additional syllables to that classical young woman s already long drawn title O you wicked thing I am hungry Lissy I have eaten nothing since dinner yesterday I am famished and the young man in a state of remarkable exhaustion leaned against the tree Melissa s heart was touched In the bitter days of her gypsy life she had known the sensation he so artfully simulated Overcome by his heartbroken tone but not entirely divested of suspicion she said Dig under the tree near the roots and you ll find lots but mind you don t tell for Mliss had HER hoards as well as the rats and squirrels But the master of course was unable to find them the effects of hunger probably blinding his senses Mliss grew uneasy At length she peered at him through the leaves in an elfish way and questioned If I come down and give you some you ll promise you won t touch me The master promised Hope you ll die if you do The master accepted instant dissolution as a forfeit Mliss slid down the tree For a few moments nothing transpired but the munching of the pine nuts Do you feel better she asked with some solicitude The master confessed to a recuperated feeling and then gravely thanking her proceeded to retrace his steps As he expected he had not gone far before she called him He turned She was standing there quite white with tears in her widely opened orbs The master felt that the right moment had come Going up to her he took both her hands and looking in her tearful eyes said gravely Lissy do you remember the first evening you came to see me Lissy remembered You asked me if you might come to school for you wanted to learn something and be better and I said Come responded the child promptly What would YOU say if the master now came to you and said that he was lonely without his little scholar and that he wanted her to come and teach him to be better The child hung her head for a few moments in silence The master waited patiently Tempted by the quiet a hare ran close to the couple and raising her bright eyes and velvet forepaws sat and gazed at them A squirrel ran halfway down the furrowed bark of the fallen tree and there stopped We are waiting Lissy said the master in a whisper and the child smiled Stirred by a passing breeze the treetops rocked and a long pencil of light stole through their interlaced boughs full on the doubting face and irresolute little figure Suddenly she took the master s hand in her quick way What she said was scarcely audible but the master putting the black hair back from her forehead kissed her and so hand in hand they passed out of the damp aisles and forest odors into the open sunlit road CHAPTER III Somewhat less spiteful in her intercourse with other scholars Mliss still retained an offensive attitude in regard to Clytemnestra Perhaps the jealous element was not entirely lulled in her passionate little breast 
1809-143025-0001	train-other-500	Perhaps it was only that the round curves and plump outline offered more extended pinching surface But while such ebullitions were under the master s control her enmity occasionally took a new and irrepressible form The master in his first estimate of the child s character
1809-143025-0002	train-other-500	could not conceive that she had ever possessed a doll But the master like many other professed readers of character was safer in a posteriori than a priori reasoning Mliss had a doll but then it was emphatically Mliss s doll a smaller copy of herself
1809-143025-0003	train-other-500	Its unhappy existence had been a secret discovered accidentally by missus Morpher It had been the old time companion of Mliss s wanderings and bore evident marks of suffering Its original complexion was long since washed away by the weather
1809-143025-0004	train-other-500	and anointed by the slime of ditches It looked very much as Mliss had in days past Its one gown of faded stuff was dirty and ragged as hers had been Mliss had never been known to apply to it any childish term of endearment
1809-143025-0005	train-other-500	She never exhibited it in the presence of other children It was put severely to bed in a hollow tree near the schoolhouse and only allowed exercise during Mliss s rambles Fulfilling a stern duty to her doll as she would to herself it knew no luxuries
1809-143025-0006	train-other-500	Now missus Morpher obeying a commendable impulse bought another doll and gave it to Mliss The child received it gravely and curiously The master on looking at it one day fancied he saw a slight resemblance in its round
1809-143025-0007	train-other-500	red cheeks and mild blue eyes to Clytemnestra It became evident before long that Mliss had also noticed the same resemblance Accordingly she hammered its waxen head on the rocks when she was alone and sometimes dragged it with a string round its neck to and from school
1809-143025-0008	train-other-500	At other times setting it up on her desk she made a pincushion of its patient and inoffensive body Whether this was done in revenge of what she considered a second figurative obtrusion of Clytie s excellences upon her
1809-143025-0009	train-other-500	or whether she had an intuitive appreciation of the rites of certain other heathens and indulging in that fetish ceremony imagined that the original of her wax model would pine away and finally die is a metaphysical question I shall not now consider
1809-143025-0010	train-other-500	In spite of these moral vagaries the master could not help noticing in her different tasks the working of a quick restless and vigorous perception She knew neither the hesitancy nor the doubts of childhood Her answers in class were always slightly dashed with audacity
1809-143025-0011	train-other-500	Of course she was not infallible But her courage and daring in passing beyond her own depth and that of the floundering little swimmers around her in their minds outweighed all errors of judgment Children are not better than grown people in this respect I fancy
1809-143025-0012	train-other-500	and whenever the little red hand flashed above her desk there was a wondering silence and even the master was sometimes oppressed with a doubt of his own experience and judgment Nevertheless certain attributes which at first amused and entertained his fancy began to afflict him with grave doubts
1809-143025-0013	train-other-500	He could not but see that Mliss was revengeful irreverent and willful That there was but one better quality which pertained to her semisavage disposition the faculty of physical fortitude and self sacrifice and another though not always an attribute of the noble savage
1809-143025-0014	train-other-500	Truth Mliss was both fearless and sincere perhaps in such a character the adjectives were synonymous The master had been doing some hard thinking on this subject
none	none	 and had arrived at that conclusion quite common to all who think sincerely that he was generally the slave of his own prejudices when he determined to call on the reverend McSnagley for advice This decision was somewhat humiliating to his pride as he and McSnagley were not friends 
1809-143025-0016	train-other-500	But he thought of Mliss and the evening of their first meeting and perhaps with a pardonable superstition that it was not chance alone that had guided her willful feet to the schoolhouse and perhaps with a complacent consciousness of the rare magnanimity of the act he choked back his dislike
none	none	 and went to McSnagley The reverend gentleman was glad to see him Moreover he observed that the master was looking peartish and hoped he had got over the neuralgy and rheumatiz He himself had been troubled with a dumb ager since last conference But he had learned to rastle and pray Pausing a moment to enable the master to write his certain method of curing the dumb ager upon the book and volume of his brain mister McSnagley proceeded to inquire after Sister Morpher She is an adornment to ChrisTEWanity and has a likely growin young family added mister McSnagley and there s that mannerly young gal 
1809-143025-0019	train-other-500	so well behaved Miss Clytie In fact Clytie s perfections seemed to affect him to such an extent that he dwelt for several minutes upon them The master was doubly embarrassed In the first place there was an enforced contrast with poor Mliss in all this praise of Clytie Secondly
1809-143025-0020	train-other-500	there was something unpleasantly confidential in his tone of speaking of missus Morpher s earliest born So that the master after a few futile efforts to say something natural found it convenient to recall another engagement and left without asking the information required but in his after reflections
none	none	 somewhat unjustly giving the reverend mister McSnagley 
1809-143025-0021	train-other-500	the full benefit of having refused it Perhaps this rebuff placed the master and pupil once more in the close communion of old The child seemed to notice the change in the master s manner which had of late been constrained and in one of their long postprandial walks she stopped suddenly
1809-143025-0022	train-other-500	and mounting a stump looked full in his face with big searching eyes You ain t mad said she with an interrogative shake of the black braids No Nor bothered No Nor hungry
1809-143025-0023	train-other-500	Hunger was to Mliss a sickness that might attack a person at any moment No Nor thinking of her Of whom Lissy That white girl
none	none	 This was the latest epithet invented by Mliss who was a very dark brunette 
1809-143025-0024	train-other-500	to express Clytemnestra No Upon your word A substitute for Hope you ll die proposed by the master Yes And sacred honor Yes Then Mliss gave him a fierce little kiss and hopping down fluttered off
1809-143025-0025	train-other-500	For two or three days after that she condescended to appear more like other children and be as she expressed it good Two years had passed since the master s advent at Smith s Pocket and as his salary was not large
1809-143025-0026	train-other-500	and the prospects of Smith s Pocket eventually becoming the capital of the State not entirely definite he contemplated a change He had informed the school trustees privately of his intentions but educated young men of unblemished moral character being scarce at that time
1809-143025-0027	train-other-500	he consented to continue his school term through the winter to early spring None else knew of his intention except his one friend
none	none	 a doctor Duchesne 
1809-143025-0028	train-other-500	a young Creole physician known to the people of Wingdam as Duchesny He never mentioned it to missus Morpher Clytie or any of his scholars His reticence was partly the result of a constitutional indisposition to fuss partly a desire to be spared the questions and surmises of vulgar curiosity
1809-143025-0029	train-other-500	and partly that he never really believed he was going to do anything before it was done He did not like to think of Mliss It was a selfish instinct perhaps which made him try to fancy his feeling for the child was foolish romantic and unpractical He even tried to imagine
1809-143025-0030	train-other-500	that she would do better under the control of an older and sterner teacher Then she was nearly eleven and in a few years by the rules of Red Mountain would be a woman
none	none	 He had done his duty 
1809-143025-0031	train-other-500	After Smith s death he addressed letters to Smith s relatives and received one answer from a sister of Melissa s mother Thanking the master she stated her intention of leaving the Atlantic States for California with her husband in a few months
1809-143025-0032	train-other-500	This was a slight superstructure for the airy castle which the master pictured for Mliss s home but it was easy to fancy that some loving sympathetic woman with the claims of kindred might better guide her wayward nature Yet
none	none	 when the master had read the letter 
1809-143025-0033	train-other-500	Mliss listened to it carelessly received it submissively and afterward cut figures out of it with her scissors supposed to represent Clytemnestra labeled the white girl to prevent mistakes and impaled them upon the outer walls of the schoolhouse When the summer was about spent
1809-143025-0034	train-other-500	and the last harvest had been gathered in the valleys the master bethought him of gathering in a few ripened shoots of the young idea and of having his Harvest Home or Examination So the savants and professionals of Smith s Pocket were gathered to witness that time honored custom
1809-143025-0035	train-other-500	of placing timid children in a constrained positions and bullying them as in a witness box As usual in such cases the most audacious and self possessed were the lucky recipients of the honors The reader will imagine
1809-143025-0036	train-other-500	that in the present instance Mliss and Clytie were preeminent and divided public attention Mliss with her clearness of material perception and self reliance
none	none	 Clytie with her placid self esteem and saintlike correctness of deportment 
1809-143025-0037	train-other-500	The other little ones were timid and blundering Mliss s readiness and brilliancy of course captivated the greatest number and provoked the greatest applause Mliss s antecedents had unconsciously awakened the strongest sympathies of a class whose athletic forms were ranged against the walls
1809-143025-0038	train-other-500	or whose handsome bearded faces looked in at the windows
none	none	 But Mliss s popularity 
1809-143025-0039	train-other-500	was overthrown by an unexpected circumstance
none	none	 McSnagley had invited himself and had been going through the pleasing entertainment of frightening the more timid pupils by the vaguest and most ambiguous questions delivered in an impressive funereal tone and Mliss had soared into astronomy and was tracking the course of our spotted ball through space and keeping time with the music of the spheres and defining the tethered orbits of the planets when McSnagley impressively arose Meelissy ye were speaking of the revolutions of this yere yearth and the move MENTS of the sun and I think ye said it had been a doing of it since the creashun eh Mliss nodded a scornful affirmative Well war that the truth said McSnagley folding his arms Yes said Mliss shutting up her little red lips tightly The handsome outlines at the windows peered further in the schoolroom 
1809-143025-0042	train-other-500	and a saintly Raphael face with blond beard and soft blue eyes belonging to the biggest scamp in the diggings turned toward the child and whispered Stick to it Mliss The reverend gentleman heaved a deep sigh and cast a compassionate glance at the master
1809-143025-0043	train-other-500	then at the children and then rested his look on Clytie That young woman softly elevated her round white arm Its seductive curves were enhanced by a gorgeous and massive specimen bracelet the gift of one of her humblest worshipers worn in honor of the occasion
1809-143025-0044	train-other-500	There was a momentary silence Clytie s round cheeks were very pink and soft Clytie s big eyes were very bright and blue Clytie s low necked white book muslin rested softly on Clytie s white plump shoulders
1809-143025-0045	train-other-500	Clytie looked at the master and the master nodded Then Clytie spoke softly Joshua commanded the sun to stand still and it obeyed him There was a low hum of applause in the schoolroom
none	none	 a triumphant expression on McSnagley s face a grave shadow on the master s and a comical look of disappointment reflected from the windows Mliss skimmed rapidly over her astronomy 
1809-143025-0047	train-other-500	and then shut the book with a loud snap
none	none	 A groan burst from McSnagley an expression of astonishment from the schoolroom a yell from the windows as Mliss brought her red fist down on the desk with the emphatic declaration It s a damn lie I don t believe it CHAPTER IV The long wet season had drawn near its close Signs of spring were visible in the swelling buds and rushing torrents 
1809-143025-0048	train-other-500	The pine forests exhaled the fresher spicery The azaleas were already budding the ceanothus getting ready its lilac livery for spring On the green upland which climbed Red Mountain at its southern aspect
1809-143025-0049	train-other-500	the long spike of the monkshood shot up from its broad leaved stool and once more shook its dark blue bells Again the billow above Smith s grave was soft and green its crest just tossed with the foam of daisies and buttercups
none	none	 The little graveyard had gathered a few new dwellers in the past year 
1809-143025-0050	train-other-500	and the mounds were placed two by two by the little paling until they reached Smith s grave and there there was but one General superstition had shunned it and the plot beside Smith was vacant
none	none	 There had been several placards posted about the town 
1809-143025-0051	train-other-500	intimating that at a certain period a celebrated dramatic company would perform for a few days a series of side splitting and screaming farces that alternating pleasantly with this there would be some melodrama and a grand divertisement which would include singing dancing et cetera
none	none	 These announcements occasioned a great fluttering among the little folk 
1809-143025-0052	train-other-500	and were the theme of much excitement and great speculation among the master s scholars
none	none	 The master had promised Mliss 
1809-143025-0053	train-other-500	to whom this sort of thing was sacred and rare that she should go
none	none	 and on that momentous evening the master and Mliss assisted 
1809-143025-0054	train-other-500	The performance was the prevalent style of heavy mediocrity the melodrama was not bad enough to laugh at nor good enough to excite But the master turning wearily to the child was astonished and felt something like self accusation
1809-143025-0055	train-other-500	in noticing the peculiar effect upon her excitable nature
none	none	 The red blood flushed in her cheeks at each stroke of her panting little heart 
1809-143025-0056	train-other-500	Her small passionate lips were slightly parted to give vent to her hurried breath Her widely opened lids threw up and arched her black eyebrows She did not laugh at the dismal comicalities of the funny man for Mliss seldom laughed
1809-143025-0057	train-other-500	Nor was she discreetly affected to the delicate extremes of the corner of a white handkerchief as was the tender hearted Clytie who was talking with her feller and ogling the master at the same moment But when the performance was over and the green curtain fell on the little stage
1809-143025-0058	train-other-500	Mliss drew a long deep breath and turned to the master s grave face with a half apologetic smile and wearied gesture Then she said Now take me home and dropped the lids of her black eyes as if to dwell once more in fancy on the mimic stage
1809-143025-0059	train-other-500	On their way to missus Morpher s the master thought proper to ridicule the whole performance Now he shouldn t wonder if Mliss thought that the young lady who acted so beautifully
none	none	 was really in earnest and in love with the gentleman who wore such fine clothes 
1809-143025-0060	train-other-500	Well if she were in love with him it was a very unfortunate thing Why said Mliss with an upward sweep of the drooping lid Oh well he couldn t support his wife at his present salary
none	none	 and pay so much a week for his fine clothes 
1809-143025-0061	train-other-500	and then they wouldn t receive as much wages if they were married as if they were merely lovers that is added the master if they are not already married to somebody else but I think the husband of the pretty young countess takes the tickets at the door or pulls up the curtain or snuffs the candles or does something equally refined and elegant
1809-143025-0062	train-other-500	As to the young man with nice clothes which are really nice now and must cost at least two and a half or three dollars not to speak of that mantle of red drugget which I happen to know the price of for I bought some of it for my room once as to this young man Lissy he is a pretty good fellow
1809-143025-0063	train-other-500	and if he does drink occasionally I don t think people ought to take advantage of it and give him black eyes and throw him in the mud Do you I am sure he might owe me two dollars and a half a long time before I would throw it up in his face as the fellow did the other night at Wingdam
none	none	 Mliss had taken his hand in both of hers and was trying to look in his eyes 
1809-143025-0064	train-other-500	which the young man kept as resolutely averted Mliss had a faint idea of irony indulging herself sometimes in a species of sardonic humor
none	none	 which was equally visible in her actions and her speech 
1809-143025-0065	train-other-500	But the young man continued in this strain until they had reached missus Morpher s and he had deposited Mliss in her maternal charge Waiving the invitation of missus Morpher to refreshment and rest and shading his eyes with his hand to keep out the blue eyed Clytemnestra s siren glances
1809-143025-0066	train-other-500	he excused himself and went home For two or three days after the advent of the dramatic company Mliss was late at school and the master s usual Friday afternoon ramble was for once omitted owing to the absence of his trustworthy guide
none	none	 As he was putting away his books and preparing to leave the schoolhouse 
1809-143025-0067	train-other-500	a small voice piped at his side Please sir The master turned and there stood Aristides Morpher Well my little man said the master impatiently what is it quick Please sir
none	none	 me and Kerg thinks that Mliss is going to run away agin 
1809-143025-0068	train-other-500	What s that sir said the master with that unjust testiness with which we always receive disagreeable news Why sir she don t stay home any more and Kerg and me see her talking with one of those actor fellers and she s with him now
1809-143025-0069	train-other-500	and please sir yesterday she told Kerg and me
none	none	 she could make a speech as well as Miss Cellerstina Montmoressy and she spouted right off by heart 
1809-143025-0070	train-other-500	and the little fellow paused in a collapsed condition What actor asked the master
none	none	 Him as wears the shiny hat 
1809-143025-0071	train-other-500	And hair And gold pin And gold chain said the just Aristides putting periods for commas to eke out his breath The master put on his gloves and hat
none	none	 feeling an unpleasant tightness in his chest and thorax 
1809-143025-0072	train-other-500	and walked out in the road Aristides trotted along by his side
none	none	 endeavoring to keep pace with his short legs to the master s strides 
1809-143025-0073	train-other-500	when the master stopped suddenly and Aristides bumped up against him Where were they talking asked the master as if continuing the conversation At the Arcade said Aristides When they reached the main street the master paused
1809-143025-0074	train-other-500	Run down home said he to the boy If Mliss is there come to the Arcade and tell me If she isn t there stay home run And off trotted the short legged Aristides The Arcade was just across the way
1809-143025-0075	train-other-500	a long rambling building containing a barroom billiard room and restaurant As the young man crossed the plaza he noticed that two or three of the passers by turned and looked after him He looked at his clothes took out his handkerchief and wiped his face before he entered the barroom
1809-143025-0076	train-other-500	It contained the usual number of loungers who stared at him as he entered One of them looked at him so fixedly and with such a strange expression that the master stopped and looked again and then saw it was only his own reflection in a large mirror
none	none	 This made the master think that perhaps he was a little excited 
1809-143025-0077	train-other-500	and so he took up a copy of the RED MOUNTAIN BANNER from one of the tables and tried to recover his composure by reading the column of advertisements He then walked through the barroom through the restaurant and into the billiard room The child was not there In the latter apartment
1809-143025-0078	train-other-500	a person was standing by one of the tables with a broad brimmed glazed hat on his head The master recognized him as the agent of the dramatic company he had taken a dislike to him at their first meeting from the peculiar fashion of wearing his beard and hair
1809-143025-0079	train-other-500	Satisfied that the object of his search was not there he turned to the man with a glazed hat He had noticed the master but tried that common trick of unconsciousness in which vulgar natures always fail Balancing a billiard cue in his hand
none	none	 he pretended to play with a ball in the center of the table 
1809-143025-0080	train-other-500	The master stood opposite to him until he raised his eyes when their glances met the master walked up to him He had intended to avoid a scene or quarrel but when he began to speak something kept rising in his throat
none	none	 and retarded his utterance and his own voice frightened him 
1809-143025-0081	train-other-500	it sounded so distant low and resonant I understand he began that Melissa Smith an orphan and one of my scholars has talked with you about adopting your profession Is that so The man with the glazed hat
none	none	 leaned over the table 
1809-143025-0082	train-other-500	and made an imaginary shot that sent the ball spinning round the cushions Then walking round the table he recovered the ball and placed it upon the spot This duty discharged getting ready for another shot he said S pose she has
1809-143025-0083	train-other-500	The master choked up again but squeezing the cushion of the table in his gloved hand he went on If you are a gentleman I have only to tell you that I am her guardian and responsible for her career You know as well as I do the kind of life you offer her
1809-143025-0084	train-other-500	As you may learn of anyone here I have already brought her out of an existence worse than death
none	none	 out of the streets and the contamination of vice 
1809-143025-0085	train-other-500	I am trying to do so again Let us talk like men She has neither father mother sister or brother Are you seeking to give her an equivalent for these The man with the glazed hat examined the point of his cue
1809-143025-0086	train-other-500	and then looked around for somebody to enjoy the joke with him I know that she is a strange willful girl continued the master but she is better than she was I believe that I have some influence over her still I beg and hope therefore that you will take no further steps in this matter
1809-143025-0087	train-other-500	but as a man as a gentleman leave her to me I am willing But here something rose again in the master s throat and the sentence remained unfinished The man with the glazed hat mistaking the master s silence
1809-143025-0088	train-other-500	raised his head with a coarse brutal laugh and said in a loud voice Want her yourself do you That cock won t fight here young man The insult was more in the tone than in the words
none	none	 more in the glance than tone 
1809-143025-0089	train-other-500	and more in the man s instinctive nature than all these The best appreciable rhetoric to this kind of animal is a blow The master felt this and with his pent up nervous energy finding expression in the one act he struck the brute full in his grinning face
1809-143025-0090	train-other-500	The blow sent the glazed hat one way and the cue another and tore the glove and skin from the master s hand from knuckle to joint It opened up the corners of the fellow s mouth and spoilt the peculiar shape of his beard for some time to come
1809-143025-0091	train-other-500	There was a shout an imprecation a scuffle and the trampling of many feet Then the crowd parted right and left and two sharp quick reports followed each other in rapid succession Then they closed again about his opponent and the master was standing alone
1809-143025-0092	train-other-500	He remembered picking bits of burning wadding from his coat sleeve with his left hand Someone was holding his other hand Looking at it he saw it was still bleeding from the blow but his fingers were clenched around the handle of a glittering knife
1809-143025-0093	train-other-500	He could not remember when or how he got it The man who was holding his hand was mister Morpher He hurried the master to the door but the master held back
none	none	 and tried to tell him as well as he could with his parched throat about Mliss 
1809-143025-0094	train-other-500	It s all right my boy said mister Morpher She s home And they passed out into the street together
none	none	 As they walked along mister Morpher said that Mliss had come running into the house a few moments before and had dragged him out 
1809-143025-0095	train-other-500	saying that somebody was trying to kill the master at the Arcade Wishing to be alone the master promised mister Morpher that he would not seek the agent again that night and parted from him taking the road toward the schoolhouse He was surprised in nearing it to find the door open
1809-143025-0096	train-other-500	still more surprised to find Mliss sitting there The master s nature as I have hinted before had like most sensitive organizations a selfish basis The brutal taunt thrown out by his late adversary still rankled in his heart
1809-143025-0097	train-other-500	It was possible he thought that such a construction might be put upon his affection for the child which at best was foolish and Quixotic Besides had she not voluntarily abnegated his authority and affection
none	none	 And what had everybody else said about her 
1809-143025-0098	train-other-500	Why should he alone combat the opinion of all and be at last obliged tacitly to confess the truth of all they predicted And he had been a participant in a low barroom fight with a common boor and risked his life to prove what What had he proved Nothing
none	none	 What would the people say What would his friends say What would McSnagley say In his self accusation the last person he should have wished to meet was Mliss He entered the door and going up to his desk 
1809-143025-0100	train-other-500	told the child in a few cold words that he was busy and wished to be alone As she rose he took her vacant seat and sitting down buried his head in his hands When he looked up again she was still standing there She was looking at his face with an anxious expression
none	none	 Did you kill him she asked 
1809-143025-0101	train-other-500	No said the master That s what I gave you the knife for said the child quickly Gave me the knife repeated the master in bewilderment Yes gave you the knife I was there under the bar Saw you hit him Saw you both fall He dropped his old knife
1809-143025-0102	train-other-500	I gave it to you Why didn t you stick him said Mliss rapidly with an expressive twinkle of the black eyes and a gesture of the little red hand
none	none	 The master could only look his astonishment 
1809-143025-0103	train-other-500	Yes said Mliss If you d asked me I d told you I was off with the play actors
none	none	 Why was I off with the play actors 
1809-143025-0104	train-other-500	Because you wouldn t tell me you was going away I knew it I heard you tell the Doctor so
none	none	 I wasn t a goin to stay here alone with those Morphers 
1809-143025-0105	train-other-500	I d rather die first With a dramatic gesture which was perfectly consistent with her character she drew from her bosom a few limp green leaves and holding them out at arm s length said in her quick vivid way and in the queer pronunciation of her old life
1809-143025-0106	train-other-500	which she fell into when unduly excited That s the poison plant you said would kill me I ll go with the play actors or I ll eat this and die here I don t care which I won t stay here where they hate and despise me Neither would you let me if you didn t hate and despise me too
1809-143025-0107	train-other-500	The passionate little breast heaved and two big tears peeped over the edge of Mliss s eyelids but she whisked them away with the corner of her apron as if they had been wasps If you lock me up in jail said Mliss fiercely to keep me from the play actors
1809-143025-0108	train-other-500	I ll poison myself Father killed himself why shouldn t I You said a mouthful of that root would kill me and I always carry it here
none	none	 and she struck her breast with her clenched fist The master thought of the vacant plot beside Smith s grave and of the passionate little figure before him 
1809-143025-0109	train-other-500	Seizing her hands in his and looking full into her truthful eyes he said Lissy will you go with ME The child put her arms around his neck and said joyfully Yes But now tonight Tonight
1809-143025-0110	train-other-500	And hand in hand they passed into the road the narrow road that had once brought her weary feet to the master s door and which it seemed she should not tread again alone The stars glittered brightly above them For good or ill the lesson had been learned
none	none	 and behind them the school of Red Mountain closed upon them forever THE RIGHT EYE OF THE COMMANDER The year of grace seventeen ninety seven passed away on the coast of California in a southwesterly gale The little bay of San Carlos albeit sheltered by the headlands of the blessed Trinity was rough and turbulent its foam clung quivering to the seaward wall of the Mission garden the air was filled with flying sand and spume and as the Senor Commandante Hermenegildo Salvatierra looked from the deep embrasured window of the Presidio guardroom he felt the salt breath of the distant sea buffet a color into his smoke dried cheeks The Commander I have said was gazing thoughtfully from the window of the guardroom He may have been reviewing the events of the year now about to pass away But like the garrison at the Presidio there was little to review the year like its predecessors had been uneventful the days had slipped by in a delicious monotony of simple duties unbroken by incident or interruption The regularly recurring feasts and saints days the half yearly courier from San Diego the rare transport ship and rarer foreign vessel were the mere details of his patriarchal life If there was no achievement there was certainly no failure Abundant harvests and patient industry amply supplied the wants of Presidio and Mission Isolated from the family of nations the wars which shook the world concerned them not so much as the last earthquake the struggle that emancipated their sister colonies on the other side of the continent to them had no suggestiveness In short it was that glorious Indian summer of California history around which so much poetical haze still lingers that bland indolent autumn of Spanish rule so soon to be followed by the wintry storms of Mexican independence and the reviving spring of American conquest The Commander turned from the window and walked toward the fire that burned brightly on the deep ovenlike hearth A pile of copybooks the work of the Presidio school lay on the table As he turned over the leaves with a paternal interest and surveyed the fair round Scripture text the first pious pothooks of the pupils of San Carlos an audible commentary fell from his lips Abimelech took her from Abraham ah little one excellent Jacob sent to see his brother body of Christ that upstroke of thine Paquita is marvelous the Governor shall see it A film of honest pride dimmed the Commander s left eye the right alas twenty years before had been sealed by an Indian arrow He rubbed it softly with the sleeve of his leather jacket and continued The Ishmaelites having arrived He stopped for there was a step in the courtyard a foot upon the threshold and a stranger entered With the instinct of an old soldier the Commander after one glance at the intruder turned quickly toward the wall where his trusty Toledo hung or should have been hanging But it was not there and as he recalled that the last time he had seen that weapon it was being ridden up and down the gallery by Pepito the infant son of Bautista the tortilla maker he blushed and then contented himself with frowning upon the intruder But the stranger s air though irreverent was decidedly peaceful He was unarmed and wore the ordinary cape of tarpaulin and sea boots of a mariner Except a villainous smell of codfish there was little about him that was peculiar His name as he informed the Commander in Spanish that was more fluent than elegant or precise his name was Peleg Scudder He was master of the schooner GENERAL COURT of the port of Salem in Massachusetts on a trading voyage to the South Seas but now driven by stress of weather into the bay of San Carlos He begged permission to ride out the gale under the headlands of the blessed Trinity and no more Water he did not need having taken in a supply at Bodega He knew the strict surveillance of the Spanish port regulations in regard to foreign vessels and would do nothing against the severe discipline and good order of the settlement There was a slight tinge of sarcasm in his tone as he glanced toward the desolate parade ground of the Presidio and the open unguarded gate The fact was that the sentry Felipe Gomez had discreetly retired to shelter at the beginning of the storm and was then sound asleep in the corridor The Commander hesitated The port regulations were severe but he was accustomed to exercise individual authority and beyond an old order issued ten years before regarding the American ship COLUMBIA there was no precedent to guide him The storm was severe and a sentiment of humanity urged him to grant the stranger s request It is but just to the Commander to say that his inability to enforce a refusal did not weigh with his decision He would have denied with equal disregard of consequences that right to a seventy four gun ship which he now yielded so gracefully to this Yankee trading schooner He stipulated only that there should be no communication between the ship and shore For yourself Senor Captain he continued accept my hospitality The fort is yours as long as you shall grace it with your distinguished presence and with old fashioned courtesy he made the semblance of withdrawing from the guardroom Master Peleg Scudder smiled as he thought of the half dismantled fort the two moldy brass cannon cast in Manila a century previous and the shiftless garrison A wild thought of accepting the Commander s offer literally conceived in the reckless spirit of a man who never let slip an offer for trade for a moment filled his brain but a timely reflection of the commercial unimportance of the transaction checked him He only took a capacious quid of tobacco as the Commander gravely drew a settle before the fire and in honor of his guest untied the black silk handkerchief that bound his grizzled brows What passed between Salvatierra and his guest that night it becomes me not as a grave chronicler of the salient points of history to relate I have said that Master Peleg Scudder was a fluent talker and under the influence of divers strong waters furnished by his host he became still more loquacious And think of a man with a twenty years budget of gossip The Commander learned for the first time how Great Britain lost her colonies of the French Revolution of the great Napoleon whose achievements perhaps Peleg colored more highly than the Commander s superiors would have liked And when Peleg turned questioner the Commander was at his mercy He gradually made himself master of the gossip of the Mission and Presidio the small beer chronicles of that pastoral age the conversion of the heathen the Presidio schools and even asked the Commander how he had lost his eye It is said that at this point of the conversation Master Peleg produced from about his person divers small trinkets kickshaws and newfangled trifles and even forced some of them upon his host It is further alleged that under the malign influence of Peleg and several glasses of aguardiente the Commander lost somewhat of his decorum and behaved in a manner unseemly for one in his position reciting high flown Spanish poetry and even piping in a thin high voice divers madrigals and heathen canzonets of an amorous complexion chiefly in regard to a little one who was his the Commander s soul These allegations perhaps unworthy the notice of a serious chronicler should be received with great caution and are introduced here as simple hearsay That the Commander however took a handkerchief and attempted to show his guest the mysteries of the SEMICUACUA capering in an agile but indecorous manner about the apartment has been denied Enough for the purposes of this narrative that at midnight Peleg assisted his host to bed with many protestations of undying friendship and then as the gale had abated took his leave of the Presidio and hurried aboard the GENERAL COURT When the day broke the ship was gone I know not if Peleg kept his word with his host It is said that the holy fathers at the Mission that night heard a loud chanting in the plaza as of the heathens singing psalms through their noses that for many days after an odor of salt codfish prevailed in the settlement that a dozen hard nutmegs which were unfit for spice or seed were found in the possession of the wife of the baker and that several bushels of shoe pegs which bore a pleasing resemblance to oats but were quite inadequate to the purposes of provender were discovered in the stable of the blacksmith But when the reader reflects upon the sacredness of a Yankee trader s word the stringent discipline of the Spanish port regulations and the proverbial indisposition of my countrymen to impose upon the confidence of a simple people he will at once reject this part of the story A roll of drums ushering in the year seventeen ninety eight awoke the Commander The sun was shining brightly and the storm had ceased He sat up in bed and through the force of habit rubbed his left eye As the remembrance of the previous night came back to him he jumped from his couch and ran to the window There was no ship in the bay A sudden thought seemed to strike him and he rubbed both of his eyes Not content with this he consulted the metallic mirror which hung beside his crucifix There was no mistake the Commander had a visible second eye a right one as good save for the purposes of vision as the left Whatever might have been the true secret of this transformation but one opinion prevailed at San Carlos It was one of those rare miracles vouchsafed a pious Catholic community as an evidence to the heathen through the intercession of the blessed San Carlos himself That their beloved Commander the temporal defender of the Faith should be the recipient of this miraculous manifestation was most fit and seemly The Commander himself was reticent he could not tell a falsehood he dared not tell the truth After all if the good folk of San Carlos believed that the powers of his right eye were actually restored was it wise and discreet for him to undeceive them For the first time in his life the Commander thought of policy for the first time he quoted that text which has been the lure of so many well meaning but easy Christians of being all things to all men Infeliz Hermenegildo Salvatierra For by degrees an ominous whisper crept though the little settlement The Right Eye of the Commander although miraculous seemed to exercise a baleful effect upon the beholder No one could look at it without winking It was cold hard relentless and unflinching More than that it seemed to be endowed with a dreadful prescience a faculty of seeing through and into the inarticulate thoughts of those it looked upon The soldiers of the garrison obeyed the eye rather than the voice of their commander and answered his glance rather than his lips in questioning The servants could not evade the ever watchful but cold attention that seemed to pursue them The children of the Presidio school smirched their copybooks under the awful supervision and poor Paquita the prize pupil failed utterly in that marvelous upstroke when her patron stood beside her Gradually distrust suspicion self accusation and timidity took the place of trust confidence and security throughout San Carlos Whenever the Right Eye of the Commander fell a shadow fell with it Nor was Salvatierra entirely free from the baleful influence of his miraculous acquisition Unconscious of its effect upon others he only saw in their actions evidence of certain things that the crafty Peleg had hinted on that eventful New Year s eve His most trusty retainers stammered blushed and faltered before him Self accusations confessions of minor faults and delinquencies or extravagant excuses and apologies met his mildest inquiries The very children that he loved his pet pupil Paquita seemed to be conscious of some hidden sin The result of this constant irritation showed itself more plainly For the first half year the Commander s voice and eye were at variance He was still kind tender and thoughtful in speech Gradually however his voice took upon itself the hardness of his glance and its skeptical impassive quality and as the year again neared its close it was plain that the Commander had fitted himself to the eye and not the eye to the Commander It may be surmised that these changes did not escape the watchful solicitude of the Fathers Indeed the few who were first to ascribe the right eye of Salvatierra to miraculous origin and the special grace of the blessed San Carlos now talked openly of witchcraft and the agency of Luzbel the evil one It would have fared ill with Hermenegildo Salvatierra had he been aught but Commander or amenable to local authority But the reverend father Friar Manuel de Cortes had no power over the political executive and all attempts at spiritual advice failed signally He retired baffled and confused from his first interview with the Commander who seemed now to take a grim satisfaction in the fateful power of his glance The holy Father contradicted himself exposed the fallacies of his own arguments and even it is asserted committed himself to several undoubted heresies When the Commander stood up at mass if the officiating priest caught that skeptical and searching eye the service was inevitably ruined Even the power of the Holy Church seemed to be lost and the last hold upon the affections of the people and the good order of the settlement departed from San Carlos As the long dry summer passed the low hills that surrounded the white walls of the Presidio grew more and more to resemble in hue the leathern jacket of the Commander and Nature herself seemed to have borrowed his dry hard glare The earth was cracked and seamed with drought a blight had fallen upon the orchards and vineyards and the rain long delayed and ardently prayed for came not The sky was as tearless as the right eye of the Commander Murmurs of discontent insubordination and plotting among the Indians reached his ears he only set his teeth the more firmly tightened the knot of his black silk handkerchief and looked up his Toledo The last day of the year seventeen ninety eight found the Commander sitting at the hour of evening prayers alone in the guardroom He no longer attended the services of the Holy Church but crept away at such times to some solitary spot where he spent the interval in silent meditation The firelight played upon the low beams and rafters but left the bowed figure of Salvatierra in darkness Sitting thus he felt a small hand touch his arm and looking down saw the figure of Paquita his little Indian pupil at his knee Ah littlest of all said the Commander with something of his old tenderness lingering over the endearing diminutives of his native speech sweet one what doest thou here Art thou not afraid of him whom everyone shuns and fears No said the little Indian readily not in the dark I hear your voice the old voice I feel your touch the old touch but I see not your eye Senor Commandante That only I fear and that O senor O my father said the child lifting her little arms towards his that I know is not thine own The Commander shuddered and turned away Then recovering himself he kissed Paquita gravely on the forehead and bade her retire A few hours later when silence had fallen upon the Presidio he sought his own couch and slept peacefully At about the middle watch of the night a dusky figure crept through the low embrasure of the Commander s apartment Other figures were flitting through the parade ground which the Commander might have seen had he not slept so quietly The intruder stepped noiselessly to the couch and listened to the sleeper s deep drawn inspiration Something glittered in the firelight as the savage lifted his arm another moment and the sore perplexities of Hermenegildo Salvatierra would have been over when suddenly the savage started and fell back in a paroxysm of terror The Commander slept peacefully but his right eye widely opened fixed and unaltered glared coldly on the would be assassin The man fell to the earth in a fit and the noise awoke the sleeper To rise to his feet grasp his sword and deal blows thick and fast upon the mutinous savages who now thronged the room was the work of a moment Help opportunely arrived and the undisciplined Indians were speedily driven beyond the walls but in the scuffle the Commander received a blow upon his right eye and lifting his hand to that mysterious organ it was gone Never again was it found and never again for bale or bliss did it adorn the right orbit of the Commander With it passed away the spell that had fallen upon San Carlos The rain returned to invigorate the languid soil harmony was restored between priest and soldier the green grass presently waved over the sere hillsides the children flocked again to the side of their martial preceptor a TE DEUM was sung in the Mission Church and pastoral content once more smiled upon the gentle valleys of San Carlos And far southward crept the GENERAL COURT with its master Peleg Scudder trafficking in beads and peltries with the Indians and offering glass eyes wooden legs and other Boston notions to the chiefs NOTES BY FLOOD AND FIELD PART I IN THE FIELD It was near the close of an October day that I began to be disagreeably conscious of the Sacramento Valley I had been riding since sunrise and my course through the depressing monotony of the long level landscape affected me more like a dull dyspeptic dream than a business journey performed under that sincerest of natural phenomena a California sky The recurring stretches of brown and baked fields the gaping fissures in the dusty trail the hard outline of the distant hills and the herds of slowly moving cattle seemed like features of some glittering stereoscopic picture that never changed Active exercise might have removed this feeling but my horse by some subtle instinct had long since given up all ambitious effort and had lapsed into a dogged trot It was autumn but not the season suggested to the Atlantic reader under that title The sharply defined boundaries of the wet and dry seasons were prefigured in the clear outlines of the distant hills In the dry atmosphere the decay of vegetation was too rapid for the slow hectic which overtakes an Eastern landscape or else Nature was too practical for such thin disguises She merely turned the Hippocratic face to the spectator with the old diagnosis of Death in her sharp contracted features In the contemplation of such a prospect there was little to excite any but a morbid fancy There were no clouds in the flinty blue heavens and the setting of the sun was accompanied with as little ostentation as was consistent with the dryly practical atmosphere Darkness soon followed with a rising wind which increased as the shadows deepened on the plain The fringe of alder by the watercourse began to loom up as I urged my horse forward A half hour s active spurring brought me to a corral and a little beyond a house so low and broad it seemed at first sight to be half buried in the earth My second impression was that it had grown out of the soil like some monstrous vegetable its dreary proportions were so in keeping with the vast prospect There were no recesses along its roughly boarded walls for vagrant and unprofitable shadows to lurk in the daily sunshine No projection for the wind by night to grow musical over to wail whistle or whisper to only a long wooden shelf containing a chilly looking tin basin and a bar of soap Its uncurtained windows were red with the sinking sun as though bloodshot and inflamed from a too long unlidded existence The tracks of cattle led to its front door firmly closed against the rattling wind To avoid being confounded with this familiar element I walked to the rear of the house which was connected with a smaller building by a slight platform A grizzled hard faced old man was standing there and met my salutation with a look of inquiry and without speaking led the way to the principal room As I entered four young men who were reclining by the fire slightly altered their attitudes of perfect repose but beyond that betrayed neither curiosity nor interest A hound started from a dark corner with a growl but was immediately kicked by the old man into obscurity and silenced again I can t tell why but I instantly received the impression that for a long time the group by the fire had not uttered a word or moved a muscle Taking a seat I briefly stated my business Was a United States surveyor Had come on account of the Espiritu Santo Rancho Wanted to correct the exterior boundaries of township lines so as to connect with the near exteriors of private grants There had been some intervention to the old survey by a mister Tryan who had preempted adjacent settled land warrants interrupted the old man Ah yes Land warrants and then this was mister Tryan I had spoken mechanically for I was preoccupied in connecting other public lines with private surveys as I looked in his face It was certainly a hard face and reminded me of the singular effect of that mining operation known as ground sluicing the harder lines of underlying character were exposed and what were once plastic curves and soft outlines were obliterated by some powerful agency There was a dryness in his voice not unlike the prevailing atmosphere of the valley as he launched into an EX PARTE statement of the contest with a fluency which like the wind without showed frequent and unrestrained expression He told me what I had already learned that the boundary line of the old Spanish grant was a creek described in the loose phraseology of the DESENO as beginning in the VALDA or skirt of the hill its precise location long the subject of litigation I listened and answered with little interest for my mind was still distracted by the wind which swept violently by the house as well as by his odd face which was again reflected in the resemblance that the silent group by the fire bore toward him He was still talking and the wind was yet blowing when my confused attention was aroused by a remark addressed to the recumbent figures Now then which on ye ll see the stranger up the creek to Altascar s tomorrow There was a general movement of opposition in the group but no decided answer Kin you go Kerg Who s to look up stock in Strarberry perar ie This seemed to imply a negative and the old man turned to another hopeful who was pulling the fur from a mangy bearskin on which he was lying with an expression as though it were somebody s hair Well Tom wot s to hinder you from goin Mam s goin to Brown s store at sunup and I s pose I ve got to pack her and the baby agin I think the expression of scorn this unfortunate youth exhibited for the filial duty into which he had been evidently beguiled was one of the finest things I had ever seen Wise Wise deigned no verbal reply but figuratively thrust a worn and patched boot into the discourse The old man flushed quickly I told ye to get Brown to give you a pair the last time you war down the river Said he wouldn t without en order Said it was like pulling gum teeth to get the money from you even then There was a grim smile at this local hit at the old man s parsimony and Wise who was clearly the privileged wit of the family sank back in honorable retirement Well Joe ef your boots are new and you aren t pestered with wimmin and children p r aps you ll go said Tryan with a nervous twitching intended for a smile about a mouth not remarkably mirthful Tom lifted a pair of bushy eyebrows and said shortly Got no saddle Wot s gone of your saddle Kerg there indicating his brother with a look such as Cain might have worn at the sacrifice You lie returned Kerg cheerfully Tryan sprang to his feet seizing the chair flourishing it around his head and gazing furiously in the hard young faces which fearlessly met his own But it was only for a moment his arm soon dropped by his side and a look of hopeless fatality crossed his face He allowed me to take the chair from his hand and I was trying to pacify him by the assurance that I required no guide when the irrepressible Wise again lifted his voice Theer s George comin why don t ye ask him He ll go and introduce you to Don Fernandy s darter too ef you ain t pertickler The laugh which followed this joke which evidently had some domestic allusion the general tendency of rural pleasantry was followed by a light step on the platform and the young man entered Seeing a stranger present he stopped and colored made a shy salute and colored again and then drawing a box from the corner sat down his hands clasped lightly together and his very handsome bright blue eyes turned frankly on mine Perhaps I was in a condition to receive the romantic impression he made upon me and I took it upon myself to ask his company as guide and he cheerfully assented But some domestic duty called him presently away The fire gleamed brightly on the hearth and no longer resisting the prevailing influence I silently watched the spurting flame listening to the wind which continually shook the tenement Besides the one chair which had acquired a new importance in my eyes I presently discovered a crazy table in one corner with an ink bottle and pen the latter in that greasy state of decomposition peculiar to country taverns and farmhouses A goodly array of rifles and double barreled guns stocked the corner half a dozen saddles and blankets lay near with a mild flavor of the horse about them Some deer and bear skins completed the inventory As I sat there with the silent group around me the shadowy gloom within and the dominant wind without I found it difficult to believe I had ever known a different existence My profession had often led me to wilder scenes but rarely among those whose unrestrained habits and easy unconsciousness made me feel so lonely and uncomfortable I shrank closer to myself not without grave doubts which I think occur naturally to people in like situations that this was the general rule of humanity and I was a solitary and somewhat gratuitous exception It was a relief when a laconic announcement of supper by a weak eyed girl caused a general movement in the family We walked across the dark platform which led to another low ceiled room Its entire length was occupied by a table at the farther end of which a weak eyed woman was already taking her repast as she at the same time gave nourishment to a weak eyed baby As the formalities of introduction had been dispensed with and as she took no notice of me I was enabled to slip into a seat without discomposing or interrupting her Tryan extemporized a grace and the attention of the family became absorbed in bacon potatoes and dried apples The meal was a sincere one Gentle gurglings at the upper end of the table often betrayed the presence of the wellspring of pleasure The conversation generally referred to the labors of the day and comparing notes as to the whereabouts of missing stock Yet the supper was such a vast improvement upon the previous intellectual feast that when a chance allusion of mine to the business of my visit brought out the elder Tryan the interest grew quite exciting I remember he inveighed bitterly against the system of ranch holding by the greasers as he was pleased to term the native Californians As the same ideas have been sometimes advanced under more pretentious circumstances they may be worthy of record Look at em holdin the finest grazin land that ever lay outer doors Whar s the papers for it Was it grants Mighty fine grants most of em made arter the Merrikans got possession More fools the Merrikans for lettin em hold em Wat paid for em Merrikan and blood money Didn t they oughter have suthin out of their native country Wot for Did they ever improve Got a lot of yaller skinned diggers not so sensible as niggers to look arter stock and they a sittin home and smokin With their gold and silver candlesticks and missions and crucifixens priests and graven idols and sich Them sort things wurent allowed in Mizzoori At the mention of improvements I involuntarily lifted my eyes and met the half laughing half embarrassed look of George The act did not escape detection and I had at once the satisfaction of seeing that the rest of the family had formed an offensive alliance against us It was agin Nater and agin God added Tryan God never intended gold in the rocks to be made into heathen candlesticks and crucifixens That s why he sent Merrikans here Nater never intended such a climate for lazy lopers She never gin six months sunshine to be slept and smoked away How long he continued and with what further illustration I could not say for I took an early opportunity to escape to the sitting room I was soon followed by George who called me to an open door leading to a smaller room and pointed to a bed You d better sleep there tonight he said you ll be more comfortable and I ll call you early I thanked him and would have asked him several questions which were then troubling me but he shyly slipped to the door and vanished A shadow seemed to fall on the room when he had gone The boys returned one by one and shuffled to their old places A larger log was thrown on the fire and the huge chimney glowed like a furnace but it did not seem to melt or subdue a single line of the hard faces that it lit In half an hour later the furs which had served as chairs by day undertook the nightly office of mattresses and each received its owner s full length figure mister Tryan had not returned and I missed George I sat there until wakeful and nervous I saw the fire fall and shadows mount the wall There was no sound but the rushing of the wind and the snoring of the sleepers At last feeling the place insupportable I seized my hat and opening the door ran out briskly into the night The acceleration of my torpid pulse in the keen fight with the wind whose violence was almost equal to that of a tornado and the familiar faces of the bright stars above me I felt as a blessed relief I ran not knowing whither and when I halted the square outline of the house was lost in the alder bushes An uninterrupted plain stretched before me like a vast sea beaten flat by the force of the gale As I kept on I noticed a slight elevation toward the horizon and presently my progress was impeded by the ascent of an Indian mound It struck me forcibly as resembling an island in the sea Its height gave me a better view of the expanding plain But even here I found no rest The ridiculous interpretation Tryan had given the climate was somehow sung in my ears and echoed in my throbbing pulse as guided by the star I sought the house again But I felt fresher and more natural as I stepped upon the platform The door of the lower building was open and the old man was sitting beside the table thumbing the leaves of a Bible with a look in his face as though he were hunting up prophecies against the Greaser I turned to enter but my attention was attracted by a blanketed figure lying beside the house on the platform The broad chest heaving with healthy slumber and the open honest face were familiar It was George who had given up his bed to the stranger among his people I was about to wake him but he lay so peaceful and quiet I felt awed and hushed And I went to bed with a pleasant impression of his handsome face and tranquil figure soothing me to sleep I was awakened the next morning from a sense of lulled repose and grateful silence by the cheery voice of George who stood beside my bed ostentatiously twirling a riata as if to recall the duties of the day to my sleep bewildered eyes I looked around me The wind had been magically laid and the sun shone warmly through the windows A dash of cold water with an extra chill on from the tin basin helped to brighten me It was still early but the family had already breakfasted and dispersed and a wagon winding far in the distance showed that the unfortunate Tom had already packed his relatives away I felt more cheerful there are few troubles Youth cannot distance with the start of a good night s rest After a substantial breakfast prepared by George in a few moments we were mounted and dashing down the plain We followed the line of alder that defined the creek now dry and baked with summer s heat but which in winter George told me overflowed its banks I still retain a vivid impression of that morning s ride the far off mountains like silhouettes against the steel blue sky the crisp dry air and the expanding track before me animated often by the well knit figure of George Tryan musical with jingling spurs and picturesque with flying riata He rode powerful native roan wild eyed untiring in stride and unbroken in nature Alas the curves of beauty were concealed by the cumbrous MACHILLAS of the Spanish saddle which levels all equine distinctions The single rein lay loosely on the cruel bit that can gripe and if need be crush the jaw it controls Again the illimitable freedom of the valley rises before me as we again bear down into sunlit space Can this be Chu Chu staid and respectable filly of American pedigree Chu Chu forgetful of plank roads and cobblestones wild with excitement twinkling her small white feet beneath me George laughs out of a cloud of dust Give her her head don t you see she likes it and Chu Chu seems to like it and whether bitten by native tarantula into native barbarism or emulous of the roan blood asserts itself and in a moment the peaceful servitude of years is beaten out in the music of her clattering hoofs The creek widens to a deep gully We dive into it and up on the opposite side carrying a moving cloud of impalpable powder with us Cattle are scattered over the plain grazing quietly or banded together in vast restless herds George makes a wide indefinite sweep with the riata as if to include them all in his vaquero s loop and says Ours About how many George Don t know How many Well p r aps three thousand head says George reflecting We don t know takes five men to look em up and keep run What are they worth About thirty dollars a head I make a rapid calculation and look my astonishment at the laughing George Perhaps a recollection of the domestic economy of the Tryan household is expressed in that look for George averts his eye and says apologetically I ve tried to get the old man to sell and build but you know he says it ain t no use to settle down just yet We must keep movin In fact he built the shanty for that purpose lest titles should fall through and we d have to get up and move stakes further down Suddenly his quick eye detects some unusual sight in a herd we are passing and with an exclamation he puts his roan into the center of the mass I follow or rather Chu Chu darts after the roan and in a few moments we are in the midst of apparently inextricable horns and hoofs TORO shouts George with vaquero enthusiasm and the band opens a way for the swinging riata I can feel their steaming breaths and their spume is cast on Chu Chu s quivering flank Wild devilish looking beasts are they not such shapes as Jove might have chosen to woo a goddess nor such as peacefully range the downs of Devon but lean and hungry Cassius like bovines economically got up to meet the exigencies of a six months rainless climate and accustomed to wrestle with the distracting wind and the blinding dust That s not our brand says George they re strange stock and he points to what my scientific eye recognizes as the astrological sign of Venus deeply seared in the brown flanks of the bull he is chasing But the herd are closing round us with low mutterings and George has again recourse to the authoritative TORO and with swinging riata divides the bossy bucklers on either side When we are free and breathing somewhat more easily I venture to ask George if they ever attack anyone Never horsemen sometimes footmen Not through rage you know but curiosity They think a man and his horse are one and if they meet a chap afoot they run him down and trample him under hoof in the pursuit of knowledge But adds George here s the lower bench of the foothills and here s Altascar s corral and that White building you see yonder is the casa A whitewashed wall enclosed a court containing another adobe building baked with the solar beams of many summers Leaving our horses in the charge of a few peons in the courtyard who were basking lazily in the sun we entered a low doorway where a deep shadow and an agreeable coolness fell upon us as sudden and grateful as a plunge in cool water from its contrast with the external glare and heat In the center of a low ceiled apartment sat an old man with a black silk handkerchief tied about his head the few gray hairs that escaped from its folds relieving his gamboge colored face The odor of CIGARRITOS was as incense added to the cathedral gloom of the building As Senor Altascar rose with well bred gravity to receive us George advanced with such a heightened color and such a blending of tenderness and respect in his manner that I was touched to the heart by so much devotion in the careless youth In fact my eyes were still dazzled by the effect of the outer sunshine and at first I did not see the white teeth and black eyes of Pepita who slipped into the corridor as we entered It was no pleasant matter to disclose particulars of business which would deprive the old senor of the greater part of that land we had just ridden over and I did it with great embarrassment But he listened calmly not a muscle of his dark face stirring and the smoke curling placidly from his lips showed his regular respiration When I had finished he offered quietly to accompany us to the line of demarcation George had meanwhile disappeared but a suspicious conversation in broken Spanish and English in the corridor betrayed his vicinity When he returned again a little absent minded the old man by far the coolest and most self possessed of the party extinguished his black silk cap beneath that stiff uncomely sombrero which all native Californians affect A serape thrown over his shoulders hinted that he was waiting Horses are always ready saddled in Spanish ranchos and in half an hour from the time of our arrival we were again loping in the staring sunlight But not as cheerfully as before George and myself were weighed down by restraint and Altascar was gravely quiet To break the silence and by way of a consolatory essay I hinted to him that there might be further intervention or appeal but the proffered oil and wine were returned with a careless shrug of the shoulders and a sententious QUE BUENO Your courts are always just The Indian mound of the previous night s discovery was a bearing monument of the new line and there we halted We were surprised to find the old man Tryan waiting us For the first time during our interview the old Spaniard seemed moved and the blood rose in his yellow cheek I was anxious to close the scene and pointed out the corner boundaries as clearly as my recollection served The deputies will be here tomorrow to run the lines from this initial point and there will be no further trouble I believe gentlemen Senor Altascar had dismounted and was gathering a few tufts of dried grass in his hands George and I exchanged glances He presently arose from his stooping posture and advancing to within a few paces of Joseph Tryan said in a voice broken with passion And I Fernando Jesus Maria Altascar put you in possession of my land in the fashion of my country He threw a sod to each of the cardinal points I don t know your courts your judges or your CORREGIDORES Take the LLANO and take this with it May the drought seize your cattle till their tongues hang down as long as those of your lying lawyers May it be the curse and torment of your old age as you and yours have made it of mine We stepped between the principal actors in this scene which only the passion of Altascar made tragical but Tryan with a humility but ill concealing his triumph interrupted Let him curse on He ll find em coming home to him sooner than the cattle he has lost through his sloth and pride The Lord is on the side of the just as well as agin all slanderers and revilers Altascar but half guessed the meaning of the Missourian yet sufficiently to drive from his mind all but the extravagant power of his native invective Stealer of the Sacrament Open not open not I say your lying Judas lips to me Ah half breed with the soul of a coyote car r r ramba With his passion reverberating among the consonants like distant thunder he laid his hand upon the mane of his horse as though it had been the gray locks of his adversary swung himself into the saddle and galloped away George turned to me Will you go back with us tonight I thought of the cheerless walls the silent figures by the fire and the roaring wind and hesitated Well then goodby Goodby George Another wring of the hands and we parted I had not ridden far when I turned and looked back The wind had risen early that afternoon and was already sweeping across the plain A cloud of dust traveled before it and a picturesque figure occasionally emerging therefrom was my last indistinct impression of George Tryan PART II IN THE FLOOD Three months after the survey of the Espiritu Santo Rancho I was again in the valley of the Sacramento But a general and terrible visitation had erased the memory of that event as completely as I supposed it had obliterated the boundary monuments I had planted The great flood of eighteen sixty one sixty two was at its height when obeying some indefinite yearning I took my carpetbag and embarked for the inundated valley There was nothing to be seen from the bright cabin windows of the GOLDEN CITY but night deepening over the water The only sound was the pattering rain and that had grown monotonous for the past two weeks and did not disturb the national gravity of my countrymen as they silently sat around the cabin stove Some on errands of relief to friends and relatives wore anxious faces and conversed soberly on the one absorbing topic Others like myself attracted by curiosity listened eagerly to newer details But with that human disposition to seize upon any circumstance that might give chance event the exaggerated importance of instinct I was half conscious of something more than curiosity as an impelling motive The dripping of rain the low gurgle of water and a leaden sky greeted us the next morning as we lay beside the half submerged levee of Sacramento Here however the novelty of boats to convey us to the hotels was an appeal that was irresistible I resigned myself to a dripping rubber cased mariner called Joe and wrapping myself in a shining cloak of the like material about as suggestive of warmth as court plaster might have been took my seat in the stern sheets of his boat It was no slight inward struggle to part from the steamer that to most of the passengers was the only visible connecting link between us and the dry and habitable earth but we pulled away and entered the city stemming a rapid current as we shot the levee We glided up the long level of K Street once a cheerful busy thoroughfare now distressing in its silent desolation The turbid water which seemed to meet the horizon edge before us flowed at right angles in sluggish rivers through the streets Nature had revenged herself on the local taste by disarraying the regular rectangles by huddling houses on street corners where they presented abrupt gables to the current or by capsizing them in compact ruin Crafts of all kinds were gliding in and out of low arched doorways The water was over the top of the fences surrounding well kept gardens in the first stories of hotels and private dwellings trailing its slime on velvet carpets as well as roughly boarded floors And a silence quite as suggestive as the visible desolation was in the voiceless streets that no longer echoed to carriage wheel or footfall The low ripple of water the occasional splash of oars or the warning cry of boatmen were the few signs of life and habitation With such scenes before my eyes and such sounds in my ears as I lie lazily in the boat is mingled the song of my gondolier who sings to the music of his oars It is not quite as romantic as his brother of the Lido might improvise but my Yankee Giuseppe has the advantage of earnestness and energy and gives a graphic description of the terrors of the past week and of noble deeds of self sacrifice and devotion occasionally pointing out a balcony from which some California Bianca or Laura had been snatched half clothed and famished Giuseppe is otherwise peculiar and refuses the proffered fare for am I not a citizen of San Francisco which was first to respond to the suffering cry of Sacramento and is not he Giuseppe a member of the Howard Society No Giuseppe is poor but cannot take my money Still if I must spend it there is the Howard Society and the women and children without food and clothes at the Agricultural Hall I thank the generous gondolier and we go to the Hall a dismal bleak place ghastly with the memories of last year s opulence and plenty and here Giuseppe s fare is swelled by the stranger s mite But here Giuseppe tells me of the Relief Boat which leaves for the flooded district in the interior and here profiting by the lesson he has taught me I make the resolve to turn my curiosity to the account of others and am accepted of those who go forth to succor and help the afflicted Giuseppe takes charge of my carpetbag and does not part from me until I stand on the slippery deck of Relief Boat No three An hour later I am in the pilothouse looking down upon what was once the channel of a peaceful river But its banks are only defined by tossing tufts of willow washed by the long swell that breaks over a vast inland sea Stretches of tule land fertilized by its once regular channel and dotted by flourishing ranchos are now cleanly erased The cultivated profile of the old landscape had faded Dotted lines in symmetrical perspective mark orchards that are buried and chilled in the turbid flood The roofs of a few farmhouses are visible and here and there the smoke curling from chimneys of half submerged tenements shows an undaunted life within Cattle and sheep are gathered on Indian mounds waiting the fate of their companions whose carcasses drift by us or swing in eddies with the wrecks of barns and outhouses Wagons are stranded everywhere where the tide could carry them As I wipe the moistened glass I see nothing but water pattering on the deck from the lowering clouds dashing against the window dripping from the willows hissing by the wheels everywhere washing coiling sapping hurrying in rapids or swelling at last into deeper and vaster lakes awful in their suggestive quiet and concealment As day fades into night the monotony of this strange prospect grows oppressive I seek the engine room and in the company of some of the few half drowned sufferers we have already picked up from temporary rafts I forget the general aspect of desolation in their individual misery Later we meet the San Francisco packet and transfer a number of our passengers From them we learn how inward bound vessels report to have struck the well defined channel of the Sacramento fifty miles beyond the bar There is a voluntary contribution taken among the generous travelers for the use of our afflicted and we part company with a hearty Godspeed on either side But our signal lights are not far distant before a familiar sound comes back to us an indomitable Yankee cheer which scatters the gloom Our course is altered and we are steaming over the obliterated banks far in the interior Once or twice black objects loom up near us the wrecks of houses floating by There is a slight rift in the sky toward the north and a few bearing stars to guide us over the waste As we penetrate into shallower water it is deemed advisable to divide our party into smaller boats and diverge over the submerged prairie I borrow a peacoat of one of the crew and in that practical disguise am doubtfully permitted to pass into one of the boats We give way northerly It is quite dark yet although the rift of cloud has widened It must have been about three o clock and we were lying upon our oars in an eddy formed by a clump of cottonwood and the light of the steamer is a solitary bright star in the distance when the silence is broken by the bow oar Light ahead All eyes are turned in that direction In a few seconds a twinkling light appears shines steadily and again disappears as if by the shifting position of some black object apparently drifting close upon us Stern all a steamer Hold hard there Steamer be damned is the reply of the coxswain It s a house and a big one too It is a big one looming in the starlight like a huge fragment of the darkness The light comes from a single candle which shines through a window as the great shape swings by Some recollection is drifting back to me with it as I listen with beating heart There s someone in it by heavens Give way boys lay her alongside Handsomely now The door s fastened try the window no here s another In another moment we are trampling in the water which washes the floor to the depth of several inches It is a large room at the farther end of which an old man is sitting wrapped in a blanket holding a candle in one hand and apparently absorbed in the book he holds with the other I spring toward him with an exclamation Joseph Tryan He does not move We gather closer to him and I lay my hand gently on his shoulder and say Look up old man look up Your wife and children where are they The boys George Are they here are they safe He raises his head slowly and turns his eyes to mine and we involuntarily recoil before his look It is a calm and quiet glance free from fear anger or pain but it somehow sends the blood curdling through our veins He bowed his head over his book again taking no further notice of us The men look at me compassionately and hold their peace I make one more effort Joseph Tryan don t you know me the surveyor who surveyed your ranch the Espiritu Santo Look up old man He shuddered and wrapped himself closer in his blanket Presently he repeated to himself The surveyor who surveyed your ranch Espiritu Santo over and over again as though it were a lesson he was trying to fix in his memory I was turning sadly to the boatmen when he suddenly caught me fearfully by the hand and said Hush We were silent Listen He puts his arm around my neck and whispers in my ear I m a MOVING OFF Moving off Hush Don t speak so loud Moving off Ah wot s that Don t you hear there listen We listen and hear the water gurgle and click beneath the floor It s them wot he sent Old Altascar sent They ve been here all night I heard em first in the creek when they came to tell the old man to move farther off They came nearer and nearer They whispered under the door and I saw their eyes on the step their cruel hard eyes Ah why don t they quit I tell the men to search the room and see if they can find any further traces of the family while Tryan resumes his old attitude It is so much like the figure I remember on the breezy night that a superstitious feeling is fast overcoming me When they have returned I tell them briefly what I know of him and the old man murmurs again Why don t they quit then They have the stock all gone gone gone for the hides and hoofs and he groans bitterly There are other boats below us The shanty cannot have drifted far and perhaps the family are safe by this time says the coxswain hopefully We lift the old man up for he is quite helpless and carry him to the boat He is still grasping the Bible in his right hand though its strengthening grace is blank to his vacant eye and he cowers in the stern as we pull slowly to the steamer while a pale gleam in the sky shows the coming day I was weary with excitement and when we reached the steamer and I had seen Joseph Tryan comfortably bestowed I wrapped myself in a blanket near the boiler and presently fell asleep But even then the figure of the old man often started before me and a sense of uneasiness about George made a strong undercurrent to my drifting dreams I was awakened at about eight o clock in the morning by the engineer who told me one of the old man s sons had been picked up and was now on board Is it George Tryan I ask quickly Don t know but he s a sweet one whoever he is adds the engineer with a smile at some luscious remembrance You ll find him for ard I hurry to the bow of the boat and find not George but the irrepressible Wise sitting on a coil of rope a little dirtier and rather more dilapidated than I can remember having seen him He is examining with apparent admiration some rough dry clothes that have been put out for his disposal I cannot help thinking that circumstances have somewhat exalted his usual cheerfulness He puts me at my ease by at once addressing me These are high old times ain t they I say what do you reckon s become o them thar bound ry moniments you stuck Ah The pause which succeeds this outburst is the effect of a spasm of admiration at a pair of high boots which by great exertion he has at last pulled on his feet So you ve picked up the ole man in the shanty clean crazy He must have been soft to have stuck there instead o leavin with the old woman Didn t know me from Adam took me for George At this affecting instance of paternal forgetfulness Wise was evidently divided between amusement and chagrin I took advantage of the contending emotions to ask about George Don t know whar he is If he d tended stock instead of running about the prairie packin off wimmin and children he might have saved suthin He lost every hoof and hide I ll bet a cooky Say you to a passing boatman when are you goin to give us some grub I m hungry nough to skin and eat a hoss Reckon I ll turn butcher when things is dried up and save hides horns and taller I could not but admire this indomitable energy which under softer climatic influences might have borne such goodly fruit Have you any idea what you ll do Wise I ask Thar ain t much to do now says the practical young man I ll have to lay over a spell I reckon till things comes straight The land ain t worth much now and won t be I dessay for some time Wonder whar the ole man ll drive stakes next I meant as to your father and George Wise Oh the old man and I ll go on to Miles s whar Tom packed the old woman and babies last week George ll turn up somewhar atween this and Altascar s ef he ain t thar now I ask how the Altascars have suffered Well I reckon he ain t lost much in stock I shouldn t wonder if George helped him drive em up the foothills And his casa s built too high Oh thar ain t any water thar you bet Ah says Wise with reflective admiration those greasers ain t the darned fools people thinks em I ll bet thar ain t one swamped out in all er Californy But the appearance of grub cut this rhapsody short I shall keep on a little farther I say and try to find George Wise stared a moment at this eccentricity until a new light dawned upon him I don t think you ll save much What s the percentage workin on shares eh I answer that I am only curious which I feel lessens his opinion of me and with a sadder feeling than his assurance of George s safety might warrant I walked away From others whom we picked up from time to time we heard of George s self sacrificing devotion with the praises of the many he had helped and rescued But I did not feel disposed to return until I had seen him and soon prepared myself to take a boat to the lower VALDA of the foothills and visit Altascar I soon perfected my arrangements bade farewell to Wise and took a last look at the old man who was sitting by the furnace fires quite passive and composed Then our boat head swung round pulled by sturdy and willing hands It was again raining and a disagreeable wind had risen Our course lay nearly west and we soon knew by the strong current that we were in the creek of the Espiritu Santo From time to time the wrecks of barns were seen and we passed many half submerged willows hung with farming implements We emerge at last into a broad silent sea It is the LLANO DE ESPIRITU SANTO As the wind whistles by me piling the shallower fresh water into mimic waves I go back in fancy to the long ride of October over that boundless plain and recall the sharp outlines of the distant hills which are now lost in the lowering clouds The men are rowing silently and I find my mind released from its tension growing benumbed and depressed as then The water too is getting more shallow as we leave the banks of the creek and with my hand dipped listlessly over the thwarts I detect the tops of chimisal which shows the tide to have somewhat fallen There is a black mound bearing to the north of the line of alder making an adverse current which as we sweep to the right to avoid I recognize We pull close alongside and I call to the men to stop There was a stake driven near its summit with the initials L E S I Tied halfway down was a curiously worked riata It was George s It had been cut with some sharp instrument and the loose gravelly soil of the mound was deeply dented with horses hoofs The stake was covered with horsehairs It was a record but no clue The wind had grown more violent as we still fought our way forward resting and rowing by turns and oftener poling the shallower surface but the old VALDA or bench is still distant My recollection of the old survey enables me to guess the relative position of the meanderings of the creek and an occasional simple professional experiment to determine the distance gives my crew the fullest faith in my ability Night overtakes us in our impeded progress Our condition looks more dangerous than it really is but I urge the men many of whom are still new in this mode of navigation to greater exertion by assurance of perfect safety and speedy relief ahead We go on in this way until about eight o clock and ground by the willows We have a muddy walk for a few hundred yards before we strike a dry trail and simultaneously the white walls of Altascar s appear like a snowbank before us Lights are moving in the courtyard but otherwise the old tomblike repose characterizes the building One of the peons recognized me as I entered the court and Altascar met me on the corridor I was too weak to do more than beg his hospitality for the men who had dragged wearily with me He looked at my hand which still unconsciously held the broken riata I began wearily to tell him about George and my fears but with a gentler courtesy than was even his wont he gravely laid his hand on my shoulder POCO A POCO senor not now You are tired you have hunger you have cold Necessary it is you should have peace He took us into a small room and poured out some French cognac which he gave to the men that had accompanied me They drank and threw themselves before the fire in the larger room The repose of the building was intensified that night and I even fancied that the footsteps on the corridor were lighter and softer The old Spaniard s habitual gravity was deeper we might have been shut out from the world as well as the whistling storm behind those ancient walls with their time worn inheritor Before I could repeat my inquiry he retired In a few minutes two smoking dishes of CHUPA with coffee were placed before us and my men ate ravenously I drank the coffee but my excitement and weariness kept down the instincts of hunger I was sitting sadly by the fire when he reentered You have eat I said Yes to please him BUENO eat when you can food and appetite are not always He said this with that Sancho like simplicity with which most of his countrymen utter a proverb as though it were an experience rather than a legend and taking the riata from the floor held it almost tenderly before him It was made by me senor I kept it as a clue to him Don Altascar I said If I could find him He is here Here and but I could not say well I understood the gravity of the old man s face the hushed footfalls the tomblike repose of the building in an electric flash of consciousness I held the clue to the broken riata at last Altascar took my hand and we crossed the corridor to a somber apartment A few tall candles were burning in sconces before the window In an alcove there was a deep bed with its counterpane pillows and sheets heavily edged with lace in all that splendid luxury which the humblest of these strange people lavish upon this single item of their household I stepped beside it and saw George lying as I had seen him once before peacefully at rest But a greater sacrifice than that he had known was here and his generous heart was stilled forever He was honest and brave said the old man and turned away There was another figure in the room a heavy shawl drawn over her graceful outline and her long black hair hiding the hands that buried her downcast face I did not seem to notice her and retiring presently left the loving and loved together When we were again beside the crackling fire in the shifting shadows of the great chamber Altascar told me how he had that morning met the horse of George Tryan swimming on the prairie how that farther on he found him lying quite cold and dead with no marks or bruises on his person that he had probably become exhausted in fording the creek and that he had as probably reached the mound only to die for want of that help he had so freely given to others that as a last act he had freed his horse These incidents were corroborated by many who collected in the great chamber that evening women and children most of them succored through the devoted energies of him who lay cold and lifeless above He was buried in the Indian mound the single spot of strange perennial greenness which the poor aborigines had raised above the dusty plain A little slab of sandstone with the initials G T is his monument and one of the bearings of the initial corner of the new survey of the Espiritu Santo Rancho AN EPISODE OF FIDDLETOWN In eighteen fifty eight Fiddletown considered her a very pretty woman She had a quantity of light chestnut hair a good figure a dazzling complexion and a certain languid grace which passed easily for gentle womanliness She always dressed becomingly and in what Fiddletown accepted as the latest fashion She had only two blemishes one of her velvety eyes when examined closely had a slight cast and her left cheek bore a small scar left by a single drop of vitriol happily the only drop of an entire phial thrown upon her by one of her own jealous sex that reached the pretty face it was intended to mar But when the observer had studied the eyes sufficiently to notice this defect he was generally incapacitated for criticism and even the scar on her cheek was thought by some to add piquancy to her smile The youthful editor of THE FIDDLETOWN AVALANCHE had said privately that it was an exaggerated dimple Colonel Starbottle was instantly reminded of the beautifying patches of the days of Queen Anne but more particularly sir of the blankest beautiful women that blank you you ever laid your two blank eyes upon a Creole woman sir in New Orleans And this woman had a scar a line extending blank me from her eye to her blank chin And this woman sir thrilled you sir maddened you sir absolutely sent your blank soul to perdition with her blank fascination And one day I said to her Celeste how in blank did you come by that beautiful scar blank you And she said to me Star there isn t another white man that I d confide in but you but I made that scar myself purposely I did blank me These were her very words sir and perhaps you think it a blank lie sir but I ll put up any blank sum you can name and prove it blank me Indeed most of the male population of Fiddletown were or had been in love with her Of this number about one half believed that their love was returned with the exception possibly of her own husband He alone had been known to express skepticism The name of the gentleman who enjoyed this infelicitous distinction was Tretherick He had been divorced from an excellent wife to marry this Fiddletown enchantress She also had been divorced but it was hinted that some previous experiences of hers in that legal formality had made it perhaps less novel and probably less sacrificial I would not have it inferred from this that she was deficient in sentiment or devoid of its highest moral expression Her intimate friend had written on the occasion of her second divorce The cold world does not understand Clara yet and Colonel Starbottle had remarked blankly that with the exception of a single woman in Opelousas Parish La she had more soul than the whole caboodle of them put together Few indeed could read those lines entitled Infelissimus commencing Why waves no cypress o er this brow originally published in the AVALANCHE over the signature of The Lady Clare without feeling the tear of sensibility tremble on his eyelids or the glow of virtuous indignation mantle his cheek at the low brutality and pitiable jocularity of THE DUTCH FLAT INTELLIGENCER which the next week had suggested the exotic character of the cypress and its entire absence from Fiddletown as a reasonable answer to the query Indeed it was this tendency to elaborate her feelings in a metrical manner and deliver them to the cold world through the medium of the newspapers that first attracted the attention of Tretherick Several poems descriptive of the effects of California scenery upon a too sensitive soul and of the vague yearnings for the infinite which an enforced study of the heartlessness of California society produced in the poetic breast impressed mister Tretherick who was then driving a six mule freight wagon between Knight s Ferry and Stockton to seek out the unknown poetess mister Tretherick was himself dimly conscious of a certain hidden sentiment in his own nature and it is possible that some reflections on the vanity of his pursuit he supplied several mining camps with whisky and tobacco in conjunction with the dreariness of the dusty plain on which he habitually drove may have touched some chord in sympathy with this sensitive woman Howbeit after a brief courtship as brief as was consistent with some previous legal formalities they were married and mister Tretherick brought his blushing bride to Fiddletown or Fideletown as missus Tretherick preferred to call it in her poems The union was not a felicitous one It was not long before mister Tretherick discovered that the sentiment he had fostered while freighting between Stockton and Knight s Ferry was different from that which his wife had evolved from the contemplation of California scenery and her own soul Being a man of imperfect logic this caused him to beat her and she being equally faulty in deduction was impelled to a certain degree of unfaithfulness on the same premise Then mister Tretherick began to drink and missus Tretherick to contribute regularly to the columns of the AVALANCHE It was at this time that Colonel Starbottle discovered a similarity in missus Tretherick s verse to the genius of Sappho and pointed it out to the citizens of Fiddletown in a two columned criticism signed A S also published in the AVALANCHE and supported by extensive quotation As the AVALANCHE did not possess a font of Greek type the editor was obliged to reproduce the Leucadian numbers in the ordinary Roman letter to the intense disgust of Colonel Starbottle and the vast delight of Fiddletown who saw fit to accept the text as an excellent imitation of Choctaw a language with which the colonel as a whilom resident of the Indian Territories was supposed to be familiar Indeed the next week s INTELLIGENCER contained some vile doggerel supposed to be an answer to missus Tretherick s poem ostensibly written by the wife of a Digger Indian chief accompanied by a glowing eulogium signed A S S The result of this jocularity was briefly given in a later copy of the AVALANCHE An unfortunate rencounter took place on Monday last between the honorable Jackson Flash of THE DUTCH FLAT INTELLIGENCER and the well known colonel Starbottle of this place in front of the Eureka Saloon Two shots were fired by the parties without injury to either although it is said that a passing Chinaman received fifteen buckshot in the calves of his legs from the colonel s double barreled shotgun which were not intended for him John will learn to keep out of the way of Melican man s firearms hereafter The cause of the affray is not known although it is hinted that there is a lady in the case The rumor that points to a well known and beautiful poetess whose lucubrations have often graced our columns seems to gain credence from those that are posted Meanwhile the passiveness displayed by Tretherick under these trying circumstances was fully appreciated in the gulches The old man s head is level said one long booted philosopher Ef the colonel kills Flash missus Tretherick is avenged if Flash drops the colonel Tretherick is all right Either way he s got a sure thing During this delicate condition of affairs missus Tretherick one day left her husband s home and took refuge at the Fiddletown Hotel with only the clothes she had on her back Here she staid for several weeks during which period it is only justice to say that she bore herself with the strictest propriety It was a clear morning in early spring that missus Tretherick unattended left the hotel and walked down the narrow street toward the fringe of dark pines which indicated the extreme limits of Fiddletown The few loungers at that early hour were preoccupied with the departure of the Wingdown coach at the other extremity of the street and missus Tretherick reached the suburbs of the settlement without discomposing observation Here she took a cross street or road running at right angles with the main thoroughfare of Fiddletown and passing through a belt of woodland It was evidently the exclusive and aristocratic avenue of the town The dwellings were few ambitious and uninterrupted by shops And here she was joined by Colonel Starbottle The gallant colonel notwithstanding that he bore the swelling port which usually distinguished him that his coat was tightly buttoned and his boots tightly fitting and that his cane hooked over his arm swung jauntily was not entirely at his ease missus Tretherick however vouchsafed him a gracious smile and a glance of her dangerous eyes and the colonel with an embarrassed cough and a slight strut took his place at her side The coast is clear said the colonel and Tretherick is over at Dutch Flat on a spree There is no one in the house but a Chinaman and you need fear no trouble from him I he continued with a slight inflation of the chest that imperiled the security of his button I will see that you are protected in the removal of your property I m sure it s very kind of you and so disinterested simpered the lady as they walked along It s so pleasant to meet someone who has soul someone to sympathize with in a community so hardened and heartless as this And missus Tretherick cast down her eyes but not until they wrought their perfect and accepted work upon her companion Yes certainly of course said the colonel glancing nervously up and down the street yes certainly Perceiving however that there was no one in sight or hearing he proceeded at once to inform missus Tretherick that the great trouble of his life in fact had been the possession of too much soul That many women as a gentleman she would excuse him of course from mentioning names but many beautiful women had often sought his society but being deficient madam absolutely deficient in this quality he could not reciprocate But when two natures thoroughly in sympathy despising alike the sordid trammels of a low and vulgar community and the conventional restraints of a hypocritical society when two souls in perfect accord met and mingled in poetical union then but here the colonel s speech which had been remarkable for a certain whisky and watery fluency grew husky almost inaudible and decidedly incoherent Possibly missus Tretherick may have heard something like it before and was enabled to fill the hiatus Nevertheless the cheek that was on the side of the colonel was quite virginal and bashfully conscious until they reached their destination It was a pretty little cottage quite fresh and warm with paint very pleasantly relieved against a platoon of pines some of whose foremost files had been displaced to give freedom to the fenced enclosure in which it sat In the vivid sunlight and perfect silence it had a new uninhabited look as if the carpenters and painters had just left it At the farther end of the lot a Chinaman was stolidly digging but there was no other sign of occupancy The coast as the colonel had said was indeed clear missus Tretherick paused at the gate The colonel would have entered with her but was stopped by a gesture Come for me in a couple of hours and I shall have everything packed she said as she smiled and extended her hand The colonel seized and pressed it with great fervor Perhaps the pressure was slightly returned for the gallant colonel was impelled to inflate his chest and trip away as smartly as his stubby toed high heeled boots would permit When he had gone missus Tretherick opened the door listened a moment in the deserted hall and then ran quickly upstairs to what had been her bedroom Everything there was unchanged as on the night she left it On the dressing table stood her bandbox as she remembered to have left it when she took out her bonnet On the mantle lay the other glove she had forgotten in her flight The two lower drawers of the bureau were half open she had forgotten to shut them and on its marble top lay her shawl pin and a soiled cuff What other recollections came upon her I know not but she suddenly grew quite white shivered and listened with a beating heart and her hand upon the door Then she stepped to the mirror and half fearfully half curiously parted with her fingers the braids of her blond hair above her little pink ear until she came upon an ugly half healed scar She gazed at this moving her pretty head up and down to get a better light upon it until the slight cast in her velvety eyes became very strongly marked indeed Then she turned away with a light reckless foolish laugh and ran to the closet where hung her precious dresses These she inspected nervously and missing suddenly a favorite black silk from its accustomed peg for a moment thought she should have fainted But discovering it the next instant lying upon a trunk where she had thrown it a feeling of thankfulness to a superior Being who protects the friendless for the first time sincerely thrilled her Then albeit she was hurried for time she could not resist trying the effect of a certain lavender neck ribbon upon the dress she was then wearing before the mirror And then suddenly she became aware of a child s voice close beside her and she stopped And then the child s voice repeated Is it Mamma missus Tretherick faced quickly about Standing in the doorway was a little girl of six or seven Her dress had been originally fine but was torn and dirty and her hair which was a very violent red was tumbled seriocomically about her forehead For all this she was a picturesque little thing even through whose childish timidity there was a certain self sustained air which is apt to come upon children who are left much to themselves She was holding under her arm a rag doll apparently of her own workmanship and nearly as large as herself a doll with a cylindrical head and features roughly indicated with charcoal A long shawl evidently belonging to a grown person dropped from her shoulders and swept the floor The spectacle did not excite missus Tretherick s delight Perhaps she had but a small sense of humor Certainly when the child still standing in the doorway again asked Is it Mamma she answered sharply No it isn t and turned a severe look upon the intruder The child retreated a step and then gaining courage with the distance said in deliciously imperfect speech Dow way then why don t you dow away But missus Tretherick was eying the shawl Suddenly she whipped it off the child s shoulders and said angrily How dared you take my things you bad child Is it yours Then you are my mamma ain t you You are Mamma she continued gleefully and before missus Tretherick could avoid her she had dropped her doll and catching the woman s skirts with both hands was dancing up and down before her What s your name child said missus Tretherick coldly removing the small and not very white hands from her garments Tarry Tarry Yeth Tarry Tarowline Caroline Yeth Tarowline Tretherick Whose child ARE you demanded missus Tretherick still more coldly to keep down a rising fear Why yours said the little creature with a laugh I m your little durl You re my mamma my new mamma Don t you know my ol mamma s dorn away never to turn back any more I don t live wid my ol mamma now I live wid you and Papa How long have you been here asked missus Tretherick snappishly I fink it s free days said Carry reflectively You think Don t you know sneered missus Tretherick Then where did you come from Carry s lip began to work under this sharp cross examination With a great effort and a small gulp she got the better of it and answered Papa Papa fetched me from Miss Simmons from Sacramento last week Last week You said three days just now returned missus Tretherick with severe deliberation I mean a monf said Carry now utterly adrift in sheer helplessness and confusion Do you know what you are talking about demanded missus Tretherick shrilly restraining an impulse to shake the little figure before her and precipitate the truth by specific gravity But the flaming red head here suddenly disappeared in the folds of missus Tretherick s dress as if it were trying to extinguish itself forever There now stop that sniffling said missus Tretherick extricating her dress from the moist embraces of the child and feeling exceedingly uncomfortable Wipe your face now and run away and don t bother Stop she continued as Carry moved away Where s your papa He s dorn away too He s sick He s been dorn she hesitated two free days Who takes care of you child said missus Tretherick eying her curiously John the Chinaman I tresses myselth John tooks and makes the beds Well now run away and behave yourself and don t bother me any more said missus Tretherick remembering the object of her visit Stop where are you going she added as the child began to ascend the stairs dragging the long doll after her by one helpless leg Doin upstairs to play and be dood and no bother Mamma I ain t your mamma shouted missus Tretherick and then she swiftly re entered her bedroom and slammed the door Once inside she drew forth a large trunk from the closet and set to work with querulous and fretful haste to pack her wardrobe She tore her best dress in taking it from the hook on which it hung she scratched her soft hands twice with an ambushed pin All the while she kept up an indignant commentary on the events of the past few moments She said to herself she saw it all Tretherick had sent for this child of his first wife this child of whose existence he had never seemed to care just to insult her to fill her place Doubtless the first wife herself would follow soon or perhaps there would be a third Red hair not auburn but RED of course the child this Caroline looked like its mother and if so she was anything but pretty Or the whole thing had been prepared this red haired child the image of its mother had been kept at a convenient distance at Sacramento ready to be sent for when needed She remembered his occasional visits there on business as he said Perhaps the mother already was there but no she had gone East Nevertheless missus Tretherick in her then state of mind preferred to dwell upon the fact that she might be there She was dimly conscious also of a certain satisfaction in exaggerating her feelings Surely no woman had ever been so shamefully abused In fancy she sketched a picture of herself sitting alone and deserted at sunset among the fallen columns of a ruined temple in a melancholy yet graceful attitude while her husband drove rapidly away in a luxurious coach and four with a red haired woman at his side Sitting upon the trunk she had just packed she partly composed a lugubrious poem describing her sufferings as wandering alone and poorly clad she came upon her husband and another flaunting in silks and diamonds She pictured herself dying of consumption brought on by sorrow a beautiful wreck yet still fascinating gazed upon adoringly by the editor of the AVALANCHE and Colonel Starbottle And where was Colonel Starbottle all this while Why didn t he come He at least understood her He she laughed the reckless light laugh of a few moments before and then her face suddenly grew grave as it had not a few moments before What was that little red haired imp doing all this time Why was she so quiet She opened the door noiselessly and listened She fancied that she heard above the multitudinous small noises and creakings and warpings of the vacant house a smaller voice singing on the floor above This as she remembered was only an open attic that had been used as a storeroom With a half guilty consciousness she crept softly upstairs and pushing the door partly open looked within Athwart the long low studded attic a slant sunbeam from a single small window lay filled with dancing motes and only half illuminating the barren dreary apartment In the ray of this sunbeam she saw the child s glowing hair as if crowned by a red aureole as she sat upon the floor with her exaggerated doll between her knees She appeared to be talking to it and it was not long before missus Tretherick observed that she was rehearsing the interview of a half hour before She catechized the doll severely cross examining it in regard to the duration of its stay there and generally on the measure of time The imitation of missus Tretherick s manner was exceedingly successful and the conversation almost a literal reproduction with a single exception After she had informed the doll that she was not her mother at the close of the interview she added pathetically that if she was dood very dood she might be her mamma and love her very much I have already hinted that missus Tretherick was deficient in a sense of humor Perhaps it was for this reason that this whole scene affected her most unpleasantly and the conclusion sent the blood tingling to her cheek There was something too inconceivably lonely in the situation The unfurnished vacant room the half lights the monstrous doll whose very size seemed to give a pathetic significance to its speechlessness the smallness of the one animate self centered figure all these touched more or less deeply the half poetic sensibilities of the woman She could not help utilizing the impression as she stood there and thought what a fine poem might be constructed from this material if the room were a little darker the child lonelier say sitting beside a dead mother s bier and the wind wailing in the turrets And then she suddenly heard footsteps at the door below and recognized the tread of the colonel s cane She flew swiftly down the stairs and encountered the colonel in the hall Here she poured into his astonished ear a voluble and exaggerated statement of her discovery and indignant recital of her wrongs Don t tell me the whole thing wasn t arranged beforehand for I know it was she almost screamed And think she added of the heartlessness of the wretch leaving his own child alone here in that way It s a blank shame stammered the colonel without the least idea of what he was talking about In fact utterly unable as he was to comprehend a reason for the woman s excitement with his estimate of her character I fear he showed it more plainly than he intended He stammered expanded his chest looked stern gallant tender but all unintelligently missus Tretherick for an instant experienced a sickening doubt of the existence of natures in perfect affinity It s of no use said missus Tretherick with sudden vehemence in answer to some inaudible remark of the colonel s and withdrawing her hand from the fervent grasp of that ardent and sympathetic man It s of no use my mind is made up You can send for my trunk as soon as you like but I shall stay here and confront that man with the proof of his vileness I will put him face to face with his infamy I do not know whether Colonel Starbottle thoroughly appreciated the convincing proof of Tretherick s unfaithfulness and malignity afforded by the damning evidence of the existence of Tretherick s own child in his own house He was dimly aware however of some unforeseen obstacle to the perfect expression of the infinite longing of his own sentimental nature But before he could say anything Carry appeared on the landing above them looking timidly and yet half critically at the pair That s her said missus Tretherick excitedly In her deepest emotions in either verse or prose she rose above a consideration of grammatical construction Ah said the colonel with a sudden assumption of parental affection and jocularity that was glaringly unreal and affected Ah pretty little girl pretty little girl How do you do How are you You find yourself pretty well do you pretty little girl The colonel s impulse also was to expand his chest and swing his cane until it occurred to him that this action might be ineffective with a child of six or seven Carry however took no immediate notice of this advance but further discomposed the chivalrous colonel by running quickly to missus Tretherick and hiding herself as if for protection in the folds of her gown Nevertheless the colonel was not vanquished Falling back into an attitude of respectful admiration he pointed out a marvelous resemblance to the Madonna and Child missus Tretherick simpered but did not dislodge Carry as before There was an awkward pause for a moment and then missus Tretherick motioning significantly to the child said in a whisper Go now Don t come here again but meet me tonight at the hotel She extended her hand the colonel bent over it gallantly and raising his hat the next moment was gone Do you think said missus Tretherick with an embarrassed voice and a prodigious blush looking down and addressing the fiery curls just visible in the folds of her dress do you think you will be dood if I let you stay in here and sit with me And let me tall you Mamma queried Carry looking up And let you call me Mamma assented missus Tretherick with an embarrassed laugh Yeth said Carry promptly They entered the bedroom together Carry s eye instantly caught sight of the trunk Are you dowin away adain Mamma she said with a quick nervous look and a clutch at the woman s dress No o said missus Tretherick looking out of the window Only playing your dowin away suggested Carry with a laugh Let me play too missus Tretherick assented Carry flew into the next room and presently reappeared dragging a small trunk into which she gravely proceeded to pack her clothes missus Tretherick noticed that they were not many A question or two regarding them brought out some further replies from the child and before many minutes had elapsed missus Tretherick was in possession of all her earlier history But to do this missus Tretherick had been obliged to take Carry upon her lap pending the most confidential disclosures They sat thus a long time after missus Tretherick had apparently ceased to be interested in Carry s disclosures and when lost in thought she allowed the child to rattle on unheeded and ran her fingers through the scarlet curls You don t hold me right Mamma said Carry at last after one or two uneasy shiftings of position How should I hold you asked missus Tretherick with a half amused half embarrassed laugh Dis way said Carry curling up into position with one arm around missus Tretherick s neck and her cheek resting on her bosom dis way dere After a little preparatory nestling not unlike some small animal she closed her eyes and went to sleep For a few moments the woman sat silent scarcely daring to breathe in that artificial attitude And then whether from some occult sympathy in the touch or God best knows what a sudden fancy began to thrill her She began by remembering an old pain that she had forgotten an old horror that she had resolutely put away all these years She recalled days of sickness and distrust days of an overshadowing fear days of preparation for something that was to be prevented that WAS prevented with mortal agony and fear She thought of a life that might have been she dared not say HAD been and wondered It was six years ago if it had lived it would have been as old as Carry The arms which were folded loosely around the sleeping child began to tremble and tighten their clasp And then the deep potential impulse came and with a half sob half sigh she threw her arms out and drew the body of the sleeping child down down into her breast down again and again as if she would hide it in the grave dug there years before And the gust that shook her passed and then ah me the rain A drop or two fell upon the curls of Carry and she moved uneasily in her sleep But the woman soothed her again it was SO easy to do it now and they sat there quiet and undisturbed so quiet that they might have seemed incorporate of the lonely silent house the slowly declining sunbeams and the general air of desertion and abandonment yet a desertion that had in it nothing of age decay or despair Colonel Starbottle waited at the Fiddletown Hotel all that night in vain And the next morning when mister Tretherick returned to his husks he found the house vacant and untenanted except by motes and sunbeams When it was fairly known that missus Tretherick had run away taking mister Tretherick s own child with her there was some excitement and much diversity of opinion in Fiddletown THE DUTCH FLAT INTELLIGENCER openly alluded to the forcible abduction of the child with the same freedom and it is to be feared the same prejudice with which it had criticized the abductor s poetry All of missus Tretherick s own sex and perhaps a few of the opposite sex whose distinctive quality was not however very strongly indicated fully coincided in the views of the INTELLIGENCER The majority however evaded the moral issue that missus Tretherick had shaken the red dust of Fiddletown from her dainty slippers was enough for them to know They mourned the loss of the fair abductor more than her offense They promptly rejected Tretherick as an injured husband and disconsolate father and even went so far as to openly cast discredit on the sincerity of his grief They reserved an ironical condolence for Colonel Starbottle overbearing that excellent man with untimely and demonstrative sympathy in barrooms saloons and other localities not generally deemed favorable to the display of sentiment She was alliz a skittish thing Kernel said one sympathizer with a fine affectation of gloomy concern and great readiness of illustration and it s kinder nat ril thet she d get away someday and stampede that theer colt but thet she should shake YOU Kernel diet she should jist shake you is what gits me And they do say thet you jist hung around thet hotel all night and payrolled them corriders and histed yourself up and down them stairs and meandered in and out o thet piazzy and all for nothing It was another generous and tenderly commiserating spirit that poured additional oil and wine on the colonel s wounds The boys yer let on thet missus Tretherick prevailed on ye to pack her trunk and a baby over from the house to the stage offis and that the chap ez did go off with her thanked you and offered you two short bits and sed ez how he liked your looks and ud employ you agin and now you say it ain t so Well I ll tell the boys it ain t so and I m glad I met you for stories DO get round Happily for missus Tretherick s reputation however the Chinaman in Tretherick s employment who was the only eyewitness of her flight stated that she was unaccompanied except by the child He further deposed that obeying her orders he had stopped the Sacramento coach and secured a passage for herself and child to San Francisco It was true that Ah Fe s testimony was of no legal value But nobody doubted it Even those who were skeptical of the pagan s ability to recognize the sacredness of the truth admitted his passionless unprejudiced unconcern But it would appear from a hitherto unrecorded passage of this veracious chronicle that herein they were mistaken It was about six months after the disappearance of missus Tretherick that Ah Fe while working in Tretherick s lot was hailed by two passing Chinamen They were the ordinary mining coolies equipped with long poles and baskets for their usual pilgrimages An animated conversation at once ensued between Ah Fe and his brother Mongolians a conversation characterized by that usual shrill volubility and apparent animosity which was at once the delight and scorn of the intelligent Caucasian who did not understand a word of it Such at least was the feeling with which mister Tretherick on his veranda and Colonel Starbottle who was passing regarded their heathenish jargon The gallant colonel simply kicked them out of his way the irate Tretherick with an oath threw a stone at the group and dispersed them but not before one or two slips of yellow rice paper marked with hieroglyphics were exchanged and a small parcel put into Ah Fe s hands When Ah Fe opened this in the dim solitude of his kitchen he found a little girl s apron freshly washed ironed and folded On the corner of the hem were the initials C T Ah Fe tucked it away in a corner of his blouse and proceeded to wash his dishes in the sink with a smile of guileless satisfaction Two days after this Ah Fe confronted his master Me no likee Fiddletown Me belly sick Me go now mister Tretherick violently suggested a profane locality Ah Fe gazed at him placidly and withdrew Before leaving Fiddletown however he accidentally met Colonel Starbottle and dropped a few incoherent phrases which apparently interested that gentleman When he concluded the colonel handed him a letter and a twenty dollar gold piece If you bring me an answer I ll double that sabe John Ah Fe nodded An interview equally accidental with precisely the same result took place between Ah Fe and another gentleman whom I suspect to have been the youthful editor of the AVALANCHE Yet I regret to state that after proceeding some distance on his journey Ah Fe calmly broke the seals of both letters and after trying to read them upside down and sideways finally divided them into accurate squares and in this condition disposed of them to a brother Celestial whom he met on the road for a trifling gratuity The agony of Colonel Starbottle on finding his wash bill made out on the unwritten side of one of these squares and delivered to him with his weekly clean clothes and the subsequent discovery that the remaining portions of his letter were circulated by the same method from the Chinese laundry of one Fung Ti of Fiddletown has been described to me as peculiarly affecting Yet I am satisfied that a higher nature rising above the levity induced by the mere contemplation of the insignificant details of this breach of trust would find ample retributive justice in the difficulties that subsequently attended Ah Fe s pilgrimage On the road to Sacramento he was twice playfully thrown from the top of the stagecoach by an intelligent but deeply intoxicated Caucasian whose moral nature was shocked at riding with one addicted to opium smoking At Hangtown he was beaten by a passing stranger purely an act of Christian supererogation At Dutch Flat he was robbed by well known hands from unknown motives At Sacramento he was arrested on suspicion of being something or other and discharged with a severe reprimand possibly for not being it and so delaying the course of justice At San Francisco he was freely stoned by children of the public schools but by carefully avoiding these monuments of enlightened progress he at last reached in comparative safety the Chinese quarters where his abuse was confined to the police and limited by the strong arm of the law The next day he entered the washhouse of Chy Fook as an assistant and on the following Friday was sent with a basket of clean clothes to Chy Fook s several clients It was the usual foggy afternoon as he climbed the long windswept hill of California Street one of those bleak gray intervals that made the summer a misnomer to any but the liveliest San Franciscan fancy There was no warmth or color in earth or sky no light nor shade within or without only one monotonous universal neutral tint over everything There was a fierce unrest in the wind whipped streets there was a dreary vacant quiet in the gray houses When Ah Fe reached the top of the hill the Mission Ridge was already hidden and the chill sea breeze made him shiver As he put down his basket to rest himself it is possible that to his defective intelligence and heathen experience this God s own climate as was called seemed to possess but scant tenderness softness or mercy But it is possible that Ah Fe illogically confounded this season with his old persecutors the schoolchildren who being released from studious confinement at this hour were generally most aggressive So he hastened on and turning a corner at last stopped before a small house It was the usual San Franciscan urban cottage There was the little strip of cold green shrubbery before it the chilly bare veranda and above this again the grim balcony on which no one sat Ah Fe rang the bell A servant appeared glanced at his basket and reluctantly admitted him as if he were some necessary domestic animal Ah Fe silently mounted the stairs and entering the open door of the front chamber put down the basket and stood passively on the threshold A woman who was sitting in the cold gray light of the window with a child in her lap rose listlessly and came toward him Ah Fe instantly recognized missus Tretherick but not a muscle of his immobile face changed nor did his slant eyes lighten as he met her own placidly She evidently did not recognize him as she began to count the clothes But the child curiously examining him suddenly uttered a short glad cry Why it s John Mamma It s our old John what we had in Fiddletown For an instant Ah Fe s eyes and teeth electrically lightened The child clapped her hands and caught at his blouse Then he said shortly Me John Ah Fe allee same Me know you How do missus Tretherick dropped the clothes nervously and looked hard at Ah Fe Wanting the quick witted instinct of affection that sharpened Carry s perception she even then could not distinguish him above his fellows With a recollection of past pain and an obscure suspicion of impending danger she asked him when he had left Fiddletown Longee time No likee Fiddletown no likee Tlevelick Likee San Flisco Likee washee Likee Tally Ah Fe s laconics pleased missus Tretherick She did not stop to consider how much an imperfect knowledge of English added to his curt directness and sincerity But she said Don t tell anybody you have seen me and took out her pocketbook Ah Fe without looking at it saw that it was nearly empty Ah Fe without examining the apartment saw that it was scantily furnished Ah Fe without removing his eyes from blank vacancy saw that both missus Tretherick and Carry were poorly dressed Yet it is my duty to state that Ah Fe s long fingers closed promptly and firmly over the half dollar which missus Tretherick extended to him Then he began to fumble in his blouse with a series of extraordinary contortions After a few moments he extracted from apparently no particular place a child s apron which he laid upon the basket with the remark One piecee washman flagittee Then he began anew his fumblings and contortions At last his efforts were rewarded by his producing apparently from his right ear a many folded piece of tissue paper Unwrapping this carefully he at last disclosed two twenty dollar gold pieces which he handed to missus Tretherick You leavee money topside of blulow Fiddletown Me findee money Me fetchee money to you All lightee But I left no money on the top of the bureau John said missus Tretherick earnestly There must be some mistake It belongs to some other person Take it back John Ah Fe s brow darkened He drew away from missus Tretherick s extended hand and began hastily to gather up his basket Me no takee it back No no Bimeby pleesman he catchee me He say God damn thief catchee flowty dollar come to jailee Me no takee back You leavee money topside blulow Fiddletown Me fetchee money you Me no takee back missus Tretherick hesitated In the confusion of her flight she MIGHT have left the money in the manner he had said In any event she had no right to jeopardize this honest Chinaman s safety by refusing it So she said Very well John I will keep it But you must come again and see me here missus Tretherick hesitated with a new and sudden revelation of the fact that any man could wish to see any other than herself and and Carry Ah Fe s face lightened He even uttered a short ventriloquistic laugh without moving his mouth Then shouldering his basket he shut the door carefully and slid quietly down stairs In the lower hall he however found an unexpected difficulty in opening the front door and after fumbling vainly at the lock for a moment looked around for some help or instruction But the Irish handmaid who had let him in was contemptuously oblivious of his needs and did not appear There occurred a mysterious and painful incident which I shall simply record without attempting to explain On the hall table a scarf evidently the property of the servant before alluded to was lying As Ah Fe tried the lock with one hand the other rested lightly on the table Suddenly and apparently of its own volition the scarf began to creep slowly toward Ah Fe s hand from Ah Fe s hand it began to creep up his sleeve slowly and with an insinuating snakelike motion and then disappeared somewhere in the recesses of his blouse Without betraying the least interest or concern in this phenomenon Ah Fe still repeated his experiments upon the lock A moment later the tablecloth of red damask moved by apparently the same mysterious impulse slowly gathered itself under Ah Fe s fingers and sinuously disappeared by the same hidden channel What further mystery might have followed I cannot say for at this moment Ah Fe discovered the secret of the lock and was enabled to open the door coincident with the sound of footsteps upon the kitchen stairs Ah Fe did not hasten his movements but patiently shouldering his basket closed the door carefully behind him again and stepped forth into the thick encompassing fog that now shrouded earth and sky From her high casement window missus Tretherick watched Ah Fe s figure until it disappeared in the gray cloud In her present loneliness she felt a keen sense of gratitude toward him and may have ascribed to the higher emotions and the consciousness of a good deed that certain expansiveness of the chest and swelling of the bosom that was really due to the hidden presence of the scarf and tablecloth under his blouse For missus Tretherick was still poetically sensitive As the gray fog deepened into night she drew Carry closer toward her and above the prattle of the child pursued a vein of sentimental and egotistic recollection at once bitter and dangerous The sudden apparition of Ah Fe linked her again with her past life at Fiddletown Over the dreary interval between she was now wandering a journey so piteous willful thorny and useless that it was no wonder that at last Carry stopped suddenly in the midst of her voluble confidences to throw her small arms around the woman s neck and bid her not to cry Heaven forefend that I should use a pen that should be ever dedicated to an exposition of unalterable moral principle to transcribe missus Tretherick s own theory of this interval and episode with its feeble palliations its illogical deductions its fond excuses and weak apologies It would seem however that her experience had been hard Her slender stock of money was soon exhausted At Sacramento she found that the composition of verse although appealing to the highest emotions of the human heart and compelling the editorial breast to the noblest commendation in the editorial pages was singularly inadequate to defray the expenses of herself and Carry Then she tried the stage but failed signally Possibly her conception of the passions was different from that which obtained with a Sacramento audience but it was certain that her charming presence so effective at short range was not sufficiently pronounced for the footlights She had admirers enough in the greenroom but awakened no abiding affection among the audience In this strait it occurred to her that she had a voice a contralto of no very great compass or cultivation but singularly sweet and touching and she finally obtained position in a church choir She held it for three months greatly to her pecuniary advantage and it is said much to the satisfaction of the gentlemen in the back pews who faced toward her during the singing of the last hymn I remember her quite distinctly at this time The light that slanted through the oriel of saint Dives s choir was wont to fall very tenderly on her beautiful head with its stacked masses of deerskin colored hair on the low black arches of her brows and to deepen the pretty fringes that shaded her eyes of Genoa velvet Very pleasant it was to watch the opening and shutting of that small straight mouth with its quick revelation of little white teeth and to see the foolish blood faintly deepen her satin cheek as you watched For missus Tretherick was very sweetly conscious of admiration and like most pretty women gathered herself under your eye like a racer under the spur And then of course there came trouble I have it from the soprano a little lady who possessed even more than the usual unprejudiced judgment of her sex that missus Tretherick s conduct was simply shameful that her conceit was unbearable that if she considered the rest of the choir as slaves she the soprano would like to know it that her conduct on Easter Sunday with the basso had attracted the attention of the whole congregation and that she herself had noticed doctor Cope twice look up during the service that her the soprano s friends had objected to her singing in the choir with a person who had been on the stage but she had waived this Yet she had it from the best authority that missus Tretherick had run away from her husband and that this red haired child who sometimes came in the choir was not her own The tenor confided to me behind the organ that missus Tretherick had a way of sustaining a note at the end of a line in order that her voice might linger longer with the congregation an act that could be attributed only to a defective moral nature that as a man he was a very popular dry goods clerk on weekdays and sang a good deal from apparently behind his eyebrows on the Sabbath that as a man sir he would put up with it no longer The basso alone a short German with a heavy voice for which he seemed reluctantly responsible and rather grieved at its possession stood up for missus Tretherick and averred that they were jealous of her because she was bretty The climax was at last reached in an open quarrel wherein missus Tretherick used her tongue with such precision of statement and epithet that the soprano burst into hysterical tears and had to be supported from the choir by her husband and the tenor This act was marked intentionally to the congregation by the omission of the usual soprano solo missus Tretherick went home flushed with triumph but on reaching her room frantically told Carry that they were beggars henceforward that she her mother had just taken the very bread out of her darling s mouth and ended by bursting into a flood of penitent tears They did not come so quickly as in her old poetical days but when they came they stung deeply She was roused by a formal visit from a vestryman one of the music committee missus Tretherick dried her long lashes put on a new neck ribbon and went down to the parlor She staid there two hours a fact that might have occasioned some remark but that the vestryman was married and had a family of grownup daughters When missus Tretherick returned to her room she sang to herself in the glass and scolded Carry but she retained her place in the choir It was not long however In due course of time her enemies received a powerful addition to their forces in the committeeman s wife That lady called upon several of the church members and on doctor Cope s family The result was that at a later meeting of the music committee missus Tretherick s voice was declared inadequate to the size of the building and she was invited to resign She did so She had been out of a situation for two months and her scant means were almost exhausted when Ah Fe s unexpected treasure was tossed into her lap The gray fog deepened into night and the street lamps started into shivering life as absorbed in these unprofitable memories missus Tretherick still sat drearily at her window Even Carry had slipped away unnoticed and her abrupt entrance with the damp evening paper in her hand roused missus Tretherick and brought her back to an active realization of the present For missus Tretherick was wont to scan the advertisements in the faint hope of finding some avenue of employment she knew not what open to her needs and Carry had noted this habit missus Tretherick mechanically closed the shutters lit the lights and opened the paper Her eye fell instinctively on the following paragraph in the telegraphic column FIDDLETOWN seventh mister James Tretherick an old resident of this place died last night of delirium tremens mister Tretherick was addicted to intemperate habits said to have been induced by domestic trouble missus Tretherick did not start She quietly turned over another page of the paper and glanced at Carry The child was absorbed in a book missus Tretherick uttered no word but during the remainder of the evening was unusually silent and cold When Carry was undressed and in bed missus Tretherick suddenly dropped on her knees beside the bed and taking Carry s flaming head between her hands said Should you like to have another papa Carry darling No said Carry after a moment s thought But a papa to help Mamma take care of you to love you to give you nice clothes to make a lady of you when you grow up Carry turned her sleepy eyes toward the questioner Should YOU Mamma missus Tretherick suddenly flushed to the roots of her hair Go to sleep she said sharply and turned away But at midnight the child felt two white arms close tightly around her and was drawn down into a bosom that heaved fluttered and at last was broken up by sobs Don t ky Mamma whispered Carry with a vague retrospect of their recent conversation Don t ky I fink I SHOULD like a new papa if he loved you very much very very much A month afterward to everybody s astonishment missus Tretherick was married The happy bridegroom was one Colonel Starbottle recently elected to represent Calaveras County in the legislative councils of the State As I cannot record the event in finer language than that used by the correspondent of THE SACRAMENTO GLOBE I venture to quote some of his graceful periods The relentless shafts of the sly god have been lately busy among our gallant Solons We quote one more unfortunate The latest victim is the honorable C Starbottle of Calaveras The fair enchantress in the case is a beautiful widow a former votary of Thespis and lately a fascinating saint Cecilia of one of the most fashionable churches of San Francisco where she commanded a high salary THE DUTCH FLAT INTELLIGENCER saw fit however to comment upon the fact with that humorous freedom characteristic of an unfettered press The new Democratic war horse from Calaveras has lately advented in the legislature with a little bill to change the name of Tretherick to Starbottle They call it a marriage certificate down there mister Tretherick has been dead just one month but we presume the gallant colonel is not afraid of ghosts It is but just to missus Tretherick to state that the colonel s victory was by no means an easy one To a natural degree of coyness on the part of the lady was added the impediment of a rival a prosperous undertaker from Sacramento who had first seen and loved missus Tretherick at the theater and church his professional habits debarring him from ordinary social intercourse and indeed any other than the most formal public contact with the sex As this gentleman had made a snug fortune during the felicitous prevalence of a severe epidemic the colonel regarded him as a dangerous rival Fortunately however the undertaker was called in professionally to lay out a brother senator who had unhappily fallen by the colonel s pistol in an affair of honor and either deterred by physical consideration from rivalry or wisely concluding that the colonel was professionally valuable he withdrew from the field The honeymoon was brief and brought to a close by an untoward incident During their bridal trip Carry had been placed in the charge of Colonel Starbottle s sister On their return to the city immediately on reaching their lodgings missus Starbottle announced her intention of at once proceeding to missus Culpepper s to bring the child home Colonel Starbottle who had been exhibiting for some time a certain uneasiness which he had endeavored to overcome by repeated stimulation finally buttoned his coat tightly across his breast and after walking unsteadily once or twice up and down the room suddenly faced his wife with his most imposing manner I have deferred said the colonel with an exaggeration of port that increased with his inward fear and a growing thickness of speech I have

Musht be done by God m m musht do it now The chile is gone Gone echoed missus Starbottle There was something in the tone of her voice in the sudden drawing together of the pupils of her eyes that for a moment nearly sobered the colonel and partly collapsed his chest I ll splain all in a minit he said with a deprecating wave of the hand Everything shall be splained The the the melencholly event

Waffed by fav rin gales to suff rin p rent Thash so missus Starbottle did not move The colonel felt his chest slowly collapsing but steadied himself against a chair and endeavored to beam with chivalrous gallantry not unmixed with magisterial firmness upon her as she sat Your feelin s m m do honor to yer sex but conshider situashun Conshider m or s feelings conshider MY feelin s The colonel paused and flourishing a white handkerchief placed it negligently in his breast and then smiled tenderly above it as over laces and ruffles on the woman before him Why should dark shed der cass bligh on two sholes with single beat Chile s fine chile good chile but summonelse chile Chile s gone Clar but all ish n t gone Clar Conshider dearesht you all s have me missus Starbottle started to her feet YOU she cried bringing out a chest note that made the chandeliers ring You that I married to give my darling food and clothes YOU a dog that I whistled to my side to keep the men off me YOU She choked up and then dashed past him into the inner room which had been Carry s then she swept by him again into her own bedroom and then suddenly reappeared before him erect menacing with a burning fire over her cheekbones a quick straightening of her arched brows and mouth a squaring of jaw and ophidian flattening of the head Listen she said in a hoarse half grown boy s voice Hear me If you ever expect to set eyes on me again you must find the child If you ever expect to speak to me again to touch me you must bring her back For where she goes I go you hear me Where she has gone look for me She struck out past him again with a quick feminine throwing out of her arms from the elbows down as if freeing herself from some imaginary bonds and dashing into her chamber slammed and locked the door Colonel Starbottle although no coward stood in superstitious fear of an angry woman and recoiling as she swept by lost his unsteady foothold and rolled helplessly on the sofa Here after one or two unsuccessful attempts to regain his foothold he remained uttering from time to time profane but not entirely coherent or intelligible protests until at last he succumbed to the exhausting quality of his emotions and the narcotic quantity of his potations Meantime within missus Starbottle was excitedly gathering her valuables and packing her trunk even as she had done once before in the course of this remarkable history Perhaps some recollection of this was in her mind for she stopped to lean her burning cheeks upon her hand as if she saw again the figure of the child standing in the doorway and heard once more a childish voice asking Is it Mamma But the epithet now stung her to the quick and with a quick passionate gesture she dashed it away with a tear that had gathered in her eye And then it chanced that in turning over some clothes she came upon the child s slipper with a broken sandal string She uttered a great cry here the first she had uttered and caught it to her breast kissing it passionately again and again and rocking from side to side with a motion peculiar to her sex And then she took it to the window the better to see it through her now streaming eyes Here she was taken with a sudden fit of coughing that she could not stifle with the handkerchief she put to her feverish lips And then she suddenly grew very faint The window seemed to recede before her the floor to sink beneath her feet and staggering to the bed she fell prone upon it with the sandal and handkerchief pressed to her breast Her face was quite pale the orbit of her eyes dark and there was a spot upon her lip another on her handkerchief and still another on the white counterpane of the bed The wind had risen rattling the window sashes and swaying the white curtains in a ghostly way Later a gray fog stole softly over the roofs soothing the wind roughened surfaces and in wrapping all things in an uncertain light and a measureless peace She lay there very quiet for all her troubles still a very pretty bride And on the other side of the bolted door the gallant bridegroom from his temporary couch snored peacefully A week before Christmas Day eighteen seventy the little town of Genoa in the State of New York exhibited perhaps more strongly than at any other time the bitter irony of its founders and sponsors A driving snowstorm that had whitened every windward hedge bush wall and telegraph pole played around this soft Italian Capital whirled in and out of the great staring wooden Doric columns of its post office and hotel beat upon the cold green shutters of its best houses and powdered the angular stiff dark figures in its streets From the level of the street the four principal churches of the town stood out starkly even while their misshapen spires were kindly hidden in the low driving storm Near the railroad station the new Methodist chapel whose resemblance to an enormous locomotive was further heightened by the addition of a pyramidal row of front steps like a cowcatcher stood as if waiting for a few more houses to be hitched on to proceed to a pleasanter location But the pride of Genoa the great Crammer Institute for Young Ladies stretched its bare brick length and reared its cupola plainly from the bleak Parnassian hill above the principal avenue There was no evasion in the Crammer Institute of the fact that it was a public institution A visitor upon its doorsteps a pretty face at its window were clearly visible all over the township The shriek of the engine of the four o clock Northern express brought but few of the usual loungers to the depot Only a single passenger alighted and was driven away in the solitary waiting sleigh toward the Genoa Hotel And then the train sped away again with that passionless indifference to human sympathies or curiosity peculiar to express trains the one baggage truck was wheeled into the station again the station door was locked and the stationmaster went home The locomotive whistle however awakened the guilty consciousness of three young ladies of the Crammer Institute who were even then surreptitiously regaling themselves in the bakeshop and confectionery saloon of Mistress Phillips in a by lane For even the admirable regulations of the Institute failed to entirely develop the physical and moral natures of its pupils They conformed to the excellent dietary rules in public and in private drew upon the luxurious rations of their village caterer They attended church with exemplary formality and flirted informally during service with the village beaux They received the best and most judicious instruction during school hours and devoured the trashiest novels during recess The result of which was an aggregation of quite healthy quite human and very charming young creatures that reflected infinite credit on the Institute Even Mistress Phillips to whom they owed vast sums exhilarated by the exuberant spirits and youthful freshness of her guests declared that the sight of them young things did her good and had even been known to shield them by shameless equivocation Four o clock girls and if we re not back to prayers by five we ll be missed said the tallest of these foolish virgins with an aquiline nose and certain quiet elan that bespoke the leader as she rose from her seat Have you got the books Addy Addy displayed three dissipated looking novels under her waterproof And the provisions Carry Carry showed a suspicious parcel filling the pocket of her sack All right then Come girls trudge Charge it she added nodding to her host as they passed toward the door I ll pay you when my quarter s allowance comes No Kate interposed Carry producing her purse let me pay it s my turn Never said Kate arching her black brows loftily even if you do have rich relatives and regular remittances from California Never Come girls forward march As they opened the door a gust of wind nearly took them off their feet Kindhearted missus Phillips was alarmed Sakes alive galls ye mussn t go out in sich weather Better let me send word to the Institoot and make ye up a nice bed tonight in my parlor But the last sentence was lost in a chorus of half suppressed shrieks as the girls hand in hand ran down the steps into the storm and were at once whirled away The short December day unlit by any sunset glow was failing fast It was quite dark already and the air was thick with driving snow For some distance their high spirits youth and even inexperience kept them bravely up but in ambitiously attempting a short cut from the highroad across an open field their strength gave out the laugh grew less frequent and tears began to stand in Carry s brown eyes When they reached the road again they were utterly exhausted Let us go back said Carry We d never get across that field again said Addy Let s stop at the first house then said Carry The first house said Addy peering through the gathering darkness is Squire Robinson s She darted a mischievous glance at Carry that even in her discomfort and fear brought the quick blood to her cheek Oh yes said Kate with gloomy irony certainly stop at the squire s by all means and be invited to tea and be driven home after by your dear friend mister Harry with a formal apology from missus Robinson and hopes that the young ladies may be excused this time No continued Kate with sudden energy That may suit YOU but I m going back as I came by the window or not at all Then she pounced suddenly like a hawk on Carry who was betraying a tendency to sit down on a snowbank and whimper and shook her briskly You ll be going to sleep next Stay hold your tongues all of you what s that It was the sound of sleigh bells Coming down toward them out of the darkness was a sleigh with a single occupant Hold down your heads girls if it s anybody that knows us we re lost But it was not for a voice strange to their ears but withal very kindly and pleasant asked if its owner could be of any help to them As they turned toward him they saw it was a man wrapped in a handsome sealskin cloak wearing a sealskin cap his face half concealed by a muffler of the same material disclosing only a pair of long mustaches and two keen dark eyes It s a son of old Santa Claus whispered Addy The girls tittered audibly as they tumbled into the sleigh they had regained their former spirits Where shall I take you said the stranger quietly There was a hurried whispering and then Kate said boldly To the Institute They drove silently up the hill until the long ascetic building loomed up before them The stranger reined up suddenly You know the way better than I he said Where do you go in Through the back window said Kate with sudden and appalling frankness I see responded their strange driver quietly and alighting quickly removed the bells from the horses We can drive as near as you please now he added by way of explanation He certainly is a son of Santa Claus whispered Addy Hadn t we better ask after his father Hush said Kate decidedly He is an angel I dare say She added with a delicious irrelevance which was however perfectly understood by her feminine auditors We are looking like three frights Cautiously skirting the fences they at last pulled up a few feet from a dark wall The stranger proceeded to assist them to alight There was still some light from the reflected snow and as he handed his fair companions to the ground each was conscious of undergoing an intense though respectful scrutiny He assisted them gravely to open the window and then discreetly retired to the sleigh until the difficult and somewhat discomposing ingress was made He then walked to the window Thank you and good night whispered three voices A single figure still lingered The stranger leaned over the window sill Will you permit me to light my cigar here It might attract attention if I struck a match outside By the upspringing light he saw the figure of Kate very charmingly framed in by the window The match burnt slowly out in his fingers Kate smiled mischievously The astute young woman had detected the pitiable subterfuge For what else did she stand at the head of her class and had doting parents paid three years tuition The storm had passed and the sun was shining quite cheerily in the eastern recitation room the next morning when Miss Kate whose seat was nearest the window placing her hand pathetically upon her heart affected to fall in bashful and extreme agitation upon the shoulder of Carry her neighbor HE has come she gasped in a thrilling whisper Who asked Carry sympathetically who never clearly understood when Kate was in earnest Who Why the man who rescued us last night I saw him drive to the door this moment Don t speak I shall be better in a moment there she said and the shameless hypocrite passed her hand pathetically across her forehead with a tragic air What can he want asked Carry whose curiosity was excited I don t know said Kate suddenly relapsing into gloomy cynicism Possibly to put his five daughters to school perhaps to finish his young wife and warn her against us He didn t look old and he didn t seem like a married man rejoined Addy thoughtfully That was his art you poor creature returned Kate scornfully You can never tell anything of these men they are so deceitful Besides it s just my fate Why Kate began Carry in serious concern Hush Miss Walker is saying something said Kate laughing The young ladies will please give attention said a slow perfunctory voice Miss Carry Tretherick is wanted in the parlor Meantime mister Jack Prince the name given on the card and various letters and credentials submitted to the reverend mister Crammer paced the somewhat severe apartment known publicly as the reception parlor and privately to the pupils as purgatory His keen eyes had taken in the various rigid details from the flat steam radiator like an enormous japanned soda cracker that heated one end of the room to the monumental bust of doctor Crammer that hopelessly chilled the other from the Lord s Prayer executed by a former writing master in such gratuitous variety of elegant calligraphic trifling as to abate considerably the serious value of the composition to three views of Genoa from the Institute which nobody ever recognized taken on the spot by the drawing teacher from two illuminated texts of Scripture in an English letter so gratuitously and hideously remote as to chill all human interest to a large photograph of the senior class in which the prettiest girls were Ethiopian in complexion and sat apparently on each other s heads and shoulders His fingers had turned listlessly the leaves of school catalogues the SERMONS of doctor Crammer the POEMS of Henry Kirke White the LAYS OF THE SANCTUARY and LIVES OF CELEBRATED WOMEN His fancy and it was a nervously active one had gone over the partings and greetings that must have taken place here and wondered why the apartment had yet caught so little of the flavor of humanity indeed I am afraid he had almost forgotten the object of his visit when the door opened and Carry Tretherick stood before him It was one of those faces he had seen the night before prettier even than it had seemed then and yet I think he was conscious of some disappointment without knowing exactly why Her abundant waving hair was of a guinea golden tint her complexion of a peculiar flowerlike delicacy her brown eyes of the color of seaweed in deep water It certainly was not her beauty that disappointed him Without possessing his sensitiveness to impression Carry was on her part quite as vaguely ill at ease She saw before her one of those men whom the sex would vaguely generalize as nice that is to say correct in all the superficial appointments of style dress manners and feature Yet there was a decidedly unconventional quality about him he was totally unlike anything or anybody that she could remember and as the attributes of originality are often as apt to alarm as to attract people she was not entirely prepossessed in his favor I can hardly hope he began pleasantly that you remember me It is eleven years ago and you were a very little girl I am afraid I cannot even claim to have enjoyed that familiarity that might exist between a child of six and a young man of twenty one I don t think I was fond of children But I knew your mother very well I was editor of the AVALANCHE in Fiddletown when she took you to San Francisco You mean my stepmother she wasn t my mother you know interposed Carry hastily mister Prince looked at her curiously I mean your stepmother he said gravely I never had the pleasure of meeting your mother No MOTHER hasn t been in California these twelve years There was an intentional emphasizing of the title and of its distinction that began to interest coldly Prince after his first astonishment was past As I come from your stepmother now he went on with a slight laugh I must ask you to go back for a few moments to that point After your father s death your mother I mean your stepmother recognized the fact that your mother the first missus Tretherick was legally and morally your guardian and although much against her inclination and affections placed you again in her charge My stepmother married again within a month after father died and sent me home said Carry with great directness and the faintest toss of her head mister Prince smiled so sweetly and apparently so sympathetically that Carry began to like him With no other notice of the interruption he went on After your stepmother had performed this act of simple justice she entered into an agreement with your mother to defray the expenses of your education until your eighteenth year when you were to elect and choose which of the two should thereafter be your guardian and with whom you would make your home This agreement I think you are already aware of and I believe knew at the time I was a mere child then said Carry Certainly said mister Prince with the same smile Still the conditions I think have never been oppressive to you nor your mother and the only time they are likely to give you the least uneasiness will be when you come to make up your mind in the choice of your guardian That will be on your eighteenth birthday the twentieth I think of the present month Carry was silent Pray do not think that I am here to receive your decision even if it be already made I only came to inform you that your stepmother missus Starbottle will be in town tomorrow and will pass a few days at the hotel If it is your wish to see her before you make up your mind she will be glad to meet you She does not however wish to do anything to influence your judgment Does Mother know she is coming said Carry hastily I do not know said Prince gravely I only know that if you conclude to see missus Starbottle it will be with your mother s permission missus Starbottle will keep sacredly this part of the agreement made ten years ago But her health is very poor and the change and country quiet of a few days may benefit her mister Prince bent his keen bright eyes upon the young girl and almost held his breath until she spoke again Mother s coming up today or tomorrow she said looking up Ah said mister Prince with a sweet and languid smile Is Colonel Starbottle here too asked Carry after a pause Colonel Starbottle is dead Your stepmother is again a widow Dead repeated Carry Yes replied mister Prince Your stepmother has been singularly unfortunate in surviving her affections Carry did not know what he meant and looked so mister Prince smiled reassuringly Presently Carry began to whimper mister Prince softly stepped beside her chair I am afraid he said with a very peculiar light in his eye and a singular dropping of the corners of his mustache I am afraid you are taking this too deeply It will be some days before you are called upon to make a decision Let us talk of something else I hope you caught no cold last evening Carry s face shone out again in dimples You must have thought us so queer It was too bad to give you so much trouble None whatever I assure you My sense of propriety he added demurely which might have been outraged had I been called upon to help three young ladies out of a schoolroom window at night was deeply gratified at being able to assist them in again The doorbell rang loudly and mister Prince rose Take your own time and think well before you make your decision But Carry s ear and attention were given to the sound of voices in the hall At the same moment the door was thrown open and a servant announced missus Tretherick and mister Robinson The afternoon train had just shrieked out its usual indignant protest at stopping at Genoa at all as mister Jack Prince entered the outskirts of the town and drove toward his hotel He was wearied and cynical A drive of a dozen miles through unpicturesque outlying villages past small economic farmhouses and hideous villas that violated his fastidious taste had I fear left that gentleman in a captious state of mind He would have even avoided his taciturn landlord as he drove up to the door but that functionary waylaid him on the steps There s a lady in the sittin room waitin for ye mister Prince hurried upstairs and entered the room as missus Starbottle flew toward him She had changed sadly in the last ten years Her figure was wasted to half its size The beautiful curves of her bust and shoulders were broken or inverted The once full rounded arm was shrunken in its sleeve and the golden hoops that encircled her wan wrists almost slipped from her hands as her long scant fingers closed convulsively around Jack s Her cheekbones were painted that afternoon with the hectic of fever somewhere in the hollows of those cheeks were buried the dimples of long ago but their graves were forgotten Her lustrous eyes were still beautiful though the orbits were deeper than before Her mouth was still sweet although the lips parted more easily over the little teeth even in breathing and showed more of them than she was wont to do before The glory of her blond hair was still left it was finer more silken and ethereal yet it failed even in its plenitude to cover the hollows of the blue veined temples Clara said Jack reproachfully Oh forgive me Jack she said falling into a chair but still clinging to his hand forgive me dear but I could not wait longer I should have died Jack died before another night Bear with me a little longer it will not be long but let me stay I may not see her I know I shall not speak to her but it s so sweet to feel that I am at last near her that I breathe the same air with my darling I am better already Jack I am indeed And you have seen her today How did she look What did she say Tell me all everything Jack Was she beautiful They say she is Has she grown Would you have known her again Will she come Jack Perhaps she has been here already perhaps she had risen with tremulous excitement and was glancing at the door perhaps she is here now Why don t you speak Jack Tell me all The keen eyes that looked down into hers were glistening with an infinite tenderness that none perhaps but she would have deemed them capable of Clara he said gently and cheerily try and compose yourself You are trembling now with the fatigue and excitement of your journey I have seen Carry she is well and beautiful Let that suffice you now His gentle firmness composed and calmed her now as it had often done before Stroking her thin hand he said after a pause Did Carry ever write to you Twice thanking me for some presents They were only schoolgirl letters she added nervously answering the interrogation of his eyes Did she ever know of your own troubles of your poverty of the sacrifices you made to pay her bills of your pawning your clothes and jewels of your No no interrupted the woman quickly no How could she I have no enemy cruel enough to tell her that But if she or if missus Tretherick had heard of it If Carry thought you were poor and unable to support her properly it might influence her decision Young girls are fond of the position that wealth can give She may have rich friends maybe a lover missus Starbottle winced at the last sentence But she said eagerly grasping Jack s hand when you found me sick and helpless at Sacramento when you God bless you for it Jack offered to help me to the East you said you knew of something you had some plan that would make me and Carry independent Yes said Jack hastily but I want you to get strong and well first And now that you are calmer you shall listen to my visit to the school It was then that mister Jack Prince proceeded to describe the interview already recorded with a singular felicity and discretion that shames my own account of that proceeding Without suppressing a single fact without omitting a word or detail he yet managed to throw a poetic veil over that prosaic episode to invest the heroine with a romantic roseate atmosphere which though not perhaps entirely imaginary still I fear exhibited that genius which ten years ago had made the columns of THE FIDDLETOWN AVALANCHE at once fascinating and instructive It was not until he saw the heightening color and heard the quick breathing of his eager listener that he felt a pang of self reproach God help her and forgive me he muttered between his clinched teeth but how can I tell her ALL now That night when missus Starbottle laid her weary head upon her pillow she tried to picture to herself Carry at the same moment sleeping peacefully in the great schoolhouse on the hill and it was a rare comfort to this yearning foolish woman to know that she was so near But at this moment Carry was sitting on the edge of her bed half undressed pouting her pretty lips and twisting her long leonine locks between her fingers as Miss Kate Van Corlear dramatically wrapped in a long white counterpane her black eyes sparkling and her thoroughbred nose thrown high in air stood over her like a wrathful and indignant ghost for Carry had that evening imparted her woes and her history to Miss Kate and that young lady had proved herself no friend by falling into a state of fiery indignation over Carry s ingratitude and openly and shamelessly espousing the claims of missus Starbottle Why if the half you tell me is true your mother and those Robinsons are making of you not only a little coward but a little snob miss Respectability forsooth Look you my family are centuries before the Trethericks but if my family had ever treated me in this way and then asked me to turn my back on my best friend I d whistle them down the wind and here Kate snapped her fingers bent her black brows and glared around the room as if in search of a recreant Van Corlear You just talk this way because you have taken a fancy to that mister Prince said Carry In the debasing slang of the period that had even found its way into the virgin cloisters of the Crammer Institute Miss Kate as she afterward expressed it instantly went for her First with a shake of her head she threw her long black hair over one shoulder then dropping one end of the counterpane from the other like a vestal tunic she stepped before Carry with a purposely exaggerated classic stride And what if I have miss What if I happen to know a gentleman when I see him What if I happen to know that among a thousand such traditional conventional feeble editions of their grandfathers as mister Harry Robinson you cannot find one original independent individualized gentleman like your Prince Go to bed miss and pray to Heaven that he may be YOUR Prince indeed Ask to have a contrite and grateful heart and thank the Lord in particular for having sent you such a friend as Kate Van Corlear Yet after an imposing dramatic exit she reappeared the next moment as a straight white flash kissed Carry between the brows and was gone The next day was a weary one to Jack Prince He was convinced in his mind that Carry would not come yet to keep this consciousness from missus Starbottle to meet her simple hopefulness with an equal degree of apparent faith was a hard and difficult task He would have tried to divert her mind by taking her on a long drive but she was fearful that Carry might come during her absence and her strength he was obliged to admit had failed greatly As he looked into her large and awe inspiring clear eyes a something he tried to keep from his mind to put off day by day from contemplation kept asserting itself directly to his inner consciousness He began to doubt the expediency and wisdom of his management He recalled every incident of his interview with Carry and half believed that its failure was due to himself Yet missus Starbottle was very patient and confident her very confidence shook his faith in his own judgment When her strength was equal to the exertion she was propped up in her chair by the window where she could see the school and the entrance to the hotel In the intervals she would elaborate pleasant plans for the future and would sketch a country home She had taken a strange fancy as it seemed to Prince to the present location but it was notable that the future always thus outlined was one of quiet and repose She believed she would get well soon in fact she thought she was now much better than she had been but it might be long before she should be quite strong again She would whisper on in this way until Jack would dash madly down into the barroom order liquors that he did not drink light cigars that he did not smoke talk with men that he did not listen to and behave generally as our stronger sex is apt to do in periods of delicate trials and perplexity The day closed with a clouded sky and a bitter searching wind With the night fell a few wandering flakes of snow She was still content and hopeful and as Jack wheeled her from the window to the fire she explained to him how that as the school term was drawing near its close Carry was probably kept closely at her lessons during the day and could only leave the school at night So she sat up the greater part of the evening and combed her silken hair and as far as her strength would allow made an undress toilet to receive her guest We must not frighten the child Jack she said apologetically and with something of her old coquetry It was with a feeling of relief that at ten o clock Jack received a message from the landlord saying that the doctor would like to see him for a moment downstairs As Jack entered the grim dimly lighted parlor he observed the hooded figure of a woman near the fire He was about to withdraw again when a voice that he remembered very pleasantly said Oh it s all right I m the doctor The hood was thrown back and Prince saw the shining black hair and black audacious eyes of Kate Van Corlear Don t ask any questions I m the doctor and there s my prescription and she pointed to the half frightened half sobbing Carry in the corner to be taken at once Then missus Tretherick has given her permission Not much if I know the sentiments of that lady replied Kate saucily Then how did you get away asked Prince gravely BY THE WINDOW When mister Prince had left Carry in the arms of her stepmother he returned to the parlor Well demanded Kate She will stay YOU will I hope also tonight As I shall not be eighteen and my own mistress on the twentieth and as I haven t a sick stepmother I won t Then you will give me the pleasure of seeing you safely through the window again When mister Prince returned an hour later he found Carry sitting on a low stool at missus Starbottle s feet Her head was in her stepmother s lap and she had sobbed herself to sleep missus Starbottle put her finger to her lip I told you she would come God bless you Jack and good night The next morning missus Tretherick indignant the reverend Asa Crammer principal injured and mister Joel Robinson Sr complacently respectable called upon mister Prince There was a stormy meeting ending in a demand for Carry We certainly cannot admit of this interference said missus Tretherick a fashionably dressed indistinctive looking woman It is several days before the expiration of our agreement and we do not feel under the circumstances justified in releasing missus Starbottle from its conditions Until the expiration of the school term we must consider Miss Tretherick as complying entirely with its rules and discipline imposed doctor Crammer The whole proceeding is calculated to injure the prospects and compromise the position of Miss Tretherick in society suggested mister Robinson In vain mister Prince urged the failing condition of missus Starbottle her absolute freedom from complicity with Carry s flight the pardonable and natural instincts of the girl and his own assurance that they were willing to abide by her decision And then with a rising color in his cheek a dangerous look in his eye but a singular calmness in his speech he added One word more It becomes my duty to inform you of a circumstance which would certainly justify me as an executor of the late mister Tretherick in fully resisting your demands A few months after mister Tretherick s death through the agency of a Chinaman in his employment it was discovered that he had made a will which was subsequently found among his papers The insignificant value of his bequest mostly land then quite valueless prevented his executors from carrying out his wishes or from even proving the will or making it otherwise publicly known until within the last two or three years when the property had enormously increased in value The provisions of that bequest are simple but unmistakable The property is divided between Carry and her stepmother with the explicit condition that missus Starbottle shall become her legal guardian provide for her education and in all details stand to her IN LOCO PARENTIS What is the value of this bequest asked mister Robinson I cannot tell exactly but not far from half a million I should say returned Prince Certainly with this knowledge as a friend of Miss Tretherick I must say that her conduct is as judicious as it is honorable to her responded mister Robinson I shall not presume to question the wishes or throw any obstacles in the way of carrying out the intentions of my dead husband added missus Tretherick and the interview was closed When its result was made known to missus Starbottle she raised Jack s hand to her feverish lips It cannot add to MY happiness now Jack but tell me why did you keep it from her Jack smiled but did not reply Within the next week the necessary legal formalities were concluded and Carry was restored to her stepmother At missus Starbottle s request a small house in the outskirts of the town was procured and thither they removed to wait the spring and missus Starbottle s convalescence Both came tardily that year Yet she was happy and patient She was fond of watching the budding of the trees beyond her window a novel sight to her Californian experience and of asking Carry their names and seasons Even at this time she projected for that summer which seemed to her so mysteriously withheld long walks with Carry through the leafy woods whose gray misty ranks she could see along the hilltop She even thought she could write poetry about them and recalled the fact as evidence of her gaining strength and there is I believe still treasured by one of the members of this little household a little carol so joyous so simple and so innocent that it might have been an echo of the robin that called to her from the window as perhaps it was And then without warning there dropped from Heaven a day so tender so mystically soft so dreamily beautiful so throbbing and alive with the fluttering of invisible wings so replete and bounteously overflowing with an awakening and joyous resurrection not taught by man or limited by creed that they thought it fit to bring her out and lay her in that glorious sunshine that sprinkled like the droppings of a bridal torch the happy lintels and doors And there she lay beatified and calm Wearied by watching Carry had fallen asleep by her side and missus Starbottle s thin fingers lay like a benediction on her head Presently she called Jack to her side Who was that she whispered who just came in Miss Van Corlear said Jack answering the look in her great hollow eyes Jack she said after a moment s silence sit by me a moment dear Jack I ve something I must say If I ever seemed hard or cold or coquettish to you in the old days it was because I loved you Jack too well to mar your future by linking it with my own I always loved you dear Jack even when I seemed least worthy of you That is gone now But I had a dream lately Jack a foolish woman s dream that you might find what I lacked in HER and she glanced lovingly at the sleeping girl at her side that you might love her as you have loved me But even that is not to be Jack is it and she glanced wistfully in his face Jack pressed her hand but did not speak After a few moments silence she again said Perhaps you are right in your choice She is a goodhearted girl Jack but a little bold And with this last flicker of foolish weak humanity in her struggling spirit she spoke no more When they came to her a moment later a tiny bird that had lit upon her breast flew away and the hand that they lifted from Carry s head fell lifeless at her side BARKER S LUCK A bird twittered The morning sun shining through the open window was apparently more potent than the cool mountain air which had only caused the sleeper to curl a little more tightly in his blankets Barker s eyes opened instantly upon the light and the bird on the window ledge Like all healthy young animals he would have tried to sleep again but with his momentary consciousness came the recollection that it was his turn to cook the breakfast that morning and he regretfully rolled out of his bunk to the floor Without stopping to dress he opened the door and stepped outside secure in the knowledge that he was overlooked only by the Sierras and plunged his head and shoulders in the bucket of cold water that stood by the door Then he began to clothe himself partly in the cabin and partly in the open air with a lapse between the putting on of his trousers and coat which he employed in bringing in wood Raking together the few embers on the adobe hearth not without a prudent regard to the rattlesnake which had once been detected in haunting the warm ashes he began to prepare breakfast By this time the other sleepers his partners Stacy and Demorest young men of about his own age were awake alert and lazily critical of his progress I don t care about my quail on toast being underdone for breakfast said Stacy with a yawn and you needn t serve with red wine I m not feeling very peckish this morning And I reckon you can knock off the fried oysters after the Spanish mackerel for ME said Demorest gravely The fact is that last bottle of Veuve Clicquot we had for supper wasn t as dry as I am this morning Accustomed to these regular Barmecide suggestions Barker made no direct reply Presently looking up from the fire he said There s no more saleratus so you mustn t blame me if the biscuit is extra heavy I told you we had none when you went to the grocery yesterday And I told you we hadn t a red cent to buy any with said Stacy who was also treasurer Put these two negatives together and you make the affirmative saleratus Mix freely and bake in a hot oven Nevertheless after a toilet as primitive as Barker s they sat down to what he had prepared with the keen appetite begotten of the mountain air and the regretful fastidiousness born of the recollection of better things Jerked beef frizzled with salt pork in a frying pan boiled potatoes biscuit and coffee composed the repast The biscuits however proving remarkably heavy after the first mouthful were used as missiles thrown through the open door at an empty bottle which had previously served as a mark for revolver practice and a few moments later pipes were lit to counteract the effects of the meal and take the taste out of their mouths Suddenly they heard the sound of horses hoofs saw the quick passage of a rider in the open space before the cabin and felt the smart impact upon the table of some small object thrown by him It was the regular morning delivery of the county newspaper He s getting to be a mighty sure shot said Demorest approvingly looking at his upset can of coffee as he picked up the paper rolled into a cylindrical wad as tightly as a cartridge and began to straighten it out This was no easy matter as the sheet had evidently been rolled while yet damp from the press but Demorest eventually opened it and ensconced himself behind it Nary news asked Stacy No There never is any said Demorest scornfully We ought to stop the paper You mean the paper man ought to WE don t pay him said Barker gently Well that s the same thing smarty No news no pay Hallo he continued his eyes suddenly riveted on the paper Then after the fashion of ordinary humanity he stopped short and read the interesting item to himself When he had finished he brought his fist and the paper together violently down upon the table Now look at this Talk of luck will you Just think of it Here are WE hard working men with lots of sabe too grubbin away on this hillside like niggers glad to get enough at the end of the day to pay for our soggy biscuits and horse bean coffee and just look what falls into the lap of some lazy sneakin greenhorn who never did a stoke of work in his life Here are WE with no foolishness no airs nor graces and yet men who would do credit to twice that amount of luck and seem born to it too and we re set aside for some long lank pen wiping scrub who just knows enough to sit down on his office stool and hold on to a bit of paper What s up now asked Stacy with the carelessness begotten of familiarity with his partner s extravagance Listen said Demorest reading Another unprecedented rise has taken place in the shares of the Yellow Hammer First Extension Mine since the sinking of the new shaft It was quoted yesterday at ten thousand dollars a foot When it is remembered that scarcely two years ago the original shares issued at fifty dollars per share had dropped to only fifty cents a share it will be seen that those who were able to hold on have got a good thing What mine did you say asked Barker looking up meditatively from the dishes he was already washing The Yellow Hammer First Extension returned Demorest shortly I used to have some shares in that and I think I have them still said Barker musingly Yes said Demorest promptly the paper speaks of it here We understand he continued reading aloud that our eminent fellow citizen George Barker otherwise known as Get Left Barker and Chucklehead is one of these fortunate individuals No said Barker with a slight flush of innocent pleasure it can t say that How could it know Stacy laughed but Demorest coolly continued You didn t hear all Listen We say WAS one of them but having already sold his apparently useless certificates to our popular druggist Jones for corn plasters at a reduced rate he is unable to realize You may laugh boys said Barker with simple seriousness but I really believe I have got em yet Just wait I ll see He rose and began to drag out a well worn valise from under his bunk You see he continued they were given to me by an old chap in return For saving his life by delaying the Stockton boat that afterward blew up returned Demorest briefly We know it all His hair was white and his hand trembled slightly as he laid these shares in yours saying and you never forgot the words Take em young man and For lending him two thousand dollars then continued Barker with a simple ignoring of the interruption as he quietly brought out the valise TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS repeated Stacy When did YOU have two thousand dollars When I first left Sacramento three years ago said Barker unstrapping the valise How long did you have it said Demorest incredulously At least two days I think returned Barker quietly Then I met that man He was hard up and I lent him my pile and took those shares He died afterward Of course he did said Demorest severely They always do Nothing kills a man more quickly than an action of that kind Nevertheless the two partners regarded Barker rummaging among some loose clothes and papers with a kind of paternal toleration If you can t find them bring out your government bonds suggested Stacy But the next moment flushed and triumphant Barker rose from his knees and came toward them carrying some papers in his hands Demorest seized them from him opened them spread them on the table examined hurriedly the date signatures and transfers glanced again quickly at the newspaper paragraph looked wildly at Stacy and then at Barker and gasped By the living hookey it is SO B gosh he HAS got em echoed Stacy Twenty shares continued Demorest breathlessly at ten thousand dollars a share even if it s only a foot is two hundred thousand dollars Jerusalem Tell me fair sir said Stacy with sparkling eyes hast still left in yonder casket any rare jewels rubies sarcenet or links of fine gold Peradventure a pearl or two may have been overlooked No that s all returned Barker simply You hear him Rothschild says that s all Prince Esterhazy says he hasn t another red cent only two hundred thousand dollars What ought I to do boys asked Barker timidly glancing from one to the other Yet he remembered with delight all that day and for many a year afterward that he saw in their faces only unselfish joy and affection at that supreme moment Do said Demorest promptly Stand on your head and yell No stop Come here He seized both Barker and Stacy by the hand and ran out into the open air Here they danced violently with clasped hands around a small buckeye in perfect silence and then returned to the cabin grave but perspiring Of course said Barker wiping his forehead we ll just get some money on these certificates and buy up that next claim which belongs to old Carter where you know we thought we saw the indication We ll do nothing of the kind said Demorest decidedly WE ain t in it That money is yours old chap every cent of it property acquired before marriage you know and the only thing we ll do is to be damned before we ll see you drop a dime of it into this Godforsaken hole No But we re partners gasped Barker Not in THIS The utmost we can do for you opulent sir though it ill becomes us horny handed sons of toil to rub shoulders with Dives is perchance to dine with you to take a pasty and a glass of Malvoisie at some restaurant in Sacramento when you ve got things fixed in honor of your return to affluence But more would ill become us But what are YOU going to do said Barker with a half hysteric half frightened smile We have not yet looked through our luggage said Demorest with invincible gravity and there s a secret recess a double FOND to my portmanteau known only to a trusty page which has not been disturbed since I left my ancestral home in Faginia There may be a few First Debentures of Erie or what not still there I felt some strange disklike protuberances in my dress suit the other day but belike they are but poker chips said Stacy thoughtfully An uneasy feeling crept over Barker The color which had left his fresh cheek returned to it quickly and he turned his eyes away Yet he had seen nothing in his companions eyes but affection with even a certain kind of tender commiseration that deepened his uneasiness I suppose he said desperately after a pause I ought to go over to Boomville and make some inquiries At the bank old chap at the bank said Demorest emphatically Take my advice and don t go ANYWHERE ELSE Don t breathe a word of your luck to anybody And don t whatever you do be tempted to sell just now you don t know how high that stock s going to jump yet I thought stammered Barker that you boys might like to go over with me We can t afford to take another holiday on grub wages and we re only two to work today said Demorest with a slight increase of color and the faintest tremor in his voice And it won t do old chap for us to be seen bumming round with you on the heels of your good fortune For everybody knows we re poor and sooner or later everybody ll know you WERE rich even when you first came to us Nonsense said Barker indignantly Gospel my boy said Demorest shortly The frozen truth old man said Stacy Barker took up his hat with some stiffness and moved toward the door Here he stopped irresolutely an irresolution that seemed to communicate itself to his partners There was a moment s awkward silence Then Demorest suddenly seized him by the shoulders with a grip that was half a caress and walked him rapidly to the door And now don t stand foolin with us Barker boy but just trot off like a little man and get your grip on that fortune and when you ve got your hooks in it hang on like grim death You ll he hesitated for an instant only possibly to find the laugh that should have accompanied his speech you re sure to find US here when you get back Hurt to the quick but restraining his feelings Barker clapped his hat on his head and walked quickly away The two partners stood watching him in silence until his figure was lost in the underbrush Then they spoke Like him wasn t it said Demorest Just him all over said Stacy Think of him having that stock stowed away all these years and never even bothering his dear old head about it And think of his wanting to put the whole thing into this rotten hillside with us And he d have done it by gosh and never thought of it again That s Barker Dear old man Good old chap I ve been wondering if one of us oughtn t to have gone with him He s just as likely to pour his money into the first lap that opens for it said Stacy The more reason why we shouldn t prevent him or seem to prevent him said Demorest almost fiercely There will be knaves and fools enough who will try and put the idea of our using him into his simple heart without that No Let him do as he likes with it but let him be himself I d rather have him come back to us even after he s lost the money his old self and empty handed than try to change the stuff God put into him and make him more like others The tone and manner were so different from Demorest s usual levity that Stacy was silent After a pause he said Well we shall miss him on the hillside won t we Demorest did not reply Reaching out his hand abstractedly he wrenched off a small slip from a sapling near him and began slowly to pull the leaves off one by one until they were all gone Then he switched it in the air struck his bootleg smartly with it said roughly Come let s get to work and strode away Meantime Barker on his way to Boomville was no less singular in his manner He kept up his slightly affected attitude until he had lost sight of the cabin But being of a simple nature his emotions were less complex If he had not seen the undoubted look of affection in the eyes of his partners he would have imagined that they were jealous of his good fortune Yet why had they refused his offer to share it with him Why had they so strangely assumed that their partnership with him had closed Why had they declined to go with him Why had this money of which he had thought so little and for which he had cared so little changed them toward him It had not changed HIM HE was the same He remembered how they had often talked and laughed over a prospective strike in mining and speculated what THEY would do together with the money And now that luck had occurred to one of them individually the effect was only to alienate them He could not make it out He was hurt wounded yet oddly enough he was conscious now of a certain power within him to hurt and wound in retribution He was rich he would let them see HE could do without them He was quite free now to think only of himself and Kitty For it must be recorded that with all this young gentleman s simplicity and unselfishness with all his loyal attitude to his partners his FIRST thought at the moment he grasped the fact of his wealth was of a young lady It was Kitty Carter the daughter of the hotelkeeper at Boomville who owned the claim that the partners had mutually coveted That a pretty girl s face should flash upon him with his conviction that he was now a rich man meant perhaps no disloyalty to his partners whom he would still have helped But it occurred to him now in his half hurt half vengeful state that they had often joked him about Kitty and perhaps further confidence with them was debarred And it was only due to his dignity that he should now see Kitty at once This was easy enough for in the naive simplicity of Boomville and the economic arrangements of her father she occasionally waited upon the hotel table Half the town was always actively in love with her the other half HAD BEEN and was silent cynical but hopeless in defeat For Kitty was one of those singularly pretty girls occasionally met with in Southwestern frontier civilization whose distinct and original refinement of face and figure were so remarkable and original as to cast a doubt on the sagacity and prescience of one parent and the morality of the other yet no doubt with equal injustice But the fact remained that she was slight graceful and self contained and moved beside her stumpy commonplace father and her faded commonplace mother in the dining room of the Boomville Hotel like some distinguished alien The three partners by virtue perhaps of their college education and refined manners had been exceptionally noticed by Kitty And for some occult reason the more serious perhaps because it had no obvious or logical presumption to the world generally Barker was particularly favored He quickened his pace and as the flagstaff of the Boomville Hotel rose before him in the little hollow he seriously debated whether he had not better go to the bank first deposit his shares and get a small advance on them to buy a new necktie or a boiled shirt in which to present himself to Miss Kitty but remembering that he had partly given his word to Demorest that he would keep his shares intact for the present he abandoned this project probably from the fact that his projected confidence with Kitty was already a violation of Demorest s injunctions of secrecy and his conscience was sufficiently burdened with that breach of faith But when he reached the hotel a strange trepidation overcame him The dining room was at its slack water between the ebb of breakfast and before the flow of the preparation for the midday meal He could not have his interview with Kitty in that dreary waste of reversed chairs and bare trestlelike tables and she was possibly engaged in her household duties But Miss Kitty had already seen him cross the road and had lounged into the dining room with an artfully simulated air of casually examining it At the unexpected vision of his hopes arrayed in the sweetest and freshest of rosebud sprigged print his heart faltered Then partly with the desperation of a timid man and partly through the working of a half formed resolution he met her bright smile with a simple inquiry for her father Miss Kitty bit her pretty lip smiled slightly and preceded him with great formality to the office Opening the door without raising her lashes to either her father or the visitor she said with a mischievous accenting of the professional manner mister Barker to see you on business and tripped sweetly away And this slight incident precipitated the crisis For Barker instantly made up his mind that he must purchase the next claim for his partners of this man Carter and that he would be obliged to confide to him the details of his good fortune and as a proof of his sincerity and his ability to pay for it he did so bluntly Carter was a shrewd business man and the well known simplicity of Barker was a proof of his truthfulness to say nothing of the shares that were shown to him His selling price for his claim had been two hundred dollars but here was a rich customer who from a mere foolish sentiment would be no doubt willing to pay more He hesitated with a bland but superior smile Ah that was my price at my last offer mister Barker he said suavely but you see things are going up since then The keenest duplicity is apt to fail before absolute simplicity Barker thoroughly believing him and already a little frightened at his own presumption not for the amount of the money involved but from the possibility of his partners refusing his gift utterly quickly took advantage of this LOCUS PENITENTIAE No matter then he said hurriedly perhaps I had better consult my partners first in fact he added with a gratuitous truthfulness all his own I hardly know whether they will take it of me so I think I ll wait Carter was staggered this would clearly not do He recovered himself with an insinuating smile You pulled me up too short mister Barker I m a business man but hang it all what s that among friends If you reckoned I GAVE MY WORD at two hundred why I m there Say no more about it the claim s yours I ll make you out a bill of sale at once But hesitated Barker you see I haven t got the money yet and Money echoed Carter bluntly what s that among friends Gimme your note at thirty days that s good enough for ME An we ll settle the whole thing now nothing like finishing a job while you re about it And before the bewildered and doubtful visitor could protest he had filled up a promissory note for Barker s signature and himself signed a bill of sale for the property And I reckon mister Barker you d like to take your partners by surprise about this little gift of yours he added smilingly Well my messenger is starting for the Gulch in five minutes he s going by your cabin and he can just drop this bill o sale as a kind o settled fact on em afore they can say anything see There s nothing like actin on the spot in these sort of things And don t you hurry bout them either You see you sorter owe us a friendly call havin always dropped inter the hotel only as a customer so ye ll stop here over luncheon and I reckon as the old woman is busy why Kitty will try to make the time pass till then by playin for you on her new pianner Delighted yet bewildered by the unexpected invitation and opportunity Barker mechanically signed the promissory note and as mechanically addressed the envelope of the bill of sale to Demorest which Carter gave to the messenger Then he followed his host across the hall to the apartment known as Miss Kitty s parlor He had often heard of it as a sanctum impervious to the ordinary guest Whatever functions the young girl assumed at the hotel and among her father s boarders it was vaguely understood that she dropped them on crossing that sacred threshold and became MISS Carter The county judge had been entertained there and the wife of the bank manager Barker s admission there was consequently an unprecedented honor He cast his eyes timidly round the room redolent and suggestive in various charming little ways of the young girl s presence There was the cottage piano which had been brought up in sections on the backs of mules from the foot of the mountain there was a crayon head of Minerva done by the fair occupant at the age of twelve there was a profile of herself done by a traveling artist there were pretty little china ornaments and many flowers notably a faded but still scented woodland shrub which Barker had presented to her two weeks ago and over which Miss Kitty had discreetly thrown her white handkerchief as he entered A wave of hope passed over him at the act but it was quickly spent as mister Carter s roughly playful voice introduced him Ye kin give mister Barker a tune or two to pass time afore lunch Kitty You kin let him see what you re doing in that line But you ll have to sit up now for this young man s come inter some property and will be sasheying round in Frisco afore long with a biled shirt and a stovepipe and be givin the go by to Boomville Well you young folks will excuse me for a while as I reckon I ll just toddle over and get the recorder to put that bill o sale on record Nothin like squaring things to onct mister Barker As he slipped away Barker felt his heart sink Carter had not only bluntly forestalled him with the news and taken away his excuse for a confidential interview but had put an ostentatious construction on his visit What could she think of him now He stood ashamed and embarrassed before her But Miss Kitty far from noticing his embarrassment in a sudden concern regarding the horrid untidiness of the room which made her cheeks quite pink in one spot and obliged her to take up and set down in exactly the same place several articles was exceedingly delighted In fact she did not remember ever having been so pleased before in her life These things were always so unexpected Just like the weather for instance It was quite cool last night and now it was just stifling And so dusty Had mister Barker noticed the heat coming from the Gulch Or perhaps being a rich man he with a dazzling smile was above walking now It was so kind of him to come here first and tell her father I really wanted to tell only YOU Miss Carter stammered Barker You see he hesitated But Miss Kitty saw perfectly He wanted to tell HER and seeing her he asked for HER FATHER Not that it made the slightest difference to her for her father would have been sure to have told her It was also kind of her father to invite him to luncheon Otherwise she might not have seen him before he left Boomville But this was more than Barker could stand With the same desperate directness and simplicity with which he had approached her father he now blurted out his whole heart to her He told her how he had loved her hopelessly from the first time that they had spoken together at the church picnic Did she remember it How he had sat and worshiped her and nothing else at church How her voice in the church choir had sounded like an angel s how his poverty and his uncertain future had kept him from seeing her often lest he should be tempted to betray his hopeless passion How as soon as he realized that he had a position that his love for her need not make her ridiculous to the world s eyes he came to tell her ALL He did not even dare to hope But she would HEAR him at least would she not Indeed there was no getting away from his boyish simple outspoken declaration In vain Kitty smiled frowned glanced at her pink cheeks in the glass and stopped to look out of the window The room was filled with his love it was encompassing her and despite his shy attitude seemed to be almost embracing her But she managed at last to turn upon him a face that was now as white and grave as his own was eager and glowing Sit down she said gently He did so obediently but wonderingly She then opened the piano and took a seat upon the music stool before it placed some loose sheets of music in the rack and ran her fingers lightly over the keys Thus intrenched she let her hands fall idly in her lap and for the first time raised her eyes to his Now listen to me be good and don t interrupt There not so near you can hear what I have to say well enough where you are That will do Barker had halted with the chair he was dragging toward her and sat down Now said Miss Kitty withdrawing her eyes and looking straight before her I believe everything you say perhaps I oughtn t to or at least SAY it but I do There But because I do believe you it seems to me all wrong For the very reasons that you give for not having spoken to me BEFORE if you really felt as you say you did are the same reasons why you should not speak to me now You see all this time you have let nobody but yourself know how you felt toward me In everybody s eyes YOU and your partners have been only the three stuck up exclusive college bred men who mined a poor claim in the Gulch and occasionally came here to this hotel as customers In everybody s eyes I have been only the rich hotel keeper s popular daughter who sometimes waited upon you but nothing more But at least we were then pretty much alike and as good as each other And now as soon as you have become suddenly rich and of course the SUPERIOR you rush down here to ask me to acknowledge it by accepting you You know I never meant that Miss Kitty burst out Barker vehemently but his protest was drowned in a rapid roulade from the young lady s fingers on the keys He sank back in his chair Of course you never MEANT it she said with an odd laugh but everybody will take it in that way and you cannot go round to everybody in Boomville and make the pretty declaration you have just made to me Everybody will say I accepted you for your money everybody will say it was a put up job of my father s Everybody will say that you threw yourself away on me And I don t know but that they would be right Sit down please or I shall play again You see she went on without looking at him just now you like to remember that you fell in love with me first as a pretty waiter girl but if I became your wife it s just what you would like to FORGET And I shouldn t for I should always like to think of the time when you came here whenever you could afford it and sometimes when you couldn t just to see me and how we used to make excuses to speak with each other over the dishes You don t know what these things mean to a woman who she hesitated a moment and then added abruptly but what does that matter You would not care to be reminded of it So she said rising up with a grave smile and grasping her hands tightly behind her it s a good deal better that you should begin to forget it now Be a good boy and take my advice Go to San Francisco You will meet some girl there in a way you will not afterward regret You are young and your riches to say nothing she added in a faltering voice that was somewhat inconsistent with the mischievous smile that played upon her lips of your kind and simple heart will secure that which the world would call unselfish affection from one more equal to you but would always believe was only BOUGHT if it came from me I suppose you are right he said simply She glanced quickly at him and her eyebrows straightened He had risen his face white and his gray eyes widely opened I suppose you are right he went on because you are saying to me what my partners said to me this morning when I offered to share my wealth with them God knows as honestly as I offered to share my heart with you I suppose that you are both right that there must be some curse of pride or selfishness upon the money that I have got but I have not felt it yet and the fault does not lie with me She gave her shoulders a slight shrug and turned impatiently toward the window When she turned back again he was gone The room around her was empty this room which a moment before had seemed to be pulsating with his boyish passion was now empty and empty of HIM She bit her lips rose and ran eagerly to the window She saw his straw hat and brown curls as he crossed the road She drew her handkerchief sharply away from the withered shrub over which she had thrown it and cast the once treasured remains in the hearth Then possibly because she had it ready in her hand she clapped the handkerchief to her eyes and sinking sideways upon the chair he had risen from put her elbows on its back and buried her face in her hands It is the characteristic and perhaps cruelty of a simple nature to make no allowance for complex motives or to even understand them So it seemed to Barker that his simplicity had been met with equal directness It was the possession of this wealth that had in some way hopelessly changed his relations with the world He did not love Kitty any the less he did not even think she had wronged him they his partners and his sweetheart were cleverer than he there must be some occult quality in this wealth that he would understand when he possessed it and perhaps it might even make him ashamed of his generosity not in the way they had said but in his tempting them so audaciously to assume a wrong position It behoved him to take possession of it at once and to take also upon himself alone the knowledge the trials and responsibilities it would incur His cheeks flushed again as he thought he had tried to tempt an innocent girl with it and he was keenly hurt that he had not seen in Kitty s eyes the tenderness that had softened his partners refusal He resolved to wait no longer but sell his dreadful stock at once He walked directly to the bank The manager a shrewd but kindly man to whom Barker was known already received him graciously in recognition of his well known simple honesty and respectfully as a representative of the equally well known poor but superior partnership of the Gulch He listened with marked attention to Barker s hesitating but brief story only remarking at its close You mean of course the SECOND Extension when you say First No said Barker I mean the First and it said First in the Boomville paper Yes yes I saw it it was a printer s error The stock of the First was called in two years ago No You mean the Second for of course you ve followed the quotations and are likely to know what stock you re holding shares of When you go back take a look at them and you ll see I am right But I brought them with me said Barker with a slight flushing as he felt in his pocket and I am quite sure they are the First He brought them out and laid them on the desk before the manager The words First Extension were plainly visible The manager glanced curiously at Barker and his brow darkened Did anybody put this up on you he said sternly Did your partners send you here with this stuff No no said Barker eagerly No one It s all MY mistake I see it now I trusted to the newspaper And you mean to say you never examined the stock or the quotations nor followed it in any way since you had it Never said Barker Never thought about IT AT ALL till I saw the newspaper So it s not worth anything And to the infinite surprise of the manager there was a slight smile on his boyish face I am afraid it is not worth the paper it s written on said the manager gently The smile on Barker s face increased to a little laugh in which his wondering companion could not help joining Thank you said Barker suddenly and rushed away He beats everything said the manager gazing after him Damned if he didn t seem even PLEASED He WAS pleased The burden of wealth had fallen from his shoulders the dreadful incubus that had weighed him down and parted his friends from him was gone And he had not got rid of it by spending it foolishly It had not ruined anybody yet it had not altered anybody in HIS eyes It was gone and he was a free and happy man once more He would go directly back to his partners they would laugh at him of course but they could not look at him now with the same sad commiserating eyes Perhaps even Kitty but here a sudden chill struck him He had forgotten the bill of sale He had forgotten the dreadful promissory note given to her father in the rash presumption of his wealth How could it ever be paid And more than that it had been given in a fraud He had no money when he gave it and no prospect of any but what he was to get from those worthless shares Would anybody believe him that it was only a stupid blunder of his own Yes his partners might believe him but horrible thought he had already implicated THEM in his fraud Even now while he was standing there hesitatingly in the road they were entering upon the new claim he had NOT PAID FOR COULD NOT PAY FOR and in the guise of a benefactor he was dishonoring them Yet it was Carter he must meet first he must confess all to him He must go back to the hotel that hotel where he had indignantly left her and tell the father he was a fraud It was terrible to think of perhaps it was part of that money curse that he could not get rid of and was now realizing but it MUST be done He was simple but his very simplicity had that unhesitating directness of conclusion which is the main factor of what men call pluck He turned back to the hotel and entered the office But mister Carter had not yet returned What was to be done He could not wait there there was no time to be lost there was only one other person who knew his expectations and to whom he could confide his failure it was Kitty It was to taste the dregs of his humiliation but it must be done He ran up the staircase and knocked timidly at the sitting room door There was a momentary pause and a weak voice said Come in Barker opened the door saw the vision of a handkerchief thrown away of a pair of tearful eyes that suddenly changed to stony indifference and a graceful but stiffening figure But he was past all insult now I would not intrude he said simply but I came only to see your father I have made an awful blunder more than a blunder I think a FRAUD Believing that I was rich I purchased your father s claim for my partners and gave him my promissory note I came here to give him back his claim for that note can NEVER be paid I have just been to the bank I find I have made a stupid mistake in the name of the shares upon which I based my belief in my wealth The ones I own are worthless am as poor as ever I am even poorer for I owe your father money I can never pay To his amazement he saw a look of pain and scorn come into her troubled eyes which he had never seen before This is a feeble trick she said bitterly it is unlike you it is unworthy of you Good God You must believe me Listen it was all a mistake a printer s error I read in the paper that the stock for the First Extension mine had gone up when it should have been the Second I had some old stock of the First which I had kept for years and only thought of when I read the announcement in the paper this morning I swear to you But it was unnecessary There was no doubting the truth of that voice that manner The scorn fled from Miss Kitty s eyes to give place to a stare and then suddenly changed to two bubbling blue wells of laughter She went to the window and laughed She sat down to the piano and laughed She caught up the handkerchief and hiding half her rosy face in it laughed She finally collapsed into an easy chair and burying her brown head in its cushions laughed long and confidentially until she brought up suddenly against a sob And then was still Barker was dreadfully alarmed He had heard of hysterics before He felt he ought to do something He moved toward her timidly and gently drew away her handkerchief Alas the blue wells were running over now He took her cold hands in his he knelt beside her and passed his arm around her waist He drew her head upon his shoulder He was not sure that any of these things were effective until she suddenly lifted her eyes to his with the last ray of mirth in them vanishing in a big teardrop put her arms round his neck and sobbed Oh George You blessed innocent An eloquent silence was broken by a remorseful start from Barker But I must go and warn my poor partners dearest there yet may be time perhaps they have not yet taken possession of your father s claim Yes George dear said the young girl with sparkling eyes and tell them to do so AT ONCE What gasped Barker At once do you hear or it may be too late Go quick But your father Oh I see dearest you will tell him all yourself and spare me I shall do nothing so foolish Georgey Nor shall you Don t you see the note isn t due for a month Stop Have you told anybody but Paw and me Only the bank manager She ran out of the room and returned in a minute tying the most enchanting of hats by a ribbon under her oval chin I ll run over and fix him she said Fix him returned Barker aghast Yes I ll say your wicked partners have been playing a practical joke on you and he mustn t give you away He ll do anything for me But my partners didn t On the contrary Don t tell me George said Miss Kitty severely THEY ought never to have let you come here with that stuff But come You must go at once You must not meet Paw you ll blurt out everything to him I know you I ll tell him you could not stay to luncheon Quick now go What Well there Whatever it represented the exclamation was apparently so protracted that Miss Kitty was obliged to push her lover to the front landing before she could disappear by the back stairs But once in the street Barker no longer lingered It was a good three miles back to the Gulch he might still reach it by the time his partners were taking their noonday rest and he resolved that although the messenger had preceded him they would not enter upon the new claim until the afternoon For Barker in spite of his mistress s injunction had no idea of taking what he couldn t pay for he would keep the claim intact until something could be settled For the rest he walked on air Kitty loved him The accursed wealth no longer stood between them They were both poor now everything was possible The sun was beginning to send dwarf shadows toward the east when he reached the Gulch Here a new trepidation seized him How would his partners receive the news of his utter failure HE was happy for he had gained Kitty through it But they For a moment it seemed to him that he had purchased his happiness through their loss He stopped took off his hat and ran his fingers remorsefully through his damp curls Another thing troubled him He had reached the crest of the Gulch where their old working ground was spread before him like a map They were not there neither were they lying under the four pines on the ridge where they were wont to rest at midday He turned with some alarm to the new claim adjoining theirs but there was no sign of them there either A sudden fear that they had after parting from him given up the claim in a fit of disgust and depression and departed now overcame him He clapped his hand on his head and ran in the direction of the cabin He had nearly reached it when the rough challenge of Who s there from the bushes halted him and Demorest suddenly swung into the trail But the singular look of sternness and impatience which he was wearing vanished as he saw Barker and with a loud shout of All right it s only Barker Hooray he ran toward him In an instant he was joined by Stacy from the cabin and the two men catching hold of their returning partner waltzed him joyfully and breathlessly into the cabin But the quick eyed Demorest suddenly let go his hold and stared at Barker s face Why Barker old boy what s up Everything s up gasped the breathless Barker It s all up about these stocks It s all a mistake all an infernal lie of that newspaper I never had the right kind of shares The ones I have are worthless rags and the next instant he had blurted out his whole interview with the bank manager The two partners looked at each other and then to Barker s infinite perplexity the same extraordinary convulsion that had seized Miss Kitty fell upon them They laughed holding on each other s shoulders they laughed clinging to Barker s struggling figure they went out and laughed with their backs against a tree They laughed separately and in different corners And then they came up to Barker with tears in their eyes dropped their heads on his shoulder and murmured exhaustedly You blessed ass But said Stacy suddenly how did you manage to buy the claim Ah that s the most awful thing boys I ve NEVER PAID FOR IT groaned Barker But Carter sent us the bill of sale persisted Demorest or we shouldn t have taken it I gave my promissory note at thirty days said Barker desperately and where s the money to come from now But he added wildly as the men glanced at each other you said taken it Good heavens you don t mean to say that I m TOO late that you ve you ve touched it I reckon that s pretty much what we HAVE been doing drawled Demorest It looks uncommonly like it drawled Stacy Barker glanced blankly from the one to the other Shall we pass our young friend in to see the show said Demorest to Stacy Yes if he ll be perfectly quiet and not breathe on the glasses returned Stacy They each gravely took one of Barker s hands and led him to the corner of the cabin There on an old flour barrel stood a large tin prospecting pan in which the partners also occasionally used to knead their bread A dirty towel covered it Demorest whisked it dexterously aside and disclosed three large fragments of decomposed gold and quartz Barker started back Heft it said Demorest grimly Barker could scarcely lift the pan Four thousand dollars weight if a penny said Stacy in short staccato sentences In a pocket Brought it out the second stroke of the pick We d been awfully blue after you left Awfully blue too when that bill of sale came for we thought you d been wasting your money on US Reckoned we oughtn t to take it but send it straight back to you Messenger gone Then Demorest reckoned as it was done it couldn t be undone and we ought to make just one prospect on the claim and strike a single stroke for you And there it is And there s more on the hillside But it isn t MINE It isn t YOURS It s Carter s I never had the money to pay for it and I haven t got it now But you gave the note and it is not due for thirty days A recollection flashed upon Barker Yes he said with thoughtful simplicity that s what Kitty said Oh Kitty said so said both partners gravely Yes stammered Barker turning away with a heightened color and as I didn t stay there to luncheon I think I d better be getting it ready He picked up the coffeepot and turned to the hearth as his two partners stepped beyond the door Wasn t it exactly like him said Demorest Him all over said Stacy And his worry over that note said Demorest And what Kitty said said Stacy Look here I reckon that wasn t ALL that Kitty said Of course not What luck A YELLOW DOG I never knew why in the Western States of America a yellow dog should be proverbially considered the acme of canine degradation and incompetency nor why the possession of one should seriously affect the social standing of its possessor But the fact being established I think we accepted it at Rattlers Ridge without question The matter of ownership was more difficult to settle and although the dog I have in my mind at the present writing attached himself impartially and equally to everyone in camp no one ventured to exclusively claim him while after the perpetration of any canine atrocity everybody repudiated him with indecent haste Well I can swear he hasn t been near our shanty for weeks or the retort He was last seen comin out of YOUR cabin expressed the eagerness with which Rattlers Ridge washed its hands of any responsibility Yet he was by no means a common dog nor even an unhandsome dog and it was a singular fact that his severest critics vied with each other in narrating instances of his sagacity insight and agility which they themselves had witnessed He had been seen crossing the flume that spanned Grizzly Canyon at a height of nine hundred feet on a plank six inches wide He had tumbled down the shoot to the South Fork a thousand feet below and was found sitting on the riverbank without a scratch cept that he was lazily givin himself with his off hind paw He had been forgotten in a snowdrift on a Sierran shelf and had come home in the early spring with the conceited complacency of an Alpine traveler and a plumpness alleged to have been the result of an exclusive diet of buried mail bags and their contents He was generally believed to read the advance election posters and disappear a day or two before the candidates and the brass band which he hated came to the Ridge He was suspected of having overlooked Colonel Johnson s hand at poker and of having conveyed to the Colonel s adversary by a succession of barks the danger of betting against four kings While these statements were supplied by wholly unsupported witnesses it was a very human weakness of Rattlers Ridge that the responsibility of corroboration was passed to the dog himself and HE was looked upon as a consummate liar Snoopin round yere and CALLIN yourself a poker sharp are ye Scoot you yaller pizin was a common adjuration whenever the unfortunate animal intruded upon a card party Ef thar was a spark an ATOM of truth in THAT DOG I d believe my own eyes that I saw him sittin up and trying to magnetize a jay bird off a tree But wot are ye goin to do with a yaller equivocator like that I have said that he was yellow or to use the ordinary expression yaller Indeed I am inclined to believe that much of the ignominy attached to the epithet lay in this favorite pronunciation Men who habitually spoke of a YELLOW bird a YELLOW hammer a YELLOW leaf always alluded to him as a YALLER dog He certainly WAS yellow After a bath usually compulsory he presented a decided gamboge streak down his back from the top of his forehead to the stump of his tail fading in his sides and flank to a delicate straw color His breast legs and feet when not reddened by slumgullion in which he was fond of wading were white A few attempts at ornamental decoration from the India ink pot of the storekeeper failed partly through the yellow dog s excessive agility which would never give the paint time to dry on him and partly through his success in transferring his markings to the trousers and blankets of the camp The size and shape of his tail which had been cut off before his introduction to Rattlers Ridge were favorite sources of speculation to the miners as determining both his breed and his moral responsibility in coming into camp in that defective condition There was a general opinion that he couldn t have looked worse with a tail and its removal was therefore a gratuitous effrontery His best feature was his eyes which were a lustrous Vandyke brown and sparkling with intelligence but here again he suffered from evolution through environment and their original trustful openness was marred by the experience of watching for flying stones sods and passing kicks from the rear so that the pupils were continually reverting to the outer angle of the eyelid Nevertheless none of these characteristics decided the vexed question of his BREED His speed and scent pointed to a hound and it is related that on one occasion he was laid on the trail of a wildcat with such success that he followed it apparently out of the State returning at the end of two weeks footsore but blandly contented Attaching himself to a prospecting party he was sent under the same belief into the brush to drive off a bear who was supposed to be haunting the campfire He returned in a few minutes WITH the bear DRIVING IT INTO the unarmed circle and scattering the whole party After this the theory of his being a hunting dog was abandoned Yet it was said on the usual uncorroborated evidence that he had put up a quail and his qualities as a retriever were for a long time accepted until during a shooting expedition for wild ducks it was discovered that the one he had brought back had never been shot and the party were obliged to compound damages with an adjacent settler His fondness for paddling in the ditches and slumgullion at one time suggested a water spaniel He could swim and would occasionally bring out of the river sticks and pieces of bark that had been thrown in but as HE always had to be thrown in with them and was a good sized dog his aquatic reputation faded also He remained simply a yaller dog What more could be said His actual name was Bones given to him no doubt through the provincial custom of confounding the occupation of the individual with his quality for which it was pointed out precedent could be found in some old English family names But if Bones generally exhibited no preference for any particular individual in camp he always made an exception in favor of drunkards Even an ordinary roistering bacchanalian party brought him out from under a tree or a shed in the keenest satisfaction He would accompany them through the long straggling street of the settlement barking his delight at every step or misstep of the revelers and exhibiting none of that mistrust of eye which marked his attendance upon the sane and the respectable He accepted even their uncouth play without a snarl or a yelp hypocritically pretending even to like it and I conscientiously believe would have allowed a tin can to be attached to his tail if the hand that tied it on were only unsteady and the voice that bade him lie still were husky with liquor He would see the party cheerfully into a saloon wait outside the door his tongue fairly lolling from his mouth in enjoyment until they reappeared permit them even to tumble over him with pleasure and then gambol away before them heedless of awkwardly projected stones and epithets He would afterward accompany them separately home or lie with them at crossroads until they were assisted to their cabins Then he would trot rakishly to his own haunt by the saloon stove with the slightly conscious air of having been a bad dog yet of having had a good time We never could satisfy ourselves whether his enjoyment arose from some merely selfish conviction that he was more SECURE with the physically and mentally incompetent from some active sympathy with active wickedness or from a grim sense of his own mental superiority at such moments But the general belief leant toward his kindred sympathy as a yaller dog with all that was disreputable And this was supported by another very singular canine manifestation the sincere flattery of simulation or imitation Uncle Billy Riley for a short time enjoyed the position of being the camp drunkard and at once became an object of Bones greatest solicitude He not only accompanied him everywhere curled at his feet or head according to Uncle Billy s attitude at the moment but it was noticed began presently to undergo a singular alteration in his own habits and appearance From being an active tireless scout and forager a bold and unovertakable marauder he became lazy and apathetic allowed gophers to burrow under him without endeavoring to undermine the settlement in his frantic endeavors to dig them out permitted squirrels to flash their tails at him a hundred yards away forgot his usual caches and left his favorite bones unburied and bleaching in the sun His eyes grew dull his coat lusterless in proportion as his companion became blear eyed and ragged in running his usual arrowlike directness began to deviate and it was not unusual to meet the pair together zigzagging up the hill Indeed Uncle Billy s condition could be predetermined by Bones appearance at times when his temporary master was invisible The old man must have an awful jag on today was casually remarked when an extra fluffiness and imbecility was noticeable in the passing Bones At first it was believed that he drank also but when careful investigation proved this hypothesis untenable he was freely called a derned time servin yaller hypocrite Not a few advanced the opinion that if Bones did not actually lead Uncle Billy astray he at least slavered him over and coddled him until the old man got conceited in his wickedness This undoubtedly led to a compulsory divorce between them and Uncle Billy was happily dispatched to a neighboring town and a doctor Bones seemed to miss him greatly ran away for two days and was supposed to have visited him to have been shocked at his convalescence and to have been cut by Uncle Billy in his reformed character and he returned to his old active life again and buried his past with his forgotten bones It was said that he was afterward detected in trying to lead an intoxicated tramp into camp after the methods employed by a blind man s dog but was discovered in time by the of course uncorroborated narrator I should be tempted to leave him thus in his original and picturesque sin but the same veracity which compelled me to transcribe his faults and iniquities obliges me to describe his ultimate and somewhat monotonous reformation which came from no fault of his own It was a joyous day at Rattlers Ridge that was equally the advent of his change of heart and the first stagecoach that had been induced to diverge from the highroad and stop regularly at our settlement Flags were flying from the post office and Polka saloon and Bones was flying before the brass band that he detested when the sweetest girl in the county Pinkey Preston daughter of the county judge and hopelessly beloved by all Rattlers Ridge stepped from the coach which she had glorified by occupying as an invited guest What makes him run away she asked quickly opening her lovely eyes in a possibly innocent wonder that anything could be found to run away from her He don t like the brass band we explained eagerly How funny murmured the girl is it as out of tune as all that This irresistible witticism alone would have been enough to satisfy us we did nothing but repeat it to each other all the next day but we were positively transported when we saw her suddenly gather her dainty skirts in one hand and trip off through the red dust toward Bones who with his eyes over his yellow shoulder had halted in the road and half turned in mingled disgust and rage at the spectacle of the descending trombone We held our breath as she approached him Would Bones evade her as he did us at such moments or would he save our reputation and consent for the moment to accept her as a new kind of inebriate She came nearer he saw her he began to slowly quiver with excitement his stump of a tail vibrating with such rapidity that the loss of the missing portion was scarcely noticeable Suddenly she stopped before him took his yellow head between her little hands lifted it and looked down in his handsome brown eyes with her two lovely blue ones What passed between them in that magnetic glance no one ever knew She returned with him said to him casually We re not afraid of brass bands are we to which he apparently acquiesced at least stifling his disgust of them while he was near her which was nearly all the time During the speechmaking her gloved hand and his yellow head were always near together and at the crowning ceremony her public checking of Yuba Bill s waybill on behalf of the township with a gold pencil presented to her by the Stage Company Bones joy far from knowing no bounds seemed to know nothing but them and he witnessed it apparently in the air No one dared to interfere For the first time a local pride in Bones sprang up in our hearts and we lied to each other in his praises openly and shamelessly Then the time came for parting We were standing by the door of the coach hats in hand as Miss Pinkey was about to step into it Bones was waiting by her side confidently looking into the interior and apparently selecting his own seat on the lap of Judge Preston in the corner when Miss Pinkey held up the sweetest of admonitory fingers Then taking his head between her two hands she again looked into his brimming eyes and said simply GOOD dog with the gentlest of emphasis on the adjective and popped into the coach The six bay horses started as one the gorgeous green and gold vehicle bounded forward the red dust rose behind and the yellow dog danced in and out of it to the very outskirts of the settlement And then he soberly returned A day or two later he was missed but the fact was afterward known that he was at Spring Valley the county town where Miss Preston lived and he was forgiven A week afterward he was missed again but this time for a longer period and then a pathetic letter arrived from Sacramento for the storekeeper s wife Would you mind wrote Miss Pinkey Preston asking some of your boys to come over here to Sacramento and bring back Bones I don t mind having the dear dog walk out with me at Spring Valley where everyone knows me but here he DOES make one so noticeable on account of HIS COLOR I ve got scarcely a frock that he agrees with He don t go with my pink muslin and that lovely buff tint he makes three shades lighter You know yellow is SO trying A consultation was quickly held by the whole settlement and a deputation sent to Sacramento to relieve the unfortunate girl We were all quite indignant with Bones but oddly enough I think it was greatly tempered with our new pride in him While he was with us alone his peculiarities had been scarcely appreciated but the recurrent phrase that yellow dog that they keep at the Rattlers gave us a mysterious importance along the countryside as if we had secured a mascot in some zoological curiosity This was further indicated by a singular occurrence A new church had been built at the crossroads and an eminent divine had come from San Francisco to preach the opening sermon After a careful examination of the camp s wardrobe and some felicitous exchange of apparel a few of us were deputed to represent Rattlers at the Sunday service In our white ducks straw hats and flannel blouses we were sufficiently picturesque and distinctive as honest miners to be shown off in one of the front pews Seated near the prettiest girls who offered us their hymn books in the cleanly odor of fresh pine shavings and ironed muslin and blown over by the spices of our own woods through the open windows a deep sense of the abiding peace of Christian communion settled upon us At this supreme moment someone murmured in an awe stricken whisper WILL you look at Bones We looked Bones had entered the church and gone up in the gallery through a pardonable ignorance and modesty but perceiving his mistake was now calmly walking along the gallery rail before the astounded worshipers Reaching the end he paused for a moment and carelessly looked down It was about fifteen feet to the floor below the simplest jump in the world for the mountain bred Bones Daintily gingerly lazily and yet with a conceited airiness of manner as if humanly speaking he had one leg in his pocket and were doing it on three he cleared the distance dropping just in front of the chancel without a sound turned himself around three times and then lay comfortably down Three deacons were instantly in the aisle coming up before the eminent divine who we fancied wore a restrained smile We heard the hurried whispers Belongs to them Quite a local institution here you know Don t like to offend sensibilities and the minister s prompt By no means as he went on with his service A short month ago we would have repudiated Bones today we sat there in slightly supercilious attitudes as if to indicate that any affront offered to Bones would be an insult to ourselves and followed by our instantaneous withdrawal in a body All went well however until the minister lifting the large Bible from the communion table and holding it in both hands before him walked toward a reading stand by the altar rails Bones uttered a distinct growl The minister stopped We and we alone comprehended in a flash the whole situation The Bible was nearly the size and shape of one of those soft clods of sod which we were in the playful habit of launching at Bones when he lay half asleep in the sun in order to see him cleverly evade it We held our breath What was to be done But the opportunity belonged to our leader Jeff Briggs a confoundedly good looking fellow with the golden mustache of a northern viking and the curls of an Apollo Secure in his beauty and bland in his self conceit he rose from the pew and stepped before the chancel rails I would wait a moment if I were you sir he said respectfully and you will see that he will go out quietly What is wrong whispered the minister in some concern He thinks you are going to heave that book at him sir without giving him a fair show as we do The minister looked perplexed but remained motionless with the book in his hands Bones arose walked halfway down the aisle and vanished like a yellow flash With this justification of his reputation Bones disappeared for a week At the end of that time we received a polite note from Judge Preston saying that the dog had become quite domiciled in their house and begged that the camp without yielding up their valuable PROPERTY in him would allow him to remain at Spring Valley for an indefinite time that both the judge and his daughter with whom Bones was already an old friend would be glad if the members of the camp would visit their old favorite whenever they desired to assure themselves that he was well cared for I am afraid that the bait thus ingenuously thrown out had a good deal to do with our ultimate yielding However the reports of those who visited Bones were wonderful and marvelous He was residing there in state lying on rugs in the drawing room coiled up under the judicial desk in the judge s study sleeping regularly on the mat outside Miss Pinkey s bedroom door or lazily snapping at flies on the judge s lawn He s as yaller as ever said one of our informants but it don t somehow seem to be the same back that we used to break clods over in the old time just to see him scoot out of the dust And now I must record a fact which I am aware all lovers of dogs will indignantly deny and which will be furiously bayed at by every faithful hound since the days of Ulysses Bones not only FORGOT but absolutely CUT US Those who called upon the judge in store clothes he would perhaps casually notice but he would sniff at them as if detecting and resenting them under their superficial exterior The rest he simply paid no attention to The more familiar term of Bonesy formerly applied to him as in our rare moments of endearment produced no response This pained I think some of the more youthful of us but through some strange human weakness it also increased the camp s respect for him Nevertheless we spoke of him familiarly to strangers at the very moment he ignored us I am afraid that we also took some pains to point out that he was getting fat and unwieldy and losing his elasticity implying covertly that his choice was a mistake and his life a failure A year after he died in the odor of sanctity and respectability being found one morning coiled up and stiff on the mat outside Miss Pinkey s door When the news was conveyed to us we asked permission the camp being in a prosperous condition to erect a stone over his grave But when it came to the inscription we could only think of the two words murmured to him by Miss Pinkey which we always believe effected his conversion GOOD Dog A MOTHER OF FIVE She was a mother and a rather exemplary one of five children although her own age was barely nine Two of these children were twins and she generally alluded to them as mister Amplach s children referring to an exceedingly respectable gentleman in the next settlement who I have reason to believe had never set eyes on her or them The twins were quite naturally alike having been in a previous state of existence two ninepins and were still somewhat vague and inchoate below their low shoulders in their long clothes but were also firm and globular about the head and there were not wanting those who professed to see in this an unmistakable resemblance to their reputed father The other children were dolls of different ages sex and condition but the twins may be said to have been distinctly her own conception Yet such was her admirable and impartial maternity that she never made any difference between them The Amplach s children was a description rather than a distinction She was herself the motherless child of Robert Foulkes a hardworking but somewhat improvident teamster on the Express Route between Big Bend and Reno His daily avocation when she was not actually with him in the wagon led to an occasional dispersion of herself and her progeny along the road and at wayside stations between those places But the family was generally collected together by rough but kindly hands already familiar with the handling of her children I have a very vivid recollection of Jim Carter trampling into a saloon after a five mile walk through a snowdrift with an Amplach twin in his pocket Suthin ought to be done he growled to make Meary a little more careful o them Amplach children I picked up one outer the snow a mile beyond Big Bend God bless my soul said a casual passenger looking up hastily I didn t know mister Amplach was married Jim winked diabolically at us over his glass No more did I he responded gloomily but you can t tell anything about the ways o them respectable psalm singing jay birds Having thus disposed of Amplach s character later on when he was alone with Mary or Meary as she chose to pronounce it the rascal worked upon her feelings with an account of the infant Amplach s sufferings in the snowdrift and its agonized whisperings for Meary Meary until real tears stood in Mary s blue eyes Let this be a lesson to you he concluded drawing the ninepin dexterously from his pocket for it took nigh a quart of the best forty rod whisky to bring that child to Not only did Mary firmly believe him but for weeks afterwards Julian Amplach this unhappy twin was kept in a somnolent attitude in the cart and was believed to have contracted dissipated habits from the effects of his heroic treatment Her numerous family was achieved in only two years and succeeded her first child which was brought from Sacramento at considerable expense by a mister William Dodd also a teamster on her seventh birthday This by one of those rare inventions known only to a child s vocabulary she at once called Misery probably a combination of Missy as she herself was formerly termed by strangers and Missouri her native State It was an excessively large doll at first mister Dodd wishing to get the worth of his money but time and perhaps an excess of maternal care remedied the defect and it lost flesh and certain unemployed parts of its limbs very rapidly It was further reduced in bulk by falling under the wagon and having the whole train pass over it but singularly enough its greatest attenuation was in the head and shoulders the complexion peeling off as a solid layer followed by the disappearance of distinct strata of its extraordinary composition This continued until the head and shoulders were much too small for even its reduced frame and all the devices of childish millinery a shawl secured with tacks and well hammered in and a hat which tilted backward and forward and never appeared at the same angle failed to restore symmetry Until one dreadful morning after an imprudent bath the whole upper structure disappeared leaving two hideous iron prongs standing erect from the spinal column Even an imaginative child like Mary could not accept this sort of thing as a head Later in the day Jack Roper the blacksmith at the Crossing was concerned at the plaintive appearance before his forge of a little girl clad in a bright blue pinafore of the same color as her eyes carrying her monstrous offspring in her arms Jack recognized her and instantly divined the situation You haven t he suggested kindly got another head at home suthin left over Mary shook her head sadly even her prolific maternity was not equal to the creation of children in detail Nor anythin like a head he persisted sympathetically Mary s loving eyes filled with tears No nuffen You couldn t he continued thoughtfully use her the other side up we might get a fine pair o legs outer them irons he added touching the two prongs with artistic suggestion Now look here he was about to tilt the doll over when a small cry of feminine distress and a swift movement of a matronly little arm arrested the evident indiscretion I see he said gravely Well you come here tomorrow and we ll fix up suthin to work her Jack was thoughtful the rest of the day more than usually impatient with certain stubborn mules to be shod and even knocked off work an hour earlier to walk to Big Bend and a rival shop But the next morning when the trustful and anxious mother appeared at the forge she uttered a scream of delight Jack had neatly joined a hollow iron globe taken from the newel post of some old iron staircase railing to the two prongs and covered it with a coat of red fireproof paint It was true that its complexion was rather high that it was inclined to be top heavy and that in the long run the other dolls suffered considerably by enforced association with this unyielding and implacable head and shoulders but this did not diminish Mary s joy over her restored first born Even its utter absence of features was no defect in a family where features were as evanescent as in hers and the most ordinary student of evolution could see that the Amplach ninepins were in legitimate succession to the globular headed Misery For a time I think that Mary even preferred her to the others Howbeit it was a pretty sight to see her on a summer afternoon sitting upon a wayside stump her other children dutifully ranged around her and the hard unfeeling head of Misery pressed deep down into her loving little heart as she swayed from side to side crooning her plaintive lullaby Small wonder that the bees took up the song and droned a slumberous accompaniment or that high above her head the enormous pines stirred through their depths by the soft Sierran air or Heaven knows what let slip flickering lights and shadows to play over that cast iron face until the child looking down upon it with the quick transforming power of love thought that it smiled The two remaining members of the family were less distinctive Gloriana pronounced as two words Glory Anna being the work of her father who also named it was simply a cylindrical roll of canvas wagon covering girt so as to define a neck and waist with a rudely inked face altogether a weak pitiable manlike invention and Johnny Dear alleged to be the representative of John Doremus a young storekeeper who occasionally supplied Mary with gratuitous sweets Mary never admitted this and as we were all gentlemen along that road we were blind to the suggestion Johnny Dear was originally a small plaster phrenological cast of a head and bust begged from some shop window in the county town with a body clearly constructed by Mary herself It was an ominous fact that it was always dressed as a BOY and was distinctly the most HUMAN looking of all her progeny Indeed in spite of the faculties that were legibly printed all over its smooth white hairless head it was appallingly lifelike Left sometimes by Mary astride of the branch of a wayside tree horsemen had been known to dismount hurriedly and examine it returning with a mystified smile and it was on record that Yuba Bill had once pulled up the Pioneer Coach at the request of curious and imploring passengers and then grimly installed Johnny Dear beside him on the box seat publicly delivering him to Mary at Big Bend to her wide eyed confusion and the first blush we had ever seen on her round chubby sunburnt cheeks It may seem strange that with her great popularity and her well known maternal instincts she had not been kept fully supplied with proper and more conventional dolls but it was soon recognized that she did not care for them left their waxen faces rolling eyes and abundant hair in ditches or stripped them to help clothe the more extravagant creatures of her fancy So it came that Johnny Dear s strictly classical profile looked out from under a girl s fashionable straw sailor hat to the utter obliteration of his prominent intellectual faculties the Amplach twins wore bonnets on their ninepins heads and even an attempt was made to fit a flaxen scalp on the iron headed Misery But her dolls were always a creation of her own her affection for them increasing with the demand upon her imagination This may seem somewhat inconsistent with her habit of occasionally abandoning them in the woods or in the ditches But she had an unbounded confidence in the kindly maternity of Nature and trusted her children to the breast of the Great Mother as freely as she did herself in her own motherlessness And this confidence was rarely betrayed Rats mice snails wildcats panther and bear never touched her lost waifs Even the elements were kindly an Amplach twin buried under a snowdrift in high altitudes reappeared smilingly in the spring in all its wooden and painted integrity We were all Pantheists then and believed this implicitly It was only when exposed to the milder forces of civilization that Mary had anything to fear Yet even then when Patsy O Connor s domestic goat had once tried to sample the lost Misery he had retreated with the loss of three front teeth and Thompson s mule came out of an encounter with that iron headed prodigy with a sprained hind leg and a cut and swollen pastern But these were the simple Arcadian days of the road between Big Bend and Reno and progress and prosperity alas brought changes in their wake It was already whispered that Mary ought to be going to school and mister Amplach still happily oblivious of the liberties taken with his name as trustee of the public school at Duckville had intimated that Mary s bohemian wanderings were a scandal to the county She was growing up in ignorance a dreadful ignorance of everything but the chivalry the deep tenderness the delicacy and unselfishness of the rude men around her and obliviousness of faith in anything but the immeasurable bounty of Nature toward her and her children Of course there was a fierce discussion between the boys of the road and the few married families of the settlement on this point but of course progress and snivelization as the boys chose to call it triumphed The projection of a railroad settled it Robert Foulkes promoted to a foremanship of a division of the line was made to understand that his daughter must be educated But the terrible question of Mary s family remained No school would open its doors to that heterogeneous collection and Mary s little heart would have broken over the rude dispersal or heroic burning of her children The ingenuity of Jack Roper suggested a compromise She was allowed to select one to take to school with her the others were ADOPTED by certain of her friends and she was to be permitted to visit them every Saturday afternoon The selection was a cruel trial so cruel that knowing her undoubted preference for her firstborn Misery we would not have interfered for worlds but in her unexpected choice of Johnny Dear the most unworldly of us knew that it was the first glimmering of feminine tact her first submission to the world of propriety that she was now entering Johnny Dear was undoubtedly the most presentable even more there was an educational suggestion in its prominent mapped out phrenological organs The adopted fathers were loyal to their trust Indeed for years afterward the blacksmith kept the iron headed Misery on a rude shelf like a shrine near his bunk nobody but himself and Mary ever knew the secret stolen and thrilling interviews that took place during the first days of their separation Certain facts however transpired concerning Mary s equal faithfulness to another of her children It is said that one Saturday afternoon when the road manager of the new line was seated in his office at Reno in private business discussion with two directors a gentle tap was heard at the door It was opened to an eager little face a pair of blue eyes and a blue pinafore To the astonishment of the directors a change came over the face of the manager Taking the child gently by the hand he walked to his desk on which the papers of the new line were scattered and drew open a drawer from which he took a large ninepin extraordinarily dressed as a doll The astonishment of the two gentlemen was increased at the following quaint colloquy between the manager and the child She s doing remarkably well in spite of the trying weather but I have had to keep her very quiet said the manager regarding the ninepin critically Ess said Mary quickly It s just the same with Johnny Dear his cough is f ightful at nights But Misery s all right I ve just been to see her There s a good deal of scarlet fever around continued the manager with quiet concern and we can t be too careful But I shall take her for a little run down the line tomorrow The eyes of Mary sparkled and overflowed like blue water Then there was a kiss a little laugh a shy glance at the two curious strangers the blue pinafore fluttered away and the colloquy ended She was equally attentive in her care of the others but the rag baby Gloriana who had found a home in Jim Carter s cabin at the Ridge living too far for daily visits was brought down regularly on Saturday afternoon to Mary s house by Jim tucked in asleep in his saddle bags or riding gallantly before him on the horn of his saddle On Sunday there was a dress parade of all the dolls which kept Mary in heart for the next week s desolation But there came one Saturday and Sunday when Mary did not appear and it was known along the road that she had been called to San Francisco to meet an aunt who had just arrived from the States It was a vacant Sunday to the boys a very hollow unsanctified Sunday somehow without that little figure But the next Sunday and the next were still worse and then it was known that the dreadful aunt was making much of Mary and was sending her to a grand school a convent at Santa Clara where it was rumored girls were turned out so accomplished that their own parents did not know them But WE knew that was impossible to our Mary and a letter which came from her at the end of the month and before the convent had closed upon the blue pinafore satisfied us and was balm to our anxious hearts It was characteristic of Mary it was addressed to nobody in particular and would but for the prudence of the aunt have been entrusted to the post office open and undirected It was a single sheet handed to us without a word by her father but as we passed it from hand to hand we understood it as if we had heard our lost playfellow s voice Ther s more houses in Frisco than you kin shake a stick at and wimmens till you kant rest but mules and jakasses ain t got no sho nor blacksmiffs shops wich is not to be seen no wear Rapits and Skwirls also bares and panfers is on noun and unforgotten on account of the streets and Sunday skoles Jim Roper you orter be very good to Mizzery on a kount of my not bein here and not harten your hart to her bekos she is top heavy which is ontroo and simply an imptient lie like you allus make I have a kinary bird wot sings deliteful but isn t a yellerhamer sutch as I know as you d think Dear Mister Montgommery don t keep Gulan Amplak to mutch shet up in office drors it isn t good for his lungs and chest And don t you ink his head nother youre as bad as the rest Johnny Dear you must be very kind to your attopted father and you Glory Anna must lov your kind Jimmy Carter verry mutch for taking you hossback so offen I has been buggy ridin with an orficer who has killed injuns real I am comin back soon with grate affeckshun so luke out and mind But it was three years before she returned and this was her last and only letter The adopted fathers of her children were faithful however and when the new line was opened and it was understood that she was to be present with her father at the ceremony they came with a common understanding to the station to meet their old playmate They were ranged along the platform poor Jack Roper a little overweighted with a bundle he was carrying on his left arm And then a young girl in the freshness of her teens and the spotless purity of a muslin frock that although brief in skirt was perfect in fit faultlessly booted and gloved tripped from the train and offered a delicate hand in turn to each of her old friends Nothing could be prettier than the smile on the cheeks that were no longer sunburnt nothing could be clearer than the blue eyes lifted frankly to theirs And yet as she gracefully turned away with her father the faces of the four adopted parents were found to be as red and embarrassed as her own on the day that Yuba Bill drove up publicly with Johnny Dear on the box seat You weren t such a fool said Jack Montgomery to Roper as to bring Misery here with you I was said Roper with a constrained laugh and you He had just caught sight of the head of a ninepin peeping from the manager s pocket The man laughed and then the four turned silently away Mary had indeed come back to them but not The Mother of Five BULGER S REPUTATION We all remembered very distinctly Bulger s advent in Rattlesnake Camp It was during the rainy season a season singularly inducive to settled reflective impressions as we sat and smoked around the stove in Mosby s grocery Like older and more civilized communities we had our periodic waves of sentiment and opinion with the exception that they were more evanescent with us and as we had just passed through a fortnight of dissipation and extravagance owing to a visit from some gamblers and speculators we were now undergoing a severe moral revulsion partly induced by reduced finances and partly by the arrival of two families with grownup daughters on the hill It was raining with occasional warm breaths through the open window of the southwest trades redolent of the saturated spices of the woods and springing grasses which perhaps were slightly inconsistent with the hot stove around which we had congregated But the stove was only an excuse for our listless gregarious gathering warmth and idleness went well together and it was currently accepted that we had caught from the particular reptile which gave its name to our camp much of its pathetic lifelong search for warmth and its habit of indolently basking in it A few of us still went through the affectation of attempting to dry our damp clothes by the stove and sizzling our wet boots against it but as the same individuals calmly permitted the rain to drive in upon them through the open window without moving and seemed to take infinite delight in the amount of steam they generated even that pretense dropped Crotalus himself with his tail in a muddy ditch and the sun striking cold fire from his slit eyes as he basked his head on a warm stone beside it could not have typified us better Percy Briggs took his pipe from his mouth at last and said with reflective severity Well gentlemen if we can t get the wagon road over here and if we re going to be left out by the stagecoach company we can at least straighten up the camp and not have it look like a cross between a tenement alley and a broken down circus I declare I was just sick when these two Baker girls started to make a short cut through the camp Darned if they didn t turn round and take to the woods and the rattlers again afore they got halfway And that benighted idiot Tom Rollins standin there in the ditch spattered all over with slumgullion til he looked like a spotted tarrypin wavin his fins and sashaying backwards and forrards and sayin This way ladies this way I didn t returned Tom Rollins quite casually without looking up from his steaming boots I didn t start in night afore last to dance The Green Corn Dance outer Hiawatha with feathers in my hair and a red blanket on my shoulders round that family s new potato patch in order that it might increase and multiply I didn t sing Sabbath Morning Bells with an anvil accompaniment until twelve o clock at night over at the Crossing so that they might dream of their Happy Childhood s Home It seems to me that it wasn t me did it I might be mistaken it was late but I have the impression that it wasn t me From the silence that followed this would seem to have been clearly a recent performance of the previous speaker who however responded quite cheerfully An evenin o simple childish gaiety don t count We ve got to start in again FAIR What we want here is to clear up and encourage decent immigration and get rid o gamblers and blatherskites that are makin this yer camp their happy hunting ground We don t want any more permiskus shootin We don t want any more paintin the town red We don t want any more swaggerin galoots ridin up to this grocery and emptyin their six shooters in the air afore they light We want to put a stop to it peacefully and without a row and we kin We ain t got no bullies of our own to fight back and they know it so they know they won t get no credit bullyin us they ll leave if we re only firm It s all along of our cussed fool good nature they see it amuses us and they ll keep it up as long as the whisky s free What we want to do is when the next man comes waltzin along A distant clatter from the rocky hillside here mingled with the puff of damp air through the window Looks as ef we might hev a show even now said Tom Rollins removing his feet from the stove as we all instinctively faced toward the window I reckon you re in with us in this Mosby said Briggs turning toward the proprietor of the grocery who had been leaning listlessly against the wall behind his bar Arter the man s had a fair show said Mosby cautiously He deprecated the prevailing condition of things but it was still an open question whether the families would prove as valuable customers as his present clients Everything in moderation gentlemen The sound of galloping hoofs came nearer now swishing in the soft mud of the highway until the unseen rider pulled up before the door There was no shouting however nor did he announce himself with the usual salvo of firearms But when after a singularly heavy tread and the jingle of spurs on the platform the door flew open to the newcomer he seemed a realization of our worst expectations Tall broad and muscular he carried in one hand a shotgun while from his hip dangled a heavy navy revolver His long hair unkempt but oiled swept a greasy circle around his shoulders his enormous mustache dripping with wet completely concealed his mouth His costume of fringed buckskin was wild and outre even for our frontier camp But what was more confirmative of our suspicions was that he was evidently in the habit of making an impression and after a distinct pause at the doorway with only a side glance at us he strode toward the bar As there don t seem to be no hotel hereabouts I reckon I kin put up my mustang here and have a shakedown somewhere behind that counter he said His voice seemed to have added to its natural depth the hoarseness of frequent overstraining Ye ain t got no bunk to spare you boys hev ye asked Mosby evasively glancing at Percy Briggs without looking at the stranger We all looked at Briggs also it was HIS affair after all HE had originated this opposition To our surprise he said nothing The stranger leaned heavily on the counter I was speaking to YOU he said with his eyes on Mosby and slightly accenting the pronoun with a tap of his revolver butt on the bar Ye don t seem to catch on Mosby smiled feebly and again cast an imploring glance at Briggs To our greater astonishment Briggs said quietly Why don t you answer the stranger Mosby Yes yes said Mosby suavely to the newcomer while an angry flush crossed his check as he recognized the position in which Briggs had placed him Of course you re welcome to what doings I hev here but I reckoned these gentlemen over there with a vicious glance at Briggs might fix ye up suthin better they re so pow ful kind to your sort The stranger threw down a gold piece on the counter and said Fork out your whisky then waited until his glass was filled took it in his hand and then drawing an empty chair to the stove sat down beside Briggs Seein as you re that kind he said placing his heavy hand on Briggs s knee mebbe ye kin tell me ef thar s a shanty or a cabin at Rattlesnake that I kin get for a couple o weeks I saw an empty one at the head o the hill You see gennelmen he added confidentially as he swept the drops of whisky from his long mustache with his fingers and glanced around our group I ve got some business over at Bigwood our nearest town but ez a place to stay AT it ain t my style What s the matter with Bigwood said Briggs abruptly It s too howlin too festive too rough thar s too much yellin and shootin goin day and night Thar s too many card sharps and gay gamboliers cavortin about the town to please me Too much permiskus soakin at the bar and free jimjams What I want is a quiet place what a man kin give his mind and elbow a rest from betwixt grippin his shootin irons and crookin in his whisky A sort o slow quiet easy place LIKE THIS We all stared at him Percy Briggs as fixedly as any But there was not the slightest trace of irony sarcasm or peculiar significance in his manner He went on slowly When I struck this yer camp a minit ago when I seed that thar ditch meanderin peaceful like through the street without a hotel or free saloon or express office on either side with the smoke just a curlin over the chimbley of that log shanty and the bresh just set fire to and a smolderin in that potato patch with a kind o old time stingin in your eyes and nose and a few women s duds just a flutterin on a line by the fence I says to myself Bulger this is peace This is wot you re lookin for Bulger this is wot you re wantin this is wot YOU LL HEV You say you ve business over at Bigwood What business said Briggs It s a peculiar business young fellow returned the stranger gravely Thar s different men ez has different opinions about it Some allows it s an easy business some allows it s a rough business some says it s a sad business others says it s gay and festive Some wonders ez how I ve got into it and others wonder how I ll ever get out of it It s a payin business it s a peaceful sort o business when left to itself It s a peculiar business a business that sort o b longs to me though I ain t got no patent from Washington for it It s MY OWN business He paused rose and saying Let s meander over and take a look at that empty cabin and ef she suits me why I ll plank down a slug for her on the spot and move in tomorrow walked towards the door I ll pick up suthin in the way o boxes and blankets from the grocery he added looking at Mosby and ef thar s a corner whar I kin stand my gun and a nail to hang up my revolver why I m all thar By this time we were no longer astonished when Briggs rose also and not only accompanied the sinister looking stranger to the empty cabin but assisted him in negotiating with its owner for a fortnight s occupancy Nevertheless we eagerly assailed Briggs on his return for some explanation of this singular change in his attitude toward the stranger He coolly reminded us however that while his intention of excluding ruffianly adventurers from the camp remained the same he had no right to go back on the stranger s sentiments which were evidently in accord with our own and although mister Bulger s appearance was inconsistent with them that was only an additional reason why we should substitute a mild firmness for that violence which we all deprecated but which might attend his abrupt dismissal We were all satisfied except Mosby who had not yet recovered from Briggs s change of front which he was pleased to call craw fishing Seemed to me his account of his business was extraordinary satisfactory Sorter filled the bill all round no mistake thar he suggested with a malicious irony I like a man that s outspoken I understood him very well said Briggs quietly In course you did Only when you ve settled in your MIND whether he was describing horse stealing or tract distributing mebbe you ll let ME know It would seem however that Briggs did not interrogate the stranger again regarding it nor did we who were quite content to leave matters in Briggs s hands Enough that mister Bulger moved into the empty cabin the next day and with the aid of a few old boxes from the grocery which he quickly extemporized into tables and chairs and the purchase of some necessary cooking utensils soon made himself at home The rest of the camp now thoroughly aroused made a point of leaving their work in the ditches whenever they could to stroll carelessly around Bulger s tenement in the vague hope of satisfying a curiosity that had become tormenting But they could not find that he was doing anything of a suspicious character except perhaps from the fact that it was not OUTWARDLY suspicious which I grieve to say did not lull them to security He seemed to be either fixing up his cabin or smoking in his doorway On the second day he checked this itinerant curiosity by taking the initiative himself and quietly walking from claim to claim and from cabin to cabin with a pacific but by no means a satisfying interest The shadow of his tall figure carrying his inseparable gun which had not yet apparently stood in the corner falling upon an excavated bank beside the delving miners gave them a sense of uneasiness they could not explain a few characteristic yells of boisterous hilarity from their noontide gathering under a cottonwood somehow ceased when mister Bulger was seen gravely approaching and his casual stopping before a poker party in the gulch actually caused one of the most reckless gamblers to weakly recede from a bluff and allow his adversary to sweep the board After this it was felt that matters were becoming serious There was no subsequent patrolling of the camp before the stranger s cabin Their curiosity was singularly abated A general feeling of repulsion kept within bounds partly by the absence of any overt act from Bulger and partly by an inconsistent over consciousness of his shotgun took its place But an unexpected occurrence revived it One evening as the usual social circle were drawn around Mosby s stove the lazy silence was broken by the familiar sounds of pistol shots and a series of more familiar shrieks and yells from the rocky hill road The circle quickly recognized the voices of their old friends the roisterers and gamblers from Sawyer s Dam they as quickly recognized the returning shouts here and there from a few companions who were welcoming them I grieve to say that in spite of their previous attitude of reformation a smile of gratified expectancy lit up the faces of the younger members and even the older ones glanced dubiously at Briggs Mosby made no attempt to conceal a sigh of relief as he carefully laid out an extra supply of glasses in his bar Suddenly the oncoming yells ceased the wild gallop of hoofs slackened into a trot and finally halted and even the responsive shouts of the camp stopped also We all looked vacantly at each other Mosby leaped over his counter and went to the door Briggs followed with the rest of us The night was dark and it was a few minutes before we could distinguish a straggling vague but silent procession moving through the moist heavy air on the hill But to our surprise it was moving away from us absolutely LEAVING the camp We were still staring in expectancy when out of the darkness slowly emerged a figure which we recognized at once as Captain Jim one of the most reckless members of our camp Pushing us back into the grocery he entered without a word closed the door behind him and threw himself vacantly into a chair We at once pressed around him He looked up at us dazedly drew a long breath and said slowly It s no use gentlemen Suthin s GOT to be done with that Bulger and mighty quick What s the matter we asked eagerly Matter he repeated passing his hand across his forehead Matter Look yere Ye all of you heard them boys from Sawyer s Dam coming over the hill Ye heard their music mebbe ye heard US join in the chorus Well on they came waltzing down the hill like old times and we waitin for em Then jest as they passed the old cabin who do you think they ran right into shooting iron long hair and mustache and all that standing there plump in the road why Bulger Well Well Whatever it was don t ask ME but dern my skin ef after a word or two from HIM them boys just stopped yellin turned round like lambs and rode away peaceful like along with him We ran after them a spell still yellin when that thar Bulger faced around said to us that he d come down here for quiet and ef he couldn t hev it he d have to leave with those gentlemen WHO WANTED IT too And I m gosh darned ef those GENTLEMEN you know em all Patsey Carpenter Snapshot Harry and the others ever said a darned word but kinder nodded So long and went away Our astonishment and mystification were complete and I regret to say the indignation of Captain Jim and Mosby equally so If we re going to be bossed by the first newcomer said the former gloomily I reckon we might as well take our chances with the Sawyer s Dam boys whom we know Ef we are going to hev the legitimate trade of Rattlesnake interfered with by the cranks of some hidin horse thief or retired road agent said Mosby we might as well invite the hull of Joaquin Murietta s gang here at once But I suppose this is part o Bulger s particular business he added with a withering glance at Briggs I understand it all said Briggs quietly You know I told you that bullies couldn t live in the same camp together That s human nature and that s how plain men like you and me manage to scud along without getting plugged You see Bulger wasn t going to hev any of his own kind jumpin his claim here And I reckon he was pow ful enough to back down Sawyer s Dam Anyhow the bluff told and here we are in peace and quietness Until he lets us know what is his little game sneered Mosby Nevertheless such is the force of mysterious power that although it was exercised against what we firmly believed was the independence of the camp it extorted a certain respect from us A few thought it was not a bad thing to have a professional bully and even took care to relate the discomfiture of the wicked youth of Sawyer s Dam for the benefit of a certain adjacent and powerful camp who had looked down upon us He himself returning the same evening from his self imposed escort vouchsafed no other reason than the one he had already given Preposterous as it seemed we were obliged to accept it and the still more preposterous inference that he had sought Rattlesnake Camp solely for the purpose of acquiring and securing its peace and quietness Certainly he had no other occupation the little work he did upon the tailings of the abandoned claim which went with his little cabin was scarcely a pretense He rode over on certain days to Bigwood on account of his business but no one had ever seen him there nor could the description of his manner and appearance evoke any information from the Bigwoodians It remained a mystery It had also been feared that the advent of Bulger would intensify that fear and dislike of riotous Rattlesnake which the two families had shown and which was the origin of Briggs s futile attempt at reformation But it was discovered that since his arrival the young girls had shown less timidity in entering the camp and had even exchanged some polite conversation and good humoured badinage with its younger and more impressible members Perhaps this tended to make these youths more observant for a few days later when the vexed question of Bulger s business was again under discussion one of them remarked gloomily I reckon there ain t no doubt WHAT he s here for The youthful prophet was instantly sat upon after the fashion of all elderly critics since Job s Nevertheless after a pause he was permitted to explain Only this morning when Lance Forester and me were chirping with them gals out on the hill who should we see hanging around in the bush but that cussed Bulger We allowed at first that it might be only a new style of his interferin so we took no notice except to pass a few remarks about listeners and that sort o thing and perhaps to bedevil the girls a little more than we d hev done if we d been alone Well they laughed and we laughed and that was the end of it But this afternoon as Lance and me were meandering down by their cabin we sorter turned into the woods to wait till they d come out Then all of a suddent Lance stopped as rigid as a pointer that s flushed somethin and says B gosh And thar under a big redwood sat that slimy hypocrite Bulger twisting his long mustaches and smiling like clockwork alongside o little Meely Baker you know her the pootiest of the two sisters and she smilin back on him Think of it that unknown unwashed longhaired tramp and bully who must be forty if a day and that innocent gal of sixteen It was simply disgustin I need not say that the older cynics and critics already alluded to at once improved the occasion What more could be expected Women the world over were noted for this sort of thing This long haired swaggering bully with his air of mystery had captivated them as he always had done since the days of Homer Simple merit which sat lowly in barrooms and conceived projects for the public good around the humble unostentatious stove was nowhere Youth could not too soon learn this bitter lesson And in this case youth too perhaps was right in its conjectures for this WAS no doubt the little game of the perfidious Bulger We recalled the fact that his unhallowed appearance in camp was almost coincident with the arrival of the two families We glanced at Briggs to our amazement for the first time he looked seriously concerned But Mosby in the meantime leaned his elbows lazily over the counter and in a slow voice added fuel to the flame I wouldn t hev spoken of it before he said with a sidelong glance at Briggs for it might be all in the line o Bulger s business but suthin happened the other night that for a minit got me I was passin the Bakers shanty and I heard one of them gals a singing a camp meeting hymn I don t calkilate to run agin you young fellers in any sparkin or canoodlin that s goin on but her voice sounded so pow ful soothin and pretty thet I jest stood there and listened Then the old woman old Mother Baker SHE joined in and I listened too And then dern my skin but a man s voice joined in jest belching outer that cabin and I sorter lifted myself up and kem away That voice gentlemen said Mosby lingering artistically as he took up a glass and professionally eyed it before wiping it with his towel that voice cumf bly fixed thar in thet cabin among them wimen folks was Bulger s Briggs got up with his eyes looking the darker for his flushed face Gentlemen he said huskily thar s only one thing to be done A lot of us have got to ride over to Sawyer s Dam tomorrow morning and pick up as many square men as we can muster there s a big camp meeting goin on there and there won t be no difficulty in that When we ve got a big enough crowd to show we mean business we must march back here and ride Bulger out of this camp I don t hanker arter Vigilance Committees as a rule it s a rough remedy it s like drinkin a quart o whisky agin rattlesnake poison but it s got to be done We don t mind being sold ourselves but when it comes to our standin by and seein the only innocent people in Rattlesnake given away we kick Bulger s got to be fired outer this camp And he will be But he was not For when the next morning a determined and thoughtful procession of the best and most characteristic citizens of Rattlesnake Camp filed into Sawyer s Dam they found that their mysterious friends had disappeared although they met with a fraternal but subdued welcome from the general camp But any approach to the subject of their visit however was received with a chilling dissapproval Did they not know that lawlessness of any kind even under the rude mantle of frontier justice was to be deprecated and scouted when a means of salvation a power of regeneration such as was now sweeping over Sawyer s Dam was at hand Could they not induce this man who was to be violently deported to accompany them willingly to Sawyer s Dam and subject himself to the powerful influence of the revival then in full swing The Rattlesnake boys laughed bitterly and described the man of whom they talked so lightly but in vain It s no use gentlemen said a more worldly bystander in a lower voice the camp meetin s got a strong grip here and betwixt you and me there ain t no wonder For the man that runs it the big preacher has got new ways and methods that fetches the boys every time He don t preach no cut and dried gospel he don t carry around no slop shop robes and clap em on you whether they fit or not but he samples and measures the camp afore he wades into it He scouts and examines he ain t no mere Sunday preacher with a comfortable house and once a week church but he gives up his days and nights to it and makes his family work with him and even sends em forward to explore the field And he ain t no white choker shadbelly either but fits himself like his gospel to the men he works among Ye ought to hear him afore you go His tent is just out your way I ll go with you Too dejected to offer any opposition and perhaps a little curious to see this man who had unwittingly frustrated their design of lynching Bulger they halted at the outer fringe of worshipers who packed the huge inclosure They had not time to indulge their cynicisms over this swaying mass of emotional half thinking and almost irresponsible beings nor to detect any similarity between THEIR extreme methods and the scheme of redemption they themselves were seeking for in a few moments apparently lifted to his feet on a wave of religious exultation the famous preacher arose The men of Rattlesnake gasped for breath It was Bulger But Briggs quickly recovered himself By what name said he turning passionately towards his guide does this man this impostor call himself here Baker Baker echoed the Rattlesnake contingent Baker repeated Lance Forester with a ghastly smile Yes returned their guide You oughter know it too For he sent his wife and daughters over after his usual style to sample your camp a week ago Come now what are you givin us IN THE TULES He had never seen a steamboat in his life Born and reared in one of the Western Territories far from a navigable river he had only known the dugout or canoe as a means of conveyance across the scant streams whose fordable waters made even those scarcely a necessity The long narrow hooded wagon drawn by swaying oxen known familiarly as a prairie schooner in which he journeyed across the plains to California in fifty three did not help his conception by that nautical figure And when at last he dropped upon the land of promise through one of the Southern mountain passes he halted all unconsciously upon the low banks of a great yellow river amidst a tangled brake of strange reed like grasses that were unknown to him The river broadening as it debouched through many channels into a lordly bay seemed to him the ULTIMA THULE of his journeyings Unyoking his oxen on the edge of the luxuriant meadows which blended with scarcely any line of demarcation into the great stream itself he found the prospect good according to his lights and prairial experiences and converting his halted wagon into a temporary cabin he resolved to rest here and settle There was little difficulty in so doing The cultivated clearings he had passed were few and far between the land would be his by discovery and occupation his habits of loneliness and self reliance made him independent of neighbors He took his first meal in his new solitude under a spreading willow but so near his natural boundary that the waters gurgled and oozed in the reeds but a few feet from him The sun sank deepening the gold of the river until it might have been the stream of Pactolus itself But Martin Morse had no imagination he was not even a gold seeker he had simply obeyed the roving instincts of the frontiersman in coming hither The land was virgin and unoccupied it was his he was alone These questions settled he smoked his pipe with less concern over his three thousand miles transference of habitation than the man of cities who had moved into a next street When the sun sank he rolled himself in his blankets in the wagon bed and went quietly to sleep But he was presently awakened by something which at first he could not determine to be a noise or an intangible sensation It was a deep throbbing through the silence of the night a pulsation that seemed even to be communicated to the rude bed whereon he lay As it came nearer it separated itself into a labored monotonous panting continuous but distinct from an equally monotonous but fainter beating of the waters as if the whole track of the river were being coursed and trodden by a multitude of swiftly trampling feet A strange feeling took possession of him half of fear half of curious expectation It was coming nearer He rose leaped hurriedly from the wagon and ran to the bank The night was dark at first he saw nothing before him but the steel black sky pierced with far spaced irregularly scattered stars Then there seemed to be approaching him from the left another and more symmetrical constellation a few red and blue stars high above the river with three compact lines of larger planetary lights flashing towards him and apparently on his own level It was almost upon him he involuntarily drew back as the strange phenomenon swept abreast of where he stood and resolved itself into a dark yet airy bulk whose vagueness topped by enormous towers was yet illuminated by those open squares of light that he had taken for stars but which he saw now were brilliantly lit windows Their vivid rays shot through the reeds and sent broad bands across the meadow the stationary wagon and the slumbering oxen But all this was nothing to the inner life they disclosed through lifted curtains and open blinds which was the crowning revelation of this strange and wonderful spectacle Elegantly dressed men and women moved through brilliantly lit and elaborately gilt saloons in one a banquet seemed to be spread served by white jacketed servants in another were men playing cards around marble topped tables in another the light flashed back again from the mirrors and glistening glasses and decanters of a gorgeous refreshment saloon in smaller openings there was the shy disclosure of dainty white curtains and velvet lounges of more intimate apartments Martin Morse stood enthralled and mystified It was as if some invisible Asmodeus had revealed to this simple frontiersman a world of which he had never dreamed It was THE world a world of which he knew nothing in his simple rustic habits and profound Western isolation sweeping by him with the rush of an unknown planet In another moment it was gone a shower of sparks shot up from one of the towers and fell all around him and then vanished even as he remembered the set piece of Fourth of July fireworks had vanished in his own rural town when he was a boy The darkness fell with it too But such was his utter absorption and breathless preoccupation that only a cold chill recalled him to himself and he found he was standing mid leg deep in the surge cast over the low banks by this passage of the first steamboat he had ever seen He waited for it the next night when it appeared a little later from the opposite direction on its return trip He watched it the next night and the next Hereafter he never missed it coming or going whatever the hard and weary preoccupations of his new and lonely life He felt he could not have slept without seeing it go by Oddly enough his interest and desire did not go further Even had he the time and money to spend in a passage on the boat and thus actively realize the great world of which he had only these rare glimpses a certain proud rustic shyness kept him from it It was not HIS world he could not affront the snubs that his ignorance and inexperience would have provoked and he was dimly conscious as so many of us are in our ignorance that in mingling with it he would simply lose the easy privileges of alien criticism For there was much that he did not understand and some things that grated upon his lonely independence One night a lighter one than those previous he lingered a little longer in the moonlight to watch the phosphorescent wake of the retreating boat Suddenly it struck him that there was a certain irregular splashing in the water quite different from the regular diagonally crossing surges that the boat swept upon the bank Looking at it more intently he saw a black object turning in the water like a porpoise and then the unmistakable uplifting of a black arm in an unskillful swimmer s overhand stroke It was a struggling man But it was quickly evident that the current was too strong and the turbulence of the shallow water too great for his efforts Without a moment s hesitation clad as he was in only his shirt and trousers Morse strode into the reeds and the next moment with a call of warning was swimming toward the now wildly struggling figure But from some unknown reason as Morse approached him nearer the man uttered some incoherent protest and desperately turned away throwing off Morse s extended arm Attributing this only to the vague convulsions of a drowning man Morse a skilled swimmer managed to clutch his shoulder and propelled him at arm s length still struggling apparently with as much reluctance as incapacity toward the bank As their feet touched the reeds and slimy bottom the man s resistance ceased and he lapsed quite listlessly in Morse s arms Half lifting half dragging his burden he succeeded at last in gaining the strip of meadow and deposited the unconscious man beneath the willow tree Then he ran to his wagon for whisky But to his surprise on his return the man was already sitting up and wringing the water from his clothes He then saw for the first time by the clear moonlight that the stranger was elegantly dressed and of striking appearance and was clearly a part of that bright and fascinating world which Morse had been contemplating in his solitude He eagerly took the proffered tin cup and drank the whisky Then he rose to his feet staggered a few steps forward and glanced curiously around him at the still motionless wagon the few felled trees and evidence of clearing and even at the rude cabin of logs and canvas just beginning to rise from the ground a few paces distant and said impatiently Where the devil am I Morse hesitated He was unable to name the locality of his dwelling place He answered briefly On the right bank of the Sacramento The stranger turned upon him a look of suspicion not unmingled with resentment Oh he said with ironical gravity and I suppose that this water you picked me out of was the Sacramento River Thank you Morse with slow Western patience explained that he had only settled there three weeks ago and the place had no name What s your nearest town then Thar ain t any Thar s a blacksmith s shop and grocery at the crossroads twenty miles further on but it s got no name as I ve heard on The stranger s look of suspicion passed Well he said in an imperative fashion which however seemed as much the result of habit as the occasion I want a horse and mighty quick too H ain t got any No horse How did you get to this place Morse pointed to the slumbering oxen The stranger again stared curiously at him After a pause he said with a half pitying half humorous smile Pike aren t you Whether Morse did or did not know that this current California slang for a denizen of the bucolic West implied a certain contempt he replied simply I m from Pike County Mizzouri Well said the stranger resuming his impatient manner you must beg or steal a horse from your neighbors Thar ain t any neighbor nearer than fifteen miles Then send fifteen miles Stop He opened his still clinging shirt and drew out a belt pouch which he threw to Morse There there s two hundred and fifty dollars in that Now I want a horse Sabe Thar ain t anyone to send said Morse quietly Do you mean to say you are all alone here Yes And you fished me out all by yourself Yes The stranger again examined him curiously Then he suddenly stretched out his hand and grasped his companion s All right if you can t send I reckon I can manage to walk over there tomorrow I was goin on to say said Morse simply that if you ll lie by tonight I ll start over sunup after puttin out the cattle and fetch you back a horse afore noon That s enough He however remained looking curiously at Morse Did you never hear he said with a singular smile that it was about the meanest kind of luck that could happen to you to save a drowning man No said Morse simply I reckon it orter be the meanest if you DIDN T That depends upon the man you save said the stranger with the same ambiguous smile and whether the SAVING him is only putting things off Look here he added with an abrupt return to his imperative style can t you give me some dry clothes Morse brought him a pair of overalls and a hickory shirt well worn but smelling strongly of a recent wash with coarse soap The stranger put them on while his companion busied himself in collecting a pile of sticks and dry leaves What s that for said the stranger suddenly A fire to dry your clothes The stranger calmly kicked the pile aside Not any fire tonight if I know it he said brusquely Before Morse could resent his quickly changing moods he continued in another tone dropping to an easy reclining position beneath the tree Now tell me all about yourself and what you are doing here Thus commanded Morse patiently repeated his story from the time he had left his backwoods cabin to his selection of the river bank for a location He pointed out the rich quality of this alluvial bottom and its adaptability for the raising of stock which he hoped soon to acquire The stranger smiled grimly raised himself to a sitting position and taking a penknife from his damp clothes began to clean his nails in the bright moonlight an occupation which made the simple Morse wander vaguely in his narration And you don t know that this hole will give you chills and fever till you ll shake yourself out of your boots Morse had lived before in aguish districts and had no fear And you never heard that some night the whole river will rise up and walk over you and your cabin and your stock No For I reckon to move my shanty farther back The man shut up his penknife with a click and rose If you ve got to get up at sunrise we d better be turning in I suppose you can give me a pair of blankets Morse pointed to the wagon Thar s a shakedown in the wagon bed you kin lie there Nevertheless he hesitated and with the inconsequence and abruptness of a shy man continued the previous conversation I shouldn t like to move far away for them steamboats is pow ful kempany o nights I never seed one afore I kem here and then with the inconsistency of a reserved man and without a word of further preliminary he launched into a confidential disclosure of his late experiences The stranger listened with a singular interest and a quietly searching eye Then you were watching the boat very closely just now when you saw me What else did you see Anything before that before you saw me in the water No the boat had got well off before I saw you at all Ah said the stranger Well I m going to turn in He walked to the wagon mounted it and by the time that Morse had reached it with his wet clothes he was already wrapped in the blankets A moment later he seemed to be in a profound slumber It was only then when his guest was lying helplessly at his mercy that he began to realize his strange experiences The domination of this man had been so complete that Morse although by nature independent and self reliant had not permitted himself to question his right or to resent his rudeness He had accepted his guest s careless or premeditated silence regarding the particulars of his accident as a matter of course and had never dreamed of questioning him That it was a natural accident of that great world so apart from his own experiences he did not doubt and thought no more about it The advent of the man himself was greater to him than the causes which brought him there He was as yet quite unconscious of the complete fascination this mysterious stranger held over him but he found himself shyly pleased with even the slight interest he had displayed in his affairs and his hand felt yet warm and tingling from his sudden soft but expressive grasp as if it had been a woman s There is a simple intuition of friendship in some lonely self abstracted natures that is nearly akin to love at first sight Even the audacities and insolence of this stranger affected Morse as he might have been touched and captivated by the coquetries or imperiousness of some bucolic virgin And this reserved and shy frontiersman found himself that night sleepless and hovering with an abashed timidity and consciousness around the wagon that sheltered his guest as if he had been a very Corydon watching the moonlit couch of some slumbering Amaryllis He was off by daylight after having placed a rude breakfast by the side of the still sleeping guest and before midday he had returned with a horse When he handed the stranger his pouch less the amount he had paid for the horse the man said curtly What s that for Your change I paid only fifty dollars for the horse The stranger regarded him with his peculiar smile Then replacing the pouch in his belt he shook Morse s hand again and mounted the horse So your name s Martin Morse Well goodby Morsey Morse hesitated A blush rose to his dark check You didn t tell me your name he said In case In case I m WANTED Well you can call me Captain Jack He smiled and nodding his head put spurs to his mustang and cantered away Morse did not do much work that day falling into abstracted moods and living over his experiences of the previous night until he fancied he could almost see his strange guest again The narrow strip of meadow was haunted by him There was the tree under which he had first placed him and that was where he had seen him sitting up in his dripping but well fitting clothes In the rough garments he had worn and returned lingered a new scent of some delicate soap overpowering the strong alkali flavor of his own He was early by the river side having a vague hope he knew not why that he should again see him and recognize him among the passengers He was wading out among the reeds in the faint light of the rising moon recalling the exact spot where he had first seen the stranger when he was suddenly startled by the rolling over in the water of some black object that had caught against the bank but had been dislodged by his movements To his horror it bore a faint resemblance to his first vision of the preceding night But a second glance at the helplessly floating hair and bloated outline showed him that it was a DEAD man and of a type and build far different from his former companion There was a bruise upon his matted forehead and an enormous wound in his throat already washed bloodless white and waxen An inexplicable fear came upon him not at the sight of the corpse for he had been in Indian massacres and had rescued bodies mutilated beyond recognition but from some moral dread that strangely enough quickened and deepened with the far off pant of the advancing steamboat Scarcely knowing why he dragged the body hurriedly ashore concealing it in the reeds as if he were disposing of the evidence of his own crime Then to his preposterous terror he noticed that the panting of the steamboat and the beat of its paddles were slowing as the vague bulk came in sight until a huge wave from the suddenly arrested wheels sent a surge like an enormous heartbeat pulsating through the sedge that half submerged him The flashing of three or four lanterns on deck and the motionless line of lights abreast of him dazzled his eyes but he knew that the low fringe of willows hid his house and wagon completely from view A vague murmur of voices from the deck was suddenly overridden by a sharp order and to his relief the slowly revolving wheels again sent a pulsation through the water and the great fabric moved solemnly away A sense of relief came over him he knew not why and he was conscious that for the first time he had not cared to look at the boat When the moon arose he again examined the body and took from its clothing a few articles of identification and some papers of formality and precision which he vaguely conjectured to be some law papers from their resemblance to the phrasing of sheriffs and electors notices which he had seen in the papers He then buried the corpse in a shallow trench which he dug by the light of the moon He had no question of responsibility his pioneer training had not included coroners inquests in its experience in giving the body a speedy and secure burial from predatory animals he did what one frontiersman would do for another what he hoped might be done for him If his previous unaccountable feelings returned occasionally it was not from that but rather from some uneasiness in regard to his late guest s possible feelings and a regret that he had not been here at the finding of the body That it would in some way have explained his own accident he did not doubt The boat did not slow up the next night but passed as usual yet three or four days elapsed before he could look forward to its coming with his old extravagant and half exalted curiosity which was his nearest approach to imagination He was then able to examine it more closely for the appearance of the stranger whom he now began to call his friend in his verbal communings with himself but whom he did not seem destined to again discover until one day to his astonishment a couple of fine horses were brought to his clearing by a stock drover They had been ordered to be left there In vain Morse expostulated and questioned Your name s Martin Morse ain t it said the drover with business brusqueness and I reckon there ain t no other man o that name around here No said Morse Well then they re YOURS But who sent them insisted Morse What was his name and where does he live I didn t know ez I was called upon to give the pedigree o buyers said the drover dryly but the horses is Morgan you can bet your life He grinned as he rode away That Captain Jack sent them and that it was a natural prelude to his again visiting him Morse did not doubt and for a few days he lived in that dream But Captain Jack did not come The animals were of great service to him in rounding up the stock he now easily took in for pasturage and saved him the necessity of having a partner or a hired man The idea that this superior gentleman in fine clothes might ever appear to him in the former capacity had even flitted through his brain but he had rejected it with a sigh But the thought that with luck and industry he himself might in course of time approximate to Captain Jack s evident station DID occur to him and was an incentive to energy Yet it was quite distinct from the ordinary working man s ambition of wealth and state It was only that it might make him more worthy of his friend The great world was still as it had appeared to him in the passing boat a thing to wonder at to be above and to criticize For all that he prospered in his occupation But one day he woke with listless limbs and feet that scarcely carried him through his daily labors At night his listlessness changed to active pain and a feverishness that seemed to impel him toward the fateful river as if his one aim in life was to drink up its waters and bathe in its yellow stream But whenever he seemed to attempt it strange dreams assailed him of dead bodies arising with swollen and distorted lips to touch his own as he strove to drink or of his mysterious guest battling with him in its current and driving him ashore Again when he essayed to bathe his parched and crackling limbs in its flood he would be confronted with the dazzling lights of the motionless steamboat and the glare of stony eyes until he fled in aimless terror How long this lasted he knew not until one morning he awoke in his new cabin with a strange man sitting by his bed and a Negress in the doorway You ve had a sharp attack of tule fever said the stranger dropping Morse s listless wrist and answering his questioning eyes but you re all right now and will pull through Who are you stammered Morse feebly doctor Duchesne of Sacramento How did you come here I was ordered to come to you and bring a nurse as you were alone There she is He pointed to the smiling Negress WHO ordered you The doctor smiled with professional tolerance One of your friends of course But what was his name Really I don t remember But don t distress yourself He has settled for everything right royally You have only to get strong now My duty is ended and I can safely leave you with the nurse Only when you are strong again I say and HE says keep back farther from the river And that was all he knew For even the nurse who attended him through the first days of his brief convalescence would tell him nothing more He quickly got rid of her and resumed his work for a new and strange phase of his simple childish affection for his benefactor partly superinduced by his illness was affecting him He was beginning to feel the pain of an unequal friendship he was dimly conscious that his mysterious guest was only coldly returning his hospitality and benefits while holding aloof from any association with him and indicating the immeasurable distance that separated their future intercourse He had withheld any kind message or sympathetic greeting he had kept back even his NAME The shy proud ignorant heart of the frontiersman swelled beneath the fancied slight which left him helpless alike of reproach or resentment He could not return the horses although in a fit of childish indignation he had resolved not to use them he could not reimburse him for the doctor s bill although he had sent away the nurse He took a foolish satisfaction in not moving back from the river with a faint hope that his ignoring of Captain Jack s advice might mysteriously be conveyed to him He even thought of selling out his location and abandoning it that he might escape the cold surveillance of his heartless friend All this was undoubtedly childish but there is an irrepressible simplicity of youth in all deep feeling and the worldly inexperience of the frontiersman left him as innocent as a child In this phase of his unrequited affection he even went so far as to seek some news of Captain Jack at Sacramento and following out his foolish quest even to take the steamboat from thence to Stockton What happened to him then was perhaps the common experience of such natures Once upon the boat the illusion of the great world it contained for him utterly vanished He found it noisy formal insincere and had he ever understood or used the word in his limited vocabulary VULGAR Rather perhaps it seemed to him that the prevailing sentiment and action of those who frequented it and for whom it was built were of a lower grade than his own And strangely enough this gave him none of his former sense of critical superiority but only of his own utter and complete isolation He wandered in his rough frontiersman s clothes from deck to cabin from airy galleries to long saloons alone unchallenged unrecognized as if he were again haunting it only in spirit as he had so often done in his dreams His presence on the fringe of some voluble crowd caused no interruption to him their speech was almost foreign in its allusions to things he did not understand or worse seemed inconsistent with their eagerness and excitement How different from all this were his old recollections of slowly oncoming teams uplifted above the level horizon of the plains in his former wanderings the few sauntering figures that met him as man to man and exchanged the chronicle of the road the record of Indian tracks the finding of a spring the discovery of pasturage with the lazy restful hospitality of the night And how fierce here this continual struggle for dominance and existence even in this lull of passage For above all and through all he was conscious of the feverish haste of speed and exertion The boat trembled vibrated and shook with every stroke of the ponderous piston The laughter of the crowd the exchange of gossip and news the banquet at the long table the newspapers and books in the reading room even the luxurious couches in the staterooms were all dominated thrilled and pulsating with the perpetual throb of the demon of hurry and unrest And when at last a horrible fascination dragged him into the engine room and he saw the cruel relentless machinery at work he seemed to recognize and understand some intelligent but pitiless Moloch who was dragging this feverish world at its heels Later he was seated in a corner of the hurricane deck whence he could view the monotonous banks of the river yet perhaps by certain signs unobservable to others he knew he was approaching his own locality He knew that his cabin and clearing would be undiscernible behind the fringe of willows on the bank but he already distinguished the points where a few cottonwoods struggled into a promontory of lighter foliage beyond them Here voices fell upon his ear and he was suddenly aware that two men had lazily crossed over from the other side of the boat and were standing before him looking upon the bank It was about here I reckon said one listlessly as if continuing a previous lagging conversation that it must have happened For it was after we were making for the bend we ve just passed that the deputy goin to the stateroom below us found the door locked and the window open But both men Jack Despard and Seth Hall the sheriff weren t to be found Not a trace of em The boat was searched but all for nothing The idea is that the sheriff arter getting his prisoner comf ble in the stateroom took off Jack s handcuffs and locked the door that Jack who was mighty desp rate bolted through the window into the river and the sheriff who was no slouch arter him Others allow for the chairs and things was all tossed about in the stateroom that the two men clinched THAR and Jack choked Hall and chucked him out and then slipped cl ar into the water himself for the stateroom window was just ahead of the paddle box and the cap n allows that no man or men could fall afore the paddles and live Anyhow that was all they ever knew of it And there wasn t no trace of them found said the second man after a long pause No Cap n says them paddles would hev just snatched em and slung em round and round and buried em way down in the ooze of the river bed with all the silt of the current atop of em and they mightn t come up for ages or else the wheels might have waltzed em way up to Sacramento until there wasn t enough left of em to float and dropped em when the boat stopped It was a mighty fool risk for a man like Despard to take resumed the second speaker as he turned away with a slight yawn Bet your life but he was desp rate and the sheriff had got him sure And they DO say that he was superstitious like all them gamblers and allowed that a man who was fixed to die by a rope or a pistol wasn t to be washed out of life by water The two figures drifted lazily away but Morse sat rigid and motionless Yet strange to say only one idea came to him clearly out of this awful revelation the thought that his friend was still true to him and that his strange absence and mysterious silence were fully accounted for and explained And with it came the more thrilling fancy that this man was alive now to HIM alone HE was the sole custodian of his secret The morality of the question while it profoundly disturbed him was rather in reference to its effect upon the chances of Captain Jack and the power it gave his enemies than his own conscience He would rather that his friend should have proven the proscribed outlaw who retained an unselfish interest in him than the superior gentleman who was coldly wiping out his gratitude He thought he understood now the reason of his visitor s strange and varying moods even his bitter superstitious warning in regard to the probable curse entailed upon one who should save a drowning man Of this he recked little enough that he fancied that Captain Jack s concern in his illness was heightened by that fear and this assurance of his protecting friendship thrilled him with pleasure There was no reason now why he should not at once go back to his farm where at least Captain Jack would always find him and he did so returning on the same boat He was now fully recovered from his illness and calmer in mind he redoubled his labors to put himself in a position to help the mysterious fugitive when the time should come The remote farm should always be a haven of refuge for him and in this hope he forbore to take any outside help remaining solitary and alone that Captain Jack s retreat should be inviolate And so the long dry season passed the hay was gathered the pasturing herds sent home and the first rains dimpling like shot the broadening surface of the river were all that broke his unending solitude In this enforced attitude of waiting and expectancy he was exalted and strengthened by a new idea He was not a religious man but dimly remembering the exhortations of some camp meeting of his boyhood he conceived the idea that he might have been selected to work out the regeneration of Captain Jack What might not come of this meeting and communing together in this lonely spot That anything was due to the memory of the murdered sheriff whose bones were rotting in the trench that he daily but unconcernedly passed did not occur to him Perhaps his mind was not large enough for the double consideration Friendship and love and for the matter of that religion are eminently one ideaed But one night he awakened with a start His hand which was hanging out of his bunk was dabbling idly in water He had barely time to spring to his middle in what seemed to be a slowly filling tank before the door fell out as from that inward pressure and his whole shanty collapsed like a pack of cards But it fell outwards the roof sliding from over his head like a withdrawn canopy and he was swept from his feet against it and thence out into what might have been another world For the rain had ceased and the full moon revealed only one vast illimitable expanse of water It was not an overflow but the whole rushing river magnified and repeated a thousand times which even as he gasped for breath and clung to the roof was bearing him away he knew not whither But it was bearing him away upon its center for as he cast one swift glance toward his meadows he saw they were covered by the same sweeping torrent dotted with his sailing hayricks and reaching to the wooded foothills It was the great flood of fifty four In its awe inspiring completeness it might have seemed to him the primeval Deluge As his frail raft swept under a cottonwood he caught at one of the overhanging limbs and working his way desperately along the bough at last reached a secure position in the fork of the tree Here he was for the moment safe But the devastation viewed from this height was only the more appalling Every sign of his clearing all evidence of his past year s industry had disappeared He was now conscious for the first time of the lowing of the few cattle he had kept as huddled together on a slight eminence they one by one slipped over struggling into the flood The shining bodies of his dead horses rolled by him as he gazed The lower lying limbs of the sycamore near him were bending with the burden of the lighter articles from his overturned wagon and cabin which they had caught and retained and a rake was securely lodged in a bough The habitual solitude of his locality was now strangely invaded by drifting sheds agricultural implements and fence rails from unknown and remote neighbors and he could faintly hear the far off calling of some unhappy farmer adrift upon a spar of his wrecked and shattered house When day broke he was cold and hungry Hours passed in hopeless monotony with no slackening or diminution of the waters Even the drifts became less and a vacant sea at last spread before him on which nothing moved An awful silence impressed him In the afternoon rain again began to fall on this gray nebulous expanse until the whole world seemed made of aqueous vapor He had but one idea now the coming of the evening boat and he would reserve his strength to swim to it He did not know until later that it could no longer follow the old channel of the river and passed far beyond his sight and hearing With his disappointment and exposure that night came a return of his old fever His limbs were alternately racked with pain or benumbed and lifeless He could scarcely retain his position at times he scarcely cared to and speculated upon ending his sufferings by a quick plunge downward In other moments of lucid misery he was conscious of having wandered in his mind of having seen the dead face of the murdered sheriff washed out of his shallow grave by the flood staring at him from the water to this was added the hallucination of noises He heard voices his own name called by a voice he knew Captain Jack s Suddenly he started but in that fatal movement lost his balance and plunged downward But before the water closed above his head he had had a cruel glimpse of help near him of a flashing light of the black hull of a tug not many yards away of moving figures the sensation of a sudden plunge following his own the grip of a strong hand upon his collar and unconsciousness When he came to he was being lifted in a boat from the tug and rowed through the deserted streets of a large city until he was taken in through the second story window of a half submerged hotel and cared for But all his questions yielded only the information that the tug a privately procured one not belonging to the Public Relief Association had been dispatched for him with special directions by a man who acted as one of the crew and who was the one who had plunged in for him at the last moment The man had left the boat at Stockton There was nothing more Yes he had left a letter Morse seized it feverishly It contained only a few lines We are quits now You are all right I have saved YOU from drowning and shifted the curse to my own shoulders Good by CAPTAIN JACK The astounded man attempted to rise to utter an exclamation but fell back unconscious Weeks passed before he was able to leave his bed and then only as an impoverished and physically shattered man He had no means to restock the farm left bare by the subsiding water A kindly train packer offered him a situation as muleteer in a pack train going to the mountains for he knew tracks and passes and could ride The mountains gave him back a little of the vigor he had lost in the river valley but none of its dreams and ambitions One day while tracking a lost mule he stopped to slake his thirst in a waterhole all that the summer had left of a lonely mountain torrent Enlarging the hole to give drink to his beast also he was obliged to dislodge and throw out with the red soil some bits of honeycomb rock which were so queer looking and so heavy as to attract his attention Two of the largest he took back to camp with him They were gold From the locality he took out a fortune Nobody wondered To the Californian s superstition it was perfectly natural It was nigger luck the luck of the stupid the ignorant the inexperienced the nonseeker the irony of the gods But the simple bucolic nature that had sustained itself against temptation with patient industry and lonely self concentration succumbed to rapidly acquired wealth So it chanced that one day with a crowd of excitement loving spendthrifts and companions he found himself on the outskirts of a lawless mountain town An eager frantic crowd had already assembled there a desperado was to be lynched Pushing his way through the crowd for a nearer view of the exciting spectacle the changed and reckless Morse was stopped by armed men only at the foot of a cart which upheld a quiet determined man who with a rope around his neck was scornfully surveying the mob that held the other end of the rope drawn across the limb of a tree above him The eyes of the doomed man caught those of Morse his expression changed a kindly smile lit his face he bowed his proud head for the first time with an easy gesture of farewell And then with a cry Morse threw himself upon the nearest armed guard and a fierce struggle began He had overpowered one adversary and seized another in his hopeless fight toward the cart when the half astonished crowd felt that something must be done It was done with a sharp report the upward curl of smoke and the falling back of the guard as Morse staggered forward FREE with a bullet in his heart Yet even then he did not fall until he reached the cart when he lapsed forward dead with his arms outstretched and his head at the doomed man s feet There was something so supreme and all powerful in this hopeless act of devotion that the heart of the multitude thrilled and then recoiled aghast at its work and a single word or a gesture from the doomed man himself would have set him free But they say and it is credibly recorded that as Captain Jack Despard looked down upon the hopeless sacrifice at his feet his eyes blazed and he flung upon the crowd a curse so awful and sweeping that hardened as they were their blood ran cold and then leaped furiously to their cheeks And now he said coolly tightening the rope around his neck with a jerk of his head Go on and be damned to you I m ready They did not hesitate this time And Martin Morse and Captain Jack Despard were buried in the same grave A CONVERT OF THE MISSION The largest tent of the Tasajara camp meeting was crowded to its utmost extent The excitement of that dense mass was at its highest pitch The Reverend Stephen Masterton the single erect passionate figure of that confused medley of kneeling worshipers had reached the culminating pitch of his irresistible exhortatory power Sighs and groans were beginning to respond to his appeals when the reverend brother was seen to lurch heavily forward and fall to the ground At first the effect was that of a part of his performance the groans redoubled and twenty or thirty brethren threw themselves prostrate in humble imitation of the preacher But Sister Deborah Stokes perhaps through some special revelation of feminine intuition grasped the fallen man tore loose his black silk necktie and dragged him free of the struggling frantic crowd whose paroxysms he had just evoked Howbeit he was pale and unconscious and unable to continue the service Even the next day when he had slightly recovered it was found that any attempt to renew his fervid exhortations produced the same disastrous result A council was hurriedly held by the elders In spite of the energetic protests of Sister Stokes it was held that the Lord was wrestlin with his sperrit and he was subjected to the same extraordinary treatment from the whole congregation that he himself had applied to THEM Propped up pale and trembling in the Mourners Bench by two brethren he was striven with exhorted prayed over and admonished until insensibility mercifully succeeded convulsions Spiritual therapeutics having failed he was turned over to the weak and carnal nursing of womenfolk But after a month of incapacity he was obliged to yield to the flesh and in the local dialect to use a doctor It so chanced that the medical practitioner of the district was a man of large experience of military training and plain speech When therefore he one day found in his surgery a man of rude Western type strong limbed and sunburned but trembling hesitating and neurotic in movement after listening to his symptoms gravely he asked abruptly And how much are you drinking now I am a lifelong abstainer stammered his patient in quivering indignation But this was followed by another question so frankly appalling to the hearer that he staggered to his feet I m Stephen Masterton known of men as a circuit preacher of the Northern California district he thundered and an enemy of the flesh in all its forms I beg your pardon responded doctor Duchesne grimly but as you are suffering from excessive and repeated excitation of the nervous system and the depression following prolonged artificial exaltation it makes little difference whether the cause be spiritual as long as there is a certain physical effect upon your BODY which I believe you have brought to me to cure Now as to diet you look all wrong there My food is of the simplest I have no hankering for fleshpots responded the patient I suppose you call saleratus bread and salt pork and flapjacks SIMPLE said the doctor coolly they are COMMON enough and if you were working with your muscles instead of your nerves in that frame of yours they might not hurt you but you are suffering as much from eating more than you can digest as the veriest gourmand You must stop all that Go down to a quiet watering place for two months I go to a watering place interrupted Masterton to the haunt of the idle the frivolous and wanton never Well I m not particular about a watering place said the doctor with a shrug although a little idleness and frivolity with different food wouldn t hurt you but you must go somewhere and change your habits and mode of life COMPLETELY I will find you some sleepy old Spanish town in the southern country where you can rest and diet If this is distasteful to you he continued grimly you can always call it a trial Stephen Masterton may have thought it so when a week later he found himself issuing from a rocky gorge into a rough badly paved hilly street which seemed to be only a continuation of the mountain road itself It broadened suddenly into a square or plaza flanked on each side by an irregular row of yellowing adobe houses with the inevitable verandaed tienda in each corner and the solitary galleried fonda with a half Moorish archway leading into an inner patio or courtyard in the center The whole street stopped as usual at the very door of the Mission church a few hundred yards farther on and under the shadow of the two belfry towers at each angle of the facade as if this were the ultima thule of every traveler But all that the eye rested on was ruined worn and crumbling The adobe houses were cracked by the incessant sunshine of the half year long summer or the more intermittent earthquake shock the paved courtyard of the fonda was so uneven and sunken in the center that the lumbering wagon and faded diligencia stood on an incline and the mules with difficulty kept their footing while being unladen the whitened plaster had fallen from the feet of the two pillars that flanked the Mission doorway like bandages from a gouty limb leaving the reddish core of adobe visible there were apparently as many broken tiles in the streets and alleys as there were on the heavy red roofs that everywhere asserted themselves and even seemed to slide down the crumbling walls to the ground There were hopeless gaps in grille and grating of doorways and windows where the iron bars had dropped helplessly out or were bent at different angles The walls of the peaceful Mission garden and the warlike presidio were alike lost in the escalading vines or leveled by the pushing boughs of gnarled pear and olive trees that now surmounted them The dust lay thick and impalpable in hollow and gutter and rose in little vapory clouds with a soft detonation at every stroke of his horse s hoofs Over all this dust and ruin idleness seemed to reign supreme From the velvet jacketed figures lounging motionless in the shadows of the open doorways so motionless that only the lazy drift of cigarette smoke betokened their breathing to the reclining peons in the shade of a catalpa or the squatting Indians in the arroyo all was sloth and dirt The reverend Stephen Masterton felt his throat swell with his old exhortative indignation A gaudy yellow fan waved languidly in front of a black rose crested head at a white curtained window He knew he was stifling with righteous wrath and clapped his spurs to his horse Nevertheless in a few days by the aid of a letter to the innkeeper he was installed in a dilapidated adobe house not unlike those he had seen but situated in the outskirts and overlooking the garden and part of the refectory of the old Mission It had even a small garden of its own if a strip of hot wall overburdened with yellow and white roses a dozen straggling callas a bank of heliotrope and an almond tree could be called a garden It had an open doorway but so heavily recessed in the thick walls that it preserved seclusion a sitting room and an alcoved bedroom with deep embrasured windows that however excluded the unwinking sunlight and kept an even monotone of shade Strange to say he found it cool restful and in spite of the dust absolutely clean and but for the scent of heliotrope entirely inodorous The dry air seemed to dissipate all noxious emanations and decay the very dust itself in its fine impalpability was volatile with a spicelike piquancy and left no stain A wrinkled Indian woman brown and veined like a tobacco leaf ministered to his simple wants But these wants had also been regulated by doctor Duchesne He found himself with some grave doubts of his effeminacy breakfasting on a single cup of chocolate instead of his usual bowl of molasses sweetened coffee crumbling a crisp tortilla instead of the heavy saleratus bread greasy flapjack or the lard fried steak and more wonderful still completing his repast with purple grapes from the Mission wall He could not deny that it was simple that it was even refreshing and consistent with the climate and his surroundings On the other hand it was the frugal diet of the commonest peasant and were not those peons slothful idolaters At the end of the week his correspondence being also restricted by his doctor to a few lines to himself regarding his progress he wrote to that adviser The trembling and unquiet has almost ceased I have less nightly turmoil and visions my carnal appetite seems to be amply mollified and soothed by these viands whatever may be their ultimate effect upon the weakness of our common sinful nature But I should not be truthful to you if I did not warn you that I am viewing with the deepest spiritual concern a decided tendency toward sloth and a folding of the hands over matters that often I fear are spiritual as well as temporal I would ask you to consider in a spirit of love if it be not wise to rouse my apathetic flesh so as to strive even with the feeblest exhortations against this sloth in others if only to keep one s self from falling into the pit of easy indulgence What answer he received is not known but it is to be presumed that he kept loyal faith with his physician and gave himself up to simple walks and rides and occasional meditation His solitude was not broken in upon curiosity was too active a vice and induced too much exertion for his indolent neighbors and the Americano s basking seclusion though unlike the habits of his countrymen did not affect them The shopkeeper and innkeeper saluted him always with a profound courtesy which awakened his slight resentment partly because he was conscious that it was grateful to him and partly that he felt he ought to have provoked in them a less satisfied condition Once when he had unwittingly passed the confines of his own garden through a gap in the Mission orchard a lissome black coated shadow slipped past him with an obeisance so profound and gentle that he was startled at first into an awkward imitation of it himself and then into an angry self examination He knew that he loathed that long skirted womanlike garment that dangling ostentatious symbol that air of secrecy and mystery and he inflated his chest above his loosely tied cravat and unbuttoned waistcoat with a contrasted sense of freedom But he was conscious the next day of weakly avoiding a recurrence of this meeting and in his self examination put it down to his self disciplined observance of his doctor s orders But when he was strong again and fitted for his Master s work how strenuously he should improve the occasion this gave him of attacking the Scarlet Woman among her slaves and worshipers His afternoon meditations and the perusal of his only book the Bible were regularly broken in upon at about sunset by two or three strokes from the cracked bell that hung in the open belfry which reared itself beyond the gnarled pear tees He could not say that it was aggressive or persistent like his own church bells nor that it even expressed to him any religious sentiment Moreover it was not a Sabbath bell but a DAILY one and even then seemed to be only a signal to ears easily responsive rather than a stern reminder And the hour was always a singularly witching one It was when the sun had slipped from the glaring red roofs and the yellowing adobe of the Mission walls and the tall ranks of wild oats on the hillside were all of the one color of old gold It was when the quivering heat of the arroyo and dusty expanse of plaza was blending with the soft breath of the sea fog that crept through the clefts of the coast range until a refreshing balm seemed to fall like a benediction on all nature It was when the trade wind swept and irritated surfaces of the rocky gorge beyond were soothed with clinging vapors when the pines above no longer rocked monotonously and the great undulating sea of the wild oat plains had gone down and was at rest It was at this hour one afternoon that with the released scents of the garden there came to him a strange and subtle perfume that was new to his senses He laid aside his book went into the garden and half unconscious of his trespass passed through the Mission orchard and thence into the little churchyard beside the church Looking at the strange inscriptions in an unfamiliar tongue he was singularly touched with the few cheap memorials lying upon the graves like childish toys and for the moment overlooked the papistic emblems that accompanied them It struck him vaguely that Death the common leveler had made even the symbols of a faith eternal inferior to those simple records of undying memory and affection and he was for a moment startled into doubt He walked to the door of the church to his surprise it was open Standing upon the threshold he glanced inside and stood for a moment utterly bewildered In a man of refined taste and education that bizarre and highly colored interior would have only provoked a smile or shrug to Stephen Masterton s highly emotional nature but artistic inexperience strangely enough it was profoundly impressive The heavily timbered roughly hewn roof barred with alternate bands of blue and Indian red the crimson hangings the gold and black draperies affected this religious backwoodsman exactly as they were designed to affect the heathen and acolytes for whose conversion the temple had been reared He could scarcely take his eyes from the tinsel crowned Mother of Heaven resplendent in white and gold and glittering with jewels the radiant shield before the Host illuminated by tall spectral candles in the mysterious obscurity of the altar dazzled him like the rayed disk of the setting sun A gentle murmur as of the distant sea came from the altar In his naive bewilderment he had not seen the few kneeling figures in the shadow of column and aisle it was not until a man whom he recognized as a muleteer he had seen that afternoon gambling and drinking in the fonda slipped by him like a shadow and sank upon his knees in the center of the aisle that he realized the overpowering truth HE Stephen Masterton was looking upon some rite of Popish idolatry He was turning quickly away when the keeper of the tienda a man of sloth and sin gently approached him from the shadow of a column with a mute gesture which he took to be one of invitation A fierce protest of scorn and indignation swelled to his throat but died upon his lips Yet he had strength enough to erect his gaunt emaciated figure throwing out his long arms and extended palms in the attitude of defiant exorcism and then rush swiftly from the church As he did so he thought he saw a faint smile cross the shopkeeper s face and a whispered exchange of words with a neighboring worshiper of more exalted appearance came to his ears But it was not intelligible to his comprehension The next day he wrote to his doctor in that quaint grandiloquence of written speech with which the half educated man balances the slips of his colloquial phrasing Do not let the purgation of my flesh be unduly protracted What with the sloth and idolatries of Baal and Ashteroth which I see daily around me I feel that without a protest not only the flesh but the spirit is mortified But my bodily strength is mercifully returning and I found myself yesterday able to take a long ride at that hour which they here keep sacred for an idolatrous rite under the beautiful name of The Angelus Thus do they bear false witness to Him Can you tell me the meaning of the Spanish words Don Keyhotter I am ignorant of these sensuous Southern languages and am aware that this is not the correct spelling but I have striven to give the phonetic equivalent It was used I am inclined to think in reference to MYSELF by an idolater P S You need not trouble yourself I have just ascertained that the words in question were simply the title of an idle novel and of course could not possibly refer to ME Howbeit it was as Don Quixote that is the common Spaniard s conception of the Knight of La Mancha merely the simple fanatic and madman that mister Stephen Masterton ever after rode all unconsciously through the streets of the Mission amid the half pitying half smiling glances of the people In spite of his meditations his single volume and his habit of retiring early he found his evenings were growing lonely and tedious He missed the prayer meeting and above all the hymns He had a fine baritone voice sympathetic as may be imagined but not cultivated One night in the seclusion of his garden and secure in his distance from other dwellings he raised his voice in a familiar camp meeting hymn with a strong Covenanter s ring in the chorus Growing bolder as he went on he at last filled the quiet night with the strenuous sweep of his chant Surprised at his own fervor he paused for a moment listening half frightened half ashamed of his outbreak But there was only the trilling of the night wind in the leaves or the far off yelp of a coyote For a moment he thought he heard the metallic twang of a stringed instrument in the Mission garden beyond his own and remembered his contiguity to the church with a stir of defiance But he was relieved nevertheless His pent up emotion had found vent and without the nervous excitement that had followed his old exaltation That night he slept better He had found the Lord again with Psalmody The next evening he chanced upon a softer hymn of the same simplicity but with a vein of human tenderness in its aspirations which his more hopeful mood gently rendered At the conclusion of the first verse he was however distinctly conscious of being followed by the same twanging sound he had heard on the previous night and which even his untutored ear could recognize as an attempt to accompany him But before he had finished the second verse the unknown player after an ingenious but ineffectual essay to grasp the right chord abandoned it with an impatient and almost pettish flourish and a loud bang upon the sounding board of the unseen instrument Masterton finished it alone With his curiosity excited however he tried to discover the locality of the hidden player The sound evidently came from the Mission garden but in his ignorance of the language he could not even interrogate his Indian housekeeper On the third night however his hymn was uninterrupted by any sound from the former musician A sense of disappointment he knew not why came over him The kindly overture of the unseen player had been a relief to his loneliness Yet he had barely concluded the hymn when the familiar sound again struck his ears But this time the musician played boldly confidently and with a singular skill on the instrument The brilliant prelude over to his entire surprise and some confusion a soprano voice high childish but infinitely quaint and fascinating was mischievously uplifted But alas even to his ears ignorant of the language it was very clearly a song of levity and wantonness of freedom and license of coquetry and incitement Yet such was its fascination that he fancied it was reclaimed by the delightful childlike and innocent expression of the singer Enough that this tall gaunt broad shouldered man arose and overcome by a curiosity almost as childlike slipped into the garden and glided with an Indian softness of tread toward the voice The moon shone full upon the ruined Mission wall tipped with clusters of dark foliage Half hiding half mingling with one of them an indistinct bulk of light colored huddled fleeces like an extravagant bird s nest hung the unknown musician So intent was the performer s preoccupation that Masterton actually reached the base of the wall immediately below the figure without attracting its attention But his foot slipped on the crumbling debris with a snapping of dry twigs There was a quick little cry from above He had barely time to recover his position before the singer impulsively leaning over the parapet had lost hers and fell outward But Masterton was tall alert and self possessed and threw out his long arms The next moment they were full of soft flounces a struggling figure was against his breast and a woman s frightened little hands around his neck But he had broken her fall and almost instantly yet with infinite gentleness he released her unharmed with hardly her crisp flounces crumpled in an upright position against the wall Even her guitar still hanging from her shoulder by a yellow ribbon had bounded elastic and resounding against the wall but lay intact at her satin slippered feet She caught it up with another quick little cry but this time more of sauciness than fear and drew her little hand across its strings half defiantly I hope you are not hurt said the circuit preacher gravely She broke into a laugh so silvery that he thought it no extravagance to liken it to the moonbeams that played over her made audible She was lithe yet plump barred with black and yellow and small waisted like a pretty wasp Her complexion in that light was a sheen of pearl satin that made her eyes blacker and her little mouth redder than any other color could She was small but remembering the fourteen year old wife of the shopkeeper he felt that for all her childish voice and features she was a grown woman and a sudden shyness took hold of him But she looked pertly in his face stood her guitar upright before her and put her hands behind her back as she leaned saucily against the wall and shrugged her shoulders It was the fault of you she said in a broken English that seemed as much infantine as foreign What for you not remain to yourself in your own CASA So it come You creep so in the dark and shake my wall and I fall And she pointing to the guitar is a most broke And for all thees I have only make to you a serenade Ingrate I beg your pardon said Masterton quickly but I was curious I thought I might help you and Make yourself another cat on the wall eh No one is enough thank you A frown lowered on Masterton s brow You don t understand me he said bluntly I did not know WHO was here Ah BUENO Then it is Pepita Ramirez you see she said tapping her bodice with one little finger all the same the niece from Manuel Garcia who keeps the Mission garden and lif there And you My name is Masterton How mooch Masterton he repeated She tried to pronounce it once or twice desperately and then shook her little head so violently that a yellow rose fastened over her ear fell to the ground But she did not heed it nor the fact that Masterton had picked it up Ah I cannot she said poutingly It is as deefeecult to make go as my guitar with your serenade Can you not say Stephen Masterton he asked more gently with a returning and forgiving sense of her childishness Es stefen Ah ESTEBAN Yes Don Esteban BUENO Then Don Esteban what for you sink so melank olly one night and one night so fierce The melank olly he ees not so bad but the fierce ah he is weeked Ess it how the Americano make always his serenade Masterton s brow again darkened And his hymn of exultation had been mistaken by these people by this this wanton child It was no serenade he replied curtly it was in the praise of the Lord Of how mooch Of the Lord of Hosts of the Almighty in Heaven He lifted his long arms reverently on high Oh she said with a frightened look slightly edging away from the wall At a secure distance she stopped Then you are a soldier Don Esteban No Then what for you sink I am a soldier of the Lord and you will make die in His army Oh yes you have said She gathered up her guitar tightly under her arm shook her small finger at him gravely and said You are a hoombog Don Esteban good a night and began to glide away One moment Miss Miss Ramirez called Masterton I that is you you have forgotten your rose he added feebly holding up the flower She halted Ah yes he have drop you have pick him up he is yours I have drop you have pick ME up but I am NOT yours Good a night COMANDANTE Don Esteban With a light laugh she ran along beside the wall for a little distance suddenly leaped up and disappeared in one of the largest gaps in its ruined and helpless structure Stephen Masterton gazed after her stupidly still holding the rose in his hand Then he threw it away and re entered his home Lighting his candle he undressed himself prayed fervently so fervently that all remembrance of the idle foolish incident was wiped from his mind and went to bed He slept well and dreamlessly The next morning when his thoughts recurred to the previous night this seemed to him a token that he had not deviated from his spiritual integrity it did not occur to him that the thought itself was a tacit suspicion So his feet quite easily sought the garden again in the early sunshine even to the wall where she had stood But he had not taken into account the vivifying freshness of the morning the renewed promise of life and resurrection in the pulsing air and potent sunlight and as he stood there he seemed to see the figure of the young girl again leaning against the wall in all the charm of her irrepressible and innocent youth More than that he found the whole scene re enacting itself before him the nebulous drapery half hidden in the foliage the cry and the fall the momentary soft contact of the girl s figure against his own the clinging arms around his neck the brush and fragrance of her flounces all this came back to him with a strength he had NOT felt when it occurred He was turning hurriedly away when his eyes fell upon the yellow rose still lying in the debris where he had thrown it but still pure fresh and unfaded He picked it up again with a singular fancy that it was the girl herself and carried it into the house As he placed it half shyly in a glass on his table a wonderful thought occurred to him Was not the episode of last night a special providence Was not that young girl wayward and childlike a mere neophyte in her idolatrous religion as yet unsteeped in sloth and ignorance presented to him as a brand to be snatched from the burning Was not this the opportunity of conversion he had longed for this the chance of exercising his gifts of exhortation that he had been hiding in the napkin of solitude and seclusion Nay was not all this PREDESTINED His illness his consequent exile to this land of false gods this contiguity to the Mission was not all this part of a supremely ordered plan for the girl s salvation and was HE not elected and ordained for that service Nay more was not the girl herself a mere unconscious instrument in the hands of a higher power was not her voluntary attempt to accompany him in his devotional exercise a vague stirring of that predestined force within her Was not even that wantonness and frivolity contrasted with her childishness which he had at first misunderstood the stirrings of the flesh and the spirit and was he to abandon her in that struggle of good and evil He lifted his bowed head that had been resting on his arm before the little flower on the table as if it were a shrine with a flash of resolve in his blue eyes The wrinkled Concepcion coming to her duties in the morning scarcely recognized her gloomily abstracted master in this transfigured man He looked ten years younger She met his greeting and the few direct inquiries that his new resolve enabled him to make more freely with some information which a later talk with the shopkeeper who had a fuller English vocabulary confirmed in detail YES truly this was a niece of the Mission gardener who lived with her uncle in the ruined wing of the presidio She had taken her first communion four years ago Ah yes she was a great musician and could play on the organ And the guitar ah yes of a certainty She was gay and flirted with the caballeros young and old but she cared not for any Whatever satisfaction this latter statement gave Masterton he believed it was because the absence of any disturbing worldly affection would make her an easier convert But how continue this chance acquaintance and effect her conversion For the first time Masterton realized the value of expediency while his whole nature impelled him to seek her society frankly and publicly and exhort her openly he knew that this was impossible still more he remembered her unmistakable fright at his first expression of faith he must be wise as the serpent and harmless as the dove He must work upon her soul alone and secretly He who would have shrunk from any clandestine association with a girl from mere human affection saw no wrong in a covert intimacy for the purpose of religious salvation Ignorant as he was of the ways of the world and inexperienced in the usages of society he began to plan methods of secretly meeting her with all the intrigue of a gallant The perspicacity as well as the intuition of a true lover had descended upon him in this effort of mere spiritual conquest Armed with his information and a few Spanish words he took the yellow Concepcion aside and gravely suborned her to carry a note to be delivered secretly to Miss Ramirez To his great relief and some surprise the old woman grinned with intelligence and her withered hand closed with a certain familiar dexterity over the epistle and the accompanying gratuity To a man less naively one ideaed it might have awakened some suspicion but to the more sanguine hopefulness of Masterton it only suggested the fancy that Concepcion herself might prove to be open to conversion and that he should in due season attempt HER salvation also But that would be later For Concepcion was always with him and accessible the girl was not The note which had cost him some labor of composition simple and almost businesslike as was the result ran as follows I wish to see you upon some matter of grave concern to yourself Will you oblige me by coming again to the wall of the Mission tonight at early candlelight It would avert worldly suspicion if you brought also your guitar The afternoon dragged slowly on Concepcion returned she had with great difficulty managed to see the senorita but not alone she had however slipped the note into her hand not daring to wait for an answer In his first hopefulness Masterton did not doubt what the answer would be but as evening approached he grew concerned as to the girl s opportunities of coming and regretted that he had not given her a choice of time Before his evening meal was finished he began to fear for her willingness and doubt the potency of his note He was accustomed to exhort ORALLY perhaps he ought to have waited for the chance of SPEAKING to her directly without writing When the moon rose he was already in the garden Lingering at first in the shadow of an olive tree he waited until the moonbeams fell on the wall and its crests of foliage But nothing moved among that ebony tracery his ear was strained for the familiar tinkle of the guitar all was silent As the moon rose higher he at last boldly walked to the wall and listened for any movement on the other side of it But nothing stirred She was evidently NOT coming his note had failed He was turning away sadly but as he faced his home again he heard a light laugh beside him He stopped A black shadow stepped out from beneath his own almond tree He started when with a gesture that seemed familiar to him the upper part of the shadow seemed to fall away with a long black mantilla and the face of the young girl was revealed He could see now that she was clad in black lace from head to foot She looked taller older and he fancied even prettier than before A sudden doubt of his ability to impress her a swift realization of all the difficulties of the attempt and for the first time perhaps a dim perception of the incongruity of the situation came over him I was looking for you on the wall he stammered MADRE DE DIOS she retorted with a laugh and her old audacity you would that I shall ALWAYS hang there and drop upon you like a pear when you shake the tree No You haven t brought your guitar he continued still more awkwardly as he noticed that she held only a long black fan in her hand For why You would that I PLAY it and when my uncle say Where go Pepita She is loss someone shall say Oh I have hear her tink a tink in the garden of the Americano who lif alone And then it ess finish Masterton began to feel exceedingly uncomfortable There was something in this situation that he had not dreamed of But with the persistency of an awkward man he went on But you played on the wall the other night and tried to accompany me But that was lass night and on the wall I had not speak to you you had not speak to me You had not sent me the leetle note by your peon She stopped and suddenly opening her fan before her face so that only her mischievous eyes were visible added You had not asked me then to come to hear you make lof to me Don Esteban That is the difference The circuit preacher felt the blood rush to his face Anger shame mortification remorse and fear alternately strove with him but above all and through all he was conscious of a sharp exquisite pleasure that frightened him still more Yet he managed to exclaim No no You cannot think me capable of such a cowardly trick The girl started more at the unmistakable sincerity of his utterance than at the words whose full meaning she may have only imperfectly caught A treek A treek she slowly and wonderingly repeated Then suddenly as if comprehending him she turned her round black eyes full upon him and dropped her fan from her face And WHAT for you ask me to come here then I wanted to talk with you he began on far more serious matters I wished to but he stopped He could not address this quaint child woman staring at him in black eyed wonder in either the measured or the impetuous terms with which he would have exhorted a maturer responsible being He made a step toward her she drew back striking at his extended hand half impatiently half mischievously with her fan He flushed and then burst out bluntly I want to talk with you about your soul My what Your immortal soul unhappy girl What have you to make with that Are you a devil Her eyes grew rounder though she faced him boldly I am a Minister of the Gospel he said in hurried entreaty You must hear me for a moment I would save your soul My immortal soul lif with the Padre at the Mission you moost seek her there My mortal BODY she added with a mischievous smile say to you good a night Don Esteban She dropped him a little curtsy and ran away One moment Miss Ramirez said Masterton eagerly but she had already slipped beyond his reach He saw her little black figure passing swiftly beside the moonlit wall saw it suddenly slide into a shadowy fissure and vanish In his blank disappointment he could not bear to re enter the house he had left so sanguinely a few moments before but walked moodily in the garden His discomfiture was the more complete since he felt that his defeat was owing to some mistake in his methods and not the incorrigibility of his subject Was it not a spiritual weakness in him to have resented so sharply the girl s imputation that he wished to make love to her He should have borne it as Christians had even before now borne slander and false testimony for their faith He might even have ACCEPTED it and let the triumph of her conversion in the end prove his innocence Or was his purpose incompatible with that sisterly affection he had so often preached to the women of his flock He might have taken her hand and called her Sister Pepita even as he had called Deborah Sister He recalled the fact that he had for an instant held her struggling in his arms he remembered the thrill that the recollection had caused him and somehow it now sent a burning blush across his face He hurried back into the house The next day a thousand wild ideas took the place of his former settled resolution He would seek the Padre this custodian of the young girl s soul he would convince HIM of his error or beseech him to give him an equal access to her spirit He would seek the uncle of the girl and work upon his feelings Then for three or four days he resolved to put the young girl from his mind trusting after the fashion of his kind for some special revelation from a supreme source as an indication for his conduct This revelation presently occurred as it is apt to occur when wanted One evening his heart leaped at the familiar sound of Pepita s guitar in the distance Whatever his ultimate intention now he hurriedly ran into the garden The sound came from the former direction but as he unhesitatingly approached the Mission wall he could see that she was not upon it and as the notes of her guitar were struck again he knew that they came from the other side But the chords were a prelude to one of his own hymns and he stood entranced as her sweet childlike voice rose with the very words that he had sung The few defects were those of purely oral imitation the accents even the slight reiteration of the s were Pepita s own Cheeldren oof the Heavenly King As ye journey essweetly ssing Essing your great Redeemer s praise Glorioos in Hees works and ways He was astounded Her recollection of the air and words was the more wonderful for he remembered now that he had only sung that particular hymn once But to his still greater delight and surprise her voice rose again in the second verse with a touch of plaintiveness that swelled his throat We are traveling home to God In the way our farzers trod They are happy now and we Soon their happiness shall see The simple almost childish words so childish that they might have been the fitting creation of her own childish lips here died away with a sweep and crash of the whole strings Breathless silence followed in which Stephen Masterton could feel the beatings of his own heart Miss Ramirez he called in a voice that scarcely seemed his own There was no reply Pepita he repeated it was strangely like the accent of a lover but he no longer cared Still the singer s voice was silent Then he ran swiftly beside the wall as he had seen her run until he came to the fissure It was overgrown with vines and brambles almost as impenetrable as an abatis but if she had pierced it in her delicate crape dress so could he He brushed roughly through and found himself in a glimmering aisle of pear trees close by the white wall of the Mission church For a moment in that intricate tracing of ebony and ivory made by the rising moon he was dazzled but evidently his irruption into the orchard had not been as lithe and silent as her own for a figure in a parti colored dress suddenly started into activity and running from the wall began to course through the trees until it became apparently a part of that involved pattern Nothing daunted however Stephen Masterton pursued his speed increased as he recognized the flounces of Pepita s barred dress but the young girl had the advantage of knowing the locality and could evade her pursuer by unsuspected turns and doubles For some moments this fanciful sylvan chase was kept up in perfect silence it might have been a woodland nymph pursued by a wandering shepherd Masterton presently saw that she was making toward a tiled roof that was now visible as projecting over the presidio wall and was evidently her goal of refuge He redoubled his speed with skillful audacity and sheer strength of his broad shoulders he broke through a dense ceanothus hedge which Pepita was swiftly skirting and suddenly appeared between her and her house With her first cry the young girl turned and tried to bury herself in the hedge but in another stride the circuit preacher was at her side and caught her panting figure in his arms While he had been running he had swiftly formulated what he should do and what he should say to her To his simple appeal for her companionship and willing ear he would add a brotherly tenderness that should invite her trustfulness in him he would confess his wrong and ask her forgiveness of his abrupt solicitations he would propose to teach her more hymns they would practice psalmody together even this priest the custodian of her soul could not object to that but chiefly he would thank her he would tell her how she had pleased him and this would lead to more serious and thoughtful converse All this was in his mind while he ran was upon his lips as he caught her and for an instant she lapsed exhausted in his arms But alas even in that moment he suddenly drew her toward him and kissed her as only a lover could The wire grass was already yellowing on the Tasajara plains with the dusty decay of the long dry summer when doctor Duchesne returned to Tasajara He came to see the wife of Deacon Sanderson who having for the twelfth time added to the population of the settlement was not doing as well as everybody except possibly doctor Duchesne expected After he had made this hollow eyed over burdened undernourished woman as comfortable as he could in her rude neglected surroundings to change the dreary chronicle of suffering he turned to the husband and said And what has become of mister Masterton who used to be in your vocation A long groan came from the deacon Hallo I hope he has not had a relapse said the doctor earnestly I thought I d knocked all that nonsense out of him I beg your pardon I mean he added hurriedly he wrote to me only a few weeks ago that he was picking up his strength again and doing well In his weak gross sinful flesh yes no doubt returned the Deacon scornfully and perhaps even in a worldly sense for those who value the vanities of life but he is lost to us for all time and lost to eternal life forever Not he continued in sanctimonious vindictiveness but that I often had my doubts of Brother Masterton s steadfastness He was too much given to imagery and song But what has he done persisted doctor Duchesne Done He has embraced the Scarlet Woman Dear me said the doctor so soon Is it anybody you knew here not anybody s wife Eh He has entered the Church of Rome said the Deacon indignantly he has forsaken the God of his fathers for the tents of the idolaters he is the consort of Papists and the slave of the Pope But are you SURE said doctor Duchesne with perhaps less concern than before Sure returned the Deacon angrily didn t Brother Bulkley on account of warning reports made by a God fearing and soul seeking teamster make a special pilgrimage to this land of Sodom to inquire and spy out its wickedness Didn t he find Stephen Masterton steeped in the iniquity of practicing on an organ he that scorned even a violin or harmonium in the tents of the Lord in an idolatrous chapel with a foreign female Papist for a teacher Didn t he find him a guest at the board of a Jesuit priest visiting the schools of the Mission where this young Jezebel of a singer teaches the children to chant in unknown tongues Didn t he find him living with a wrinkled Indian witch who called him Padrone and speaking her gibberish Didn t he find him who left here a man mortified in flesh and spirit and pale with striving with sinners fat and rosy from native wines and fleshpots and even vain and gaudy in colored apparel And last of all didn t Brother Bulkley hear that a rumor was spread far and wide that this miserable backslider was to take to himself a wife in one of these strange women that very Jezebel who seduced him What do you call that It looks a good deal like human nature said the doctor musingly but I call it a cure THE INDISCRETION OF ELSBETH The American paused He had evidently lost his way For the last half hour he had been wandering in a medieval town in a profound medieval dream Only a few days had elapsed since he had left the steamship that carried him hither and the accents of his own tongue the idioms of his own people and the sympathetic community of New World tastes and expressions still filled his mind until he woke up or rather as it seemed to him was falling asleep in the past of this Old World town which had once held his ancestors Although a republican he had liked to think of them in quaint distinctive garb representing state and importance perhaps even aristocratic pre eminence content to let the responsibility of such bad eminence rest with them entirely but a habit of conscientiousness and love for historic truth eventually led him also to regard an honest BAUER standing beside his cattle in the quaint market place or a kindly faced black eyed DIENSTMADCHEN in a doorway with a timid respectful interest as a possible type of his progenitors For unlike some of his traveling countrymen in Europe he was not a snob and it struck him as an American that it was perhaps better to think of his race as having improved than as having degenerated In these ingenuous meditations he had passed the long rows of quaint high houses whose sagging roofs and unpatched dilapidations were yet far removed from squalor until he had reached the road bordered by poplars all so unlike his own country s waysides and knew that he had wandered far from his hotel He did not care however to retrace his steps and return by the way he had come There was he reasoned some other street or turning that would eventually bring him to the market place and his hotel and yet extend his experience of the town He turned at right angles into a narrow grass lane which was however as neatly kept and apparently as public as the highway A few moments walking convinced him that it was not a thoroughfare and that it led to the open gates of a park This had something of a public look which suggested that his intrusion might be at least a pardonable trespass and he relied like most strangers on the exonerating quality of a stranger s ignorance The park lay in the direction he wished to go and yet it struck him as singular that a park of such extent should be still allowed to occupy such valuable urban space Indeed its length seemed to be illimitable as he wandered on until he became conscious that he must have again lost his way and he diverged toward the only boundary a high thickset hedge to the right whose line he had been following As he neared it he heard the sound of voices on the other side speaking in German with which he was unfamiliar Having as yet met no one and being now impressed with the fact that for a public place the park was singularly deserted he was conscious that his position was getting serious and he determined to take this only chance of inquiring his way The hedge was thinner in some places than in others and at times he could see not only the light through it but even the moving figures of the speakers and the occasional white flash of a summer gown At last he determined to penetrate it and with little difficulty emerged on the other side But here he paused motionless He found himself behind a somewhat formal and symmetrical group of figures with their backs toward him but all stiffened into attitudes as motionless as his own and all gazing with a monotonous intensity in the direction of a handsome building which had been invisible above the hedge but which now seemed to arise suddenly before him Some of the figures were in uniform Immediately before him but so slightly separated from the others that he was enabled to see the house between her and her companions he was confronted by the pretty back shoulders and blond braids of a young girl of twenty Convinced that he had unwittingly intruded upon some august ceremonial he instantly slipped back into the hedge but so silently that his momentary presence was evidently undetected When he regained the park side he glanced back through the interstices there was no movement of the figures nor break in the silence to indicate that his intrusion had been observed With a long breath of relief he hurried from the park It was late when he finally got back to his hotel But his little modern adventure had I fear quite outrun his previous medieval reflections and almost his first inquiry of the silver chained porter in the courtyard was in regard to the park There was no public park in Alstadt The Herr possibly alluded to the Hof Gardens the Schloss which was in the direction he indicated The Schloss was the residency of the hereditary Grand Duke JA WOHL He was stopping there with several Hoheiten There was naturally a party there a family reunion But it was a private enclosure At times when the Grand Duke was not in residence it was open to the public In point of fact at such times tickets of admission were to be had at the hotel for fifty pfennige each There was not of truth much to see except a model farm and dairy the pretty toy of a previous Grand Duchess But he seemed destined to come into closer collision with the modern life of Alstadt On entering the hotel wearied by his long walk he passed the landlord and a man in half military uniform on the landing near his room As he entered his apartment he had a vague impression without exactly knowing why that the landlord and the military stranger had just left it This feeling was deepened by the evident disarrangement of certain articles in his unlocked portmanteau and the disorganization of his writing case A wave of indignation passed over him It was followed by a knock at the door and the landlord blandly appeared with the stranger A thousand pardons said the former smilingly but Herr Sanderman the Ober Inspector of Police wishes to speak with you I hope we are not intruding Not NOW said the American dryly The two exchanged a vacant and deprecating smile I have to ask only a few formal questions said the Ober Inspector in excellent but somewhat precise English to supplement the report which as a stranger you may not know is required by the police from the landlord in regard to the names and quality of his guests who are foreign to the town You have a passport I have said the American still more dryly But I do not keep it in an unlocked portmanteau or an open writing case An admirable precaution said Sanderman with unmoved politeness May I see it Thanks he added glancing over the document which the American produced from his pocket I see that you are a born American citizen and an earlier knowledge of that fact would have prevented this little contretemps You are aware mister Hoffman that your name is German It was borne by my ancestors who came from this country two centuries ago said Hoffman curtly We are indeed honored by your return to it returned Sanderman suavely but it was the circumstance of your name being a local one and the possibility of your still being a German citizen liable to unperformed military duty which has caused the trouble His manner was clearly civil and courteous but Hoffman felt that all the time his own face and features were undergoing a profound scrutiny from the speaker And you are making sure that you will know me again said Hoffman with a smile I trust indeed both returned Sanderman with a bow although you will permit me to say that your description here pointing to the passport scarcely does you justice ACH GOTT it is the same in all countries the official eye is not that of the young DAMEN Hoffman though not conceited had not lived twenty years without knowing that he was very good looking yet there was something in the remark that caused him to color with a new uneasiness The Ober Inspector rose with another bow and moved toward the door I hope you will let me make amends for this intrusion by doing anything I can to render your visit here a pleasant one Perhaps he added it is not for long But Hoffman evaded the evident question as he resented what he imagined was a possible sneer I have not yet determined my movements he said The Ober Inspector brought his heels together in a somewhat stiffer military salute and departed Nothing however could have exceeded the later almost servile urbanity of the landlord who seemed to have been proud of the official visit to his guest He was profuse in his attentions and even introduced him to a singularly artistic looking man of middle age wearing an order in his buttonhole whom he met casually in the hall Our Court photographer explained the landlord with some fervor at whose studio only a few houses distant most of the Hoheiten and Prinzessinen of Germany have sat for their likenesses I should feel honored if the distinguished American Herr would give me a visit said the stranger gravely as he gazed at Hoffman with an intensity which recalled the previous scrutiny of the Police Inspector and I would be charmed if he would avail himself of my poor skill to transmit his picturesque features to my unique collection Hoffman returned a polite evasion to this invitation although he was conscious of being struck with this second examination of his face and the allusion to his personality The next morning the porter met him with a mysterious air The Herr would still like to see the Schloss Hoffman who had quite forgotten his adventure in the park looked vacant JA WOHL the Hof authorities had no doubt heard of his visit and had intimated to the hotel proprietor that he might have permission to visit the model farm and dairy As the American still looked indifferent the porter pointed out with some importance that it was a Ducal courtesy not to be lightly treated that few indeed of the burghers themselves had ever been admitted to this eccentric whim of the late Grand Duchess He would of course be silent about it the Court would not like it known that they had made an exception to their rules in favor of a foreigner he would enter quickly and boldly alone There would be a housekeeper or a dairymaid to show him over the place More amused at this important mystery over what he as an American was inclined to classify as a free pass to a somewhat heavy side show he gravely accepted the permission and the next morning after breakfast set out to visit the model farm and dairy Dismissing his driver as he had been instructed Hoffman entered the gateway with a mingling of expectancy and a certain amusement over the boldness which the porter had suggested should characterize his entrance Before him was a beautifully kept lane bordered by arbored and trellised roses which seemed to sink into the distance He was instinctively following it when he became aware that he was mysteriously accompanied by a man in the livery of a chasseur who was walking among the trees almost abreast of him keeping pace with his step and after the first introductory military salute preserving a ceremonious silence There was something so ludicrous in this solemn procession toward a peaceful rural industry that by the time they had reached the bottom of the lane the American had quite recovered his good humor But here a new astonishment awaited him Nestling before him in a green amphitheater lay a little wooden farm yard and outbuildings which irresistibly suggested that it had been recently unpacked and set up from a box of Nuremberg toys The symmetrical trees the galleried houses with preternaturally glazed windows even the spotty disproportionately sized cows in the white fenced barnyards were all unreal wooden and toylike Crossing a miniature bridge over a little stream from which he was quite prepared to hook metallic fish with a magnet their own size he looked about him for some real being to dispel the illusion The mysterious chasseur had disappeared But under the arch of an arbor which seemed to be composed of silk ribbons green glass and pink tissue paper stood a quaint but delightful figure At first it seemed as if he had only dispelled one illusion for another For the figure before him might have been made of Dresden china so daintily delicate and unique it was in color and arrangement It was that of a young girl dressed in some forgotten medieval peasant garb of velvet braids silver staylaced corsage lace sleeves and helmeted metallic comb But after the Dresden method the pale yellow of her hair was repeated in her bodice the pink of her cheeks was in the roses of her chintz overskirt The blue of her eyes was the blue of her petticoat the dazzling whiteness of her neck shone again in the sleeves and stockings Nevertheless she was real and human for the pink deepened in her cheeks as Hoffman s hat flew from his head and she recognized the civility with a grave little curtsy You have come to see the dairy she said in quaintly accurate English I will show you the way If you please said Hoffman gaily but But what she said facing him suddenly with absolutely astonished eyes Hoffman looked into them so long that their frank wonder presently contracted into an ominous mingling of restraint and resentment Nothing daunted however he went on Couldn t we shake all that The look of wonder returned Shake all that she repeated I do not understand Well I m not positively aching to see cows and you must be sick of showing them I think too I ve about sized the whole show Wouldn t it be better if we sat down in that arbor supposing it won t fall down and you told me all about the lot It would save you a heap of trouble and keep your pretty frock cleaner than trapesing round Of course he said with a quick transition to the gentlest courtesy if you re conscientious about this thing we ll go on and not spare a cow Consider me in it with you for the whole morning She looked at him again and then suddenly broke into a charming laugh It revealed a set of strong white teeth as well as a certain barbaric trace in its cadence which civilized restraint had not entirely overlaid I suppose she really is a peasant in spite of that pretty frock he said to himself as he laughed too But her face presently took a shade of reserve and with a gentle but singular significance she said I think you must see the dairy Hoffman s hat was in his hand with a vivacity that tumbled the brown curls on his forehead By all means he said instantly and began walking by her side in modest but easy silence Now that he thought her a conscientious peasant he was quiet and respectful Presently she lifted her eyes which despite her gravity had not entirely lost their previous mirthfulness and said But you Americans in your rich and prosperous country with your large lands and your great harvests you must know all about farming Never was in a dairy in my life said Hoffman gravely I m from the city of New York where the cows give swill milk and are kept in cellars Her eyebrows contracted prettily in an effort to understand Then she apparently gave it up and said with a slanting glint of mischief in her eyes Then you come here like the other Americans in hope to see the Grand Duke and Duchess and the Princesses No The fact is I almost tumbled into a lot of em standing like wax figures the other side of the park lodge the other day and got away as soon as I could I think I prefer the cows Her head was slightly turned away He had to content himself with looking down upon the strong feet in their serviceable but smartly buckled shoes that uplifted her upright figure as she moved beside him Of course he added with boyish but unmistakable courtesy if it s part of your show to trot out the family why I m in that too I dare say you could make them interesting But why she said with her head still slightly turned away toward a figure a sturdy looking woman which for the first time Hoffman perceived was walking in a line with them as the chasseur had done why did you come here at all The first time was a fool accident he returned frankly I was making a short cut through what I thought was a public park The second time was because I had been rude to a Police Inspector whom I found going through my things but who apologized as I suppose by getting me an invitation from the Grand Duke to come here and I thought it only the square thing to both of em to accept it But I m mighty glad I came I wouldn t have missed YOU for a thousand dollars You see I haven t struck anyone I cared to talk to since Here he suddenly remarked that she hadn t looked at him and that the delicate whiteness of her neck was quite suffused with pink and stopped instantly Presently he said quite easily Who s the chorus The lady Yes She s watching us as if she didn t quite approve you know just as if she didn t catch on She s the head housekeeper of the farm Perhaps you would prefer to have her show you the dairy shall I call her The figure in question was very short and stout with voluminous petticoats Please don t I ll stay without your setting that paperweight on me But here s the dairy Don t let her come inside among those pans of fresh milk with that smile or there ll be trouble The young girl paused too made a slight gesture with her hand and the figure passed on as they entered the dairy It was beautifully clean and fresh With a persistence that he quickly recognized as mischievous and ironical and with his characteristic adaptability accepted with even greater gravity and assumption of interest she showed him all the details From thence they passed to the farmyard where he hung with breathless attention over the names of the cows and made her repeat them Although she was evidently familiar with the subject he could see that her zeal was fitful and impatient Suppose we sit down he said pointing to an ostentatious rustic seat in the center of the green Sir down she repeated wonderingly What for To talk We ll knock off and call it half a day But if you are not looking at the farm you are of course going she said quickly Am I I don t think these particulars were in my invitation She again broke into a fit of laughter and at the same time cast a bright eye around the field Come he said gently there are no other sightseers waiting and your conscience is clear and he moved toward the rustic seat Certainly not there she added in a low voice They moved on slowly together to a copse of willows which overhung the miniature stream You are not staying long in Alstadt she said No I only came to see the old town that my ancestors came from They were walking so close together that her skirt brushed his trousers but she suddenly drew away from him and looking him fixedly in the eye said Ah you have relations here Yes but they are dead two hundred years She laughed again with a slight expression of relief They had entered the copse and were walking in dense shadow when she suddenly stopped and sat down upon a rustic bench To his surprise he found that they were quite alone Tell me about these relatives she said slightly drawing aside her skirt to make room for him on the seat He did not require a second invitation He not only told her all about his ancestral progenitors but I fear even about those more recent and more nearly related to him about his own life his vocation he was a clever newspaper correspondent with a roving commission his ambitions his beliefs and his romance And then perhaps of this visit you will also make copy He smiled at her quick adaptation of his professional slang but shook his head No he said gravely No this is YOU The CHICAGO INTERVIEWER is big pay and is rich but it hasn t capital enough to buy you from me He gently slid his hand toward hers and slipped his fingers softly around it She made a slight movement of withdrawal but even then as if in forgetfulness or indifference permitted her hand to rest unresponsively in his It was scarcely an encouragement to gallantry neither was it a rejection of an unconscious familiarity But you haven t told me about yourself he said Oh I she returned with her first approach to coquetry in a laugh and a sidelong glance of what importance is that to you It is the Grand Duchess and Her Highness the Princess that you Americans seek to know I am what I am as you see You bet said Hoffman with charming decision I WHAT You ARE you know and that s good enough for me but I don t even know your name She laughed again and after a pause said Elsbeth But I couldn t call you by your first name on our first meeting you know Then you Americans are really so very formal eh she said slyly looking at her imprisoned hand Well yes returned Hoffman disengaging it I suppose we are respectful or mean to be But whom am I to inquire for To write to You are neither to write nor inquire What She had moved in her seat so as to half face him with eyes in which curiosity mischief and a certain seriousness alternated but for the first time seemed conscious of his hand and accented her words with a slight pressure You are to return to your hotel presently and say to your landlord Pack up my luggage I have finished with this old town and my ancestors and the Grand Duke whom I do not care to see and I shall leave Alstadt tomorrow Thank you I don t catch on Of what necessity should you I have said it That should be enough for a chivalrous American like you She again significantly looked down at her hand If you mean that you know the extent of the favor you ask of me I can say no more he said seriously but give me some reason for it Ah so she said with a slight shrug of her shoulders Then I must tell you You say you do not know the Grand Duke and Duchess Well THEY KNOW YOU The day before yesterday you were wandering in the park as you admit You say also you got through the hedge and interrupted some ceremony That ceremony was not a Court function mister Hoffman but something equally sacred the photographing of the Ducal family before the Schloss You say that you instantly withdrew But after the photograph was taken the plate revealed a stranger standing actually by the side of the Princess Alexandrine and even taking the PAS of the Grand Duke himself That stranger was you And the picture was spoiled said the American with a quiet laugh I should not say that returned the lady with a demure glance at her companion s handsome face and I do not believe that the Princess who first saw the photograph thought so either But she is very young and willful and has the reputation of being very indiscreet and unfortunately she begged the photographer not to destroy the plate but to give it to her and to say nothing about it except that the plate was defective and to take another Still it would have ended there if her curiosity had not led her to confide a description of the stranger to the Police Inspector with the result you know Then I am expected to leave town because I accidentally stumbled into a family group that was being photographed Because a certain Princess was indiscreet enough to show her curiosity about you corrected the fair stranger But look here I ll apologize to the Princess and offer to pay for the plate Then you do want to see the Princess said the young girl smiling you are like the others Bother the Princess I want to see YOU And I don t see how they can prevent it if I choose to remain Very easily You will find that there is something wrong with your passport and you will be sent on to Pumpernickel for examination You will unwittingly transgress some of the laws of the town and be ordered to leave it You will be shadowed by the police until you quarrel with them like a free American and you are conducted to the frontier Perhaps you will strike an officer who has insulted you and then you are finished on the spot The American s crest rose palpably until it cocked his straw hat over his curls Suppose I am content to risk it having first laid the whole matter and its trivial cause before the American Minister so that he could make it hot for this whole caboodle of a country if they happened to down me By Jove I shouldn t mind being the martyr of an international episode if they d spare me long enough to let me get the first copy over to the other side His eyes sparkled You could expose them but they would then deny the whole story and you have no evidence They would demand to know your informant and I should be disgraced and the Princess who is already talked about made a subject of scandal But no matter It is right that an American s independence shall not be interfered with She raised the hem of her handkerchief to her blue eyes and slightly turned her head aside Hoffman gently drew the handkerchief away and in so doing possessed himself of her other hand Look here Miss Miss Elsbeth You know I wouldn t give you away whatever happened But couldn t I get hold of that photographer I saw him he wanted me to sit to him and make him tell me He wanted you to sit to him she said hurriedly and did you No he replied He was a little too fresh and previous though I thought he fancied some resemblance in me to somebody else Ah She said something to herself in German which he did not understand and then added aloud You did well he is a bad man this photographer Promise me you shall not sit for him How can I if I m fired out of the place like this He added ruefully But I d like to make him give himself away to me somehow He will not and if he did he would deny it afterward Do not go near him nor see him Be careful that he does not photograph you with his instantaneous instrument when you are passing Now you must go I must see the Princess Let me go too I will explain it to her said Hoffman She stopped looked at him keenly and attempted to withdraw her hands Ah then it IS so It is the Princess you wish to see You are curious you too you wish to see this lady who is interested in you I ought to have known it You are all alike He met her gaze with laughing frankness accepting her outburst as a charming feminine weakness half jealousy half coquetry but retained her hands Nonsense he said I wish to see her that I may have the right to see you that you shall not lose your place here through me that I may come again You must never come here again Then you must come where I am We will meet somewhere when you have an afternoon off You shall show me the town the houses of my ancestors their tombs possibly if the Grand Duke rampages the probable site of my own She looked into his laughing eyes with her clear stedfast gravely questioning blue ones Do not you Americans know that it is not the fashion here in Germany for the young men and the young women to walk together unless they are VERLOBT VER which Engaged She nodded her head thrice viciously decidedly mischievously So much the better ACH GOTT She made a gesture of hopelessness at his incorrigibility and again attempted to withdraw her hands I must go now Well then good by It was easy to draw her closer by simply lowering her still captive hands Then he suddenly kissed her coldly startled lips and instantly released her She as instantly vanished Elsbeth he called quickly Elsbeth Her now really frightened face reappeared with a heightened color from the dense foliage quite to his astonishment Hush she said with her finger on her lips Are you mad I only wanted to remind you to square me with the Princess he laughed as her head disappeared He strolled back toward the gate Scarcely had he quitted the shrubbery before the same chasseur made his appearance with precisely the same salute and keeping exactly the same distance accompanied him to the gate At the corner of the street he hailed a droshky and was driven to his hotel The landlord came up smiling He trusted that the Herr had greatly enjoyed himself at the Schloss It was a distinguished honor in fact quite unprecedented Hoffman while he determined not to commit himself nor his late fair companion was nevertheless anxious to learn something more of her relations to the Schloss So pretty so characteristic and marked a figure must be well known to sightseers Indeed once or twice the idea had crossed his mind with a slightly jealous twinge that left him more conscious of the impression she had made on him than he had deemed possible He asked if the model farm and dairy were always shown by the same attendants ACH GOTT no doubt yes His Royal Highness had quite a retinue when he was in residence And were these attendants in costume There was undoubtedly a livery for the servants Hoffman felt a slight republican irritation at the epithet he knew not why But this costume was rather a historical one surely it was not entrusted to everyday menials and he briefly described it His host s blank curiosity suddenly changed to a look of mysterious and arch intelligence ACH GOTT yes He remembered now with his finger on his nose that when there was a fest at the Schloss the farm and dairy were filled with shepherdesses in quaint costume worn by the ladies of the Grand Duke s own theatrical company who assumed the characters with great vivacity Surely it was the same and the Grand Duke had treated the Herr to this special courtesy Yes there was one pretty blonde young lady the Fraulein Wimpfenbuttel a most popular soubrette who would play it to the life And the description fitted her to a hair Ah there was no doubt of it many persons indeed had been so deceived But happily now that he had given him the wink the Herr could corroborate it himself by going to the theater tonight Ah it would be a great joke quite colossal if he took a front seat where she could see him And the good man rubbed his hands in gleeful anticipation Hoffman had listened to him with a slow repugnance that was only equal to his gradual conviction that the explanation was a true one and that he himself had been ridiculously deceived The mystery of his fair companion s costume which he had accepted as part of the show the inconsistency of her manner and her evident occupation her undeniable wish to terminate the whole episode with that single interview her mingling of worldly aplomb and rustic innocence her perfect self control and experienced acceptance of his gallantry under the simulated attitude of simplicity all now struck him as perfectly comprehensible He recalled the actress s inimitable touch in certain picturesque realistic details in the dairy which she had not spared him he recognized it now even in their bowered confidences how like a pretty ballet scene their whole interview on the rustic bench was and it breathed through their entire conversation to their theatrical parting at the close And the whole story of the photograph was no doubt as pure a dramatic invention as the rest The Princess s romantic interest in him that Princess who had never appeared why had he not detected the old well worn sentimental situation here was all a part of it The dark mysterious hint of his persecution by the police was a necessary culmination to the little farce Thank Heaven he had not risen at the Princess even if he had given himself away to the clever actress in her own humble role Then the humor of the whole situation predominated and he laughed until the tears came to his eyes and his forgotten ancestors might have turned over in their graves without his heeding them And with this humanizing influence upon him he went to the theater It was capacious even for the town and although the performance was a special one he had no difficulty in getting a whole box to himself He tried to avoid this public isolation by sitting close to the next box where there was a solitary occupant an officer apparently as lonely as himself He had made up his mind that when his fair deceiver appeared he would let her see by his significant applause that he recognized her but bore no malice for the trick she had played on him After all he had kissed her he had no right to complain If she should recognize him and this recognition led to a withdrawal of her prohibition and their better acquaintance he would be a fool to cavil at her pleasant artifice Her vocation was certainly a more independent and original one than that he had supposed for its social quality and inequality he cared nothing He found himself longing for the glance of her calm blue eyes for the pleasant smile that broke the seriousness of her sweetly restrained lips There was no doubt that he should know her even as the heroine of DER CZAR UND DER ZIMMERMANN on the bill before him He was becoming impatient And the performance evidently was waiting A stir in the outer gallery the clatter of sabers the filing of uniforms into the royal box and a triumphant burst from the orchestra showed the cause As a few ladies and gentlemen in full evening dress emerged from the background of uniforms and took their places in the front of the box Hoffman looked with some interest for the romantic Princess Suddenly he saw a face and shoulders in a glitter of diamonds that startled him and then a glance that transfixed him He leaned over to his neighbor Who is the young lady in the box The Princess Alexandrine I mean the young lady in blue with blond hair and blue eyes It is the Princess Alexandrine Elsbeth Marie Stephanie the daughter of the Grand Duke there is none other there Thank you He sat silently looking at the rising curtain and the stage Then he rose quietly gathered his hat and coat and left the box When he reached the gallery he turned instinctively and looked back at the royal box Her eyes had followed him and as he remained a moment motionless in the doorway her lips parted in a grateful smile and she waved her fan with a faint but unmistakable gesture of farewell The next morning he left Alstadt There was some little delay at the Zoll on the frontier and when Hoffman received back his trunk it was accompanied by a little sealed packet which was handed to him by the Customhouse Inspector Hoffman did not open it until he was alone There hangs upon the wall of his modest apartment in New York a narrow irregular photograph ingeniously framed of himself standing side by side with a young German girl who in the estimation of his compatriots is by no means stylish and only passably good looking When he is joked by his friends about the post of honor given to this production and questioned as to the lady he remains silent The Princess Alexandrine Elsbeth Marie Stephanie von Westphalen Alstadt among her other royal qualities knew whom to trust THE DEVOTION OF ENRIQUEZ In another chronicle which dealt with the exploits of Chu Chu a Californian mustang I gave some space to the accomplishments of Enriquez Saltillo who assisted me in training her and who was also brother to Consuelo Saitillo the young lady to whom I had freely given both the mustang and my youthful affections I consider it a proof of the superiority of masculine friendship that neither the subsequent desertion of the mustang nor that of the young lady ever made the slightest difference to Enriquez or me in our exalted amity To a wondering doubt as to what I ever could possibly have seen in his sister to admire he joined a tolerant skepticism of the whole sex This he was wont to express in that marvelous combination of Spanish precision and California slang for which he was justly famous As to thees women and their little game he would say believe me my friend your old Oncle Enry is not in it No he will ever take a back seat when lofe is around For why Regard me here If she is a horse you shall say She will buck jump She will ess shy She will not arrive or She will arrive too quick But if it is thees women where are you For when you shall say She will ess shy look you she will walk straight or she will remain tranquil when you think she buck jump or else she will arrive and look you you will not You shall get left It is ever so My father and the brother of my father have both make court to my mother when she was but a senorita My father think she have lofe his brother more So he say to her It is enofe tranquillize yourself I will go I will efface myself Adios Shake hands Ta ta So long See you again in the fall And what make my mother Regard me She marry my father on the instant Of thees women believe me Pancho you shall know nothing Not even if they shall make you the son of your father or his nephew I have recalled this characteristic speech to show the general tendency of Enriquez convictions at the opening of this little story It is only fair to say however that his usual attitude toward the sex he so cheerfully maligned exhibited little apprehension or caution in dealing with them Among the frivolous and light minded intermixture of his race he moved with great freedom and popularity He danced well when we went to fandangos together his agility and the audacity of his figures always procured him the prettiest partners his professed sentiments I presume shielding him from subsequent jealousies heartburnings or envy I have a vivid recollection of him in the mysteries of the SEMICUACUA a somewhat corybantic dance which left much to the invention of the performers and very little to the imagination of the spectator In one of the figures a gaudy handkerchief waved more or less gracefully by dancer and danseuse before the dazzled eyes of each other acted as love s signal and was used to express alternate admiration and indifference shyness and audacity fear and transport coyness and coquetry as the dance proceeded I need not say that Enriquez pantomimic illustration of these emotions was peculiarly extravagant but it was always performed and accepted with a gravity that was an essential feature of the dance At such times sighs would escape him which were supposed to portray the incipient stages of passion snorts of jealousy burst from him at the suggestion of a rival he was overtaken by a sort of saint Vitus s dance that expressed his timidity in making the first advances of affection the scorn of his ladylove struck him with something like a dumb ague and a single gesture of invitation from her produced marked delirium All this was very like Enriquez but on the particular occasion to which I refer I think no one was prepared to see him begin the figure with the waving of FOUR handkerchiefs Yet this he did pirouetting capering brandishing his silken signals like a ballerina s scarf in the languishment or fire of passion until in a final figure where the conquered and submitting fair one usually sinks into the arms of her partner need it be said that the ingenious Enriquez was found in the center of the floor supporting four of the dancers Yet he was by no means unduly excited either by the plaudits of the crowd or by his evident success with the fair Ah believe me it is nothing he said quietly rolling a fresh cigarette as he leaned against the doorway Possibly I shall have to offer the chocolate or the wine to thees girls or make to them a promenade in the moonlight on the veranda It is ever so Unless my friend he said suddenly turning toward me in an excess of chivalrous self abnegation unless you shall yourself take my place Behold I gif them to you I vamos I vanish I make track I skedaddle I think he would have carried his extravagance to the point of summoning his four gypsy witches of partners and committing them to my care if the crowd had not at that moment parted before the remaining dancers and left one of the onlookers a tall slender girl calmly surveying them through gold rimmed eyeglasses in complete critical absorption I stared in amazement and consternation for I recognized in the fair stranger Miss Urania Mannersley the Congregational minister s niece Everybody knew Rainie Mannersley throughout the length and breadth of the Encinal She was at once the envy and the goad of the daughters of those Southwestern and Eastern immigrants who had settled in the valley She was correct she was critical she was faultless and observant She was proper yet independent she was highly educated she was suspected of knowing Latin and Greek she even spelled correctly She could wither the plainest field nosegay in the hands of other girls by giving the flowers their botanical names She never said Ain t you but Aren t you She looked upon Did I which as an incomplete and imperfect form of What did I do She quoted from Browning and Tennyson and was believed to have read them She was from Boston What could she possibly be doing at a free and easy fandango Even if these facts were not already familiar to everyone there her outward appearance would have attracted attention Contrasted with the gorgeous red black and yellow skirts of the dancers her plain tightly fitting gown and hat all of one delicate gray were sufficiently notable in themselves even had they not seemed like the girl herself a kind of quiet protest to the glaring flounces before her Her small straight waist and flat back brought into greater relief the corsetless waistless swaying figures of the Mexican girls and her long slim well booted feet peeping from the stiff white edges of her short skirt made their broad low quartered slippers held on by the big toe appear more preposterous than ever Suddenly she seemed to realize that she was standing there alone but without fear or embarrassment She drew back a little glancing carelessly behind her as if missing some previous companion and then her eyes fell upon mine She smiled an easy recognition then a moment later her glance rested more curiously upon Enriquez who was still by my side I disengaged myself and instantly joined her particularly as I noticed that a few of the other bystanders were beginning to stare at her with little reserve Isn t it the most extraordinary thing you ever saw she said quietly Then presently noticing the look of embarrassment on my face she went on more by way of conversation than of explanation I just left uncle making a call on a parishioner next door and was going home with Jocasta a peon servant of her uncle s when I heard the music and dropped in I don t know what has become of her she added glancing round the room again she seemed perfectly wild when she saw that creature over there bounding about with his handkerchiefs You were speaking to him just now Do tell me is he real I should think there was little doubt of that I said with a vague laugh You know what I mean she said simply Is he quite sane Does he do that because he likes it or is he paid for it This was too much I pointed out somewhat hurriedly that he was a scion of one of the oldest Castilian families that the performance was a national gypsy dance which he had joined in as a patriot and a patron and that he was my dearest friend At the same time I was conscious that I wished she hadn t seen his last performance You don t mean to say that all that he did was in the dance she said I don t believe it It was only like him As I hesitated over this palpable truth she went on I do wish he d do it again Don t you think you could make him Perhaps he might if YOU asked him I said a little maliciously Of course I shouldn t do that she returned quietly All the same I do believe he is really going to do it or something else Do look I looked and to my horror saw that Enriquez possibly incited by the delicate gold eyeglasses of Miss Mannersley had divested himself of his coat and was winding the four handkerchiefs tied together picturesquely around his waist preparatory to some new performance I tried furtively to give him a warning look but in vain Isn t he really too absurd for anything said Miss Mannersley yet with a certain comfortable anticipation in her voice You know I never saw anything like this before I wouldn t have believed such a creature could have existed Even had I succeeded in warning him I doubt if it would have been of any avail For seizing a guitar from one of the musicians he struck a few chords and suddenly began to zigzag into the center of the floor swaying his body languishingly from side to side in time with the music and the pitch of a thin Spanish tenor It was a gypsy love song Possibly Miss Mannersley s lingual accomplishments did not include a knowledge of Castilian but she could not fail to see that the gestures and illustrative pantomime were addressed to her Passionately assuring her that she was the most favored daughter of the Virgin that her eyes were like votive tapers and yet in the same breath accusing her of being a brigand and assassin in her attitude toward his heart he balanced with quivering timidity toward her threw an imaginary cloak in front of her neat boots as a carpet for her to tread on and with a final astonishing pirouette and a languishing twang of his guitar sank on one knee and blew with a rose a kiss at her feet If I had been seriously angry with him before for his grotesque extravagance I could have pitied him now for the young girl s absolute unconsciousness of anything but his utter ludicrousness The applause of dancers and bystanders was instantaneous and hearty her only contribution to it was a slight parting of her thin red lips in a half incredulous smile In the silence that followed the applause as Enriquez walked pantingly away I heard her saying half to herself Certainly a most extraordinary creature In my indignation I could not help turning suddenly upon her and looking straight into her eyes They were brown with that peculiar velvet opacity common to the pupils of nearsighted persons and seemed to defy internal scrutiny She only repeated carelessly Isn t he and added Please see if you can find Jocasta I suppose we ought to be going now and I dare say he won t be doing it again Ah there she is Good gracious child what have you got there It was Enriquez rose which Jocasta had picked up and was timidly holding out toward her mistress Heavens I don t want it Keep it yourself I walked with them to the door as I did not fancy a certain glitter in the black eyes of the Senoritas Manuela and Pepita who were watching her curiously But I think she was as oblivious of this as she was of Enriquez particular attentions As we reached the street I felt that I ought to say something more You know I began casually that although those poor people meet here in this public way their gathering is really quite a homely pastoral and a national custom and these girls are all honest hardworking peons or servants enjoying themselves in quite the old idyllic fashion Certainly said the young girl half abstractedly Of course it s a Moorish dance originally brought over I suppose by those old Andalusian immigrants two hundred years ago It s quite Arabic in its suggestions I have got something like it in an old CANCIONERO I picked up at a bookstall in Boston But she added with a gasp of reminiscent satisfaction that s not like HIM Oh no HE is decidedly original Heavens yes I turned away in some discomfiture to join Enriquez who was calmly awaiting me with a cigarette in his mouth outside the sala Yet he looked so unconscious of any previous absurdity that I hesitated in what I thought was a necessary warning He however quickly precipitated it Glancing after the retreating figures of the two women he said Thees mees from Boston is return to her house You do not accompany her I shall Behold me I am there But I linked my arm firmly in his Then I pointed out first that she was already accompanied by a servant secondly that if I who knew her had hesitated to offer myself as an escort it was hardly proper for him a perfect stranger to take that liberty that Miss Mannersley was very punctilious of etiquette which he as a Castilian gentleman ought to appreciate But will she not regard lofe the admiration excessif he said twirling his thin little mustache meditatively No she will not I returned sharply and you ought to understand that she is on a different level from your Manuelas and Carmens Pardon my friend he said gravely thees women are ever the same There is a proverb in my language Listen Whether the sharp blade of the Toledo pierce the satin or the goatskin it shall find behind it ever the same heart to wound I am that Toledo blade possibly it is you my friend Wherefore let us together pursue this girl of Boston on the instant But I kept my grasp on Enriquez arm and succeeded in restraining his mercurial impulses for the moment He halted and puffed vigorously at his cigarette but the next instant he started forward again Let us however follow with discretion in the rear we shall pass her house we shall gaze at it it shall touch her heart Ridiculous as was this following of the young girl we had only just parted from I nevertheless knew that Enriquez was quite capable of attempting it alone and I thought it better to humor him by consenting to walk with him in that direction but I felt it necessary to say I ought to warn you that Miss Mannersley already looks upon your performances at the sala as something outre and peculiar and if I were you I shouldn t do anything to deepen that impression You are saying she ees shock said Enriquez gravely I felt I could not conscientiously say that she was shocked and he saw my hesitation Then she have jealousy of the senoritas he observed with insufferable complacency You observe I have already said It is ever so I could stand it no longer Look here Harry I said if you must know it she looks upon you as an acrobat a paid performer Ah his black eyes sparkled the torero the man who fights the bull he is also an acrobat Yes but she thinks you a clown a GRACIOSO DE TEATRO there Then I have make her laugh he said coolly I don t think he had but I shrugged my shoulders BUENO he said cheerfully Lofe he begin with a laugh he make feenish with a sigh I turned to look at him in the moonlight His face presented its habitual Spanish gravity a gravity that was almost ironical His small black eyes had their characteristic irresponsible audacity the irresponsibility of the vivacious young animal It could not be possible that he was really touched with the placid frigidities of Miss Mannersley I remembered his equally elastic gallantries with Miss Pinkey Smith a blonde Western belle from which both had harmlessly rebounded As we walked on slowly I continued more persuasively Of course this is only your nonsense but don t you see Miss Mannersley thinks it all in earnest and really your nature I hesitated for it suddenly struck me that it WAS really his nature And hang it all you don t want her to believe you a common buffoon or some intoxicated muchacho Intoxicated repeated Enriquez with exasperating languishment Yes that is the word that shall express itself My friend you have made a shot in the center you have ring the bell every time It is intoxication but not of aguardiente Look I have long time an ancestor of whom is a pretty story One day in church he have seen a young girl a mere peasant girl pass to the confessional He look her in her eye he stagger here Enriquez wobbled pantomimically into the road he fall he would have suited the action to the word if I had not firmly held him up They have taken him home where he have remain without his clothes and have dance and sing But it was the drunkenness of lofe And look you thees village girl was a nothing not even pretty The name of my ancestor was Don Quixote de La Mancha I suggested maliciously I suspected as much Come along That will do My ancestor s name continued Enriquez gravely was Antonio Hermenegildo de Salvatierra which is not the same Thees Don Quixote of whom you speak exist not at all Never mind Only for heaven s sake as we are nearing the house don t make a fool of yourself again It was a wonderful moonlight night The deep redwood porch of the Mannersley parsonage under the shadow of a great oak the largest in the Encinal was diapered in black and silver As the women stepped upon the porch their shadows were silhouetted against the door Miss Mannersley paused for an instant and turned to give a last look at the beauty of the night as Jocasta entered Her glance fell upon us as we passed She nodded carelessly and unaffectedly to me but as she recognized Enriquez she looked a little longer at him with her previous cold and invincible curiosity To my horror Enriquez began instantly to affect a slight tremulousness of gait and a difficulty of breathing but I gripped his arm savagely and managed to get him past the house as the door closed finally on the young lady You do not comprehend friend Pancho he said gravely but those eyes in their glass are as the ESPEJO USTORIO the burning mirror They burn they consume me here like paper Let us affix to ourselves thees tree She will without doubt appear at her window We shall salute her for good night We will do nothing of the kind I said sharply Finding that I was determined he permitted me to lead him away I was delighted to notice however that he had indicated the window which I knew was the minister s study and that as the bedrooms were in the rear of the house this later incident was probably not overseen by the young lady or the servant But I did not part from Enriquez until I saw him safely back to the sala where I left him sipping chocolate his arm alternating around the waists of his two previous partners in a delightful Arcadian and childlike simplicity and an apparent utter forgetfulness of Miss Mannersley The fandangos were usually held on Saturday night and the next day being Sunday I missed Enriquez but as he was a devout Catholic I remembered that he was at mass in the morning and possibly at the bullfight at San Antonio in the afternoon But I was somewhat surprised on the Monday morning following as I was crossing the plaza to have my arm taken by the reverend mister Mannersley in the nearest approach to familiarity that was consistent with the reserve of this eminent divine I looked at him inquiringly Although scrupulously correct in attire his features always had a singular resemblance to the national caricature known as Uncle Sam but with the humorous expression left out Softly stroking his goatee with three fingers he began condescendingly You are I think more or less familiar with the characteristics and customs of the Spanish as exhibited by the settlers here A thrill of apprehension went through me Had he heard of Enriquez proceedings Had Miss Mannersley cruelly betrayed him to her uncle I have not given that attention myself to their language and social peculiarities he continued with a large wave of the hand being much occupied with a study of their religious beliefs and superstitions it struck me that this was apt to be a common fault of people of the Mannersley type but I have refrained from a personal discussion of them on the contrary I have held somewhat broad views on the subject of their remarkable missionary work and have suggested a scheme of company operation with them quite independent of doctrinal teaching to my brethren of other Protestant Christian sects These views I first incorporated in a sermon last Sunday week which I am told has created considerable attention He stopped and coughed slightly I have not yet heard from any of the Roman clergy but I am led to believe that my remarks were not ungrateful to Catholics generally I was relieved although still in some wonder why he should address me on this topic I had a vague remembrance of having heard that he had said something on Sunday which had offended some Puritans of his flock but nothing more He continued I have just said that I was unacquainted with the characteristics of the Spanish American race I presume however they have the impulsiveness of their Latin origin They gesticulate eh They express their gratitude their joy their affection their emotions generally by spasmodic movements They naturally dance sing eh A horrible suspicion crossed my mind I could only stare helplessly at him I see he said graciously perhaps it is a somewhat general question I will explain myself A rather singular occurrence happened to me the other night I had returned from visiting a parishioner and was alone in my study reviewing my sermon for the next day It must have been quite late before I concluded for I distinctly remember my niece had returned with her servant fully an hour before Presently I heard the sounds of a musical instrument in the road with the accents of someone singing or rehearsing some metrical composition in words that although couched in a language foreign to me in expression and modulation gave me the impression of being distinctly adulatory For some little time in the greater preoccupation of my task I paid little attention to the performance but its persistency at length drew me in no mere idle curiosity to the window From thence standing in my dressing gown and believing myself unperceived I noticed under the large oak in the roadside the figure of a young man who by the imperfect light appeared to be of Spanish extraction But I evidently miscalculated my own invisibility for he moved rapidly forward as I came to the window and in a series of the most extraordinary pantomimic gestures saluted me Beyond my experience of a few Greek plays in earlier days I confess I am not an adept in the understanding of gesticulation but it struck me that the various phases of gratitude fervor reverence and exaltation were successively portrayed He placed his hands upon his head his heart and even clasped them together in this manner To my consternation the reverend gentleman here imitated Enriquez most extravagant pantomime I am willing to confess he continued that I was singularly moved by them as well as by the highly creditable and Christian interest that evidently produced them At last I opened the window Leaning out I told him that I regretted that the lateness of the hour prevented any further response from me than a grateful though hurried acknowledgment of his praiseworthy emotion but that I should be glad to see him for a few moments in the vestry before service the next day or at early candlelight before the meeting of the Bible class I told him that as my sole purpose had been the creation of an evangelical brotherhood and the exclusion of merely doctrinal views nothing could be more gratifying to me than his spontaneous and unsolicited testimony to my motives He appeared for an instant to be deeply affected and indeed quite overcome with emotion and then gracefully retired with some agility and a slight saltatory movement He paused A sudden and overwhelming idea took possession of me and I looked impulsively into his face Was it possible that for once Enriquez ironical extravagance had been understood met and vanquished by a master hand But the reverend mister Mannersley s self satisfied face betrayed no ambiguity or lurking humor He was evidently in earnest he had complacently accepted for himself the abandoned Enriquez serenade to his niece I felt a hysterical desire to laugh but it was checked by my companion s next words I informed my niece of the occurrence in the morning at breakfast She had not heard anything of the strange performance but she agreed with me as to its undoubted origin in a grateful recognition of my liberal efforts toward his coreligionists It was she in fact who suggested that your knowledge of these people might corroborate my impressions I was dumfounded Had Miss Mannersley who must have recognized Enriquez hand in this concealed the fact in a desire to shield him But this was so inconsistent with her utter indifference to him except as a grotesque study that she would have been more likely to tell her uncle all about his previous performance Nor could it be that she wished to conceal her visit to the fandango She was far too independent for that and it was even possible that the reverend gentleman in his desire to know more of Enriquez compatriots would not have objected In my confusion I meekly added my conviction to hers congratulated him upon his evident success and slipped away But I was burning with a desire to see Enriquez and know all He was imaginative but not untruthful Unfortunately I learned that he was just then following one of his erratic impulses and had gone to a rodeo at his cousin s in the foothills where he was alternately exercising his horsemanship in catching and breaking wild cattle and delighting his relatives with his incomparable grasp of the American language and customs and of the airs of a young man of fashion Then my thoughts recurred to Miss Mannersley Had she really been oblivious that night to Enriquez serenade I resolved to find out if I could without betraying Enriquez Indeed it was possible after all that it might not have been he Chance favored me The next evening I was at a party where Miss Mannersley by reason of her position and quality was a distinguished I had almost written a popular guest But as I have formerly stated although the youthful fair of the Encinal were flattered by her casual attentions and secretly admired her superior style and aristocratic calm they were more or less uneasy under the dominance of her intelligence and education and were afraid to attempt either confidence or familiarity They were also singularly jealous of her for although the average young man was equally afraid of her cleverness and her candor he was not above paying a tremulous and timid court to her for its effect upon her humbler sisters This evening she was surrounded by her usual satellites including of course the local notables and special guests of distinction She had been discussing I think the existence of glaciers on Mount Shasta with a spectacled geologist and had participated with charming frankness in a conversation on anatomy with the local doctor and a learned professor when she was asked to take a seat at the piano She played with remarkable skill and wonderful precision but coldly and brilliantly As she sat there in her subdued but perfectly fitting evening dress her regular profile and short but slender neck firmly set upon her high shoulders exhaling an atmosphere of refined puritanism and provocative intelligence the utter incongruity of Enriquez extravagant attentions if ironical and their equal hopelessness if not seemed to me plainer than ever What had this well poised coldly observant spinster to do with that quaintly ironic ruffler that romantic cynic that rowdy Don Quixote that impossible Enriquez Presently she ceased playing Her slim narrow slipper revealing her thin ankle remained upon the pedal her delicate fingers were resting idly on the keys her head was slightly thrown back and her narrow eyebrows prettily knit toward the ceiling in an effort of memory Something of Chopin s suggested the geologist ardently That exquisite sonata pleaded the doctor Suthin of Rubinstein Heard him once said a gentleman of Siskiyou He just made that pianner get up and howl Play Rube She shook her head with parted lips and a slight touch of girlish coquetry in her manner Then her fingers suddenly dropped upon the keys with a glassy tinkle there were a few quick pizzicato chords down went the low pedal with a monotonous strumming and she presently began to hum to herself I started as well I might for I recognized one of Enriquez favorite and most extravagant guitar solos It was audacious it was barbaric it was I fear vulgar As I remembered it as he sang it it recounted the adventures of one Don Francisco a provincial gallant and roisterer of the most objectionable type It had one hundred and four verses which Enriquez never spared me I shuddered as in a pleasant quiet voice the correct Miss Mannersley warbled in musical praise of the PELLEJO or wineskin and a eulogy of the dicebox came caressingly from her thin red lips But the company was far differently affected the strange wild air and wilder accompaniment were evidently catching people moved toward the piano somebody whistled the air from a distant corner even the faces of the geologist and doctor brightened A tarantella I presume blandly suggested the doctor Miss Mannersley stopped and rose carelessly from the piano It is a Moorish gypsy song of the fifteenth century she said dryly It seemed sorter familiar too hesitated one of the young men timidly like as if don t you know you had without knowing it don t you know he blushed slightly sorter picked it up somewhere I picked it up as you call it in the collection of medieval manuscripts of the Harvard Library and copied it returned Miss Mannersley coldly as she turned away But I was not inclined to let her off so easily I presently made my way to her side Your uncle was complimentary enough to consult me as to the meaning of the appearance of a certain exuberant Spanish visitor at his house the other night I looked into her brown eyes but my own slipped off her velvety pupils without retaining anything Then she reinforced her gaze with a pince nez and said carelessly Oh it s you How are you Well could you give him any information Only generally I returned still looking into her eyes These people are impulsive The Spanish blood is a mixture of gold and quicksilver She smiled slightly That reminds me of your volatile friend He was mercurial enough certainly Is he still dancing And singing sometimes I responded pointedly But she only added casually A singular creature without exhibiting the least consciousness and drifted away leaving me none the wiser I felt that Enriquez alone could enlighten me I must see him I did but not in the way I expected There was a bullfight at San Antonio the next Saturday afternoon the usual Sunday performance being changed in deference to the Sabbatical habits of the Americans An additional attraction was offered in the shape of a bull and bear fight also a concession to American taste which had voted the bullfight slow and had averred that the bull did not get a fair show I am glad that I am able to spare the reader the usual realistic horrors for in the Californian performances there was very little of the brutality that distinguished this function in the mother country The horses were not miserable worn out hacks but young and alert mustangs and the display of horsemanship by the picadors was not only wonderful but secured an almost absolute safety to horse and rider I never saw a horse gored although unskillful riders were sometimes thrown in wheeling quickly to avoid the bull s charge they generally regained their animals without injury The Plaza de Toros was reached through the decayed and tile strewn outskirts of an old Spanish village It was a rudely built oval amphitheater with crumbling whitewashed adobe walls and roofed only over portions of the gallery reserved for the provincial notables but now occupied by a few shopkeepers and their wives with a sprinkling of American travelers and ranchmen The impalpable adobe dust of the arena was being whirled into the air by the strong onset of the afternoon trade winds which happily however helped also to dissipate a reek of garlic and the acrid fumes of cheap tobacco rolled in cornhusk cigarettes I was leaning over the second barrier waiting for the meager and circuslike procession to enter with the keys of the bull pen when my attention was attracted to a movement in the reserved gallery A lady and gentleman of a quality that was evidently unfamiliar to the rest of the audience were picking their way along the rickety benches to a front seat I recognized the geologist with some surprise and the lady he was leading with still greater astonishment For it was Miss Mannersley in her precise well fitting walking costume a monotone of sober color among the parti colored audience However I was perhaps less surprised than the audience for I was not only becoming as accustomed to the young girl s vagaries as I had been to Enriquez extravagance but I was also satisfied that her uncle might have given her permission to come as a recognition of the Sunday concession of the management as well as to conciliate his supposed Catholic friends I watched her sitting there until the first bull had entered and after a rather brief play with the picadors and banderilleros was dispatched At the moment when the matador approached the bull with his lethal weapon I was not sorry for an excuse to glance at Miss Mannersley Her hands were in her lap her head slightly bent forward over her knees I fancied that she too had dropped her eyes before the brutal situation to my horror I saw that she had a drawing book in her hand and was actually sketching it I turned my eyes in preference to the dying bull The second animal led out for this ingenious slaughter was however more sullen uncertain and discomposing to his butchers He accepted the irony of a trial with gloomy suspicious eyes and he declined the challenge of whirling and insulting picadors He bristled with banderillas like a hedgehog but remained with his haunches backed against the barrier at times almost hidden in the fine dust raised by the monotonous stroke of his sullenly pawing hoof his one dull heavy protest A vague uneasiness had infected his adversaries the picadors held aloof the banderilleros skirmished at a safe distance The audience resented only the indecision of the bull Galling epithets were flung at him followed by cries of ESPADA and curving his elbow under his short cloak the matador with his flashing blade in hand advanced and stopped The bull remained motionless For at that moment a heavier gust of wind than usual swept down upon the arena lifted a suffocating cloud of dust and whirled it around the tiers of benches and the balcony and for a moment seemed to stop the performance I heard an exclamation from the geologist who had risen to his feet I fancied I heard even a faint cry from Miss Mannersley but the next moment as the dust was slowly settling we saw a sheet of paper in the air that had been caught up in this brief cyclone dropping dipping from side to side on uncertain wings until it slowly descended in the very middle of the arena It was a leaf from Miss Mannersley s sketchbook the one on which she had been sketching In the pause that followed it seemed to be the one object that at last excited the bull s growing but tardy ire He glanced at it with murky distended eyes he snorted at it with vague yet troubled fury Whether he detected his own presentment in Miss Mannersley s sketch or whether he recognized it as an unknown and unfamiliar treachery in his surroundings I could not conjecture for the next moment the matador taking advantage of the bull s concentration with a complacent leer at the audience advanced toward the paper But at that instant a young man cleared the barrier into the arena with a single bound shoved the matador to one side caught up the paper turned toward the balcony and Miss Mannersley with a gesture of apology dropped gaily before the bull knelt down before him with an exaggerated humility and held up the drawing as if for his inspection A roar of applause broke from the audience a cry of warning and exasperation from the attendants as the goaded bull suddenly charged the stranger But he sprang to one side with great dexterity made a courteous gesture to the matador as if passing the bull over to him and still holding the paper in his hand re leaped the barrier and rejoined the audience in safety I did not wait to see the deadly dominant thrust with which the matador received the charging bull my eyes were following the figure now bounding up the steps to the balcony where with an exaggerated salutation he laid the drawing in Miss Mannersley s lap and vanished There was no mistaking that thin lithe form the narrow black mustache and gravely dancing eyes The audacity of conception the extravagance of execution the quaint irony of the sequel could belong to no one but Enriquez I hurried up to her as the six yoked mules dragged the carcass of the bull away She was placidly putting up her book the unmoved focus of a hundred eager and curious eyes She smiled slightly as she saw me I was just telling mister Briggs what an extraordinary creature it was and how you knew him He must have had great experience to do that sort of thing so cleverly and safely Does he do it often Of course not just that But does he pick up cigars and things that I see they throw to the matador Does he belong to the management mister Briggs thinks the whole thing was a feint to distract the bull she added with a wicked glance at the geologist who I fancied looked disturbed I am afraid I said dryly that his act was as unpremeditated and genuine as it was unusual Why afraid It was a matter of fact question but I instantly saw my mistake What right had I to assume that Enriquez attentions were any more genuine than her own easy indifference and if I suspected that they were was it fair in me to give my friend away to this heartless coquette You are not very gallant she said with a slight laugh as I was hesitating and turned away with her escort before I could frame a reply But at least Enriquez was now accessible and I should gain some information from him I knew where to find him unless he were still lounging about the building intent upon more extravagance but I waited until I saw Miss Mannersley and Briggs depart without further interruption The hacienda of Ramon Saltillo Enriquez cousin was on the outskirts of the village When I arrived there I found Enriquez pinto mustang steaming in the corral and although I was momentarily delayed by the servants at the gateway I was surprised to find Enriquez himself lying languidly on his back in a hammock in the patio His arms were hanging down listlessly on each side as if in the greatest prostration yet I could not resist the impression that the rascal had only just got into the hammock when he heard of my arrival You have arrived friend Pancho in time he said in accents of exaggerated weakness I am absolutely exhaust I am bursted caved in kerflummoxed I have behold you my friend at the barrier I speak not I make no sign at the first because I was on fire I speak not at the feenish for I am exhaust I see the bull made it lively for you He instantly bounded up in the hammock The bull Caramba Not a thousand bulls And thees one look you was a craven I snap my fingers over his horn I roll my cigarette under his nose Well then what was it He instantly lay down again pulling up the sides of the hammock Presently his voice came from its depths appealing in hollow tones to the sky He asks me thees friend of my soul thees brother of my life thees Pancho that I lofe what it was He would that I should tell him why I am game in the legs why I shake in the hand crack in the voice and am generally wipe out And yet he my pardner thees Francisco know that I have seen the mees from Boston That I have gaze into the eye touch the hand and for the instant possess the picture that hand have drawn It was a sublime picture Pancho he said sitting up again suddenly and have kill the bull before our friend Pepe s sword have touch even the bone of hees back and make feenish of him Look here Enriquez I said bluntly have you been serenading that girl He shrugged his shoulders without the least embarrassment and said Ah yes What would you It is of a necessity Well I retorted then you ought to know that her uncle took it all to himself thought you some grateful Catholic pleased with his religious tolerance He did not even smile BUENO he said gravely That make something too In thees affair it is well to begin with the duenna He is the duenna And I went on relentlessly her escort told her just now that your exploit in the bull ring was only a trick to divert the bull suggested by the management Bah her escort is a geologian Naturally she is to him as a stone I would have continued but a peon interrupted us at this moment with a sign to Enriquez who leaped briskly from the hammock bidding me wait his return from a messenger in the gateway Still unsatisfied of mind I waited and sat down in the hammock that Enriquez had quitted A scrap of paper was lying in its meshes which at first appeared to be of the kind from which Enriquez rolled his cigarettes but as I picked it up to throw it away I found it was of much firmer and stouter material Looking at it more closely I was surprised to recognize it as a piece of the tinted drawing paper torn off the block that Miss Mannersley had used It had been deeply creased at right angles as if it had been folded it looked as if it might have been the outer half of a sheet used for a note It might have been a trifling circumstance but it greatly excited my curiosity I knew that he had returned the sketch to Miss Mannersley for I had seen it in her hand Had she given him another And if so why had it been folded to the destruction of the drawing Or was it part of a note which he had destroyed In the first impulse of discovery I walked quickly with it toward the gateway where Enriquez had disappeared intending to restore it to him He was just outside talking with a young girl I started for it was Jocasta Miss Mannersley s maid With this added discovery came that sense of uneasiness and indignation with which we illogically are apt to resent the withholding of a friend s confidence even in matters concerning only himself It was no use for me to reason that it was no business of mine that he was right in keeping a secret that concerned another and a lady but I was afraid I was even more meanly resentful because the discovery quite upset my theory of his conduct and of Miss Mannersley s attitude toward him I continued to walk on to the gateway where I bade Enriquez a hurried good by alleging the sudden remembrance of another engagement but without appearing to recognize the girl who was moving away when to my further discomfiture the rascal stopped me with an appealing wink threw his arms around my neck whispered hoarsely in my ear Ah you see you comprehend but you are the mirror of discretion and returned to Jocasta But whether this meant that he had received a message from Miss Mannersley or that he was trying to suborn her maid to carry one was still uncertain He was capable of either During the next two or three weeks I saw him frequently but as I had resolved to try the effect of ignoring Miss Mannersley in our conversation I gathered little further of their relations and to my surprise after one or two characteristic extravagances of allusion Enriquez dropped the subject too Only one afternoon as we were parting he said carelessly My friend you are going to the casa of Mannersley tonight I too have the honor of the invitation But you will be my Mercury my Leporello you will take of me a message to thees Mees Boston that I am crushed desolated prostrate and flabbergasted that I cannot arrive for I have of that night to sit up with the grand aunt of my brother in law who has a quinsy to the death It is sad This was the first indication I had received of Miss Mannersley s advances I was equally surprised at Enriquez refusal Nonsense I said bluntly Nothing keeps you from going My friend returned Enriquez with a sudden lapse into languishment that seemed to make him absolutely infirm it is everything that shall restrain me I am not strong I shall become weak of the knee and tremble under the eye of Mees Boston I shall precipitate myself to the geologian by the throat Ask me another conundrum that shall be easy He seemed idiotically inflexible and did not go But I did I found Miss Mannersley exquisitely dressed and looking singularly animated and pretty The lambent glow of her inscrutable eye as she turned toward me might have been flattering but for my uneasiness in regard to Enriquez I delivered his excuses as naturally as I could She stiffened for an instant and seemed an inch higher I am so sorry she said at last in a level voice I thought he would have been so amusing Indeed I had hoped we might try an old Moorish dance together which I have found and was practicing He would have been delighted I know It s a great pity he didn t come with me I said quickly but I could not help adding with emphasis on her words he is such an extraordinary creature you know I see nothing extraordinary in his devotion to an aged relative returned Miss Mannersley quietly as she turned away except that it justifies my respect for his character I do not know why I did not relate this to him Possibly I had given up trying to understand them perhaps I was beginning to have an idea that he could take care of himself But I was somewhat surprised a few days later when after asking me to go with him to a rodeo at his uncle s he added composedly You will meet Mees Boston I stared and but for his manner would have thought it part of his extravagance For the rodeo a yearly chase of wild cattle for the purpose of lassoing and branding them was a rather brutal affair and purely a man s function it was also a family affair a property stock taking of the great Spanish cattle owners and strangers particularly Americans found it difficult to gain access to its mysteries and the fiesta that followed But how did she get an invitation I asked You did not dare to ask I began My friend said Enriquez with a singular deliberation the great and respectable Boston herself and her serene venerable oncle and other Boston magnificos have of a truth done me the inexpressible honor to solicit of my degraded papistical oncle that she shall come that she shall of her own superior eye behold the barbaric customs of our race His tone and manner were so peculiar that I stepped quickly before him laid my hands on his shoulders and looked down into his face But the actual devil which I now for the first time saw in his eyes went out of them suddenly and he relapsed again in affected languishment in his chair I shall be there friend Pancho he said with a preposterous gasp I shall nerve my arm to lasso the bull and tumble him before her at her feet I shall throw the buck jump mustang at the same sacred spot I shall pluck for her the buried chicken at full speed from the ground and present it to her You shall see it friend Pancho I shall be there He was as good as his word When Don Pedro Amador his uncle installed Miss Mannersley with Spanish courtesy on a raised platform in the long valley where the rodeo took place the gallant Enriquez selected a bull from the frightened and galloping herd and cleverly isolating him from the band lassoed his hind legs and threw him exactly before the platform where Miss Mannersley was seated It was Enriquez who caught the unbroken mustang sprang from his own saddle to the bare back of his captive and with the lasso for a bridle halted him on rigid haunches at Miss Mannersley s feet It was Enriquez who in the sports that followed leaned from his saddle at full speed caught up the chicken buried to its head in the sand without wringing its neck and tossed it unharmed and fluttering toward his mistress As for her she wore the same look of animation that I had seen in her face at our previous meeting Although she did not bring her sketchbook with her as at the bullfight she did not shrink from the branding of the cattle which took place under her very eyes Yet I had never seen her and Enriquez together they had never to my actual knowledge even exchanged words And now although she was the guest of his uncle his duties seemed to keep him in the field and apart from her Nor as far as I could detect did either apparently make any effort to have it otherwise The peculiar circumstance seemed to attract no attention from anyone else But for what I alone knew or thought I knew of their actual relations I should have thought them strangers But I felt certain that the fiesta which took place in the broad patio of Don Pedro s casa would bring them together And later in the evening as we were all sitting on the veranda watching the dancing of the Mexican women whose white flounced sayas were monotonously rising and falling to the strains of two melancholy harps Miss Mannersley rejoined us from the house She seemed to be utterly absorbed and abstracted in the barbaric dances and scarcely moved as she leaned over the railing with her cheek resting on her hand Suddenly she arose with a little cry What is it asked two or three Nothing only I have lost my fan She had risen and was looking abstractedly on the floor Half a dozen men jumped to their feet Let me fetch it they said No thank you I think I know where it is and will go for it myself She was moving away But Don Pedro interposed with Spanish gravity Such a thing was not to be heard of in his casa If the senorita would not permit HIM an old man to go for it it must be brought by Enriquez her cavalier of the day But Enriquez was not to be found I glanced at Miss Mannersley s somewhat disturbed face and begged her to let me fetch it I thought I saw a flush of relief come into her pale cheek as she said in a lower voice On the stone seat in the garden I hurried away leaving Don Pedro still protesting I knew the gardens and the stone seat at an angle of the wall not a dozen yards from the casa The moon shone full upon it There indeed lay the little gray feathered fan But beside it also lay the crumpled black gold embroidered riding gauntlet that Enriquez had worn at the rodeo I thrust it hurriedly into my pocket and ran back As I passed through the gateway I asked a peon to send Enriquez to me The man stared Did I not know that Don Enriquez had ridden away two minutes ago When I reached the veranda I handed the fan to Miss Mannersley without a word BUENO said Don Pedro gravely it is as well There shall be no bones broken over the getting of it for Enriquez I hear has had to return to the Encinal this very evening Miss Mannersley retired early I did not inform her of my discovery nor did I seek in any way to penetrate her secret There was no doubt that she and Enriquez had been together perhaps not for the first time but what was the result of their interview From the young girl s demeanor and Enriquez hurried departure I could only fear the worst for him Had he been tempted into some further extravagance and been angrily rebuked or had he avowed a real passion concealed under his exaggerated mask and been deliberately rejected I tossed uneasily half the night following in my dreams my poor friend s hurrying hoofbeats and ever starting from my sleep at what I thought was the sound of galloping hoofs I rose early and lounged into the patio but others were there before me and a small group of Don Pedro s family were excitedly discussing something and I fancied they turned away awkwardly and consciously as I approached There was an air of indefinite uneasiness everywhere A strange fear came over me with the chill of the early morning air Had anything happened to Enriquez I had always looked upon his extravagance as part of his playful humor Could it be possible that under the sting of rejection he had made his grotesque threat of languishing effacement real Surely Miss Mannersley would know or suspect something if it were the case I approached one of the Mexican women and asked if the senorita had risen The woman started and looked covertly round before she replied Did not Don Pancho know that Miss Mannersley and her maid had not slept in their beds that night but had gone none knew where For an instant I felt an appalling sense of my own responsibility in this suddenly serious situation and hurried after the retreating family group But as I entered the corridor a vaquero touched me on the shoulder He had evidently just dismounted and was covered with the dust of the road He handed me a note written in pencil on a leaf from Miss Mannersley s sketchbook It was in Enriquez hand and his signature was followed by his most extravagant rubric Friend Pancho When you read this line you shall of a possibility think I am no more That is where you shall slip up my little brother I am much more I am two times as much for I have marry Miss Boston At the Mission Church at five of the morning sharp No cards shall be left I kiss the hand of my venerable uncle in law You shall say to him that we fly to the South wilderness as the combined evangelical missionary to the heathen Miss Boston herself say this Ta ta How are you now Your own Enriquez End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Selected Stories
