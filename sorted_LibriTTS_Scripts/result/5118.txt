never could understand why anybody should ever have begun to live at Dillsborough or why the population there should have been at any time recruited by new comers That a man with a family should cling to a house in which he has once established himself is intelligible The butcher who supplied Dillsborough or the baker or the ironmonger though he might not drive what is called a roaring trade nevertheless found himself probably able to live and might well hesitate before he would encounter the dangers of a more energetic locality But how it came to pass that he first got himself to Dillsborough or his father or his grandfather before him has always been a mystery to me The town has no attractions and never had any It does not stand on a bed of coal and has no connection with iron It has no water peculiarly adapted for beer or for dyeing or for the cure of maladies It is not surrounded by beauty of scenery strong enough to bring tourists and holiday travellers There is no cathedral there to form with its bishops prebendaries and minor canons the nucleus of a clerical circle It manufactures nothing specially It has no great horse fair or cattle fair or even pig market of special notoriety Every Saturday farmers and graziers and buyers of corn and sheep do congregate in a sleepy fashion about the streets but Dillsborough has no character of its own even as a market town Its chief glory is its parish church which is ancient and inconvenient having not as yet received any of those modern improvements which have of late become common throughout England but its parish church though remarkable is hardly celebrated The town consists chiefly of one street which is over a mile long with a square or market place in the middle round which a few lanes with queer old names are congregated and a second small open space among these lanes in which the church stands As you pass along the street north west away from the railway station and from London there is a steep hill beginning to rise just beyond the market place Up to that point it is the High Street thence it is called Bullock s Hill Beyond that you come to Norrington Road Norrington being the next town distant from Dillsborough about twelve miles Dillsborough however stands in the county of Rufford whereas at the top of Bullock s Hill you enter the county of Ufford of which Norrington is the assize town The Dillsborough people are therefore divided some two thousand five hundred of them belonging to Rufford and the remaining five hundred to the neighbouring county This accident has given rise to not a few feuds Ufford being a large county with pottery and ribbons and watches going on in the farther confines whereas Rufford is small and thoroughly agricultural The men at the top of Bullock s Hill are therefore disposed to think themselves better than their fellow townsfolks though they are small in number and not specially thriving in their circumstances At every interval of ten years when the census is taken the population of Dillsborough is always found to have fallen off in some slight degree For a few months after the publication of the figures a slight tinge of melancholy comes upon the town The landlord of the Bush Inn who is really an enterprising man in his way and who has looked about in every direction for new sources of business becomes taciturn for a while and forgets to smile upon comers mister Ribbs the butcher tells his wife that it is out of the question that she and the children should take that long talked of journey to the sea coast and mister Gregory Masters the well known old established attorney of Dillsborough whispers to some confidential friend that he might as well take down his plate and shut up his house But in a month or two all that is forgotten and new hopes spring up even in Dillsborough mister Runciman at the Bush is putting up new stables for hunting horses that being the special trade for which he now finds that there is an opening missus Ribbs is again allowed to suggest Mare Slocumb and mister Masters goes on as he has done for the last forty years making the best he can of a decreasing business Dillsborough is built chiefly of brick and is in its own way solid enough The Bush which in the time of the present landlord s father was one of the best posting inns on the road is not only substantial but almost handsome A broad coach way cut through the middle of the house leads into a spacious well kept clean yard and on each side of the coach way there are bay windows looking into the street the one belonging to the commercial parlour and the other to the so called coffee room But the coffee room has in truth fallen away from its former purposes and is now used for a farmer s ordinary on market days and other similar purposes Travellers who require the use of a public sitting room must all congregate in the commercial parlour at the Bush So far the interior of the house has fallen from its past greatness But the exterior is maintained with much care The brickwork up to the eaves is well pointed fresh and comfortable to look at In front of the carriage way swings on two massive supports the old sign of the Bush as to which it may be doubted whether even mister Runciman himself knows that it has swung there or been displayed in some fashion since it was the custom for the landlord to beat up wine to freshen it before it was given to the customers to drink The church too is of brick though the tower and chancel are of stone The attorney s house is of brick which shall not be more particularly described now as many of the scenes which these pages will have to describe were acted there and almost the entire High Street in the centre of the town was brick also But the most remarkable house in Dillsborough was one standing in a short thoroughfare called Hobbs Gate leading down by the side of the Bush Inn from the market place to Church Square as it is called As you pass down towards the church this house is on the right hand and it occupies with its garden the whole space between the market place and Church Square But though the house enjoys the privilege of a large garden so large that the land being in the middle of a town would be of great value were it not that Dillsborough is in its decadence still it stands flush up to the street upon which the front door opens It has an imposing flight of stone steps guarded by iron rails leading up to it and on each side of the door there is a row of three windows and on the two upper stories rows of seven windows Over the door there is a covering on which there are grotesquely formed carved wooden faces and over the centre of each window let into the brickwork is a carved stone There are also numerous underground windows sunk below the earth and protected by iron railings Altogether the house is one which cannot fail to attract attention and in the brickwork is clearly marked the date seventeen oh one not the very best period for English architecture as regards beauty but one in which walls and roofs ceilings and buttresses were built more substantially than they are to day This was the only house in Dillsborough which had a name of its own and it was called Hoppet Hall the Dillsborough chronicles telling that it had been originally built for and inhabited by the Hoppet family The only Hoppet now left in Dillsborough is old Joe Hoppet the ostler at the Bush and the house as was well known had belonged to some member of the Morton family for the last hundred years at least The garden and ground it stands upon comprise three acres all of which are surrounded by a high brick wall which is supposed to be coeval with the house The best Ribston pippins some people say the only real Ribston pippins in all Rufford are to be found here and its Burgundy pears and walnuts are almost equally celebrated There are rumours also that its roses beat everything in the way of roses for ten miles round But in these days very few strangers are admitted to see the Hoppet Hall roses The pears and apples do make their way out and are distributed either by missus Masters the attorney s wife or mister Runciman the innkeeper The present occupier of the house is a certain mister Reginald Morton with whom we shall also be much concerned in these pages but whose introduction to the reader shall be postponed for awhile The land around Dillsborough is chiefly owned by two landlords of whom the greatest and richest is Lord Rufford He however does not live near the town but away at the other side of the county and is not much seen in these parts unless when the hounds bring him here or when with two or three friends he will sometimes stay for a few days at the Bush Inn for the sake of shooting the coverts He is much liked by all sporting men but is not otherwise very popular with the people round Dillsborough A landlord if he wishes to be popular should be seen frequently If he lives among his farmers they will swear by him even though he raises his rental every ten or twelve years and never puts a new roof to a barn for them Lord Rufford is a rich man who thinks of nothing but sport in all its various shapes from pigeon shooting at Hurlingham to the slaughter of elephants in Africa and though he is lenient in all his dealings is not much thought of in the Dillsborough side of the county except by those who go out with the hounds At Rufford where he generally has a full house for three months in the year and spends a vast amount of money he is more highly considered The other extensive landlord is mister John Morton a young man who in spite of his position as squire of Bragton owner of Bragton Park and landlord of the entire parishes of Bragton and Mallingham the latter of which comes close up to the confines of Dillsborough was at the time at which our story begins Secretary of Legation at Washington As he had been an absentee since he came of age soon after which time he inherited the property he had been almost less liked in the neighbourhood than the lord Indeed no one in Dillsborough knew much about him although Bragton Hall was but four miles from the town and the Mortons had possessed the property and lived on it for the last three centuries But there had been extravagance as will hereafter have to be told and there had been no continuous residence at Bragton since the death of old Reginald Morton who had been the best known and the best loved of all the squires in Rufford and had for many years been master of the Rufford hounds He had lived to a very great age and though the great grandfather of the present man had not been dead above twenty years He was the man of whom the older inhabitants of Dillsborough and the neighbourhood still thought and still spoke when they gave vent to their feelings in favour of gentlemen And yet the old squire in his latter days had been able to do little or nothing for them being sometimes backward as to the payment of money he owed among them But he had lived all his days at Bragton Park and his figure had been familiar to all eyes in the High Street of Dillsborough and at the front entrance of the Bush People still spoke of old mister Reginald Morton as though his death had been a sore loss to the neighbourhood And there were in the country round sundry yeomen as they ought to be called gentlemen farmers as they now like to style themselves men who owned some acres of land and farmed these acres themselves Of these we may specially mention mister Lawrence Twentyman who was quite the gentleman farmer He possessed over three hundred acres of land on which his father had built an excellent house The present mister Twentyman Lawrence Twentyman Esquire as he was called by everybody was by no means unpopular in the neighbourhood He not only rode well to hounds but paid twenty five pounds annually to the hunt which entitled him to feel quite at home in his red coat He generally owned a racing colt or two and attended meetings but was supposed to know what he was about and to have kept safely the five or six thousand pounds which his father had left him And his farming was well done for though he was out and out a gentleman farmer he knew how to get the full worth in work done for the fourteen shillings a week which he paid to his labourers a deficiency in which knowledge is the cause why gentlemen in general find farming so expensive an amusement He was a handsome good looking man of about thirty and would have been a happy man had he not been too ambitious in his aspirations after gentry He had been at school for three years at Cheltenham College which together with his money and appearance and undoubted freehold property should he thought have made his position quite secure to him but though he sometimes called young Hampton of Hampton Wick Hampton and the son of the rector of Dillsborough Mainwaring and always called the rich young brewers from Norrington Botsey partners in the well known firm of Billbrook Botsey and though they in return called him Larry and admitted the intimacy still he did not get into their houses And Lord Rufford when he came into the neighbourhood never asked him to dine at the Bush And worst of all some of the sporting men and others in the neighbourhood who decidedly were not gentlemen also called him Larry mister Runciman always did so Twenty or twenty five years ago Runciman had been his father s special friend before the house had been built and before the days at Cheltenham College Remembering this Lawrence was too good a fellow to rebuke Runciman but to younger men of that class he would sometimes make himself objectionable There was another keeper of hunting stables a younger man named Stubbings living at Stanton Corner a great hunting rendezvous about four miles from Dillsborough and not long since Twentyman had threatened to lay his whip across Stubbings shoulders if Stubbings ever called him Larry again Stubbings who was a little man and rode races only laughed at mister Twentyman who was six feet high and told the story round to all the hunt mister Twentyman was more laughed at than perhaps he deserved A man should not have his Christian name used by every Tom and Dick without his sanction But the difficulty is one to which men in the position of mister Lawrence Twentyman are often subject Those whom I have named together with mister Mainwaring the rector and mister Surtees his curate made up the very sparse aristocracy of Dillsborough The Hamptons of Hampton Wick were Ufford men and belonged rather to Norrington than Dillsborough The Botseys also from Norrington were members of the U R U or Ufford and Rufford United Hunt Club but they did not much affect Dillsborough as a town mister Mainwaring who has been mentioned lived in another brick house behind the church the old parsonage of saint John s There was also a missus Mainwaring but she was an invalid Their family consisted of one son who was at Brasenose at this time He always had a horse during the Christmas vacation and if rumour did not belie him kept two or three up at Oxford mister Surtees the curate lived in lodgings in the town He was a painstaking eager clever young man with aspirations in church matters which were always being checked by his rector Quieta non movere was the motto by which the rector governed his life and he certainly was not at all the man to allow his curate to drive him into activity Such at the time of our story was the little town of Dillsborough CHAPTER II THE MORTON FAMILY I can hardly describe accurately the exact position of the Masters family without first telling all that I know about the Morton family and it is absolutely essential that the reader should know all the Masters family intimately mister Masters as I have said in the last chapter was the attorney in Dillsborough and the Mortons had been for centuries past the squires of Bragton I need not take the reader back farther than old Reginald Morton He had come to the throne of his family as a young man and had sat upon it for more than half a century He had been a squire of the old times having no inclination for London seasons never wishing to keep up a second house quite content with his position as squire of Bragton but with considerable pride about him as to that position He had always liked to have his house full and had hated petty oeconomies He had for many years hunted the county at his own expense the amusement at first not having been so expensive as it afterwards became When he began the work it had been considered sufficient to hunt twice a week Now the Rufford and Ufford hounds have four days and sometimes a bye It went much against mister Reginald Morton s pride when he was first driven to take a subscription But the temporary distress into which the family fell was caused not so much by his own extravagance as by that of two sons and by his indulgence in regard to them He had three children none of whom were very fortunate in life The eldest John married the daughter of a peer stood for Parliament had one son and died before he was forty owing something over Ltwenty thousand The estate was then worth Lseven thousand a year Certain lands not lying either in Bragton or Mallingham were sold and that difficulty was surmounted not without a considerable diminution of income In process of time the grandson who was a second John Morton grew up and married and became the father of a third John Morton the young man who afterwards became owner of the property and Secretary of Legation at Washington But the old squire outlived his son and his grandson and when he died had three or four great grandchildren playing about the lawns of Bragton Park The peer s daughter had lived and had for many years drawn a dower from the Bragton property and had been altogether a very heavy incumbrance But the great trial of the old man s life as also the great romance had arisen from the career of his second son Reginald Of all his children Reginald had been the dearest to him He went to Oxford and had there spent much money not as young men now spend money but still to an extent that had been grievous to the old squire But everything was always paid for Reginald It was necessary of course that he should have a profession and he took a commission in the army As a young man he went to Canada This was in eighteen twenty nine when all the world was at peace and his only achievement in Canada was to marry a young woman who is reported to have been pretty and good but who had no advantages either of fortune or birth She was indeed the daughter of a bankrupt innkeeper in Montreal Soon after this he sold out and brought his wife home to Bragton It was at this period of the squire s life that the romance spoken of occurred John Morton the brother with the aristocratic wife was ten or twelve years older than Reginald and at this time lived chiefly at Bragton when he was not in town He was perhaps justified in regarding Bragton as almost belonging to him knowing as he did that it must belong to him after his father s lifetime and to his son after him His anger against his brother was hot and that of his wife still hotter He himself had squandered thousands but then he was the heir Reginald who was only a younger brother had sold his commission And then he had done so much more than this He had married a woman who was not a lady John was clearly of opinion that at any rate the wife should not be admitted into Bragton House The old squire in those days was not a happy man he had never been very strong minded but now he was strong enough to declare that his house door should not be shut against a son of his or a son s wife as long as she was honest Hereupon the Honourable missus Morton took her departure and was never seen at Bragton again in the old squire s time Reginald Morton came to the house and soon afterwards another little Reginald was born at Bragton Park This happened as long ago as eighteen thirty five twenty years before the death of the old squire But there had been another child a daughter who had come between the two sons still living in these days who will become known to any reader who will have patience to follow these pages to the end She married not very early in life a certain Sir William Ushant who was employed by his country in India and elsewhere but who found soon after his marriage that the service of his country required that he should generally leave his wife at Bragton As her father had been for many years a widower Lady Ushant became the mistress of the house But death was very busy with the Mortons Almost every one died except the squire himself and his daughter and that honourable dowager with her income and her pride who could certainly very well have been spared When at last in eighteen fifty five the old squire went full of years full of respect but laden also with debts and money troubles not only had his son John and his grandson John gone before him but Reginald and his wife were both lying in Bragton Churchyard The elder branch of the family John the great grandson and his little sisters were at once taken away from Bragton by the honourable grandmother John who was then about seven years old was of course the young squire and was the owner of the property The dowager therefore did not undertake an altogether unprofitable burden Lady Ushant was left at the house and with Lady Ushant or rather immediately subject to her care young Reginald Morton who was then nineteen years of age and who was about to go to Oxford But there immediately sprang up family lawsuits instigated by the honourable lady on behalf of her grandchildren of which Reginald Morton was the object The old man had left certain outlying properties to his grandson Reginald of which Hoppet Hall was a part For eight or ten years the lawsuit was continued and much money was expended Reginald was at last successful and became the undoubted owner of Hoppet Hall but in the meantime he went to Germany for his education instead of to Oxford and remained abroad even after the matter was decided living no one but Lady Ushant knew where or after what fashion When the old squire died the children were taken away and Bragton was nearly deserted The young heir was brought up with every caution and under the auspices of his grandmother and her family behaved himself very unlike the old Mortons He was educated at Eton after leaving which he was at once examined for Foreign Office employment and commenced his career with great eclat He had been made to understand clearly that it would be better that he should not enter in upon his squirearchy early in life The estate when he came of age had already had some years to recover itself and as he went from capital to capital he was quite content to draw from it an income which enabled him to shine with peculiar brilliance among his brethren He had visited Bragton once since the old squire s death and had found the place very dull and uninviting He had no ambition whatever to be master of the U R U but did look forward to a time when he might be Minister Plenipotentiary at some foreign court For many years after the old man s death Lady Ushant who was then a widow was allowed to live at Bragton She was herself childless and being now robbed of her great nephews and nieces took a little girl to live with her named Mary Masters It was a very desolate house in those days but the old lady was careful as to the education of the child and did her best to make the home happy for her Some two or three years before the commencement of this story there arose a difference between the manager of the property and Lady Ushant and she was made to understand after some half courteous manner that Bragton house and park would do better without her There would be no longer any cows kept and painters must come into the house and there were difficulties about fuel She was not turned out exactly but she went and established herself in lonely lodgings at Cheltenham Then Mary Masters who had lived for more than a dozen years at Bragton went back to her father s house in Dillsborough Any reader with an aptitude for family pedigrees will now understand that Reginald Master of Hoppet Hall was first cousin to the father of the Foreign Office paragon and that he is therefore the paragon s first cousin once removed The relationship is not very distant but the two men one of whom was a dozen years older than the other had not seen each other for more than twenty years at a time when one of them was a big boy and the other a very little one and during the greater part of that time a lawsuit had been carried on between them in a very rigorous manner It had done much to injure both and had created such a feeling of hostility that no intercourse of any kind now existed between them It does not much concern us to know how far back should be dated the beginning of the connection between the Morton family and that of mister Masters the attorney but it is certain that the first attorney of that name in Dillsborough became learned in the law through the patronage of some former Morton The father of the present Gregory Masters and the grandfather had been thoroughly trusted and employed by old Reginald Morton and the former of the two had made his will Very much of the stewardship and management of the property had been in their hands and they had thriven as honest men but as men with a tolerably sharp eye to their own interests The late mister Masters had died a few years before the squire and the present attorney had seemed to succeed to these family blessings But the whole order of things became changed Within a few weeks of the squire s death mister Masters found that he was to be entrusted no further with the affairs of the property but that in lieu of such care was thrown upon him the task of defending the will which he had made against the owner of the estate His father and grandfather had contrived between them to establish a fairly good business independently of Bragton which business of course was now his As far as reading went and knowledge he was probably a better lawyer than either of them but he lacked their enterprise and special genius and the thing had dwindled with him It seemed to him perhaps not unnaturally that he had been robbed of an inheritance He had no title deeds as had the owners of the property but his ancestors before him from generation to generation had lived by managing the Bragton property They had drawn the leases and made the wills and collected the rents and had taught themselves to believe that a Morton could not live on his land without a Masters Now there was a Morton who did not live on his land but spent his rents elsewhere without the aid of any Masters and it seemed to the old lawyer that all the good things of the world had passed away He had married twice his first wife having before her marriage been well known at Bragton Park When she had died and mister Masters had brought a second wife home Lady Ushant took the only child of the mother whom she had known as a girl into her own keeping till she also had been compelled to leave Bragton Then Mary Masters had returned to her father and stepmother The Bragton Park residence is a large old fashioned comfortable house but by no means a magnificent mansion The greater part of it was built one hundred and fifty years ago and the rooms are small and low In the palmy days of his reign which is now more than half a century since the old squire made alterations and built new stables and kennels and put up a conservatory but what he did then has already become almost old fashioned now What he added he added in stone but the old house was brick He was much abused at the time for his want of taste and heard a good deal about putting new cloth as patches on old rents but as the shrubs and ivy have grown up a certain picturesqueness has come upon the place which is greatly due to the difference of material The place is somewhat sombre as there is no garden close to the house There is a lawn at the back with gravel walks round it but it is only a small lawn and then divided from the lawn by a ha ha fence is the park The place too has that sad look which always comes to a house from the want of a tenant Poor Lady Ushant when she was there could do little or nothing A gardener was kept but there should have been three or four gardeners The man grew cabbages and onions which he sold but cared nothing for the walks or borders Whatever it may have been in the old time Bragton Park was certainly not a cheerful place when Lady Ushant lived there In the squire s time the park itself had always been occupied by deer Even when distress came he would not allow the deer to be sold But after his death they went very soon and from that day to the time of which I am writing the park has been leased to some butchers or graziers from Dillsborough The ground hereabouts is nearly level but it falls away a little and becomes broken and pretty where the river Dill runs through the park about half a mile from the house There is a walk called the Pleasance passing down through shrubs to the river and then crossing the stream by a foot bridge and leading across the fields towards Dillsborough This bridge is perhaps the prettiest spot in Bragton or for that matter anywhere in the county round but even here there is not much of beauty to be praised It is here on the side of the river away from the house that the home meet of the hounds used to be held and still the meet at Bragton Bridge is popular in the county CHAPTER III THE MASTERS FAMILY At six o clock one November evening mister Masters the attorney was sitting at home with his family in the large parlour of his house his office being on the other side of the passage which cut the house in two and was formally called the hall Upstairs over the parlour was a drawing room but this chamber which was supposed to be elegantly furnished was very rarely used mister and missus Masters did not see much company and for family purposes the elegance of the drawing room made it unfit It added however not a little to the glory of missus Masters life The house itself was a low brick building in the High Street at the corner where the High Street runs into the market place and therefore nearly opposite to the Bush It had none of the elaborate grandeur of the inn nor of the simple stateliness of Hoppet Hall but nevertheless it maintained the character of the town and was old substantial respectable and dark I think it a very spirited thing of him to do then said missus Masters I don t know my dear Perhaps it is only revenge What have you to do with that What can it matter to a lawyer whether it s revenge or anything else He s got the means I suppose I don t know my dear What does Nickem say I suppose he has the means said mister Masters who was aware that if he told his wife a fib on the matter she would learn the truth from his senior clerk mister Samuel Nickem Among the professional gifts which mister Masters possessed had not been that great gift of being able to keep his office and his family distinct from each other His wife always knew what was going on and was very free with her advice generally tendering it on that side on which money was to be made and doing so with much feminine darkness as to right or wrong His clerk Nickem who was afflicted with no such darkness but who ridiculed the idea of scruple in an attorney often took part against him It was the wish of his heart to get rid of Nickem but Nickem would have carried business with him and gone over to some enemy or perhaps have set up in some irregular manner on his own bottom and his wife would have given him no peace had he done so for she regarded Nickem as the mainstay of the house What is Lord Rufford to you asked missus Masters He has always been very friendly I don t see it at all You have never had any of his money I don t know that you are a pound richer by him I have always gone with the gentry of the county Fiddlesticks Gentry Gentry are very well as long as you can make a living out of them You could afford to stick up for gentry till you lost the Bragton property This was a subject that was always sore between mister Masters and his wife The former missus Masters had been a lady the daughter of a neighbouring clergyman and had been much considered by the family at Bragton The present missus Masters was the daughter of an ironmonger at Norrington who had brought a thousand pounds with her which had been very useful No doubt mister Masters practice had been considerably affected by the lowliness of his second marriage People who used to know the first missus Masters such as missus Mainwaring and the doctor s wife and old missus Cooper the wife of the vicar of Mallingham would not call on the second missus Masters As missus Masters was too high spirited to run after people who did not want her she took to hating gentry instead We have always been on the other side said the old attorney I and my father and grandfather before me They lived on it and you can t If you are going to say that you won t have any client that isn t a gentleman you might as well put up your shutters at once I haven t said so Isn t Runciman my client He always goes with the gentry He a most thinks he s one of them himself And old Nobbs the greengrocer But it s all nonsense Any man is my client or any woman who can come and pay me for business that is fit for me to do Why isn t this fit to be done If the man s been damaged why shouldn t he be paid He s had money offered him If he thinks it ain t enough who s to say that it is unless a jury said missus Masters becoming quite eloquent And how s a poor man to get a jury to say that unless he comes to a lawyer Of course if you won t have it he ll go to Bearside Bearside won t turn him away Bearside was another attorney an interloper of about ten years standing whose name was odious to mister Masters You don t know anything about it my dear said he aroused at last to anger I know you re letting anybody who likes take the bread out of the children s mouths The children so called were sitting round the table and could not but take an interest in the matter The eldest was that Mary Masters the daughter of the former wife whom Lady Ushant had befriended a tall girl with dark brown hair so dark as almost to be black and large soft thoughtful grey eyes We shall have much to say of Mary Masters and can hardly stop to give an adequate description of her here The others were Dolly and Kate two girls aged sixteen and fifteen The two younger children were eating bread and butter and jam in a very healthy manner but still had their ears wide open to the conversation that was being held The two younger girls sympathised strongly with their mother Mary who had known much about the Mortons and was old enough to understand the position which her grandfather had held in reference to the family of course leaned in her heart to her father s side But she was wiser than her father and knew that in such discussions her mother often showed a worldly wisdom which in their present circumstances they could hardly afford to disregard unpalatable though it might be mister Masters disliked these discussions altogether but he disliked them most of all in presence of his children He looked round upon them in a deprecatory manner making a slight motion with his hand and bringing his head down on one side and then he gave a long sigh If it was his intention to convey some subtle warning to his wife some caution that she alone should understand he was deceived The children all knew what he meant quite as well as did their mother Shall we go out mamma asked Dolly Finish your teas my dears said mister Masters who wished to stop the discussion rather than to carry it on before a more select audience You ve got to make up your mind to night said missus Masters and you ll be going over to the Bush at eight No I needn t He is to come on Monday I told Nickem I wouldn t see him to night nor of course to morrow Then he ll go to Bearside He may go to Bearside and be Oh Lord I do wish you d let me drop the business for a few minutes when I am in here You don t know anything about it How should you I know that if I didn t speak you d let everything slip through your fingers There s mister Twentyman Kate open the door Kate who was fond of mister Twentyman rushed up and opened the front door at once In saying so much of Kate I do not mean it to be understood that any precocious ideas of love were troubling that young lady s bosom Kate Masters was a jolly bouncing schoolgirl of fifteen who was not too proud to eat toffy and thought herself still a child But she was very fond of Lawrence Twentyman who had a pony that she could ride and who was always good natured to her All the family liked mister Twentyman unless it might be Mary who was the one that he specially liked himself And Mary was not altogether averse to him knowing him to be good natured manly and straightforward But mister Twentyman had proposed to her and she had certainly not accepted him This however had broken none of the family friendship Every one in the house unless it might be Mary herself hoped that mister Twentyman might prevail at last The man was worth six or seven hundred a year and had a good house and owed no one a shilling He was handsome and about the best tempered fellow known Of course they all desired that he should prevail with Mary I wish that I were old enough Larry that s all Kate had said to him once laughing I wouldn t have you if you were ever so old Larry had replied you d want to be out hunting every day That will show the sort of terms that Larry was on with his friend Kate He called at the house every Saturday with the declared object of going over to the club that was held that evening in the parlour at the Bush whither mister Masters also always went It was understood at home that mister Masters should attend this club every Saturday from eight till eleven but that he was not at any other time to give way to the fascinations of the Bush On this occasion and we may say on almost every Saturday night mister Twentyman arrived a full hour before the appointed time The reason of his doing so was of course well understood and was quite approved by missus Masters She was not at any rate as yet a cruel stepmother but still if the girl could be transferred to so eligible a home as that which mister Twentyman could give her it would be well for all parties When he took his seat he did not address himself specially to the lady of his love I don t know how a gentleman is to do so in the presence of her father and mother and sisters Saturday after Saturday he probably thought that some occasion would arise but if his words could have been counted it would have been found that he addressed fewer to her than to any one in the room Larry said his special friend Kate am I to have the pony at the Bridge meet How very free you are Miss said her mother I don t know about that said Larry When is there to be a meet at the Bridge I haven t heard But I have Tony Tuppett told me that they would be there this day fortnight Tony Tuppett was the huntsman of the U R U That s more than Tony can know He may have guessed it Shall I have the pony if he has guessed right Then the pony was promised and Kate trusting in Tony Tuppett s sagacity was happy Have you heard of all this about Dillsborough Wood asked missus Masters The attorney shrank at the question and shook himself uneasily in his chair Yes I ve heard about it said Larry And what do you think about it I don t see why Lord Rufford is to ride over everybody because he s a lord mister Twentyman scratched his head Though a keen sportsman himself he did not specially like Lord Rufford a fact which had been very well known to missus Masters But nevertheless this threatened action against the nobleman was distasteful to him It was not a hunting affair or mister Twentyman could not have doubted for a moment It was a shooting difficulty and as mister Twentyman had never been asked to fire a gun on the Rufford preserves it was no great sorrow to him that there should be such a difficulty But the thing threatened was an attack upon the country gentry and their amusements and mister Twentyman was a country gentleman who followed sport Upon the whole his sympathies were with Lord Rufford The man is an utter blackguard you know said Larry Last year he threatened to shoot the foxes in Dillsborough Wood No said Kate quite horrified I m afraid he s a bad sort of fellow all round said the attorney I don t see why he shouldn t claim what he thinks due to him said missus Masters I m told that his lordship offered him seven and six an acre for the whole of the two fields said the gentleman farmer Goarly declares said missus Masters that the pheasants didn t leave him four bushels of wheat to the acre Goarly was the man who had proposed himself as a client to mister Masters and who was desirous of claiming damages to the amount of forty shillings an acre for injury done to the crops on two fields belonging to himself which lay adjacent to Dillsborough Wood a covert belonging to Lord Rufford about four miles from the town in which both pheasants and foxes were preserved with great care Has Goarly been to you asked Twentyman mister Masters nodded his head
6075_57156_000014_000000	train-clean-360	 That s just it 
none	none	said missus Masters I don t see why a man isn t to go to law if he pleases that is if he can afford to pay for it I have nothing to say against gentlemen s sport but I do say that they should run the same chance as others And I say it s a shame if they re to band themselves together and make the county too hot to hold any one as doesn t like to have his things ridden over and his crops devoured and his fences knocked to Jericho I think there s a deal of selfishness in sport and a deal of tyranny Oh missus Masters exclaimed Larry Well I do And if a poor man or a man whether he s poor or no added missus Masters correcting herself as she thought of the money which this man ought to have in order that he might pay for his lawsuit thinks hisself injured it s nonsense to tell me that nobody should take up his case It s just as though the butcher wouldn t sell a man a leg of mutton because Lord Rufford had a spite against him Who s Lord Rufford Everybody knows that I care very little for his lordship said mister Twentyman Nor I and I don t see why Gregory should If Goarly isn t entitled to what he wants he won t get it that s all But let it be tried fairly Hereupon mister Masters took up his hat and left the room and mister Twentyman followed him not having yet expressed any positive opinion on the delicate matter submitted to his judgment Of course Goarly was a brute Had he not threatened to shoot foxes But then an attorney must live by lawsuits and it seemed to mister Twentyman that an attorney should not stop to inquire whether a new client is a brute or not CHAPTER IV THE DILLSBOROUGH CLUB The club so called at Dillsborough was held every Saturday evening in a back parlour at the Bush and was attended generally by seven or eight members It was a very easy club There was no balloting and no other expense attending it other than that of paying for the liquor which each man chose to drink Sometimes about ten o clock there was a little supper the cost of which was defrayed by subscription among those who partook of it It was one rule of the club or a habit rather which had grown to be a rule that mister Runciman might introduce into it any one he pleased I do not know that a similar privilege was denied to any one else but as mister Runciman had a direct pecuniary advantage in promoting the club the new comers were generally ushered in by him When the attorney and Twentyman entered the room mister Runciman was seated as usual in an arm chair at the corner of the fire nearest to the door with the bell at his right hand He was a hale good looking man about fifty with black hair now turning grey at the edges and a clean shorn chin He had a pronounced strong face of his own one capable of evincing anger and determination when necessary but equally apt for smiles or on occasion for genuine laughter He was a masterful but a pleasant man very civil to customers and to his friends generally while they took him the right way but one who could be a Tartar if he were offended holding an opinion that his position as landlord of an inn was one requiring masterdom And his wife was like him in everything except in this that she always submitted to him He was a temperate man in the main but on Saturday nights he would become jovial and sometimes a little quarrelsome When this occurred the club would generally break itself up and go home to bed not in the least offended Indeed mister Runciman was the tyrant of the club though it was held at his house expressly with the view of putting money into his pocket Opposite to his seat was another arm chair not so big as mister Runciman s but still a soft and easy chair which was always left for the attorney For mister Masters was a man much respected through all Dillsborough partly on his own account but more perhaps for the sake of his father and grandfather He was a round faced clean shorn man with straggling grey hair who always wore black clothes and a white cravat There was something in his appearance which recommended him among his neighbours who were disposed to say he looked the gentleman but a stranger might have thought his cheeks to be flabby and his mouth to be weak Making a circle or the beginning of a circle round the fire were Nupper the doctor a sporting old bachelor doctor who had the reputation of riding after the hounds in order that he might be ready for broken bones and minor accidents next to him in another arm chair facing the fire was Ned Botsey the younger of the two brewers from Norrington who was in the habit during the hunting season of stopping from Saturday to Monday at the Bush partly because the Rufford hounds hunted on Saturday and Monday and on those days seldom met in the Norrington direction and partly because he liked the sporting conversation of the Dillsborough Club He was a little man very neat in his attire who liked to be above his company and fancied that he was so in mister Runciman s parlour Between him and the attorney s chair was Harry Stubbings from Stanton Corner the man who let out hunters and whom Twentyman had threatened to thrash His introduction to the club had taken place lately not without some opposition but Runciman had set his foot upon that saying that it was all d nonsense He had prevailed and Twentyman had consented to meet the man but there was no great friendship between them Seated back on the sofa was mister Ribbs the butcher who was allowed into the society as being a specially modest man His modesty perhaps did not hinder him in an affair of sheep or bullocks nor yet in the collection of his debts but at the club he understood his position and rarely opened his mouth to speak When Twentyman followed the attorney into the room there was a vacant chair between mister Botsey and Harry Stubbings but he would not get into it preferring to seat himself on the table at Botsey s right hand So Goarly was with you mister Masters mister Runciman began as soon as the attorney was seated It was clear that they had all been talking about Goarly and his law suit and that Goarly and the law suit would be talked about very generally in Dillsborough He was over at my place this evening said the attorney You are not going to take his case up for him mister Masters said young Botsey We expect something better from you than that Now Ned Botsey was rather an impudent young man and mister Masters though he was mild enough at home did not like impudence from the world at large I suppose mister Botsey said he that if Goarly were to go to you for a barrel of beer you d sell it to him I don t know whether I should or not I dare say my people would But that s a different thing I don t see any difference at all You re not very particular as to your customers and I don t ask you any questions about them Ring the bell Runciman please The bell was rung and the two new comers ordered their liquor It was quite right that Ned Botsey should be put down Every one in the room felt that But there was something in the attorney s tone which made the assembled company feel that he had undertaken Goarly s case whereas in the opinion of the company Goarly was a scoundrel with whom mister Masters should have had nothing to do The attorney had never been a sporting man himself but he had always been as it were on that side Goarly is a great fool for his pains said the doctor He has had a very fair offer made him and first or last it ll cost him forty pounds He has got it into his head said the landlord that he can sue Lord Rufford for his fences Lord Rufford is not answerable for his fences It s the loss of crop he s going for said Twentyman How can there be pheasants to that amount in Dillsborough Wood continued the landlord when everybody knows that foxes breed there every year There isn t a surer find for a fox in the whole county Everybody knows that Lord Rufford never lets his game stand in the way of foxes Lord Rufford was mister Runciman s great friend and patron and best customer and not a word against Lord Rufford was allowed in that room though elsewhere in Dillsborough ill natured things were sometimes said of his lordship Then there came on that well worn dispute among sportsmen whether foxes and pheasants are or are not pleasant companions to each other Every one was agreed that if not then the pheasants should suffer and that any country gentleman who allowed his gamekeeper to entrench on the privileges of foxes in order that pheasants might be more abundant was a brute and a beast and altogether unworthy to live in England Larry Twentyman and Ned Botsey expressed an opinion that pheasants were predominant in Dillsborough Wood while mister Runciman the doctor and Harry Stubbings declared loudly that everything that foxes could desire was done for them in that Elysium of sport We drew the wood blank last time we were there said Larry Don t you remember mister Runciman about the end of last March Of course I remember said the landlord Just the end of the season when two vixens had litters in the wood You don t suppose Bean was going to let that old butcher Tony find a fox in Dillsborough at that time Bean was his lordship s head gamekeeper in that part of the country How many foxes had we found there during the season Two or three suggested Botsey Seven said the energetic landlord seven including cub hunting and killed four If you kill four foxes out of an eighty acre wood and have two litters at the end of the season I don t think you have much to complain of If they all did as well as Lord Rufford you d have more foxes than you d know what to do with said the doctor Then this branch of the conversation was ended by a bet of a new hat between Botsey and the landlord as to the finding of a fox in Dillsborough Wood when it should next be drawn as to which when the speculation was completed Harry Stubbings offered mister Runciman ten shillings down for his side of the bargain But all this did not divert the general attention from the important matter of Goarly s attack Let it be how it will said mister Runciman a fellow like that should be put down He did not address himself specially to mister Masters but that gentleman felt that he was being talked at Certainly he ought said doctor Nupper If he didn t feel satisfied with what his lordship offered him why couldn t he ask his lordship to refer the matter to a couple of farmers who understood it It s the spirit of the thing said mister Ribbs from his place on the sofa It s a hodious spirit That s just it mister Ribbs said Harry Stubbings It s all meant for opposition Whether it s shooting or whether it s hunting it s all one Such a chap oughtn t to be allowed to have land I d take it away from him by Act of Parliament It s such as him as is destroying the country There ain t many of them hereabouts thank God said the landlord Now mister Twentyman said Stubbings who was anxious to make friends with the gentleman farmer you know what land can do and what land has done as well as any man What would you say was the real damage done to them two wheat fields by his lordship s game last autumn You saw the crops as they were growing and you know what came off the land I wouldn t like to say But if you were on your oath mister Twentyman Was there more than seven and sixpence an acre lost No nor five shillings said Runciman I think Goarly ought to take his lordship s offer if you mean that said Twentyman Then there was a pause during which more drink was brought in and pipes were re lighted Everybody wished that mister Masters might be got to say that he would not take the case but there was a delicacy about asking him If I remember right he was in Rufford Gaol once said Runciman He was let out on bail and then the matter was hushed up somehow said the attorney It was something about a woman continued Runciman I know that on that occasion he came out an awful scoundrel Don t you remember asked Botsey how he used to walk up and down the covert side with a gun two years ago swearing he would shoot the fox if he broke over his land I heard him say it Botsey said Twentyman It wouldn t have been the first fox he s murdered said the doctor Not by many said the landlord You remember that old woman near my place said Stubbings It was he that put her up to tell all them lies about her turkeys I ran it home to him A blackguard like that Nobody ought to take him up I hope you won t mister Masters said the doctor The doctor was as old as the attorney and had known him for many years No one else could dare to ask the question I don t suppose I shall Nupper said the attorney from his chair It was the first word he had spoken since he had put down young Botsey It wouldn t just suit me but a man has to judge of those things for himself Then there was a general rejoicing and mister Runciman stood broiled bones and ham and eggs and bottled stout for the entire club one unfortunate effect of which unwonted conviviality was that mister Masters did not get home till near twelve o clock That was sure to cause discomfort and then he had pledged himself to decline Goarly s business CHAPTER V REGINALD MORTON We will now go back to Hoppet Hall and its inhabitants When the old squire died he left by his will Hoppet Hall and certain other houses in Dillsborough which was all that he could leave to his grandson Reginald Morton Then there arose a question whether this property also was not entailed The former mister Masters and our friend of the present day had been quite certain of the squire s power to do what he liked with it but others had been equally certain on the other side and there had been a lawsuit During that time Reginald Morton had been forced to live on a very small allowance His aunt Lady Ushant had done what little she could for him but it had been felt to be impossible that he should remain at Bragton which was the property of the cousin who was at law with him From the moment of his birth the Honourable missus Morton who was also his aunt by marriage had been his bitter enemy He was the son of an innkeeper s daughter and according to her theory of life should never even have been noticed by the real Mortons And this honourable old lady was almost equally adverse to Lady Ushant whose husband had simply been a knight and who had left nothing behind him Thus Reginald Morton had been friendless since his grandfather died and had lived in Germany nobody quite knew how During the entire period of this law suit Hoppet Hall had remained untenanted When the property was finally declared to belong to Reginald Morton the Hall before it could be used required considerable repair But there was other property The Bush Inn belonged to Reginald Morton as did the house in which mister Masters lived and sundry other smaller tenements in the vicinity There was an income from these of about five hundred pounds a year Reginald who was then nearly thirty years of age came over to England and stayed for a month or two at Bragton with his aunt to the infinite chagrin of the old dowager The management of the town property was entrusted to mister Masters and Hoppet Hall was repaired At this period mister Mainwaring had just come to Dillsborough and having a wife with some money and perhaps quite as much pretension had found the rectory too small and had taken the Hall on a lease for seven years When this was arranged Reginald Morton again went to Germany and did not return till the lease had run out By that time mister Mainwaring having spent a little money found that the rectory would be large enough for his small family Then the Hall was again untenanted for awhile till quite suddenly Reginald Morton returned to Dillsborough and took up his permanent residence in his own house It soon became known that the new comer would not add much to the gaiety of the place The only people whom he knew in Dillsborough were his own tenants mister Runciman and mister Masters and the attorney s eldest daughter During those months which he had spent with Lady Ushant at Bragton Mary had been living there then a child of twelve years old and as a child had become his fast friend With his aunt he had continually corresponded and partly at her instigation and partly from feelings of his own he had at once gone to the attorney s house This was now two years since and he had found in his old playmate a beautiful young woman in his opinion very unlike the people with whom she lived For the first twelvemonths he saw her occasionally though not indeed very often Once or twice he had drunk tea at the attorney s house on which occasions the drawing room upstairs had been almost as grand as it was uncomfortable Then the attentions of Larry Twentyman began to make themselves visible infinitely to Reginald Morton s disgust Up to that time he had no idea of falling in love with the girl himself Since he had begun to think on such subjects at all he had made up his mind that he would not marry He was almost the more proud of his birth by his father s side because he had been made to hear so much of his mother s low position He had told himself a hundred times that under no circumstances could he marry any other than a lady of good birth But his own fortune was small and he knew himself well enough to be sure that he would not marry for money He was now nearly forty years of age and had never yet been thrown into the society of any one that had attracted him He was sure that he would not marry And yet when he saw that mister Twentyman was made much of and flattered by the whole Masters family apparently because he was regarded as an eligible husband for Mary Reginald Morton was not only disgusted but personally offended Being a most unreasonable man he conceived a bitter dislike to poor Larry who at any rate was truly in love and was not looking too high in desiring to marry the portionless daughter of the attorney But Morton thought that the man ought to be kicked and horsewhipped or at any rate banished into some speechless exile for his presumption With mister Runciman he had dealings and in some sort friendship There were two meadows attached to Hoppet Hall fields lying close to the town which were very suitable for the landlord s purposes mister Mainwaring had held them in his own hands taking them up from mister Runciman who had occupied them while the house was untenanted in a manner which induced mister Runciman to feel that it was useless to go to church to hear such sermons as those preached by the rector But Morton had restored the fields giving them rent free on condition that he should be supplied with milk and butter mister Runciman no doubt had the best of the bargain as he generally had in all bargains but he was a man who liked to be generous when generously treated Consequently he almost overdid his neighbour with butter and cream and occasionally sent in quarters of lamb and sweetbreads to make up the weight I don t know that the offerings were particularly valued but friendship was engendered Runciman too had his grounds for quarrelling with those who had taken up the management of the Bragton property after the squire s death and had his own antipathy to the Honourable missus Morton and her grandson the Secretary of Legation When the law suit was going on he had been altogether on Reginald Morton s side It was an affair of sides and quite natural that Runciman and the attorney should be friendly with the new comer at Hoppet Hall though there were very few points of personal sympathy between them Reginald Morton was no sportsman nor was he at all likely to become a member of the Dillsborough Club It was currently reported of him in the town that he had never sat on a horse or fired off a gun As he had been brought up as a boy by the old squire this was probably an exaggeration but it is certain that at this period of his life he had given up any aptitudes in that direction for which his early training might have suited him He had brought back with him to Hoppet Hall many cases of books which the ignorance of Dillsborough had magnified into an enormous library and he was certainly a sedentary reading man There was already a report in the town that he was engaged in some stupendous literary work and the men and women generally looked upon him as a disagreeable marvel of learning Dillsborough of itself was not bookish and would have regarded any one known to have written an article in a magazine almost as a phenomenon He seldom went to church much to the sorrow of mister Surtees who ventured to call at the house and remonstrate with him He never called again And though it was the habit of mister Surtees life to speak as little ill as possible of any one he was not able to say any good of mister Morton mister Mainwaring who would never have troubled himself though his parishioner had not entered a place of worship once in a twelvemonth did say many severe things against his former landlord He hated people who were unsocial and averse to dining out and who departed from the ways of living common among English country gentlemen mister Mainwaring was upon the whole prepared to take the other side Reginald Morton though he was now nearly forty was a young looking handsome man with fair hair cut short and a light beard which was always clipped Though his mother had been an innkeeper s daughter in Montreal he had the Morton blue eyes and the handsome well cut Morton nose He was nearly six feet high and strongly made and was known to be a much finer man than the Secretary of Legation who was rather small and supposed to be not very robust Our lonely man was a great walker and had investigated every lane and pathway and almost every hedge within ten miles of Dillsborough before he had resided there two years but his favourite rambles were all in the neighbourhood of Bragton As there was no one living in the house no one but the old housekeeper who had lived there always he was able to wander about the place as he pleased On the Tuesday afternoon after the meeting of the Dillsborough Club which has been recorded he was seated about three o clock on the rail of the foot bridge over the Dill with a long German pipe hanging from his mouth He was noted throughout the whole country for this pipe or for others like it such a one usually being in his mouth as he wandered about The amount of tobacco which he had smoked since his return to these parts exactly in that spot was considerable for there he might have been found at some period of the afternoon at least three times a week He would sit on this rail for half an hour looking down at the sluggish waters of the little river rolling the smoke out of his mouth at long intervals and thinking perhaps of the great book which he was supposed to be writing As he sat there now he suddenly heard voices and laughter and presently three girls came round the corner of the hedge which at this spot hid the Dillsborough path and he saw the attorney s three daughters It s mister Morton said Dolly in a whisper He s always walking about Bragton said Kate in another whisper Tony Tuppett says that he s the Bragton ghost Kate said Mary also in a low voice you shouldn t talk so much about what you hear from Tony Tuppett Bosh said Kate who knew that she could not be scolded in the presence of mister Morton He came forward and shook hands with them all and took off his hat to Mary You ve walked a long way Miss Masters he said We don t think it far I like sometimes to come and look at the old place And so do I I wonder whether you remember how often I ve sat you on this rail and threatened to throw you into the river I remember very well that you did threaten me once and that I almost believed that you would throw me in What had she done that was naughty mister Morton asked Kate I don t think she ever did anything naughty in those days I don t know whether she has changed for the worse since Mary is never naughty now said Dolly Kate and I are naughty and it s very much better fun than being good The world has found out that long ago Miss Dolly only the world is not quite so candid in owning it as you are Will you come and walk round the house Miss Masters I never go in but I have no scruples about the paths and park At the end of the bridge leading into the shrubbery there was a stile high indeed but made commodiously with steps almost like a double staircase so that ladies could pass it without trouble Mary had given her assent to the proposed walk and was in the act of putting out her hand to be helped over the stile when mister Twentyman appeared at the other side of it If here isn t Larry said Kate Morton s face turned as black as thunder but he immediately went back across the bridge leading Mary with him The other girls who had followed him on to the bridge had of course to go back also Mary was made very unhappy by the meeting mister Morton would of course think that it had been planned whereas by Mary herself it had been altogether unexpected Kate when the bridge was free rushed over it and whispered something to Larry The meeting had indeed been planned between her and Dolly and the lover and this special walk had been taken at the request of the two younger girls Morton stood stock still as though he expected that Twentyman would pass by Larry hurried over the bridge feeling sure that the meeting with Morton had been accidental and thinking that he would pass on towards the house Larry was not at all ashamed of his purpose nor was he inclined to give way and pass on He came up boldly to his love and shook hands with her with a pleasant smile If you are walking back to Dillsborough he said maybe you ll let me go a little way with you I was going round the house with mister Morton she said timidly Perhaps I can join you said he bobbing his head at the other man If you intended to walk back with mister Twentyman began Morton But I didn t said the poor girl who in truth understood more of it all than did either of the two men I didn t expect him and I didn t expect you It s a pity I can t go both ways isn t it she added attempting to appear cheerful Come back Mary said Kate we ve had walking enough and shall be awfully tired before we get home Mary had thought that she would like extremely to go round the house with her old friend and have a hundred incidents of her early life called to her memory The meeting with Reginald Morton had been altogether pleasant to her She had often felt how much she would have liked it had the chance of her life enabled her to see more frequently one whom as a child she had so intimately known But at the moment she lacked the courage to walk boldly across the bridge and thus to rid herself of Lawrence Twentyman She had already perceived that Morton s manner had rendered it impossible that her lover should follow them I am afraid I must go home she said It was the very thing she did not want to do this going home with Lawrence Twentyman and yet she herself said that she must do it driven to say so by a nervous dread of showing herself to be fond of the other man s company Good afternoon to you said Morton very gloomily waving his hat and stalking across the bridge CHAPTER VI NOT IN LOVE Reginald Morton as he walked across the bridge towards the house was thoroughly disgusted with all the world He was very angry with himself feeling that he had altogether made a fool of himself by his manner He had shown himself to be offended not only by mister Twentyman but by Miss Masters also and he was well aware as he thought of it all that neither of them had given him any cause of offence If she chose to make an appointment for a walk with mister Lawrence Twentyman and to keep it what was that to him His anger was altogether irrational and he knew that it was so What right had he to have an opinion about it if Mary Masters should choose to like the society of mister Twentyman It was an affair between her and her father and mother in which he could have no interest and yet he had not only taken offence but was well aware that he had shown his feeling Nevertheless as to the girl herself he could not argue himself out of his anger It was grievous to him that he should have gone out of his way to ask her to walk with him just at the moment when she was expecting this vulgar lover for that she had expected him he felt no doubt Yet he had heard her disclaim any intention of walking with the man But girls are sly especially when their lovers are concerned It made him sore at heart to feel that this girl should be sly and doubly sore to think that she should have been able to love such a one as Lawrence Twentyman As he roamed about among the grounds this idea troubled him much He assured himself that he was not in love with her himself and that he had no idea of falling in love with her but it sickened him to think that a girl who had been brought up by his aunt who had been loved at Bragton whom he had liked who looked so like a lady should put herself on a par with such a wretch as that In all this he was most unjust to both of them He was specially unjust to poor Larry who was by no means a wretch His costume was not that to which Morton had been accustomed in Germany nor would it have passed without notice in Bond Street But it was rational and clean When he came to the bridge to meet his sweetheart he had on a dark green shooting coat a billicock hat brown breeches and gaiters nearly up to his knees I don t know that a young man in the country could wear more suitable attire And he was a well made man just such a one as in this dress would take the eye of a country girl There was a little bit of dash about him just a touch of swagger which better breeding might have prevented But it was not enough to make him odious to an unprejudiced observer I could fancy that an old lady from London with an eye in her head for manly symmetry would have liked to look at Larry and would have thought that a girl in Mary s position would be happy in having such a lover providing that his character was good and his means adequate But Reginald Morton was not an old woman and to his eyes the smart young farmer with his billicock hat not quite straight on his head was an odious thing to behold He exaggerated the swagger and took no notice whatever of the well made limbs And then this man had proposed to accompany him had wanted to join his party had thought it possible that a flirtation might be carried on in his presence He sincerely hated the man But what was he to think of such a girl as Mary Masters when she could bring herself to like the attentions of such a lover He was very cross with himself because he knew how unreasonable was his anger Of one thing only could he assure himself that he would never again willingly put himself in Mary s company What was Dillsborough and the ways of its inhabitants to him Why should he so far leave the old fashions of his life as to fret himself about an attorney s daughter in a little English town And yet he did fret himself walking rapidly and smoking his pipe a great deal quicker than was his custom When he was about to return home he passed the front of the house and there standing at the open door he saw missus Hopkins the housekeeper who had in truth been waiting for him He said a good natured word to her intending to make his way on without stopping but she called him back Have you heard the news mister Reginald she said I haven t heard any news this twelvemonth he replied Laws that is so like you mister Reginald The young squire is to be here next week Who is the young squire I didn t know there was any squire now mister Reginald A squire as I take it missus Hopkins is a country gentleman who lives on his own property Since my grandfather s time no such gentleman has lived at Bragton That s true too mister Reginald Any way mister Morton is coming down next week I thought he was in America He has come home for a turn like and is staying up in town with the old lady The old lady always meant the Honourable missus Morton And is the old lady coming down with him I fancy she is mister Reginald He didn t say as much but only that there would be three or four a couple of ladies he said and perhaps more So I am getting the east bedroom with the dressing room and the blue room for her ladyship People about Bragton had been accustomed to call missus Morton her ladyship That s where she always used to be Would you come in and see mister Reginald Certainly not missus Hopkins If you were asking me into a house of your own I would go in and see all the rooms and chat with you for an hour but I don t suppose I shall ever go into this house again unless things change very much indeed Then I m sure I hope they will change mister Reginald missus Hopkins had known Reginald Morton as a boy growing up into manhood had almost been present at his birth and had renewed her friendship while he was staying with Lady Ushant but of the present squire as she called him she had seen almost nothing and what she had once remembered of him had now been obliterated by an absence of twenty years Of course she was on Reginald s side in the family quarrel although she was the paid servant of the Foreign Office paragon And they are to be here next week What day next week missus Hopkins missus Hopkins didn t know on what day she was to expect the visitors nor how long they intended to stay mister John Morton had said in his letter that he would send his own man down two days before his arrival and that was nearly all that he had said Then Morton started on his return walk to Dillsborough again taking the path across the bridge Ah he said to himself with a shudder as he crossed the stile thinking of his own softened feelings as he had held out his hand to help Mary Masters and then of his revulsion of feeling when she declared her purpose of walking home with mister Twentyman And he struck the rail of the bridge with his stick as though he were angry with the place altogether And he thought to himself that he would never come there any more that he hated the place and that he would never cross that bridge again Then his mind reverted to the tidings he had heard from missus Hopkins What ought he to do when his cousin arrived Though there had been a long lawsuit there had been no actual declared quarrel between him and the heir He had indeed never seen the heir for the last twenty years nor had they ever interchanged letters There had been no communication whatever between them and therefore there could hardly be a quarrel He disliked his cousin nay almost hated him he was quite aware of that And he was sure also that he hated that Honourable old woman worse than any one else in the world and that he always would do so He knew that the Honourable old woman had attempted to drive his own mother from Bragton and of course he hated her But that was no reason why he should not call on his cousin He was anxious to do what was right He was specially anxious that blame should not be attributed to him What he would like best would be that he might call might find nobody at home and that then John Morton should not return the courtesy He did not want to go to Bragton as a guest he did not wish to be in the wrong himself but he was by no means equally anxious that his cousin should keep himself free from reproach The bridge path came out on the Dillsborough road just two miles from the town and Morton as he got over the last stile saw Lawrence Twentyman coming towards him on the road The man no doubt had gone all the way into Dillsborough with the girls and was now returning home The parish of Bragton lies to the left of the high road as you go into the town from Rufford and the direction of London whereas Chowton Farm the property of mister Twentyman is on the right of the road but in the large parish of saint John s Dillsborough Dillsborough Wood lies at the back of Larry Twentyman s land and joining on to Larry s land and also to the wood is the patch of ground owned by that scoundrel Goarly Chowton Farm gate opens on to the high road so that Larry was now on his direct way home As soon as he saw Morton he made up his mind to speak to him He was quite sure from what had passed between him and the girls on the road home that he had done something wrong He was convinced that he had interfered in some ill bred way though he did not at all know how Of Reginald Morton he was not in the least jealous He too was of a jealous temperament but it had never occurred to him to join Reginald Morton and Mary Masters together He was very much in love with Mary but had no idea that she was in any way above the position which she might naturally hold as daughter of the Dillsborough attorney But of Reginald Morton s attributes and scholarship and general standing he had a mystified appreciation which saved him from the pain of thinking that such a man could be in love with his sweetheart As he certainly did not wish to quarrel with Morton having always taken Reginald s side in the family disputes he thought that he would say a civil word in passing and if possible apologise When Morton came up he raised his hand to his head and did open his mouth though not pronouncing any word very clearly Morton looked at him as grim as death just raised his hand and then passed on with a quick step Larry was displeased but the other was so thoroughly a gentleman one of the Mortons and a man of property in the county that he didn t even yet wish to quarrel with him What the deuce have I done said he to himself as he walked on I didn t tell her not to go up to the house If I offered to walk with her what was that to him It must be remembered that Lawrence Twentyman was twelve years younger than Reginald Morton and that a man of twenty eight is apt to regard a man of forty as very much too old for falling in love It is a mistake which it will take him fully ten years to rectify and then he will make a similar mistake as to men of fifty With his awe for Morton s combined learning and age it never occurred to him to be jealous Morton passed on rapidly almost feeling that he had been a brute But what business had the objectionable man to address him He tried to excuse himself but yet he felt that he had been a brute and had so demeaned himself in reference to the daughter of the Dillsborough attorney He would teach himself to do all he could to promote the marriage He would give sage advice to Mary Masters as to the wisdom of establishing herself having not an hour since made up his mind that he would never see her again He would congratulate the attorney and missus Masters He would conquer the absurd feeling which at present was making him wretched He would cultivate some sort of acquaintance with the man and make the happy pair a wedding present But yet what a beast the man was with that billicock hat on one side of his head and those tight leather gaiters As he passed through the town towards his own house he saw mister Runciman standing in front of the hotel His road took him up Hobbs gate by the corner of the Bush but Runciman came a little out of the way to meet him You have heard the news said the innkeeper I have heard one piece of news What s that sir Come you tell me yours first The young squire is coming down to Bragton next week That s my news too It is not likely that there should be two matters of interest in Dillsborough on the same day I don t know why Dillsborough should be worse off than any other place mister Morton but at any rate the squire s coming So missus Hopkins told me Has he written to you His coachman or his groom has or perhaps he keeps what they call an ekkery He s much too big a swell to write to the likes of me Lord bless me when I think of it I wonder how many dozen of orders I ve had from Lord Rufford under his own hand Dear Runciman dinner at eight ten of us won t wait a moment Yours R I suppose mister Morton would think that his lordship had let himself down by anything of that sort What does my cousin want Two pair of horses for a week certain and perhaps longer and two carriages How am I to let anyone have two pair of horses for a week certain and perhaps longer What are other customers to do I can supply a gentleman by the month and buy horses to suit or I can supply him by the job But I guess mister Morton don t well know how things are managed in this country He ll have to learn What day does he come They haven t told me that yet mister Morton CHAPTER VII THE WALK HOME Mary Masters when Reginald Morton had turned his back upon her at the bridge was angry with herself and with him which was reasonable and very angry also with Larry Twentyman which was unreasonable As she had at once acceded to Morton s proposal that they should walk round the house together surely he should not have deserted her so soon It had not been her fault that the other man had come up She had not wanted him But she was aware that when the option had in some sort been left to herself she had elected to walk back with Larry She knew her own motives and her own feelings but neither of the men would understand them Because she preferred the company of mister Morton and had at the moment feared that her sisters would have deserted her had she followed him therefore she had declared her purpose of going back to Dillsborough in doing which she knew that Larry and the girls would accompany her But of course mister Morton would think that she had preferred the company of her recognised admirer It was pretty well known in Dillsborough that Larry was her lover Her stepmother had spoken of it very freely and Larry himself was a man who did not keep his lights hidden under a bushel I hope I ve not been in the way Mary said mister Twentyman as soon as Morton was out of hearing In the way of what I didn t think there was any harm in offering to go up to the house with you if you were going Who has said there was any harm The path was only broad enough for one and she was walking first Larry was following her and the girls were behind him I think that mister Morton is a very stuck up fellow said Kate who was the last Hold your tongue Kate said Mary You don t know what you are talking about I know as well as any one when a person is good natured What made him go off in that hoity toity fashion Nobody had said anything to him He always looks as though he were going to eat somebody said Dolly He shan t eat me said Kate Then there was a pause during which they all went along quickly Mary leading the way Larry felt that he was wasting his opportunity and yet hardly knew how to use it feeling that the girl was angry with him I wish you d say Mary whether you think that I did anything wrong Nothing wrong to me mister Twentyman Did I do anything wrong to him I don t know how far you may be acquainted with him He was proposing to go somewhere and you offered to go with him I offered to go with you said Larry sturdily I suppose I m sufficiently acquainted with you Quite so said Mary Why should he be so proud I never said an uncivil word to him He s nothing to me If he can do without me I m sure that I can do without him Very well indeed I should think The truth is Mary There has been quite enough said about it mister Twentyman The truth is Mary I came on purpose to have a word with you Hearing this Kate rushed on and pulled Larry by the tail of his coat How did you know I was to be there demanded Mary sharply I didn t know I had reason to think you perhaps might be there The girls I knew had been asking you to come as far as the bridge At any rate I took my chance I d seen him some time before and then I saw you If I m to be watched about in that way said Mary angrily I won t go out at all Of course I want to see you Why shouldn t I I m all fair and above board ain t I Your father and mother know all about it It isn t as though I were doing anything clandestine He paused for a reply but Mary walked on in silence She knew quite well that he was warranted in seeking her and that nothing but a very positive decision on her part could put an end to his courtship At the present moment she was inclined to be very positive but he had hardly as yet given her an opportunity of speaking out I think you know Mary what it is that I want They were now at a rough stile which enabled him to come close up to her and help her She tripped over the stile with a light step and again walked on rapidly The field they were in enabled him to get up to her side and now if ever was his opportunity It was a long straggling meadow which he knew well with the Dill running by it all the way or rather two meadows with an open space where there had once been a gate He had ridden through the gap a score of times and knew that at the further side of the second meadow they would come upon the high road The fields were certainly much better for his purpose than the road Don t you think Mary you could say a kind word to me I never said anything unkind You can t think ill of me for loving you better than all the world I don t think ill of you at all I think very well of you That s kind So I do How can I help thinking well of you when I ve never heard anything but good of you Then why shouldn t you say at once that you ll have me and make me the happiest man in all the county Because Well I told you before mister Twentyman and that ought to have been enough A young woman doesn t fall in love with every man that she thinks well of I should like you as well as all the rest of the family if you would only marry some other girl I shall never do that Yes you will some day Never I ve set my heart upon it and I mean to stick to it I m not the fellow to turn about from one girl to another What I want is the girl I love I ve money enough and all that kind of thing of my own I m sure you re disinterested mister Twentyman Yes I am Ever since you ve been home from Bragton it has been the same thing and when I felt that it was so I spoke up to your father honestly I haven t been beating about the bush and I haven t done anything that wasn t honourable They were very near the last stile now Come Mary if you won t make me a promise say that you ll think of it I have thought of it mister Twentyman and I can t make you any other answer I dare say I m very foolish I wish you were more foolish Perhaps then you wouldn t be so hard to please Whether I m wise or foolish indeed indeed it s no good your going on Now we re on the road Pray go back home mister Twentyman It ll be getting dark in a little time Not before we re in Dillsborough If it were ever so dark we could find our way home by ourselves Come along Dolly Over the last stile he had stayed a moment to help the younger girl and as he did so Kate whispered a word in his ear She s angry because she couldn t go up to the house with that stuck up fellow It was a foolish word but then Kate Masters had not had much experience in the world Whether overcome by Mary s resolute mode of speaking or aware that the high road would not suit his purpose he did turn back as soon as he had seen them a little way on their return towards the town He had not gone half a mile before he met Morton and had been half minded to make some apology to him But Morton had denied him the opportunity and he had walked on to his own house low in spirits indeed but still with none of that sorest of agony which comes to a lover from the feeling that his love loves some one else Mary had been very decided with him more so he feared than before but still he saw no reason why he should not succeed at last missus Masters had told him that Mary would certainly give a little trouble in winning but would be the more worth the winner s trouble when won And she had certainly shown no preference for any other young man about the town There had been a moment when he had much dreaded mister Surtees Young clergymen are apt to be formidable rivals and mister Surtees had certainly made some overtures of friendship to Mary Masters But Larry had thought that he had seen that these overtures had not led to much and then that fear had gone from him He did believe that Mary was now angry because she had not been allowed to walk about Bragton with her old friend mister Morton It had been natural that she should like to do so It was the pride of Mary s life that she had been befriended by the Mortons and Lady Ushant But it did not occur to him that he ought to be jealous of mister Morton though it had occurred to Kate Masters There was very little said between the sisters on their way back to the town Mary was pretty sure now that the two girls had made the appointment with Larry but she was unwilling to question them on the subject Immediately on their arrival at home they heard the great news John Morton was coming to Bragton with a party of ladies and gentlemen missus Hopkins had spoken of four persons missus Masters told Mary that there were to be a dozen at least and that four or five pairs of horses and half a dozen carriages had been ordered from mister Runciman He means to cut a dash when he does begin said missus Masters Is he going to stay mother He wouldn t come down in that way if it was only for a few days I suppose But what they will do for furniture I don t know There s plenty of furniture mother A thousand years old Or for wine or fruit or plate The old plate was there when Lady Ushant left People do things now in a very different way from what they used A couple of dozen silver forks made quite a show on the old squire s table Now they change the things so often that ten dozen is nothing I don t suppose there s a bottle of wine in the cellar They can get wine from Cobbold mother Cobbold s wine won t go down with them I fancy I wonder what servants they re bringing When mister Masters came in from his office the news was corroborated mister John Morton was certainly coming to Bragton The attorney had still a small unsettled and disputed claim against the owner of the property and he had now received by the day mail an answer to a letter which he had written to mister Morton saying that that gentleman would see him in the course of the next fortnight CHAPTER VIII THE PARAGON S PARTY AT BRAGTON There was certainly a great deal of fuss made about John Morton s return to the home of his ancestors made altogether by himself and those about him and not by those who were to receive him On the Thursday in the week following that of which we have been speaking two carriages from the Bush met the party at the Railway Station and took them to Bragton mister Runciman after due consideration put up with the inconsiderate nature of the order given and supplied the coaches and horses as required consoling himself no doubt with the reflection that he could charge for the unreasonableness of the demand in the bill The coachman and butler had come down two days before their master so that things might be in order missus Hopkins learned from the butler that though the party would at first consist only of three two other very august persons were to follow on the Saturday no less than Lady Augustus Trefoil and her daughter Arabella And missus Hopkins was soon led to imagine though no positive information was given to her on the subject that Miss Trefoil was engaged to be married to their master Will he live here altogether mister Tankard missus Hopkins asked To this question mister Tankard was able to give a very definite answer He was quite sure that mister Morton would not live anywhere altogether According to mister Tankard s ideas the whole foreign policy of England depended on mister John Morton s presence in some capital either in Europe Asia or America upon mister Morton s presence and of course upon his own also mister Tankard thought it not improbable that they might soon be wanted at Hong Kong or some very distant place but in the meantime they were bound to be back at Washington very shortly Tankard had himself been at Washington and also before that at Lisbon and could tell missus Hopkins how utterly unimportant had been the actual ministers at those places and how the welfare of England had depended altogether on the discretion and general omniscience of his young master and of himself He Tankard had been the only person in Washington who had really known in what order Americans should go out to dinner one after another mister Elias Gotobed who was coming was perhaps the most distinguished American of the day and was Senator for Mickewa Mickey war said poor missus Hopkins that s been one of them terrible American wars we used to hear of Then Tankard explained to her that Mickewa was one of the Western States and mister Elias Gotobed was a great Republican who had very advanced opinions of his own respecting government liberty and public institutions in general With mister Morton and the Senator was coming the Honourable missus Morton The lady had her lady s maid and mister Morton had his own man so that there would be a great influx of persons Of course there was very much perturbation of spirit missus Hopkins after that first letter the contents of which she had communicated to Reginald Morton had received various despatches and been asked various questions Could she find a cook Could she find two housemaids And all these were only wanted for a time In her distress she went to missus Runciman and did get assistance I suppose he thinks he s to have the cook out of my kitchen Runciman had said Somebody however was found who said she could cook and two girls who professed that they knew how to make beds And in this way an establishment was ready before the arrival of the Secretary of Legation and the great American Senator Those other questions of wine and plate and vegetables had no doubt settled themselves after some fashion John Morton had come over to England on leave of absence for four months and had brought with him the Senator from Mickewa The Senator had never been in England before and was especially anxious to study the British Constitution and to see the ways of Britons with his own eyes He had only been a fortnight in London before this journey down to the county had been planned mister Gotobed wished to see English country life and thought that he could not on his first arrival have a better opportunity It must be explained also that there was another motive for this English rural sojourn Lady Augustus Trefoil who was an adventurous lady had been travelling in the United States with her daughter and had there fallen in with mister John Morton Arabella Trefoil was a beauty and a woman of fashion and had captivated the Paragon An engagement had been made subject to various stipulations the consent of Lord Augustus in the first place as to which John Morton who only understood foreign affairs was not aware as he would have been had he lived in England that Lord Augustus was nobody Lady Augustus had spoken freely as to settlements value of property life insurance and such matters and had spoken firmly as well as freely expressing doubt as to the expediency of such an engagement all of which had surprised mister Morton considerably for the young lady had at first been left in his hands with almost American freedom And now Lady Augustus and her daughter were coming down on a visit of inspection They had been told as had the Senator that things would be in the rough The house had not been properly inhabited for nearly a quarter of a century The Senator had expressed himself quite contented Lady Augustus had only hoped that everything would be made as comfortable as possible for her daughter I don t know what more could have been done at so short a notice than to order two carriages two housemaids and a cook A word or two must also be said of the old lady who made one of the party The Honourable missus Morton was now seventy but no old lady ever showed less signs of advanced age It is not to be understood from this that she was beautiful but that she was very strong What might be the colour of her hair or whether she had any no man had known for many years But she wore so perfect a front that some people were absolutely deluded She was very much wrinkled but as there are wrinkles which seem to come from the decay of those muscles which should uphold the skin so are there others which seem to denote that the owner has simply got rid of the watery weaknesses of juvenility missus Morton s wrinkles were strong wrinkles She was thin but always carried herself bolt upright and would never even lean back in her chair She had a great idea of her duty and hated everybody who differed from her with her whole heart She was the daughter of a Viscount a fact which she never forgot for a single moment and which she thought gave her positive superiority to all women who were not the daughters of Dukes or Marquises or of Earls Therefore as she did not live much in the fashionable world she rarely met any one above herself Her own fortune on her marriage had been small but now she was a rich woman Her husband had been dead nearly half a century and during the whole of that time she had been saving money To two charities she gave annually Lfive per annum each Duty demanded it and the money was given Beyond that she had never been known to spend a penny in charity Duty she had said more than once required of her that she do something to repair the ravages made on the Morton property by the preposterous extravagance of the old squire in regard to the younger son and that son s child In her anger she had not hesitated on different occasions to call the present Reginald a bastard though the expression was a wicked calumny for which there was no excuse Without any aid of hers the Morton property had repaired itself There had been a minority of thirteen or fourteen years and since that time the present owner had not spent his income But John Morton was not himself averse to money and had always been careful to maintain good relations with his grandmother She had now been asked down to Bragton in order that she might approve if possible of the proposed wife It was not likely that she should approve absolutely of anything but to have married without an appeal to her would have been to have sent the money flying into the hands of some of her poor paternal cousins Arabella Trefoil was the granddaughter of a duke and a step had so far been made in the right direction But missus Morton knew that Lord Augustus was nobody that there would be no money and that Lady Augustus had been the daughter of a banker and that her fortune had been nearly squandered The Paragon was not in the least afraid of his American visitor nor as far as the comforts of his house were concerned of his grandmother Of the beauty and her mother he did stand in awe but he had two days in which to look to things before they would come The train reached the Dillsborough Station at half past three and the two carriages were there to meet them You will understand mister Gotobed said the old lady that my grandson has nothing of his own established here as yet This little excuse was produced by certain patches and tears in the cushions and linings of the carriages mister Gotobed smiled and bowed and declared that everything was fixed convenient Then the Senator followed the old lady into one carriage mister Morton followed alone into the other and they were driven away to Bragton When missus Hopkins had taken the old lady up to her room mister Morton asked the Senator to walk round the grounds mister Gotobed lighting an enormous cigar of which he put half down his throat for more commodious and quick consumption walked on to the middle of the drive and turning back looked up at the house Quite a pile he said observing that the offices and outhouses extended a long way to the left till they almost joined other buildings in which were the stables and coach house It s a good sized house said the owner nothing very particular as houses are built now a days Damp I should say I think not I have never lived here much myself but I have not heard that it is considered so I guess it s damp Very lonely isn t it We like to have our society inside among ourselves in the country Keep a sort of hotel like suggested mister Gotobed Well I don t dislike hotel life especially when there are no charges How many servants do you want to keep up such a house as that mister Morton explained that at present he knew very little about it himself then led him away by the path over the bridge and turning to the left showed him the building which had once been the kennels of the Rufford hounds All that for dogs exclaimed mister Gotobed All for dogs said Morton Hounds we generally call them Hounds are they Well I ll remember though dogs seems to me more civil How many used there to be About fifty couple I think A hundred dogs No wonder your country gentlemen burst up so often Wouldn t half a dozen do as well except for the show of the thing Half a dozen hounds couldn t hunt a fox mister Gotobed I guess half a dozen would do just as well only for the show What strikes me mister Morton on visiting this old country is that so much is done for show What do you say to New York mister Gotobed There certainly are a couple of hundred fools in New York who having more money than brains amuse themselves by imitating European follies But you won t find that through the country mister Morton You won t find a hundred dogs at an American planter s house when ten or twelve would do as well Hunting is not one of your amusements Yes it is I ve been a hunter myself I ve had nothing to eat but what I killed for a month together That s more than any of your hunters can say A hundred dogs to kill one fox Not all at the same time mister Gotobed And you have got none now I don t hunt myself And does nobody hunt the foxes about here at present Then Morton explained that on the Saturday following the U R U hounds under the mastership of that celebrated sportsman Captain Glomax would meet at eleven o clock exactly at the spot on which they were then standing and that if mister Gotobed would walk out after breakfast he should see the whole paraphernalia including about half a hundred dogs and perhaps a couple of hundred men on horseback I shall be delighted to see any institution of this great country said mister Gotobed however much opposed it may be to my opinion either of utility or rational recreation Then having nearly eaten up one cigar he lit another preparatory to eating it and sauntered back to the house Before dinner that evening there were a few words between the Paragon and his grandmother I m afraid you won t like my American friend he said He is all very well John Of course an American member of Congress can t be an English gentleman You in your position have to be civil to such people I dare say I shall get on very well with mister Gotobed I must get somebody to meet him Lady Augustus and her daughter are coming They knew each other in Washington And there will be so many ladies You could ask the Coopers from Mallingham suggested the lady I don t think they would dine out He s getting very old And I m told the Mainwarings at Dillsborough are very nice people said missus Morton who knew that mister Mainwaring at any rate came from a good family I suppose they ought to call first I never saw them in my life Reginald Morton you know is living at Hoppet Hall in Dillsborough You don t mean to say you wish to ask him to this house I think I ought Why should I take upon myself to quarrel with a man I have not seen since I was a child and who certainly is my cousin I do not know that he is your cousin nor do you John Morton passed by the calumny which he had heard before and which he knew that it was no good for him to attempt to subvert He was received here as one of the family ma am I know he was and with what result I don t think that I ought to turn my back upon him because my great grandfather left property away from me to him It would give me a bad name in the county It would be against me when I settle down to live here I think quarrelling is the most foolish thing a man can do especially with his own relations I can only say this John let me know if he is coming so that I may not be called upon to meet him I will not eat at table with Reginald Morton So saying the old lady in a stately fashion stalked out of the room CHAPTER IX THE OLD KENNELS On the next morning missus Morton asked her grandson what he meant to do with reference to his suggested invitation to Reginald As you will not meet him of course I have given up the idea he said The of course had been far from true He had debated the matter very much with himself He was an obstinate man with something of independence in his spirit He liked money but he liked having his own way too The old lady looked as though she might live to be a hundred and though she might last only for ten years longer was it worth his while to be a slave for that time And he was by no means sure of her money though he should be a slave He almost made up his mind that he would ask Reginald Morton But then the old lady would be in her tantrums and there would be the disagreeable necessity of making an explanation to that inquisitive gentleman mister Elias Gotobed I couldn t have met him John I couldn t indeed I remember so well all that occurred when your poor infatuated old great grandfather would have that woman into the house I was forced to have my meals in my bedroom and to get myself taken away as soon as I could get a carriage and horses After all that I ought not to be asked to meet the child I was thinking of asking old mister Cooper on Monday I know she doesn t go out And perhaps mister Mainwaring wouldn t take it amiss mister Puttock I know isn t at home but if he were he couldn t come mister Puttock was the rector of Bragton a very rich living but was unfortunately afflicted with asthma Poor man I heard of that and he s only been here about six years I don t see why mister Mainwaring should take it amiss at all You can explain that you are only here a few days I like to meet clergymen I think that it is the duty of a country gentleman to ask them to his house It shows a proper regard for religion By the bye John I hope that you ll see that they have a fire in the church on Sunday The Honourable missus Morton always went to church and had no doubt of her own sincerity when she reiterated her prayer that as she forgave others their trespasses so might she be forgiven hers As Reginald Morton had certainly never trespassed against her perhaps there was no reason why her thoughts should be carried to the necessity of forgiving him The Paragon wrote two very diplomatic notes explaining his temporary residence and expressing his great desire to become acquainted with his neighbours Neither of the two clergymen were offended and both of them promised to eat his dinner on Monday mister Mainwaring was very fond of dining out and would have gone almost to any gentleman s house mister Cooper had been enough in the neighbourhood to have known the old squire and wrote an affectionate note expressing his gratification at the prospect of renewing his acquaintance with the little boy whom he remembered So the party was made up for Monday John Morton was very nervous on the matter fearing that Lady Augustus would think the land to be barren The Friday passed by without much difficulty The Senator was driven about and everything was inquired into One or two farm houses were visited and the farmers wives were much disturbed by the questions asked them I don t think they d get a living in the States was the Senator s remark after leaving one of the homesteads in which neither the farmer nor his wife had shown much power of conversation Then they re right to stay where they are replied mister Morton who in spite of his diplomacy could not save himself from being nettled They seem to get a very good living here and they pay their rent punctually On the Saturday morning the hounds met at the Old Kennels as the meet was always called and here was an excellent opportunity of showing to mister Gotobed one of the great institutions of the country It was close to the house and therefore could be reached without any trouble and as it was held on Morton s own ground he could do more towards making his visitor understand the thing than might have been possible elsewhere When the hounds moved the carriage would be ready to take them about the roads and show them as much as could be seen on wheels Punctually at eleven John Morton and his American guest were on the bridge and Tony Tuppett was already occupying his wonted place seated on a strong grey mare that had done a great deal of work but would live as Tony used to say to do a great deal more Round him the hounds were clustered twenty three couple in all some seated on their haunches some standing obediently still while a few moved about restlessly subject to the voices and on one or two occasions to a gentle administration of thong from the attendant whips Four or five horsemen were clustering round most of them farmers and were talking to Tony Our friend mister Twentyman was the only man in a red coat who had yet arrived and with him on her brown pony was Kate Masters who was listening with all her ears to every word that Tony said That I guess is the Captain you spoke of said the Senator pointing to Tony Tuppett Oh no that s the huntsman Those three men in caps are the servants who do the work The dogs can t be brought out without servants to mind them They re what you call gamekeepers Morton was explaining that the men were not gamekeepers when Captain Glomax himself arrived driving a tandem There was no road up to the spot but on hunt mornings or at any rate when the meet was at the old kennels the park gates were open so that vehicles could come up on the green sward That s Captain Glomax I suppose said Morton I don t know him but from the way he s talking to the huntsman you may be sure of it He is the great man is he All these dogs belong to him Either to him or the hunt And he pays for those servants Certainly He is a very rich man I suppose Then mister Morton endeavoured to explain the position of Captain Glomax He was not rich He was no one in particular except that he was Captain Glomax and his one attribute was a knowledge of hunting He didn t keep the dogs out of his own pocket He received Ltwo thousand a year from the gentlemen of the county and he himself only paid anything which the hounds and horses might cost over that He s a sort of upper servant then asked the Senator Not at all He s the greatest man in the county on hunting days Does he live out of it I should think not It s a deal of trouble isn t it Full work for an active man s time I should say A great many more questions were asked and answered at the end of which the Senator declared that he did not quite understand it but that as far as he saw he did not think very much of Captain Glomax If he could make a living out of it I should respect him said the Senator though it s like knife grinding or handling arsenic an unwholesome sort of profession I think they look very nice said Morton as one or two well turned out young men rode up to the place They seem to me to have thought more about their breeches than anything else said the Senator But if they re going to hunt why don t they hunt Have they got a fox with them Then there was a further explanation At this moment there was a murmur as of a great coming arrival and then an open carriage with four post horses was brought at a quick trot into the open space There were four men dressed for hunting inside and two others on the box They were all smoking and all talking It was easy to see that they did not consider themselves the least among those who were gathered together on this occasion The carriage was immediately surrounded by grooms and horses and the ceremony of disencumbering themselves of great coats and aprons of putting on spurs and fastening hat strings was commenced Then there were whispered communications from the grooms and long faces under some of the hats This horse hadn t been fit since last Monday s run and that man s hack wasn t as it should be A muttered curse might have been heard from one gentleman as he was told on jumping from the box that Harry Stubbings hadn t sent him any second horse to ride I didn t hear nothing about it till yesterday Captain said Harry Stubbings and every foot I had fit to come out was bespoke The groom however who heard this was quite aware that mister Stubbings did not wish to give unlimited credit to the Captain and he knew also that the second horse was to have carried his master the whole day as the animal which was brought to the meet had been ridden hard on the previous Wednesday At all this the Senator looked with curious eyes thinking that he had never in his life seen brought together a set of more useless human beings That is Lord Rufford said Morton pointing to a stout ruddy faced handsome man of about thirty who was the owner of the carriage Oh a lord Do the lords hunt generally That s as they like it Senators with us wouldn t have time for that said the Senator But you are paid to do your work Everybody from whom work is expected should be paid Then the work will be done or those who pay will know the reason why I must speak to Lord Rufford said Morton If you ll come with me I ll introduce you The Senator followed willingly enough and the introduction was made while his lordship was still standing by his horse The two men had known each other in London and it was natural that Morton as owner of the ground should come out and speak to the only man who knew him It soon was spread about that the gentleman talking to Lord Rufford was John Morton and many who lived in the county came up to shake hands with him To some of these the Senator was introduced and the conversation for a few minutes seemed to interrupt the business on hand I am sorry you should be on foot mister Gotobed said the lord And I am sorry that I cannot mount him said mister Morton We can soon get over that difficulty if he will allow me to offer him a horse The Senator looked as though he would almost like it but he didn t quite like it Perhaps your horse might kick me off my lord I can t answer for that but he isn t given to kicking and there he is if you ll get on him But the Senator felt that the exhibition would suit neither his age nor position and refused We d better be moving said Captain Glomax I suppose Lord Rufford we might as well trot over to Dillsborough Wood at once I saw Bean as I came along and he seemed to wish we should draw the wood first Then there was a little whispering between his lordship and the Master and Tony Tuppett His lordship thought that as mister Morton was there the hounds might as well be run through the Bragton spinnies Tony made a wry face and shook his head He knew that though the Old Kennels might be a very good place for meeting there was no chance of finding a fox at Bragton And Captain Glomax who being an itinerary master had no respect whatever for a country gentleman who didn t preserve also made a long face and also shook his head But Lord Rufford who knew the wisdom of reconciling a newcomer in the county to foxhunting prevailed and the hounds and men were taken round a part of Bragton Park What d t old squire ve said if he d ve known there hadn t been a fox at Bragton for more nor ten year This remark was made by Tuppett to mister Runciman who was riding by him mister Runciman replied that there was a great difference in people You may say that mister Runciman It s all changes His lordship s father couldn t bear the sight of a hound nor a horse and saddle Well I suppose I needn t gammon any furder We ll just trot across to the wood at once They haven t begun yet as far as I can see said mister Gotobed standing up in the carriage They haven t found as yet replied Morton They must go on till they find a fox They never bring him with them Then there was an explanation as to bagged foxes Morton not being very conversant with the subject he had to explain And if they shouldn t find one all day Then it ll be a blank And these hundred gentlemen will go home quite satisfied with themselves No they ll go home quite dissatisfied And have paid their money and given their time for nothing Do you know it doesn t seem to me the most heart stirring thing in the world Don t they ride faster than that At this moment Tony with the hounds at his heels was trotting across the park at a huntsman s usual pace from covert to covert The Senator was certainly ungracious Nothing that he saw produced from him a single word expressive of satisfaction Less than a mile brought them to the gate and road leading up to Chowton Farm They passed close by Larry Twentyman s door and not a few though it was not yet more than half past eleven stopped to have a glass of Larry s beer When the hounds were in the neighbourhood Larry s beer was always ready But Tony and his attendants trotted by with eyes averted as though no thought of beer was in their minds Nothing had been done and a huntsman is not entitled to beer till he has found a fox Captain Glomax followed with Lord Rufford and a host of others There was plenty of way here for carriages and half a dozen vehicles passed through Larry s farmyard Immediately behind the house was a meadow and at the bottom of the meadow a stubble field next to which was the ditch and bank which formed the bounds of Dillsborough Wood Just at this side of the gate leading into the stubble field there was already a concourse of people when Tony arrived near it with the hounds and immediately there was a holloaing and loud screeching of directions which was soon understood to mean that the hounds were at once to be taken away The Captain rode on rapidly and then sharply gave his orders Tony was to take the hounds back to mister Twentyman s farmyard as fast as he could and shut them up in a barn The whips were put into violent commotion Tony was eagerly at work Not a hound was to be allowed near the gate And then as the crowd of horsemen and carriages came on the word poison was passed among them from mouth to mouth What does all this mean said the Senator I don t at all know I m afraid there s something wrong replied Morton I heard that man say poison They have taken the dogs back again Then the Senator and Morton got out of the carriage and made their way into the crowd The riders who had grooms on second horses were soon on foot and a circle was made inside which there was some object of intense interest In the meantime the hounds had been secured in one of mister Twentyman s barns What was that object of interest shall be told in the next chapter CHAPTER X GOARLY S REVENGE The Senator and Morton followed close on the steps of Lord Rufford and Captain Glomax and were thus able to make their way into the centre of the crowd There on a clean sward of grass laid out as carefully as though he were a royal child prepared for burial was a dead fox It s pi son my lord it s pi son to a moral said Bean who as keeper of the wood was bound to vindicate himself and his master and the wood Feel of him how stiff he is A good many did feel but Lord Rufford stood still and looked at the poor victim in silence It s easy knowing how he come by it said Bean The men around gazed into each other s faces with a sad tragic air as though the occasion were one which at the first blush was too melancholy for many words There was whispering here and there and one young farmer s son gave a deep sigh like a steam engine beginning to work and rubbed his eyes with the back of his hand There ain t nothin too bad nothin said another leaving his audience to imagine whether he were alluding to the wretchedness of the world in general or to the punishment which was due to the perpetrator of this nefarious act The dreadful word vulpecide was heard from various lips with an oath or two before it It makes me sick of my own land to think it should be done so near said Larry Twentyman who had just come up mister Runciman declared that they must set their wits to work not only to find the criminal but to prove the crime against him and offered to subscribe a couple of sovereigns on the spot to a common fund to be raised for the purpose I don t know what is to be done with a country like this said Captain Glomax who as an itinerant was not averse to cast a slur upon the land of his present sojourn I don t remember anything like it on my property before said the lord standing up for his own estate and the county at large Nor in the hunt said young Hampton Of course such a thing may happen anywhere They had foxes poisoned in the Pytchley last year It shows a d bad feeling somewhere said the Master We know very well where the feeling is said Bean who had by this time taken up the fox determined not to allow it to pass into any hands less careful than his own It s that scoundrel Goarly said one of the Botseys Then there was an indignant murmur heard first of all from two or three and then running among the whole crowd Everybody knew as well as though he had seen it that Goarly had baited meat with strychnine and put it down in the wood Might have pi soned half the pack said Tony Tuppett who had come up on foot from the barn where the hounds were still imprisoned and had caught hold in an affectionate manner of a fore pad of the fox which Bean had clutched by the two hind legs Poor Tony Tuppett almost shed tears as he looked at the dead animal and thought what might have been the fate of the pack It s him my lord he said as we run through Littleton gorse Monday after Christmas last and up to Impington Park where he got away from us in a hollow tree He s four year old added Tony looking at the animal s mouth and there warn t a finer dog fox in the county Do they know all the foxes asked the Senator In answer to this Morton only shook his head not feeling quite sure himself how far a huntsman s acquaintance in that line might go and being also too much impressed by the occasion for speculative conversation It s that scoundrel Goarly had been repeated again and again and then on a sudden Goarly himself was seen standing on the further hedge of Larry s field with a gun in his hand He was not at this time above two hundred yards from them and was declared by one of the young farmers to be grinning with delight The next field was Goarly s but the hedge and ditch belonged to Twentyman Larry rushed forward as though determined to thrash the man and two or three followed him But Lord Rufford galloped on and stopped them Don t get into a row with a fellow like that he said to Twentyman He s on my land my lord said Larry impatiently I m on my own now and let me see who ll dare to touch me said Goarly jumping down You ve put poison down in that wood said Larry No I didn t but I knows who did It ain t I as am afeard for my young turkeys Now it was well known that old missus Twentyman Larry s mother was fond of young turkeys and that her poultry yard had suffered Larry in his determination to be a gentleman had always laughed at his mother s losses But now to be accused in this way was terrible to his feelings He made a rush as though to jump over the hedge but Lord Rufford again intercepted him I didn t think mister Twentyman that you d care for what such a fellow as that might say By this time Lord Rufford was off his horse and had taken hold of Larry I ll tell you all what it is screamed Goarly standing just at the edge of his own field if a hound comes out of the wood on to my land I ll shoot him I don t know nothing about p isoning though I dare say mister Twentyman does But if a hound comes on my land I ll shoot him open before you all There was however no danger of such a threat being executed on this day as of course no hound would be allowed to go into Dillsborough Wood Twentyman was reluctantly brought back into the meadow where the horses were standing and then a consultation was held as to what they should do next There were some who thought that the hounds should be taken home for the day It was as though some special friend of the U R U had died that morning and that the spirits of the sportsmen were too dejected for their sport Others with prudent foresight suggested that the hounds might run back from some distant covert to Dillsborough and that there should be no hunting till the wood had been thoroughly searched But the strangers especially those who had hired horses would not hear of this and after considerable delay it was arranged that the hounds should be trotted off as quickly as possible to Impington Gorse which was on the other side of Impington Park and fully five miles distant And so they started leaving the dead fox in the hands of Bean the gamekeeper Is this the sort of thing that occurs every day asked the Senator as he got back into the carriage I should fancy not answered Morton Somebody has poisoned a fox and I don t think that that is very often done about here Why did he poison him To save his fowls I suppose Why shouldn t he poison him if the fox takes his fowls Fowls are better than foxes Not in this country said Morton Then I m very glad I don t live here said mister Gotobed These friends of yours are dressed very nicely and look very well but a fox is a nasty animal It was that man standing up on the bank wasn t it continued the Senator who was determined to understand it all to the very bottom in reference to certain lectures which he intended to give on his return to the States and perhaps also in the old country before he left it They suspect him That man with the gun One man against two hundred Now I respect that man I do with all my heart You d better not say so here mister Gotobed I know how full of prejudice you all air but I do respect him If I comprehend the matter rightly he was on his own land when we saw him Yes that was his own field And they meant to ride across it whether he liked it or no Everybody rides across everybody s land out hunting Would they ride across your park mister Morton if you didn t let them Certainly they would and break down all my gates if I had them locked and pull down my park palings to let the hounds through And you could get no compensation Practically I could get none And certainly I should not try The greatest enemy to hunting in the whole county would not be foolish enough to make the attempt Why so He would get no satisfaction and everybody would hate him Then I respect that man the more What is that man s name Morton hadn t heard the name or had forgotten it I shall find that man out and have some conversation with him mister Morton I respect that man mister Morton He s one against two hundred and he insists upon his rights Those men standing round and wiping their eyes and stifled with grief because a fox had been poisoned as though some great patriot had died among them in the service of his country formed one of the most remarkable phenomena sir that ever I beheld in any country When I get among my own people in Mickewa and tell them that they won t believe me sir In the meantime the cavalcade was hurrying away to Impington Gorse and John Morton feeling that he had not had an opportunity as yet of showing his American friend the best side of hunting went with them The five miles were five long miles and as the pace was not above seven miles an hour nearly an hour was occupied There was therefore plenty of opportunity for the Senator to inquire whether the gentlemen around him were as yet enjoying their sport There was an air of triumph about him as to the misfortunes of the day joined to a battery of continued raillery which made it almost impossible for Morton to keep his temper He asked whether it was not at any rate better than trotting a pair of horses backwards and forwards over the same mile of road for half the day as is the custom in the States But the Senator though he did not quite approve of trotting matches argued that there was infinitely more of skill and ingenuity in the American pastime Everybody is so gloomy said the Senator lighting his third cigar I ve been watching that young man in pink boots for the last half hour and he hasn t spoken a word to any one Perhaps he s a stranger said Morton And that s the way you treat him It was past two when the hounds were put into the gorse and certainly no one was in a very good humour A trot of five miles is disagreeable and two o clock in November is late for finding a first fox and then poisoning is a vice that may grow into a habit There was a general feeling that Goarly ought to be extinguished but an idea that it might be difficult to extinguish him The whips nevertheless cantered on to the corner of the covert and Tony put in his hounds with a cheery voice The Senator remarked that the gorse was a very little place for as they were on the side of an opposite hill they could see it all Lord Rufford who was standing by the carriage explained to him that it was a favourite resort of foxes and difficult to draw as being very close Perhaps they ve poisoned him too said the Senator It was evident from his voice that had such been the case he would not have been among the mourners The blackguards are not yet thick enough in our country for that said Lord Rufford meaning to be sarcastic Then a whimper was heard from a hound at first very low and then growing into a fuller sound There he is said young Hampton For heaven s sake get those fellows away from that side Glomax This was uttered with so much vehemence that the Senator looked up in surprise Then the Captain galloped round the side of the covert and making use of some strong language stopped the ardour of certain gentlemen who were in a hurry to get away on what they considered good terms Lord Rufford Hampton Larry Twentyman and others sat stock still on their horses watching the gorse Ned Botsey urged himself a little forward down the hill and was creeping on when Captain Glomax asked him whether he would be so obliging kind as to remain where he was for half a minute Ned took the observations in good part and stopped his horse Does he do all that cursing and swearing for the Ltwo thousand asked the Senator The fox traversed the gorse back from side to side and from corner to corner again and again There were two sides certainly at which he might break but though he came out more than once he could not be got to go away They ll kill him now before he breaks said the elder Botsey Brute exclaimed his brother They re hot on him now said Hampton At this time the whole side of the hill was ringing with the music of the hounds He was out then but Dick turned him said Larry Dick was one of the whips Will you be so kind mister Morton asked the Senator as to tell me whether they re hunting yet They ve been at it for three hours and a half and I should like to know when they begin to amuse themselves Just as he had spoken there came from Dick a cry that he was away Tony who had been down at the side of the gorse at once jumped into it knowing the passage through Lord Rufford who for the last five or six minutes had sat perfectly still on his horse started down the hill as though he had been thrown from a catapult There was a little hand gate through which it was expedient to pass and in a minute a score of men were jostling for the way among whom were the two Botseys our friend Runciman and Larry Twentyman with Kate Masters on the pony close behind him Young Hampton jumped a very nasty fence by the side of the wicket and Lord Rufford followed him A score of elderly men with some young men among them too turned back into a lane behind them having watched long enough to see that they were to take the lane to the left and not the lane to the right After all there was time enough for when the men had got through the hand gate the hounds were hardly free of the covert and Tony riding up the side of the hill opposite was still blowing his horn But they were off at last and the bulk of the field got away on good terms with the hounds Now they are hunting said mister Morton to the Senator They all seemed to be very angry with each other at that narrow gate They were in a hurry I suppose Two of them jumped over the hedge Why didn t they all jump How long will it be now before they catch him Very probably they may not catch him at all Not catch him after all that Then the man was certainly right to poison that other fox in the wood How long will they go on Half an hour perhaps And you call that hunting Is it worth the while of all those men to expend all that energy for such a result Upon the whole mister Morton I should say that it is one of the most incomprehensible things that I have ever seen in the course of a rather long and varied life Shooting I can understand for you have your birds Fishing I can understand as you have your fish Here you get a fox to begin with and are all broken hearted Then you come across another after riding about all day and the chances are you can t catch him I suppose said mister Morton angrily the habits of one country are incomprehensible to the people of another When I see Americans loafing about in the bar room of an hotel I am lost in amazement There is not a man you see who couldn t give a reason for his being there He has an object in view though perhaps it may be no better than to rob his neighbour But here there seems to be no possible motive CHAPTER XI FROM IMPINGTON GORSE The fox ran straight from the covert through his well known haunts to Impington Park and as the hounds were astray there for two or three minutes there was a general idea that he too had got up into a tree which would have amused the Senator very much had the Senator been there But neither had the country nor the pace been adapted to wheels and the Senator and the Paragon were now returning along the road towards Bragton The fox had tried his old earths at Impington High wood and had then skulked back along the outside of the covert Had not one of the whips seen him he would have been troubled no further on that day a fact which if it could have been explained to the Senator in all its bearings would greatly have added to his delight But Dick viewed him and with many holloas and much blowing of horns and prayers from Captain Glomax that gentlemen would only be so good as to hold their tongues and a full tongued volley of abuse from half the field against an unfortunate gentleman who rode after the escaping fox before a hound was out of the covert they settled again to their business It was pretty to see the quiet ease and apparent nonchalance and almost affected absence of bustle of those who knew their work among whom were especially to be named young Hampton and the elder Botsey and Lord Rufford and above all a dark visaged long whiskered sombre military man who had been in the carriage with Lord Rufford and who had hardly spoken a word to any one the whole day This was the celebrated Major Caneback known to all the world as one of the dullest men and best riders across country that England had ever produced But he was not so dull but that he knew how to make use of his accomplishment so as always to be able to get a mount on a friend s horses If a man wanted to make a horse or to try a horse or to sell a horse or to buy a horse he delighted to put Major Caneback up The Major was sympathetic and made his friend s horses and tried them and sold them Then he would take his two bottles of wine of course from his friend s cellar and when asked about the day s sport would be oracular in two words Rather slow Quick spurt Goodish thing Regularly mulled and such like Nevertheless it was a great thing to have Major Caneback with you To the list of those who rode well and quietly must in justice be added our friend Larry Twentyman who was in truth a good horseman And he had three things to do which it was difficult enough to combine He had a young horse which he would have liked to sell he had to coach Kate Masters on his pony and he desired to ride like Major Caneback From Impington Park they went in a straight line to Littleton Gorse skirting certain small woods which the fox disdained to enter Here the pace was very good and the country was all grass It was the very cream of the U R U and could the Senator have read the feelings of the dozen leading men in the run he would have owned that they were for the time satisfied with their amusement Could he have read Kate Masters feelings he would have had to own that she was in an earthly Paradise When the pony paused at the big brook brought his four legs steadily down on the brink as though he were going to bathe then with a bend of his back leaped to the other side dropping his hind legs in and instantly recovering them and when she saw that Larry had waited just a moment for her watching to see what might be her fate she was in heaven Wasn t it a big one Larry she asked in her triumph He did go in behind Those cats of things always do it somehow Larry replied darting forward again and keeping the Major well in his eye The brook had stopped one or two and tidings came up that Ned Botsey had broken his horse s back The knowledge of the brook had sent some round by the road steady riding men such as mister Runciman and Doctor Nupper Captain Glomax had got into it and came up afterwards wet through with temper by no means improved But the glory of the day had been the way in which Lord Rufford s young bay mare who had never seen a brook before had flown over it with the Major on her back taking it as Larry afterwards described just in her stride without condescending to look at it I was just behind the Major and saw her do it Larry understood that a man should never talk of his own place in a run but he didn t quite understand that neither should he talk of having been close to another man who was supposed to have had the best of it Lord Rufford who didn t talk much of these things quite understood that he had received full value for his billet and mount in the improved character of his mare Then there was a little difficulty at the boundary fence of Impington Hall Farm The Major who didn t know the ground tried it at an impracticable place and brought his mare down But she fell at the right side and he was quick enough in getting away from her not to fall under her in the ditch Tony Tuppet who knew every foot of that double ditch and bank and every foot in the hedge above kept well to the left and crept through a spot where one ditch ran into the other intersecting of the fence Tony like a knowing huntsman as he was rode always for the finish and not for immediate glory Both Lord Rufford and Hampton who in spite of their affected nonchalance were in truth rather riding against one another took it all in a fly choosing a lighter spot than that which the Major had encountered Larry had longed to follow them or rather to take it alongside of them but was mindful at last of Kate and hurried down the ditch to the spot which Tony had chosen and which was now crowded by horsemen He would have done it as well as the best of them said Kate panting for breath We re all right said Larry Follow me Don t let them hustle you out Now Mat can t you make way for a lady half a minute Mat growled quite understanding the use which was being made of Kate Masters but he did give way and was rewarded with a gracious smile You are going uncommon well Miss Kate said Mat and I won t stop you I am so much obliged to you mister Ruggles said Kate not scrupling for a moment to take the advantage offered her The fox had turned a little to the left which was in Larry s favour and the Major was now close to him covered on one side with mud but still looking as though the mud were all right There are some men who can crush their hats have their boots and breeches full of water and be covered with dirt from their faces downwards and yet look as though nothing were amiss while with others the marks of a fall are always provocative either of pity or ridicule I hope you re not hurt Major Caneback said Larry glad of the occasion to speak to so distinguished an individual The Major grunted as he rode on finding no necessity here even for his customary two words Little accidents such as that were the price he paid for his day s entertainment As they got within view of Littleton Gorse Hampton Lord Rufford and Tony had the best of it though two or three farmers were very close to them At this moment Tony s mind was much disturbed and he looked round more than once for Captain Glomax Captain Glomax had got into the brook and had then ridden down to the high road which ran here near to them and which as he knew ran within one field of the gorse He had lost his place and had got a ducking and was a little out of humour with things in general It had not been his purpose to go to Impington on this day and he was still in his mind saying evil things of the U R U respecting that poisoned fox Perhaps he was thinking as itinerant masters often must think that it was very hard to have to bear so many unpleasant things for a poor Ltwo thousand a year and meditating as he had done for the last two seasons a threat that unless the money were increased he wouldn t hunt the country more than three times a week As Tony got near to the gorse and also near to the road he managed with infinite skill to get the hounds off the scent and to make a fictitious cast to the left as though he thought the fox had traversed that way Tony knew well enough that the fox was at that moment in Littleton Gorse but he knew also that the gorse was only six acres that such a fox as he had before him wouldn t stay there two minutes after the first hound was in it and that Dillsborough Wood which to his imagination was full of poison would then be only a mile and a half before him Tony whose fault was a tendency to mystery as is the fault of most huntsmen having accomplished his object in stopping the hounds pretended to cast about with great diligence He crossed the road and was down one side of a field and along another looking anxiously for the Captain The fox has gone on to the gorse said the elder Botsey what a stupid old pig he is meaning that Tony Tuppett was the pig He was seen going on said Larry who had come across a man mending a drain It would be his run of course said Hampton who was generally up to Tony s wiles but who was now as much in the dark as others Then four or five rode up to the huntsman and told him that the fox had been seen heading for the gorse Tony said not a word but bit his lips and scratched his head and bethought himself what fools men might be even though they did ride well to hounds One word of explanation would have settled it all but he would not speak that word till he whispered it to Captain Glomax In the meantime there was a crowd in the road waiting to see the result of Tony s manoeuvres And then as is usual on such occasions a little mild repartee went about what the sportsmen themselves would have called chaff Ned Botsey came up not having broken his horse s back as had been rumoured but having had to drag the brute out of the brook with the help of two countrymen and the Major was asked about his fall till he was forced to open his mouth Double ditch mare fell matter of course And then he got himself out of the crowd disgusted with the littleness of mankind Lord Rufford had been riding a very big chestnut horse and had watched the anxious struggles of Kate Masters to hold her place Kate though fifteen and quite up to that age in intelligence and impudence was small and looked almost a child That s a nice pony of yours my dear said the Lord Kate who didn t quite like being called my dear but who knew that a lord has privileges said that it was a very good pony Suppose we change said his lordship Could you ride my horse He s very big said Kate You d look like a tom tit on a haystack said his lordship And if you got on my pony you d look like a haystack on a tom tit said Kate Then it was felt that Kate Masters had had the best of that little encounter Yes I got one there said Lord Rufford while his friends were laughing at him At length Captain Glomax was seen in the road and Tony was with him at once whispering in his ear that the hounds if allowed to go on would certainly run into Dillsborough Wood D the hounds muttered the Captain but he knew too well what he was about to face so terrible a danger They re going home he said as soon as he had joined Lord Rufford and the crowd Going home exclaimed a pink coated young rider of a hired horse which had been going well with him and as he said so he looked at his watch Unless you particularly wish me to take the hounds to some covert twenty miles off answered the sarcastic Master The fox certainly went on to Littleton said the elder Botsey My dear fellow said the Captain I can tell you where the fox went quite as well as you can tell me Do allow a man to know what he s about some times It isn t generally the custom here to take the hounds off a running fox continued Botsey who subscribed Lfifty and did not like being snubbed And it isn t generally the custom to have fox coverts poisoned said the Captain assuming to himself the credit due to Tony s sagacity If you wish to be Master of these hounds I haven t the slightest objection but while I m responsible you must allow me to do my work according to my own judgment Then the thing was understood and Captain Glomax was allowed to carry off the hounds and his ill humour without another word But just at that moment while the hounds and the master and Lord Rufford and his friends were turning back in their own direction John Morton came up with his carriage and the Senator Is it all over asked the Senator All over for to day said Lord Rufford Did you catch the animal
6075_57154_000021_000000	train-clean-360	 No mister Gotobed we couldn t catch him 
none	none	To tell the truth we didn t try but we had a nice little skurry for four or five miles Some of you look very wet Captain Glomax and Ned Botsey were standing near the carriage but the Captain as soon as he heard this broke into a trot and followed the hounds Some of us are very wet said Ned That s part of the fun
6075_57154_000024_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh that s part of the fun 
none	none	You found one fox dead and you didn t kill another because you didn t try Well mister Morton I don t think I shall take to fox hunting even though they should introduce it in Mickewa 
6075_57154_000024_000003	train-clean-360	What s become of the rest of the men 
none	none	Most of them are in the brook said Ned Botsey as he rode on towards Dillsborough mister Runciman was also there and trotted on homewards with Botsey Larry and Kate Masters I think I ve won my bet said the hotel keeper I don t see that at all We didn t find in Dillsborough Wood I say we did find in Dillsborough Wood We found a fox though unfortunately the poor brute was dead The bet s off I should say What do you say Larry Then Runciman argued his case at great length and with much ability It had been intended that the bet should be governed by the fact whether Dillsborough Wood did or did not contain a fox on that morning He himself had backed the wood and Botsey had been strong in his opinion against the wood Which of them had been practically right Had not the presence of the poisoned fox shown that he was right I think you ought to pay said Larry All right said Botsey riding on and telling himself that that was what came from making a bet with a man who was not a gentleman He s as unhappy about that hat said Runciman as though beer had gone down a penny a gallon CHAPTER XII ARABELLA TREFOIL On the Sunday the party from Bragton went to the parish church and found it very cold The duty was done by a young curate who lived in Dillsborough there being no house in Bragton for him The rector himself had not been in the church for the last six months being an invalid At present he and his wife were away in London but the vicarage was kept up for his use The service was certainly not alluring It was a very wet morning and the curate had ridden over from Dillsborough on a little pony which the rector kept for him in addition to the Lone hundred per annum paid for his services That he should have got over his service quickly was not a matter of surprise nor was it wonderful that there should have been no soul stirring matter in his discourse as he had two sermons to preach every week and to perform single handed all the other clerical duties of a parish lying four miles distant from his lodgings Perhaps had he expected the presence of so distinguished a critic as the Senator from Mickewa he might have done better As it was being nearly wet through and muddy up to his knees he did not do the work very well When Morton and his friends left the church and got into the carriage for their half mile drive home across the park missus Morton was the first to speak John she said that church is enough to give any woman her death I won t go there any more They don t understand warming a church in the country said John apologetically Is it not a little too large for the congregation asked the Senator The church was large and straggling and ill arranged and on this particular Sunday had been almost empty There was in it an harmonium which missus Puttock played when she was at home but in her absence the attempt made by a few rustics to sing the hymns had not been a musical success The whole affair had been very sad and so the Paragon had felt it who knew and was remembering through the whole service how these things are done in transatlantic cities The weather kept the people away I suppose said Morton Does that gentleman generally draw large congregations asked the persistent Senator We don t go in for drawing congregations here Under the cross examination of his guest the Secretary of Legation almost lost his diplomatic good temper We have a church in every parish for those who choose to attend it And very few do choose said the Senator I can t say that they re wrong There seemed at the moment to be no necessity to carry the disagreeable conversation any further as they had now reached the house missus Morton immediately went up stairs and the two gentlemen took themselves to the fire in the so called library which room was being used as more commodious than the big drawing room mister Gotobed placed himself on the rug with his back to the fire and immediately reverted to the Church That gentleman is paid by tithes I suppose He s not the rector He s a curate Ah just so He looked like a curate Doesn t the rector do anything Then Morton who was by this time heartily sick of explaining explained the unfortunate state of mister Puttock s health and the conversation was carried on till gradually the Senator learned that mister Puttock received Leight hundred a year and a house for doing nothing and that he paid his deputy Lone hundred a year with the use of a pony And how long will that be allowed to go on mister Morton asked the Senator To all these inquiries Morton found himself compelled not only to answer but to answer the truth Any prevarication or attempt at mystification fell to the ground at once under the Senator s tremendous powers of inquiry It had been going on for four years and would probably go on now till mister Puttock died A man of his age with the asthma may live for twenty years said the Senator who had already learned that mister Puttock was only fifty Then he ascertained that mister Puttock had not been presented to or selected for the living on account of any peculiar fitness but that he had been a fellow of Rufford at Oxford till he was forty five when he had thought it well to marry and take a living But he must have been asthmatic then said the Senator He may have had all the ailments endured by the human race for anything I know said the unhappy host And for anything the bishop cared as far as I can see said the Senator Well now I guess that couldn t occur in our country A minister may turn out badly with us as well as with you But we don t appoint a man without inquiry as to his fitness and if a man can t do his duty he has to give way to some one who can If the sick gentleman took the small portion of the stipend and the working man the larger would not better justice be done and the people better served mister Puttock has a freehold in the parish A freehold possession of men s souls The fact is mister Morton that the spirit of conservatism in this country is so strong that you cannot bear to part with a shred of the barbarism of the middle ages And when a rag is sent to the winds you shriek with agony at the disruption and think that the wound will be mortal As mister Gotobed said this he extended his right hand and laid his left on his breast as though he were addressing the Senate from his own chair Morton who had offered to entertain the gentleman for ten days sincerely wished that he were doing so On the Monday afternoon the Trefoils arrived mister Morton with his grandmother and both the carriages went down to receive them with a cart also for the luggage which was fortunate as Arabella Trefoil s big box was very big indeed and Lady Augustus though she was economical in most things had brought a comfortable amount of clothes Each of them had her own lady s maid so that the two carriages were necessary How it was that these ladies lived so luxuriously was a mystery to their friends as for some time past they had enjoyed no particular income of their own Lord Augustus had spent everything that came to his hand and the family owned no house at all Nevertheless Arabella Trefoil was to be seen at all parties magnificently dressed and never stirred anywhere without her own maid It would have been as grievous to her to be called on to live without food as to go without this necessary appendage She was a big fair girl whose copious hair was managed after such a fashion that no one could guess what was her own and what was purchased She certainly had fine eyes though I could never imagine how any one could look at them and think it possible that she should be in love They were very large beautifully blue but never bright and the eyebrows over them were perfect Her cheeks were somewhat too long and the distance from her well formed nose to her upper lip too great Her mouth was small and her teeth excellent But the charm of which men spoke the most was the brilliance of her complexion If as the ladies said it was all paint she or her maid must have been a great artist It never betrayed itself to be paint But the beauty on which she prided herself was the grace of her motion Though she was tall and big she never allowed an awkward movement to escape from her She certainly did it very well No young woman could walk across an archery ground with a finer step or manage a train with more perfect ease or sit upon her horse with a more complete look of being at home there No doubt she was slow but though slow she never seemed to drag Now she was after a certain fashion engaged to marry John Morton and perhaps she was one of the most unhappy young persons in England She had long known that it was her duty to marry and especially her duty to marry well Between her and her mother there had been no reticence on this subject With worldly people in general though the worldliness is manifest enough and is taught by plain lessons from parents to their children yet there is generally some thin veil even among themselves some transparent tissue of lies which though they never quite hope to deceive each other does produce among them something of the comfort of deceit But between Lady Augustus and her daughter there had for many years been nothing of the kind The daughter herself had been too honest for it As for caring about him mamma she had once said speaking of a suitor of course I don t He is nasty and odious in every way But I have got to do the best I can and what is the use of talking about such trash as that Then there had been no more trash between them It was not John Morton whom Arabella Trefoil had called nasty and odious She had had many lovers and had been engaged to not a few and perhaps she liked John Morton as well as any of them except one He was quiet and looked like a gentleman and was reputed for no vices Nor did she quarrel with her fate in that he himself was not addicted to any pleasures She herself did not care much for pleasure But she did care to be a great lady one who would be allowed to swim out of rooms before others one who could snub others one who could show real diamonds when others wore paste one who might be sure to be asked everywhere even by the people who hated her She rather liked being hated by women and did not want any man to be in love with her except as far as might be sufficient for the purpose of marriage The real diamonds and the high rank would not be hers with John Morton She would have to be content with such rank as is accorded to Ministers at the Courts at which they are employed The fall would be great from what she had once expected and therefore she was miserable There had been a young man of immense wealth of great rank whom at one time she really had fancied that she had loved but just as she was landing her prey the prey had been rescued from her by powerful friends and she had been all but broken hearted mister Morton s fortune was in her eyes small and she was beginning to learn that he knew how to take care of his own money Already there had been difficulties as to settlements difficulties as to pin money difficulties as to residence Lady Augustus having been very urgent John Morton who had really been captivated by the beauty of Arabella was quite in earnest but there were subjects on which he would not give way He was anxious to put his best leg foremost so that the beauty might be satisfied and might become his own but there was a limit beyond which he would not go Lady Augustus had more than once said to her daughter that it would not do and then there would be all the weary work to do again Nobody seeing the meeting on the platform would have imagined that mister Morton and Miss Trefoil were lovers and as for Lady Augustus it would have been thought that she was in some special degree offended with the gentleman who had come to meet her She just gave him the tip of her fingers and then turned away to her maid and called for the porters and made herself particular and disagreeable Arabella vouchsafed a cold smile but then her smiles were always cold After that she stood still and shivered Are you cold asked Morton She shook her head and shivered again Perhaps you are tired Then she nodded her head When her maid came to her in some trouble about the luggage she begged that she might not be bothered saying that no doubt her mother knew all about it Can I do anything asked Morton Nothing at all I should think said Miss Trefoil In the meantime old missus Morton was standing by as black as thunder for the Trefoil ladies had hardly noticed her The luggage turned up all right at last as luggage always does and was stowed away in the cart Then came the carriage arrangement Morton had intended that the two elder ladies should go together with one of the maids and that he should put his love into the other which having a seat behind could accommodate the second girl without disturbing them in the carriage But Lady Augustus had made some exception to this and had begged that her daughter might be seated with herself It was a point which Morton could not contest out there among the porters and drivers so that at last he and his grandmother had the phaeton together with the two maids in the rumble I never saw such manners in all my life said the Honourable missus Morton almost bursting with passion They are cold and tired ma am No lady should be too cold or too tired to conduct herself with propriety No real lady is ever so The place is strange to them you know I hope with all my heart that it may never be otherwise than strange to them When they arrived at the house the strangers were carried into the library and tea was of course brought to them The American Senator was there but the greetings were very cold missus Morton took her place and offered her hospitality in the most frigid manner There had not been the smallest spark of love s flame shown as yet nor did the girl as she sat sipping her tea seem to think that any such spark was wanted Morton did get a seat beside her and managed to take away her muff and one of her shawls but she gave them to him almost as she might have done to a servant She smiled indeed but she smiled as some women smile at everybody who has any intercourse with them I think perhaps missus Morton will let us go up stairs said Lady Augustus missus Morton immediately rang the bell and prepared to precede the ladies to their chambers Let them be as insolent as they would she would do what she conceived to be her duty Then Lady Augustus stalked out of the room and her daughter swum after her They don t seem to be quite the same as they were in Washington said the Senator John Morton got up and left the room without making any reply He was thoroughly unhappy What was he to do for a week with such a houseful of people And then what was he to do for all his life if the presiding spirit of the house was to be such a one as this She was very beautiful certainly So he told himself and yet as he walked round the park he almost repented of what he had done But after twenty minutes fast walking he was able to convince himself that all the fault on this occasion lay with the mother Lady Augustus had been fatigued with her journey and had therefore made everybody near her miserable CHAPTER XIII AT BRAGTON When the ladies went up stairs the afternoon was not half over and they did not dine till past seven As Morton returned to the house in the dusk he thought that perhaps Arabella might make some attempt to throw herself in his way She had often done so when they were not engaged and surely she might do so now There was nothing to prevent her coming down to the library when she had got rid of her travelling clothes and in this hope he looked into the room As soon as the door was open the Senator who was preparing his lecture in his mind at once asked whether no one in England had an apparatus for warming rooms such as was to be found in every well built house in the States The Paragon hardly vouchsafed him a word of reply but escaped up stairs trusting that he might meet Miss Trefoil on the way He was a bold man and even ventured to knock at her door but there was no reply and fearing the Senator he had to betake himself to his own privacy Miss Trefoil had migrated to her mother s room and there over the fire was holding a little domestic conversation I never saw such a barrack in my life said Lady Augustus Of course mamma we knew that we should find the house such as it was left a hundred years ago He told us that himself

none	none	What s the use if he s to live always at foreign courts He intends to come home sometimes I suppose and if he didn t you would Lady Augustus was not going to let her daughter marry a man who could not give her a home for at any rate a part of the year Of course he must furnish the place and have an immense deal done before he can marry I think it is a piece of impudence to bring one to such a place as this That s

none	none	because he told us all about it The more I see of it all Arabella the more sure I am that it won t do It must do mamma Twelve hundred a year is all that he offers and his lawyer says that he will make no stipulation whatever as to an allowance Really mamma you might leave that to me I like to have everything fixed my dear and certain Nothing really ever is certain While there is anything to get you may be sure that I shall have my share As far as money goes I m not a bit afraid of having the worst of it only there will be so very little between us That s just it There s no doubt about the property mamma A nasty beggarly place And from what everybody says he s sure to be a minister or ambassador or something of that sort I ve no doubt he will And where ll he have to go to To Brazil or the West Indies or some British Colony said her ladyship showing her ignorance of the Foreign Office service That might be very well You could stay at home Only where would you live He wouldn t keep a house in town for you Is this the sort of place you d like I don t think it makes any difference where one is said Arabella disgusted But I do a very great difference It seems to me that he s altogether under the control of that hideous old termagant Arabella I think you d better make up your mind that it won t do It must do said Arabella You re very fond of him it seems Mamma how you do delight to torture me as if my life weren t bad enough without your making it worse I tell you my dear what I m bound to tell you as your mother I have my duty to do whether it s painful or not That s nonsense mamma You know it is That might have been all very well ten years ago You were almost in your cradle my dear Psha cradle I ll tell you what it is mamma I ve been at it till I m nearly broken down I must settle somewhere or else die or else run away I can t stand this any longer and I won t Talk of work men s work What man ever has to work as I do I wonder which was the hardest part of that work the hairdressing and painting and companionship of the lady s maid or the continual smiling upon unmarried men to whom she had nothing to say and for whom she did not in the least care I can t do it any more and I won t As for mister Morton I don t care that for him You know I don t I never cared much for anybody and shall never again care at all You ll find that will come all right after you are married Like you and papa I suppose My dear I had no mother to take care of me or I shouldn t have married your father I wish you hadn t because then I shouldn t be going to marry mister Morton But as I have got so far for heaven s sake let it go on If you break with him I ll tell him everything and throw myself into his hands Lady Augustus sighed deeply
6075_57156_000031_000002	train-clean-360	 I will mamma 
none	none	It was you spotted this man and when you said that you thought it would do I gave way He was the last man in the world I should have thought of myself We had heard so much about Bragton

none	none	At any rate let me look about me Don t give him an opportunity of breaking off till I have made up my mind I can always break off if I like it No one in London has heard of the engagement yet Just leave me alone for this week to see what I think about it Then Lady Augustus threw herself back in her chair and went to sleep or pretended to do so A little after half past seven she and her daughter dressed for dinner went down to the library together The other guests were assembled there and missus Morton was already plainly expressing her anger at the tardiness of her son s guests The Senator had got hold of mister Mainwaring and was asking pressing questions as to church patronage a subject not very agreeable to the rector of saint John s as his living had been bought for him with his wife s money during the incumbency of an old gentleman of seventy eight mister Cooper who was himself nearly that age and who was vicar of Mallingham a parish which ran into Dillsborough and comprehended a part of its population was listening to these queries with awe and perhaps with some little gratification as he had been presented to his living by the bishop after a curacy of many years This kind of things I believe can be bought and sold in the market said the Senator speaking every word with absolute distinctness But as he paused for an answer the two ladies came in and the conversation was changed Both the clergymen were introduced to Lady Augustus and her daughter and mister Mainwaring at once took refuge under the shadow of the ladies title Arabella did not sit down so that Morton had an opportunity of standing near to his love I suppose you are very tired he said Not in the least She smiled her sweetest as she answered him but yet it was not very sweet Of course we were tired and cross when we got out of the train People always are aren t they Perhaps ladies are We were But all that about the carriages mister Morton wasn t my doing Mamma had been talking to me so much that I didn t know whether I was on my head or my heels It was very good of you to come and meet us and I ought to have been more gracious In this way she made her peace and as she was quite in earnest doing a portion of the hard work of her life she continued to smile as sweetly as she could Perhaps he liked it but any man endowed with that power of appreciation which we call sympathy would have felt it to be as cold as though it had come from a figure on a glass window The dinner was announced mister Morton was honoured with the hand of Lady Augustus The Senator handed the old lady into the dining room and mister Mainwaring the younger lady so that Arabella was sitting next to her lover It had all been planned by Morton and acceded to by his grandmother mister Gotobed throughout the dinner had the best of the conversation though Lady Augustus had power enough to snub him on more than one occasion Suppose we were to allow at once she said that everything is better in the United States than anywhere else shouldn t we get along easier I don t know that getting along easy is what we have particularly got in view said mister Gotobed who was certainly in quest of information But it is what I have in view mister Gotobed so if you please we ll take the pre eminence of your country for granted Then she turned to mister Mainwaring on the other side Upon this the Senator addressed himself for a while to the table at large and had soon forgotten altogether the expression of the lady s wishes I believe you have a good many churches about here said Lady Augustus trying to make conversation to her neighbour One in every parish I fancy said mister Mainwaring who preferred all subjects to clerical subjects I suppose London is quite empty now We came direct from the Duke s said Lady Augustus and did not even sleep in town but it is empty The Duke was the brother of Lord Augustus and a compromise had been made with Lady Augustus by which she and her daughter should be allowed a fortnight every year at the Duke s place in the country and a certain amount of entertainment in town I remember the Duke at Christchurch said the parson He and I were of the same par He was Lord Mistletoe then Dear me that was a long time ago I wonder whether he remembers being upset out of a trap with me one day after dinner I suppose we had dined in earnest He has gone his way and I have gone mine and I ve never seen him since Pray remember me to him Lady Augustus said she would and did entertain some little increased respect for the clergyman who could boast that he had been tipsy in company with her worthy brother in law Poor mister Cooper did not get on very well with missus Morton All his remembrances of the old squire were eulogistic and affectionate Hers were just the reverse He had a good word to say for Reginald Morton to which she would not even listen She was willing enough to ask questions about the Mallingham tenants but mister Cooper would revert back to the old days and so conversation was at an end Morton tried to make himself agreeable to his left hand neighbour trying also very hard to make himself believe that he was happy in his immediate position How often in the various amusements of the world is one tempted to pause a moment and ask oneself whether one really likes it He was conscious that he was working hard struggling to be happy painfully anxious to be sure that he was enjoying the luxury of being in love But he was not at all contented There she was and very beautiful she looked and he thought that he could be proud of her if she sat at the end of his table and he knew that she was engaged to be his wife But he doubted whether she was in love with him and he almost doubted sometimes whether he was very much in love with her He asked her in so many words what he should do to amuse her Would she like to ride with him as if so he would endeavour to get saddle horses Would she like to go out hunting Would she be taken round to see the neighbouring towns Rufford and Norrington Lord Rufford lives somewhere near Rufford she asked Yes he lived at Rufford Hall three or four miles from the town Did Lord Rufford hunt Morton believed that he was greatly given to hunting Then he asked Arabella whether she knew the young lord She had just met him she said and had only asked the question because of the name He is one of my neighbours down here said Morton but being always away of course I see nothing of him After that Arabella consented to be taken out on horseback to see a meet of the hounds although she could not hunt We must see what we can do about horses he said She however professed her readiness to go in the carriage if a saddle horse could not be found The dinner party I fear was very dull mister Mainwaring perhaps liked it because he was fond of dining anywhere away from home mister Cooper was glad once more to see his late old friend s old dining room mister Gotobed perhaps obtained some information But otherwise the affair was dull Are we to have a week of this said Lady Augustus when she found herself up stairs You must mamma if we are to stay till we go to the Gores Lord Rufford is here in the neighbourhood But they don t know each other Yes they do slightly I am to go to the meet some day and he ll be there It might be dangerous Nonsense mamma And after all you ve been saying about dropping mister Morton But there is nothing so bad as a useless flirtation Do I ever flirt Oh mamma that after so many years you shouldn t know me Did you ever see me yet making myself happy in any way What nonsense you talk Then without waiting for or making any apology she walked off to her own room CHAPTER XIV THE DILLSBOROUGH FEUD It s that nasty beastly drunken club said missus Masters to her unfortunate husband on the Wednesday morning It may perhaps be remembered that the poisoned fox was found on the Saturday and it may be imagined that mister Goarly had risen in importance since that day On the Saturday Bean with a couple of men employed by Lord Rufford had searched the wood and found four or five red herrings poisoned with strychnine There had been no doubt about the magnitude of the offence On the Monday a detective policeman dressed of course in rustic disguise but not the less known to every one in the place was wandering about between Dillsborough and Dillsborough Wood and making futile inquiries as to the purchase of strychnine and also as to the purchase of red herrings But every one knew and such leading people as Runciman and doctor Nupper were not slow to declare that Dillsborough was the only place in England in which one might be sure that those articles had not been purchased And on the Tuesday it began to be understood that Goarly had applied to Bearside the other attorney in reference to his claim against Lord Rufford s pheasants He had contemptuously refused the seven s six d an acre offered him and put his demand at forty s As to the poisoned fox and the herrings and the strychnine Goarly declared that he didn t care if there were twenty detectives in the place He stated it to be his opinion that Larry Twentyman had put down the poison It was all very well Goarly said for Larry to be fond of gentlemen and to ride to hounds and make pretences but Larry liked his turkeys as well as anybody else and Larry had put down the poison In this matter Goarly overreached himself No one in Dillsborough could be brought to believe that Even Harry Stubbings was ready to swear that he should suspect himself as soon But nothing was clearer than this that Goarly was going to make a stand against the hunt and especially against Lord Rufford He had gone to Bearside and Bearside had taken up the matter in a serious way Then it became known very quickly that Bearside had already received money and it was surmised that Goarly had some one at his back Lord Rufford had lately ejected from a house of his on the other side of the county a discontented litigious retired grocer from Rufford who had made some money and had set himself up in a pretty little residence with a few acres of land The man had made himself objectionable and had been dispossessed The man s name was Scrobby and hence had come these sorrows This was the story that had already made itself known in Dillsborough on the Tuesday evening But up to that time not a tittle of evidence had come to light as to the purchase of the red herrings or the strychnine All that was known was the fact that had not Tony Tuppett stopped the hounds before they reached the wood there must have been a terrible mortality It s that nasty beastly drunken club said missus Masters to her husband Of course it was at this time known to the lady that her husband had thrown away Goarly s business and that it had been transferred to Bearside It was also surmised by her as it was by the town in general that Goarly s business would come to considerable dimensions just the sort of case as would have been sure to bring popularity if carried through as Nickem the senior clerk would have carried it And as soon as Scrobby s name was heard by missus Masters there was no end to the money in the lady s imagination to which this very case might not have amounted The club had nothing to do with it my dear What time did you come home on Saturday night or Sunday morning I mean Do you mean to tell me you didn t settle it there There was no nastiness and no beastliness and no drunkenness about it I told you before I went that I wouldn t take it No you didn t How on earth are you to go on if you chuck the children s bread out of their mouths in that way You won t believe me Do you ask Twentyman what sort of a man Goarly is The attorney knew that Larry was in great favour with his wife as being the favoured suitor for Mary s hand and had thought that this argument would be very strong I don t want mister Twentyman to teach me what is proper for my family nor yet to teach you your business mister Twentyman has his own way of living He brought home Kate the other day with hardly a rag of her sister s habit left She don t go out hunting any more Very well my dear Indeed for the matter of that I don t see how any of them are to do anything What ll Lord Rufford do for you I don t want Lord Rufford to do anything for me The attorney was beginning to have his spirit stirred within him You don t want anybody to do anything and yet you will do nothing yourself just because a set of drinking fellows in a tap room which you call a club It isn t a tap room It s worse because nobody can see what you re doing I know how it was You hadn t the pluck to hold to your own when Runciman told you not There was a spice of truth in this which made it all the more bitter Runciman knows on which side his bread is buttered He can make his money out of these swearing tearing fellows He can send in his bills and get them paid too And it s all very well for Larry Twentyman to be hobbing and nobbing with the likes of them Botseys But for a father of a family like you to be put off his business by what mister Runciman says is a shame I shall manage my business as I think fit said the attorney And when we re all in the poor house what ll you do then said missus Masters with her handkerchief out at the spur of the moment Whenever she roused her husband to a state of bellicose ire by her taunts she could always reduce him again by her tears Being well aware of this he would bear the taunts as long as he could knowing that the tears would be still worse He was so soft hearted that when she affected to be miserable he could not maintain the sternness of his demeanour and leave her in her misery When everything has gone away from us what are we to do My little bit of money has disappeared ever so long Then she sat herself down in her chair and had a great cry It was useless for him to remind her that hitherto she had never wanted anything for herself or her children She was resolved that everything was going to the dogs because Goarly s case had been refused And what will all those sporting men do for you she repeated I hate the very name of a gentleman so I do I wish Goarly had killed all the foxes in the county Nasty vermin What good are the likes of them Nickem the senior clerk was at first made almost as unhappy as missus Masters by the weak decision to which his employer had come and had in the first flush of his anger resolved to leave the office He was sure that the case was one which would just have suited him He would have got up the evidence as to the fertility of the land the enormous promise of crop and the ultimate absolute barrenness to a marvel He would have proved clouds of pheasants And then Goarly s humble position futile industry and general poverty might have been contrasted beautifully with Lord Rufford s wealth idleness and devotion to sport Anything above the seven s six d an acre obtained against the lord would have been a triumph and he thought that if the thing had been well managed they might probably have got fifteen s And then in such a case Lord Rufford could hardly have taxed the costs It was really suicide for an attorney to throw away business so excellent as this And now it had gone to Bearside whom Nickem remembered as a junior to himself when they were both young hobbledehoys at Norrington a dirty blear eyed pimply faced boy who was suspected of purloining halfpence out of coat pockets The thing was very trying to Nat Nickem But suddenly before that Wednesday was over another idea had occurred to him and he was almost content He knew Goarly and he had heard of Scrobby and Scrobby s history in regard to the tenement at Rufford As he could not get Goarly s case why should he not make something of the case against Goarly That detective was merely eking out his time and having an idle week among the public houses If he could set himself up as an amateur detective he thought that he might perhaps get to the bottom of it all It is not a bad thing to be concerned on the same side with a lord when the lord is in earnest Lord Rufford was very angry about the poison in the covert and would probably be ready to pay very handsomely for having the criminal found and punished The criminal of course was Goarly Nickem did not doubt that for a moment and would not have doubted it whichever side he might have taken Nickem did not suppose that any one for a moment really doubted Goarly s guilt But to his eyes such certainty amounted to nothing if evidence of the crime were not forthcoming He probably felt within his own bosom that the last judgment of all would depend in some way on terrestrial evidence and was quite sure that it was by such that a man s conscience should be affected If Goarly had so done the deed as to be beyond the possibility of detection Nickem could not have brought himself to regard Goarly as a sinner As it was he had considerable respect for Goarly but might it not be possible to drop down upon Scrobby Bearside with his case against the lord would be nowhere if Goarly could be got to own that he had been suborned by Scrobby to put down the poison Or if in default of this any close communication could be proved between Goarly and Scrobby Scrobby s injury and spirit of revenge being patent then too Bearside would not have much of a case A jury would look at that question of damages with a very different eye if Scrobby s spirit of revenge could be proved at the trial and also the poisoning and also machinations between Scrobby and Goarly Nickem was a little red haired man about forty who wrote a good flourishing hand could endure an immense amount of work and drink a large amount of alcohol without being drunk His nose and face were all over blotches and he looked to be dissipated and disreputable But as he often boasted no one could say that black was the white of his eye by which he meant to insinuate that he had not been detected in anything dishonest and that he was never too tipsy to do his work He was a married man and did not keep his wife and children in absolute comfort but they lived and mister Nickem in some fashion paid his way There was another clerk in the office a very much younger man named Sundown and Nickem could not make his proposition to mister Masters till Sundown had left the office Nickem himself had only matured his plans at dinner time and was obliged to be reticent till at six o clock Sundown took himself off mister Masters was at the moment locking his own desk when Nickem winked at him to stay mister Masters did stay and Sundown did at last leave the office You couldn t let me leave home for three days said Nickem There ain t much a doing What do you want it for That Goarly is a great blackguard mister Masters Very likely Do you know anything about him Nickem scratched his head and rubbed his chin I think I could manage to know something In what way I don t think I m quite prepared to say sir I shouldn t use your name of course But they re down upon Lord Rufford and if you could lend me a trifle of thirty s sir I think I could get to the bottom of it His lordship would be awful obliged to any one who could hit it off mister Masters did give his clerk leave for three days and did advance him the required money And when he suggested in a whisper that perhaps the circumstance need not be mentioned to missus Masters Nickem winked again and put his fore finger to the side of his big carbuncled nose That evening Larry Twentyman came in but was not received with any great favour by missus Masters There was growing up at this moment in Dillsborough the bitterness of real warfare between the friends and enemies of sport in general and missus Masters was ranking herself thereby among the enemies Larry was of course one of the friends But unhappily there was a slight difference of sentiment even in Larry s own house and on this very morning old missus Twentyman had expressed to missus Masters a feeling of wrong which had gradually risen from the annual demolition of her pet broods of turkeys She declared that for the last three years every turkey poult had gone and that at last she was beginning to feel it It s over a hundred of em they ve had and it is wearing said the old woman Larry had twenty times begged her to give up the rearing turkeys but her heart had been too high for that I don t know why Lord Rufford s foxes are to be thought of always and nobody is to think about your poor mother s poultry said missus Masters lugging the subject in neck and heels Has she been talking to you missus Masters about her turkeys Your mother may speak to me I suppose if she likes it without offence to Lord Rufford Lord Rufford has got nothing to do with it The wood belongs to him said missus Masters Foxes are much better than turkeys anyway said Kate Masters If you don t hold your tongue miss you ll be sent to bed The wood belongs to his lordship and the foxes are a nuisance He keeps the foxes for the county and where would the county be without them began Larry What is it brings money into such a place as this To Runciman s stables and Harry Stubbings and the like of them What money does it bring in to steady honest people Look at all the grooms said Larry The impudentest set of young vipers about the place said the lady Look at Grice s business Grice was the saddler Grice indeed What s Grice And the price of horses Yes making everything dear that ought to be cheap I don t see and I never shall see and I never will see any good in extravagant idleness As for Kate she shall never go out hunting again She has torn Mary s habit to pieces And shooting is worse Why is a man to have a flock of voracious cormorants come down upon his corn fields I m all in favour of Goarly and so I tell you mister Twentyman After this poor Larry went away finding that he had no opportunity for saying a word to Mary Masters CHAPTER XV A FIT COMPANION FOR ME AND MY SISTERS On that same Wednesday Reginald Morton had called at the attorney s house had asked for Miss Masters and had found her alone missus Masters at the time had been out picking up intelligence about the great case and the two younger girls had been at school Reginald as he walked home from Bragton all alone on that occasion when Larry had returned with Mary was quite sure that he would never willingly go into Mary s presence again Why should he disturb his mind about such a girl one who could rush into the arms of such a man as Larry Twentyman Or indeed why disturb his mind about any girl That was not the manner of life which he planned for himself After that he shut himself up for a few days and was not much seen by any of the Dillsborough folk 
5789_57158_000014_000007	train-clean-100	But on this Wednesday he received a letter and as he told himself merely in consequence of that letter he called at the attorney s house and asked for Miss Masters 
none	none	He was shown up into the beautiful drawing room and in a few minutes Mary came to him
5789_57158_000015_000001	train-clean-100	 I have brought you a letter from my aunt he said 
none	none	From Lady Ushant 
5789_57158_000016_000001	train-clean-100	I am so glad 
5789_57158_000017_000000	train-clean-100	 She was writing to me and she put this under cover 
5789_57158_000017_000001	train-clean-100	I know what it contains 
5789_57158_000017_000002	train-clean-100	She wants you to go to her at Cheltenham for a month 
none	none	Oh mister Morton
5789_57158_000019_000000	train-clean-100	 Would you like to go 
5789_57158_000020_000000	train-clean-100	 How should I not like to go 
5789_57158_000020_000001	train-clean-100	Lady Ushant is my dearest dearest friend 
none	none	It is so very good of her to think of me She talks of the first week in December and wants you to be there for Christmas I don t at all know that I can go mister Morton
5789_57158_000023_000000	train-clean-100	 Why not go 
none	none	I m afraid mamma will not spare me There were many reasons She could hardly go on such a visit without some renewal of her scanty wardrobe which perhaps the family funds would not permit And as she knew very well missus Masters was not at all favourable to Lady Ushant 
5789_57158_000024_000003	train-clean-100	If the old lady had altogether kept Mary it might have been very well but she had not done so and missus Masters had more than once said that that kind of thing must be all over meaning that Mary was to drop her intimacy with high born people that were of no real use 
none	none	And then there was mister Twentyman and his suit Mary had for some time felt that her step mother intended her to understand that her only escape from home would be by becoming missus Twentyman
5789_57158_000024_000006	train-clean-100	 I don t think it will be possible mister Morton 
none	none	My aunt will be very sorry Oh how sorry shall I be It is like having another little bit of heaven before me Then he said what he certainly should not have said I thought Miss Masters that your heaven was all here
5789_57158_000028_000000	train-clean-100	 What do you mean by that mister Morton she asked blushing up to her hair 
none	none	Of course she knew what he meant and of course she was angry with him 
5789_57158_000028_000002	train-clean-100	Ever since that walk her mind had been troubled by ideas as to what he would think about her and now he was telling her what he thought 
none	none	I fancied that you were happy here without going to see an old woman who after all has not much amusement to offer to you I don t want any amusement At any rate you will answer Lady Ushant
5789_57158_000032_000000	train-clean-100	 Of course I shall answer her 
5789_57158_000033_000000	train-clean-100	 Perhaps you can let me know 
none	none	She wishes me to take you to Cheltenham I shall go for a couple of days but I shall not stay longer If you are going perhaps you would allow me to travel with you Of course it would be very kind but I don t suppose that I shall go I am sure Lady Ushant won t believe that I am kept away from her by any pleasure of my own here 
5789_57158_000034_000002	train-clean-100	I can explain it all to her and she will understand me She hardly meant to reproach him 
none	none	She did not mean to assume an intimacy sufficient for reproach 
5789_57158_000034_000004	train-clean-100	But he felt that she had reproached him 
none	none	I love Lady Ushant so dearly that I would go anywhere to see her if I could Then I think it could be managed Your father Papa does not attend much to us girls It is mamma that manages all that At any rate I will write to Lady Ushant and will ask papa to let you know 
5789_57158_000037_000000	train-clean-100	Then it seemed as though there were nothing else for him but to go and yet he wanted to say some other word 
none	none	If he had been cruel in throwing mister Twentyman in her teeth surely he ought to apologize I did not mean to say anything to offend you You have not offended me at all mister Morton
5789_57158_000039_000000	train-clean-100	 If I did think that that 
5789_57158_000040_000000	train-clean-100	 It does not signify in the least 
5789_57158_000040_000001	train-clean-100	I only want Lady Ushant to understand that if I could possibly go to her I would rather do that than anything else in the world 
5789_57158_000040_000002	train-clean-100	Because Lady Ushant is kind to me I needn t expect other people to be so Reginald Morton was of course the other people 
5789_57158_000041_000000	train-clean-100	Then he paused a moment 
5789_57158_000041_000001	train-clean-100	 I did so long he said to walk round the old place with you the other day before these people came there and I was so disappointed when you would not come with me 
5789_57158_000042_000000	train-clean-100	 I was coming 
5789_57158_000043_000000	train-clean-100	 But you went back with that other man 
none	none	Of course I did when you showed so plainly that you didn t want him to join you 
5789_57158_000044_000001	train-clean-100	What was I to do 
none	none	I couldn t send him away mister Twentyman is a very intimate friend of ours and very kind to Dolly and Kate I wished so much to talk to you about the old days And I wish to go to your aunt mister Morton but we can t all of us have what we wish Of course I saw that you were very angry but I couldn t help that Perhaps it was wrong in mister Twentyman to offer to walk with you
5789_57158_000047_000000	train-clean-100	 I didn t say so at all 
none	none	You looked it at any rate mister Morton And as mister Twentyman is a friend of ours You were angry with me
5789_57158_000050_000000	train-clean-100	 I don t say that 
5789_57158_000050_000001	train-clean-100	But as you were too grand for our friend of course you were too grand for us 
none	none	That is a very unkind way of putting it I don t think I am grand A man may wish to have a little conversation with a very old friend without being interrupted and yet not be grand I dare say mister Twentyman is just as good as I am
5789_57158_000052_000000	train-clean-100	 You don t think that mister Morton 
none	none	I believe him to be a great deal better for he earns his bread and takes care of his mother and as far as I know does his duty thoroughly I know the difference mister Morton and of course I know how you feel it I don t suppose that mister Twentyman is a fit companion for any of the Mortons but for all that he may be a fit companion for me and my sisters Surely she must have said this with the express object of declaring to him that in spite of the advantages of her education she chose to put herself in the ranks of the Twentymans Runcimans and such like 
5789_57158_000054_000002	train-clean-100	He had come there ardently wishing that she might be allowed to go to his aunt and resolved that he would take her himself if it were possible 
5789_57158_000054_000003	train-clean-100	But now he almost thought that she had better not go 
none	none	If she had made her election she must be allowed to abide by it 
5789_57158_000054_000005	train-clean-100	If she meant to marry mister Twentyman what good could she get by associating with his aunt or with him 
none	none	And had she not as good as told him that she meant to marry mister Twentyman She had at any rate very plainly declared that she regarded mister Twentyman as her equal in rank Then he took his leave without any further explanation Even if she did go to Cheltenham he would not take her 
5789_57158_000055_000000	train-clean-100	After that he walked straight out to Bragton 
5789_57158_000055_000001	train-clean-100	He was of course altogether unconscious what grand things his cousin John had intended to do by him had not the Honourable old lady interfered but he had made up his mind that duty required him to call at the house 
5789_57158_000055_000002	train-clean-100	So he walked by the path across the bridge and when he came out on the gravel road near the front door he found a gentleman smoking a cigar and looking around him 
5789_57158_000055_000003	train-clean-100	It was mister Gotobed who had just returned from a visit which he had made the circumstances of which must be narrated in the next chapter 
none	none	The Senator lifted his hat and remarked that it was a very fine afternoon 
5789_57158_000055_000005	train-clean-100	Reginald lifted his hat and assented 
5789_57158_000055_000006	train-clean-100	 mister Morton sir I think is out with the ladies taking a drive 
5789_57158_000056_000000	train-clean-100	 I will leave a card then 
none	none	The old lady is at home sir if you wish to see her continued the Senator following Reginald up to the door
5789_57158_000058_000000	train-clean-100	 Oh mister Reginald is that you said old missus Hopkins taking the card 
5789_57158_000058_000001	train-clean-100	 They are all out except herself As he certainly did not wish to see herself he greeted the old woman and left his card 
none	none	You live in these parts sir asked the Senator In the town yonder Because mister Morton s housekeeper seems to know you She knows me very well as I was brought up in this house 
5789_57158_000062_000001	train-clean-100	Good morning to you 
none	none	Good afternoon to you sir Perhaps you can tell me who lives in that country residence what you call a farm house on the other side of the road Reginald said that he presumed the gentleman was alluding to mister Twentyman s house Ah yes I dare say 
5789_57158_000064_000001	train-clean-100	That was the name I heard up there 
none	none	You are not mister Twentyman sir
5789_57158_000065_000000	train-clean-100	 My name is Morton 
none	none	Morton is it perhaps my friend s ah ah yes He didn t like to say uncle because Reginald didn t look old enough and he knew he ought not to say brother because the elder brother in England would certainly have had the property
5789_57158_000067_000000	train-clean-100	 I am mister John Morton s cousin 
none	none	Oh mister Morton s cousin I asked whether you were the owner of that farm house because I intruded just now by passing through the yards and I would have apologized 
5789_57158_000068_000003	train-clean-100	Good afternoon to you sir Then Reginald having thus done his duty returned home 
none	none	Mary Masters when she was alone was again very angry with herself She knew thoroughly how perverse she had been when she declared that Larry Twentyman was a fit companion for herself and that she had said it on purpose to punish the man who was talking to her Not a day passed or hardly an hour of a day in which she did not tell herself that the education she had received and the early associations of her life had made her unfit for the marriage which her friends were urging upon her It was the one great sorrow of her life She even repented of the good things of her early days because they had given her a distaste for what might have otherwise been happiness and good fortune There had been moments in which she had told herself that she ought to marry Larry Twentyman and adapt herself to the surroundings of her life Since she had seen Reginald Morton frequently she had been less prone to tell herself so than before and yet to this very man she had declared her fitness for Larry s companionship CHAPTER XVI mister GOTOBED S PHILANTHROPY mister Gotobed when the persecutions of Goarly were described to him at the scene of the dead fox had expressed considerable admiration for the man s character as portrayed by what he then heard The man a poor man too and despised in the land was standing up for his rights all alone against the aristocracy and plutocracy of the county He had killed the demon whom the aristocracy and plutocracy worshipped and had appeared there in arms ready to defend his own territory one against so many and so poor a man against men so rich The Senator had at once said that he would call upon mister Goarly and the Senator was a man who always carried out his purposes Afterwards from John Morton and from others who knew the country better than Morton he learned further particulars On the Monday and Tuesday he fathomed or nearly fathomed that matter of the seven s six d an acre He learned at any rate that the owner of the wood admitted a damage done by him to the corn and had then himself assessed the damage without consultation with the injured party and he was informed also that Goarly was going to law with the lord for a fuller compensation He liked Goarly for killing the fox and he liked him more for going to law with Lord Rufford He declared openly at Bragton his sympathy with the man and his intention of expressing it Morton was annoyed and endeavoured to persuade him to leave the man alone but in vain No doubt had he expressed himself decisively and told his friend that he should be annoyed by a guest from his house taking part in such a matter the Senator would have abstained and would merely have made one more note as to English peculiarities and English ideas of justice but Morton could not bring himself to do this The feeling of the country will be altogether against you he had said hoping to deter the Senator The Senator had replied that though the feeling of that little bit of the country might be against him he did not believe that such would be the case with the feeling of England generally The ladies had all become a little afraid of mister Gotobed and hardly dared to express an opinion Lady Augustus did say that she supposed that Goarly was a low vulgar fellow which of course strengthened the Senator in his purpose The Senator on Wednesday would not wait for lunch but started a little before one with a crust of bread in his pocket to find his way to Goarly s house There was no difficulty in this as he could see the wood as soon as he had got upon the high road He found Twentyman s gate and followed directly the route which the hunting party had taken till he came to the spot on which the crowd had been assembled Close to this there was a hand gate leading into Dillsborough wood and standing in the gateway was a man The Senator thought that this might not improbably be Goarly himself and asked the question Might your name be mister Goarly sir Me Goarly said the man in infinite disgust I ain t nothing of the kind and you knows it That the man should have been annoyed at being taken for Goarly that man being Bean the gamekeeper who would willingly have hung Goarly if he could and would have thought it quite proper that a law should be now passed for hanging him at once was natural enough But why he should have told the Senator that the Senator knew he was not Goarly it might be difficult to explain He probably at once regarded the Senator as an enemy as a man on the other side and therefore as a cunning knave who would be sure to come creeping about on false pretences Bean who had already heard of Bearside and had heard of Scrobby in connection with this matter looked at the Senator very hard He knew Bearside The man certainly was not the attorney and from what he had heard of Scrobby he didn t think he was Scrobby The man was not like what in his imagination Scrobby would be He did not know what to make of mister Gotobed who was a person of an imposing appearance tall and thin with a long nose and look of great acuteness dressed in black from head to foot but yet not looking quite like an English gentleman He was a man to whom Bean in an ordinary way would have been civil civil in a cold guarded way but how was he to be civil to anybody who addressed him as Goarly I did not know it said the Senator As Goarly lives near here I thought you might be Goarly When I saw Goarly he had a gun and you have a gun Can you tell me where Goarly lives Tother side of the wood said Bean pointing back with his thumb He never had a gun like this in his hand in all his born days I dare say not my friend I can go through the wood I guess for Bean had pointed exactly over the gateway I guess you can t then said Bean The man who like other gamekeepers lived much in the company of gentlemen was ordinarily a civil courteous fellow who knew how to smile and make things pleasant But at this moment he was very much put out His covert had been found full of red herrings and strychnine and his fox had been poisoned He had lost his guinea on the day of the hunt the guinea which would have been his perquisite had they found a live fox in his wood And all this was being done by such a fellow as Goarly And now this abandoned wretch was bringing an action against his Lordship and was leagued with such men as Scrobby and Bearside It was a dreadful state of things How was it likely that he should give a passage through the wood to anybody coming after Goarly You re on mister Twentyman s land now as I dare say you know I don t know anything about it Well that wood is Lord Rufford s wood I did know as much as that certainly And you can t go into it How shall I find mister Goarly s house If you ll get over that there ditch you ll be on Mister Goarly s land and that s all about it Bean as he said this put a strongly ironical emphasis on the term of respect and then turned back into the wood The Senator made his way down the fence to the bank on which Goarly had stood with his gun then over into Goarly s field and so round the back of the wood till he saw a small red brick house standing perhaps four hundred yards from the covert just on the elbow of a lane It was a miserable looking place with a pigsty and a dung heap and a small horse pond or duck puddle all close around it The stack of chimneys seemed to threaten to fall and as he approached from behind he could see that the two windows opening that way were stuffed with rags There was a little cabbage garden which now seemed to be all stalks and a single goose waddling about the duck puddle The Senator went to the door and having knocked was investigated by a woman from behind it Yes this was Goarly s house What did the gentleman want Goarly was at work in the field Then she came out the Senator having signified his friendly intentions and summoned Goarly to the spot I hope I see you well sir said the Senator putting out his hand as Goarly came up dragging a dung fork behind him Goarly rubbed his hand on his breeches before he gave it to be shaken and declared himself to be pretty tidy considering I was present the other day mister Goarly when that dead fox was exposed to view Was you sir I was given to understand that you had destroyed the brute Don t you believe a word on it then said the woman interposing He didn t do nothing of the kind Who ever seed him a buying of red herrings and p ison Hold your jaw said Goarly familiarly Let em prove it I don t know who you are sir but let em prove it My name mister Goarly is Elias Gotobed I am an American citizen and Senator for the State of Mickewa mister and missus Goarly shook their heads at every separate item of information tendered to them I am on a visit to this country and am at present staying at the house of my friend mister John Morton He s the gentl man from Bragton Dan Hold your jaw can t you said the husband Then he touched his hat to the Senator intending to signify that the Senator might if he pleased continue his narrative If you did kill that fox mister Goarly I think you were quite right to kill him Then Goarly winked at him I cannot imagine that even the laws of England could justify a man in perpetuating a breed of wild animals that are destructive to his neighbours property I could shoot un not a doubt about that Mister I could shoot un and I wull Have a care Dan whispered missus Goarly Hold your jaw will ye I could shoot un Mister I don t rightly know about p ison That fox we saw was poisoned I suppose said the Senator carelessly Have a care Dan have a care whispered the wife Allow me to assure both of you said the Senator that you need fear nothing from me I have come quite as a friend Thank ee sir said Goarly again touching his hat It seems to me said the Senator that in this matter a great many men are leagued together against you You may say that sir I didn t just catch your name sir My name is Gotobed Gotobed Elias Gotobed Senator from the State of Mickewa to the United States Congress missus Goarly who understood nothing of all these titles and who had all along doubted dropped a suspicious curtsey Goarly who understood a little now took his hat altogether off He was very much puzzled but inclined to think that if he managed matters rightly profit might be got out of this very strange meeting In my country mister Goarly all men are free and equal That s a fine thing sir It is a fine thing my friend if properly understood and properly used Coming from such a country I was shocked to see so many rich men banded together against one who I suppose is not rich Very far from it said the woman It s my own land you know said Goarly who was proud of his position as a landowner No one can t touch me on it as long as the rates is paid I m as good a man here and he stamped his foot on the ground as his Lordship is in that there wood This was the first word spoken by the Goarlys that had pleased the Senator and this set him off again Just so and I admire a man that will stand up for his own rights I am told that you have found his Lordship s pheasants destructive to your corn Didn t leave him hardly a grain last August said missus Goarly Will you hold your jaw woman or will you not said the man turning round fiercely at her I m going to have the law of his Lordship sir What s seven and six an acre There s that quantity of pheasants in that wood as d eat up any mortal thing as ever was growed Seven and six Didn t you propose arbitration I never didn t propose nothin I ve axed two pound and my lawyer says as how I ll get it What I sold come off that other bit of ground down there Wonderful crop And this d ve been the same His Lordship ain t nothin to me mister Gotobed You don t approve of hunting mister Goarly Oh I approves if they d pay a poor man for what harm they does him Look at that there goose mister Gotobed did look at the goose There s nine and twenty they ve tuk from me and only left un that Now missus Goarly s goose was well known in those parts It was declared that she was more than a match for any fox in the county but that missus Goarly for the last two years had never owned any goose but this one The foxes have eaten them all asked the Senator Every mortal one And the gentlemen of the hunt have paid you nothing I had four half crowns once said the woman If you don t send the heads you don t get it said the man and then they ll keep you waiting months and months just for their pleasures Who s a going to put up with that I ain t And now you re going to law I am like a man His Lordship ain t nothin to me I ain t afeard of his Lordship Will it cost you much That s just what it will do sir said the woman Didn t I tell you hold your jaw The gentl man was going to offer to help us a little Dan I was going to say that I am interested in the case and that you have all my good wishes I do not like to offer pecuniary help You re very good sir very good This bit of land is mine not a doubt of it but we re poor sir Indeed we is said the woman What with taxes and rates and them foxes as won t let me rear a head of poultry and them brutes of birds as eats up the corn I often tells him he d better sell the bit o land and just set up for a public It belonged to my feyther and grandfeyther said Goarly Then the Senator s heart was softened again and he explained at great length that he would watch the case and if he saw his way clearly befriend it with substantial aid He asked about the attorney and took down Bearside s address After that he shook hands with both of them and then made his way back to Bragton through mister Twentyman s farm mister and missus Goarly were left in a state of great perturbation of mind They could not in the least make out among themselves who the gentleman was or whether he had come for good or evil That he called himself Gotobed Goarly did remember and also that he had said that he was an American All that which had referred to senatorial honours and the State of Mickewa had been lost upon Goarly The question of course arose whether he was not a spy sent out by Lord Rufford s man of business and missus Goarly was clearly of opinion that such had been the nature of his employment Had he really been a friend she suggested he would have left a sovereign behind him He didn t get no information from me said Goarly Only about mister Bearside What s the odds of that They all knows that Bearside Why should I be ashamed of Bearside I ll do a deal better with Bearside than I would with that old woman Masters But he took it down in writing Dan What the d s the odds in that I don t like it when they puts it down in writing Hold your jaw said Goarly as he slowly shouldered the dung fork to take it back to his work But as they again discussed the matter that night the opinion gained ground upon them that the Senator had been an emissary from the enemy CHAPTER XVII LORD RUFFORD S INVITATION On that same Wednesday afternoon when Morton returned with the ladies in the carriage he found that a mounted servant had arrived from Rufford Hall with a letter and had been instructed to wait for an answer The man was now refreshing himself in the servants hall Morton when he had read the letter found that it required some consideration before he could answer it It was to the following purport Lord Rufford had a party of ladies and gentlemen at Rufford Hall as his sister Lady Penwether was staying with him Would mister Morton and his guests come over to Rufford Hall on Monday and stay till Wednesday On Tuesday there was to be a dance for the people of the neighbourhood Then he specified as the guests invited Lady Augustus and her daughter and mister Gotobed omitting the honourable missus Morton of whose sojourn in the county he might have been ignorant His Lordship went on to say that he trusted the abruptness of the invitation might be excused on account of the nearness of their neighbourhood and the old friendship which had existed between their families He had had he said the pleasure of being acquainted with Lady Augustus and her daughter in London and would be proud to see mister Gotobed at his house during his sojourn in the county Then he added in a postscript that the hounds met at Rufford Hall on Tuesday and that he had a horse that carried a lady well if Miss Trefoil would like to ride him He could also put up a horse for mister Morton This was all very civil but there was something in it that was almost too civil There came upon Morton a suspicion which he did not even define to himself that the invitation was due to Arabella s charms There were many reasons why he did not wish to accept it His grandmother was left out and he feared that she would be angry He did not feel inclined to take the American Senator to the lord s house knowing as he did that the American Senator was interfering in a ridiculous manner on behalf of Goarly And he did not particularly wish to be present at Rufford Hall with the Trefoil ladies Hitherto he had received very little satisfaction from their visit to Bragton so little that he had been more than once on the verge of asking Arabella whether she wished to be relieved from her engagement She had never quite given him the opportunity She had always been gracious to him in a cold disagreeable glassy manner in a manner that irked his spirit but still did not justify him in expressing anger Lady Augustus was almost uncivil to him and from time to time said little things which were hard to bear but he was not going to marry Lady Augustus and could revenge himself against her by resolving in his own breast that he would have as little as possible to do with her after his marriage That was the condition of his mind towards them and in that condition he did not want to take them to Lord Rufford s house Their visit to him would be over on Monday and it would he thought be better for him that they should then go on their way to the Gores as they had proposed But he did not like to answer the letter by a refusal without saying a word to his guests on the subject He would not object to ignore the Senator but he was afraid that if nothing were to be said to Arabella she would hear of it hereafter and would complain of such treatment He therefore directed that the man might be kept waiting while he consulted the lady of his choice It was with difficulty that he found himself alone with her and then only by sending her maid in quest of her He did get her at last into his own sitting room and then having placed her in a chair near the fire gave her Lord Rufford s letter to read What can it be said she looking up into his face with her great inexpressive eyes that has required all this solemnity She still looked up at him and did not even open the letter I did not like to answer that without showing it to you I don t suppose you would care to go Go where It is from Lord Rufford for Monday From Lord Rufford It would break up all your plans and your mother s and would probably be a great bore Then she did read the letter very carefully and very slowly weighing every word of it as she read it Did it mean more than it said But though she read it slowly and carefully and was long before she made him any answer she had very quickly resolved that the invitation should be accepted It would suit her very well to know Lady Penwether It might possibly suit her still better to become intimate with Lord Rufford She was delighted at the idea of riding Lord Rufford s horse As her eyes dwelt on the paper she too began to think that the invitation had been chiefly given on her account At any rate she would go She had understood perfectly well from the first tone of her lover s voice that he did not wish to subject her to the allurements of Rufford Hall She was clever enough and could read it all But she did not mean to throw away a chance for the sake of pleasing him She must not at once displease him by declaring her purpose strongly and therefore as she slowly continued her reading she resolved that she would throw the burden upon her mother Had I not better show this to mamma she said You can if you please You are going to the Gores on Monday We could not go earlier but we might put it off for a couple of days if we pleased Would it bore you I don t mind about myself I m not a very great man for dances You d sooner write a report wouldn t you about the products of the country A great deal sooner said the Paragon But you see we haven t all of us got products to write about I don t care very much about it myself but if you don t mind I ll ask mamma Of course he was obliged to consent and merely informed her as she went off with the letter that a servant was waiting for an answer To go to Lord Rufford s said Lady Augustus From Monday till Wednesday mamma Of course we must go I promised poor missus Gore Nonsense mamma The Gores can do very well without us That was only to be a week and we can still stay out our time Of course this has only been sent because we are here I should say so I don t suppose Lord Rufford would care to know mister Morton Lady Penwether goes everywhere doesn t she Everywhere It would suit me to a t to get on to Lady Penwether s books But mamma of course it s not that If Lord Rufford should say a word it is so much easier to manage down in the country than up in London He has Lforty thousand a year if he has a penny How many girls have tried the same thing with him But I don t mind I ve always said that John Morton and Bragton would not do No mamma you haven t You were the first to say they would do I only said that if there were nothing else Oh mamma how can you say such things Nothing else as if he were the last man You said distinctly that Bragton was Lseven thousand a year and that it would do very well You may change your mind if you like but it s no good trying to back out of your own doings Then I have changed my mind Yes without thinking what I have to go through I m not going to throw myself at Lord Rufford s head so as to lose my chance here but we ll go and see how the land lies Of course you ll go mamma If you think it is for your advantage my dear My advantage It s part of the work to be done and we may as well do it At any rate I ll tell him to accept We shall have this odious American with us but that can t be helped And the old woman Lord Rufford doesn t say anything about her I don t suppose he s such a muff but what he can leave his grandmother behind for a couple of days Then she went back to Morton and told him that her mother was particularly anxious to make the acquaintance of Lady Penwether and that she had decided upon going to Rufford Hall It will be a very nice opportunity said she for you to become acquainted with Lord Rufford Then he was almost angry I can make plenty of such opportunities for myself when I want them he said Of course if you and Lady Augustus like it we will go But let it stand on its right bottom It may stand on any bottom you please Do you mean to ride the man s horse Certainly I do I never refuse a good offer Why shouldn t I ride the man s horse Did you never hear before of a young lady borrowing a gentleman s horse No lady belonging to me will ever do so unless the gentleman be a very close friend indeed The lady in this case does not belong to you mister Morton and therefore if you have no other objection she will ride Lord Rufford s horse Perhaps you will not think it too much trouble to signify the lady s acceptance of the mount in your letter Then she swam out of the room knowing that she left him in anger After that he had to find mister Gotobed The going was now decided on as far as he was concerned and it would make very little difference whether the American went or not except that his letter would have been easier to him in accepting the invitation for three persons than for four But the Senator was of course willing It was the Senator s object to see England and Lord Rufford s house would be an additional bit of England The Senator would be delighted to have an opportunity of saying what he thought about Goarly at Lord Rufford s table After that before this weary letter could be written he was compelled to see his grandmother and explain to her that she had been omitted Of course ma am they did not know that you were at Bragton as you were not in the carriage at the meet That s nonsense John Did Lord Rufford suppose that you were entertaining ladies here without some one to be mistress of the house Of course he knew that I was here I shouldn t have gone you may be sure of that I m not in the habit of going to the houses of people I don t know Indeed I think it s an impertinence in them to ask in that way I m surprised that you would go on such an invitation The Trefoils knew them If Lady Penwether knew them why could not Lady Penwether ask them independently of us I don t believe they ever spoke to Lady Penwether in their lives Lord Rufford and Miss Trefoil may very likely be London acquaintances He may admire her and therefore choose to have her at his ball I know nothing about that As far as I am concerned he s quite welcome to keep her All this was not very pleasant to John Morton He knew already that his grandmother and Lady Augustus hated each other and said spiteful things not only behind each other s backs but openly to each other s faces But now he had been told by the girl who was engaged to be his wife that she did not belong to him and by his grandmother who stood to him in the place of his mother that she wished that this girl belonged to some one else He was not quite sure that he did not wish it himself But even were it to be so and should there be reason for him to be gratified at the escape still he did not relish the idea of taking the girl himself to the other man s house He wrote the letter however and dispatched it But even the writing of it was difficult and disagreeable When various details of hospitality have been offered by a comparative stranger a man hardly likes to accept them all But in this case he had to do it He would be delighted he said to stay at Rufford Hall from the Monday to the Wednesday Lady Augustus and Miss Trefoil would also be delighted and so also would mister Gotobed be delighted And Miss Trefoil would be further delighted to accept Lord Rufford s offer of a horse for the Tuesday As for himself if he rode at all a horse would come for him to the meet Then he wrote another note to mister Harry Stubbings bespeaking a mount for the occasion On that evening the party at Bragton was not a very pleasant one No doubt you are intimate with Lady Penwether Lady Augustus said missus Morton Now Lady Penwether was a very fashionable woman whom to know was considered an honour What makes you ask ma am said Lady Augustus Only as you were taking your daughter to her brother s house and as he is a bachelor My dear missus Morton really you may leave me to take care of myself and of my daughter too You have lived so much out of the world for the last thirty years that it is quite amusing There are some persons worlds that it is a great deal better for a lady to be out of said missus Morton Then Lady Augustus put up her hands and turned round and affected to laugh of all which things mister Gotobed who was studying English society made notes in his own mind What sort of position does that man Goarly occupy here the Senator asked immediately after dinner No position at all said Morton Every man created holds some position as I take it The land is his own He has I believe about fifty acres And yet he seems to be in the lowest depth of poverty and ignorance Of course he mismanages his property and probably drinks I dare say mister Morton He is proud of his rights and talked of his father and his grandfather and yet I doubt whether you would find a man so squalid and so ignorant in all the States I suppose he is injured by having a lord so near him Quite the contrary if he would be amenable You mean if he would be a creature of the lord s And why was that other man so uncivil to me the man who was the lord s gamekeeper Because you went there as a friend of Goarly And that s his idea of English fair play asked the Senator with a jeer The truth is mister Gotobed said Morton endeavouring to explain it all you see a part only and not the whole That man Goarly is a rascal So everybody says And why can t you believe everybody So everybody says on the lord s side But before I m done I ll find out what people say on the other side I can see that he is ignorant and squalid but that very probably is the lord s fault It may be that he is a rascal and that the lord is to blame for that too But if the lord s pheasants have eaten up Goarly s corn the lord ought to pay for the corn whether Goarly be a rascal or not Then John Morton made up his mind that he would never ask another American Senator to his house CHAPTER XVIII THE ATTORNEY S FAMILY IS DISTURBED On that Wednesday evening Mary Masters said nothing to any of her family as to the invitation from Lady Ushant She very much wished to accept it Latterly for the last month or two her distaste to the kind of life for which her stepmother was preparing her had increased upon her greatly There had been days in which she had doubted whether it might not be expedient that she should accept mister Twentyman s offer She believed no ill of him She thought him to be a fine manly young fellow with a good heart and high principles She never asked herself whether he were or were not a gentleman She had never even inquired of herself whether she herself were or were not especially a lady But with all her efforts to like the man because she thought that by doing so she would relieve and please her father yet he was distasteful to her and now since that walk home with him from Bragton Bridge he was more distasteful than ever She did not tell herself that a short visit say for a month to Cheltenham would prevent his further attentions but she felt that there would be a temporary escape I do not think that she dwelt much on the suggestion that Reginald Morton should be her companion on the journey but the idea of such companionship even for a short time was pleasant to her If he did this surely then he would forgive her for having left him at the bridge She had much to think of before she could resolve how she should tell her tidings Should she show the letter first to her stepmother or to her father In the ordinary course of things in that house the former course would be expected It was missus Masters who managed everything affecting the family It was she who gave permission or denied permission for every indulgence She was generally fair to the three girls taking special pride to herself for doing her duty by her stepdaughter but on this very account she was the more likely to be angry if Mary passed her by on such an occasion as this and went to her father But should her stepmother have once refused her permission then the matter would have been decided against her It would be quite useless to appeal from her stepmother to her father nor would such an appeal come within the scope of her own principles The Mortons and especially Lady Ushant had been her father s friends in old days and she thought that perhaps she might prevail in this case if she could speak to her father first She knew well what would be the great or rather the real objection Her mother would not wish that she should be removed so long from Larry Twentyman There might be difficulties about her clothes but her father she knew would be kind to her At last she made up her mind that she would ask her father He was always at his office desk for half an hour in the morning before the clerks had come and on the following day a minute or two after he had taken his seat she knocked at the door He was busy reading a letter from Lord Rufford s man of business asking him certain questions about Goarly and almost employing him to get up the case on Lord Rufford s behalf There was a certain triumph to him in this It was not by his means that tidings had reached Lord Rufford of his refusal to undertake Goarly s case But Runciman who was often allowed by his lordship to say a few words to him in the hunting field had mentioned the circumstance A man like mister Masters is better without such a blackguard as that the Lord had said Then Runciman had replied No doubt my Lord no doubt But Dillsborough is a poor place and business is business my Lord Then Lord Rufford had remembered it and the letter which the attorney was somewhat triumphantly reading had been the consequence Is that you Mary What can I do for you my love Papa I want you to read this Then mister Masters read the letter I should so like to go Should you my dear Oh yes Lady Ushant has been so kind to me all my life And I do so love her What does mamma say I haven t asked mamma Is there any reason why you shouldn t go Of that one reason as to Larry Twentyman of course she would say nothing She must leave him to discuss that with her mother I should want some clothes papa a dress and some boots and a new hat and there would be money for the journey and a few other things The attorney winced but at the same time remembered that something was due to his eldest child in the way of garments and relaxation I never like to be an expense papa You are very good about that my dear I don t see why you shouldn t go It s very kind of Lady Ushant I ll talk to mamma Then Mary went away to get the breakfast fearing that before long there would be black looks in the house mister Masters at once went up to his wife having given himself a minute or two to calculate that he would let Mary have twenty pounds for the occasion and made his proposition I never heard of such nonsense in my life said missus Masters Nonsense my dear Why should it be nonsense Cocking her up with Lady Ushant What good will Lady Ushant do her She s not going to live with ladies of quality all her life Why shouldn t she live with ladies You know what I mean Gregory The Mortons have dropped you for any use they were to you long ago and you may as well make up your mind to drop them You ll go on hankering after gentlefolks till you ve about ruined yourself When he remembered that he had that very morning received a commission from Lord Rufford he thought that this was a little too bad But he was not now in a humour to make known to her this piece of good news I like to feel that she has got friends he said going back to Mary s proposed visit Of course she has got friends if she ll only take up with them as she ought to do Why does she go on shilly shallying with that young man instead of closing upon it at once If she did that she wouldn t want such friends as Lady Ushant Why did the girl come to you with all this instead of asking me There would be a little money wanted Money Yes I dare say It s very easy to want money but very hard to get it If you send clients away out of the office with a flea in their ear I don t see how she s to have all manner of luxuries She ought to have come to me I don t see that at all my dear If I m to look after her she shall be said by me that s all I ve done for her just as I have for my own and I m not going to have her turn up her nose at me directly she wants anything for herself I know what s fit for Mary and it ain t fit that she should go trapesing away to Cheltenham doing nothing in that old woman s parlour and losing her chances for life Who is to suppose that Larry Twentyman will go on dangling after her in this way month after month The young man wants a wife and of course he ll get one You can t make her marry the man if she don t like him Like him She ought to be made to like him A young man well off as he is and she without a shilling All that comes from Ushanting It never occurred to missus Masters that perhaps the very qualities that had made poor Larry so vehemently in love with Mary had come from her intercourse with Lady Ushant If I m to have my way she won t go a yard on the way to Cheltenham I ve told her she may go said mister Masters whose mind was wandering back to old days to his first wife and to the time when he used to be an occasional guest in the big parlour at Bragton He was always ready to acknowledge to himself that his present wife was a good and helpful companion to him and a careful mother to his children but there were moments in which he would remember with soft regret a different phase of his life Just at present he was somewhat angry and resolving in his own mind that in this case he would have his own way Then I shall tell her she mayn t said missus Masters with a look of dogged determination I hope you will do nothing of the kind my dear I ve told her that she shall have a few pounds to get what she wants and I won t have her disappointed After that missus Masters bounced out of the room and made herself very disagreeable indeed over the tea things The whole household was much disturbed that day missus Masters said nothing to Mary about Lady Ushant all the morning but said a great deal about other things Poor Mary was asked whether she was not ashamed to treat a young man as she was treating mister Twentyman Then again it was demanded of her whether she thought it right that all the house should be knocked about for her At dinner missus Masters would hardly speak to her husband but addressed herself exclusively to Dolly and Kate mister Masters was not a man who could usually stand this kind of thing very long and was accustomed to give up in despair and then take himself off to the solace of his office chair But on the present occasion he went through his meal like a Spartan and retired from the room without a sign of surrender In the afternoon about five o clock Mary watched her opportunity and found him again alone It was incumbent on her to reply to Lady Ushant Would it not be better that she should write and say how sorry she was that she could not come But I want you to go said he Oh papa I cannot bear to cause trouble No my dear no and I m sure I don t like trouble myself But in this case I think you ought to go What day has she named Then Mary declared that she could not possibly go so soon as Lady Ushant had suggested but that she could be ready by the eighteenth of December Then write and tell her so my dear and I will let your mother know that it is fixed But Mary still hesitated desiring to know whether she had not better speak to her mother first I think you had better write your letter first and then he absolutely made her write it in the office and give it to him to be posted After that he promised to communicate to Reginald Morton what had been done The household was very much disturbed the whole of that evening Poor Mary never remembered such a state of things and when there had been any difference of opinion she had hitherto never been the cause of it Now it was all owing to her And things were said so terrible that she hardly knew how to bear them Her father had promised her the twenty pounds and it was insinuated that all the comforts of the family must be stopped because of this lavish extravagance Her father sat still and bore it almost without a word Both Dolly and Kate were silent and wretched missus Masters every now and then gurgled in her throat and three or four times wiped her eyes I m better out of the way altogether she said at last jumping up and walking towards the door as though she were going to leave the room and the house for ever Mamma said Mary rising from her seat I won t go I ll write and tell Lady Ushant that I can t do it You re not to mind me said missus Masters You re to do what your papa tells you Everything that I ve been striving at is to be thrown away I m to be nobody and it s quite right that your papa should tell you so Dear mamma don t talk like that said Mary clinging hold of her stepmother Your papa sits there and won t say a word said missus Masters stamping her foot What s the good of speaking when you go on like that before the children said mister Masters getting up from his chair I say that it s a proper thing that the girl should go to see the old friend who brought her up and has been always kind to her and she shall go missus Masters seated herself on the nearest chair and leaning her head against the wall began to go into hysterics Your letter has already gone Mary and I desire you will write no other without letting me know Then he left the room and the house and absolutely went over to the Bush This latter proceeding was however hardly more than a bravado for he merely took the opportunity of asking missus Runciman a question at the bar and then walked back to his own house and shut himself up in the office On the next morning he called on Reginald Morton and told him that his daughter had accepted Lady Ushant s invitation but could not go till the eighteenth I shall be proud to take charge of her said Reginald And as for the change in the day it will suit me all the better So that was settled On the next day Friday missus Masters did not come down to breakfast but was waited upon upstairs by her own daughters This with her was a most unusual circumstance The two maids were of opinion that such a thing had never occurred before and that therefore Masters must have been out half the night at the public house although they had not known it To Mary she would hardly speak a word She appeared at dinner and called her husband mister Masters when she helped him to stew All the afternoon she averred that her head was splitting but managed to say many very bitter things about gentlemen in general and expressed a vehement hope that that poor man Goarly would get at least a hundred pounds It must be owned however that at this time she had heard nothing of Lord Rufford s commission to her husband In the evening Larry came in and was at once told the terrible news Larry said Kate Mary is going away for a month Where are you going Mary asked the lover eagerly To Lady Ushant s mister Twentyman For a month She has asked me for a month said Mary It s a regular fool s errand said missus Masters It s not done with my consent mister Twentyman I don t think she ought to stir from home till things are more settled They can be settled this moment as far as I am concerned said Larry standing up There now said missus Masters At this time mister Masters was not in the room If you can make it straight with mister Twentyman I won t say a word against your going away for a month Mamma you shouldn t exclaimed Mary I hate such nonsense mister Twentyman is behaving honest and genteel What more would you have Give him an answer like a sensible girl I have given him an answer and I cannot say anything more said Mary as she left the room CHAPTER XIX WHO VALUED THE GEESE Before the time had come for the visit to Rufford Hall mister Gotobed had called upon Bearside the attorney and had learned as much as mister Bearside chose to tell him of the facts of the case This took place on the Saturday morning and the interview was on the whole satisfactory to the Senator But then having a theory of his own in his head and being fond of ventilating his own theories he explained thoroughly to the man the story which he wished to hear before the man was called upon to tell his story mister Bearside of course told it accordingly Goarly was a very poor man and very ignorant was perhaps not altogether so good a member of society as he might have been but no doubt he had a strong case against the lord The lord so said mister Bearside had fallen into a way of paying a certain recompense in certain cases for crops damaged by game and having in this way laid down a rule for himself did not choose to have that rule disturbed Just feudalism said the indignant Senator No better nor yet no worse than that sir said the attorney who did not in the least know what feudalism was The strong hand backed by the strong rank and the strong purse determined to have its own way continued the Senator A most determined man is his lordship said the attorney Then the Senator expressed his hope that mister Bearside would be able to see the poor man through it and mister Bearside explained to the Senator that the poor man was a very poor man indeed who had been so unfortunate with his land that he was hardly able to provide bread for himself and his children He went so far as to insinuate that he was taking up this matter himself solely on the score of charity adding that as he could not of course afford to be money out of pocket for expenses of witnesses c he did not quite see how he was to proceed Then the Senator made certain promises He was he said going back to London in the course of next week but he did not mind making himself responsible to the extent of fifty dollars if the thing were carried on bona fide to a conclusion mister Bearside declared that it would of course be bona fide and asked the Senator for his address Would mister Gotobed object to putting his name to a little docket certifying to the amount promised mister Gotobed gave an address but thought that in such a matter as that his word might be trusted If it were not trusted then the offer might fall to the ground mister Bearside was profuse in his apologies and declared that the gentleman s word was as good as his bond mister Gotobed made no secret of his doings Perhaps he had a feeling that he could not justify himself in so strange a proceeding without absolute candour He saw mister Mainwaring in the street as he left Bearside s office and told him all about it I just want sir to see what ll come of it You ll lose your fifty dollars mister Gotobed and only cause a little vexation to a high spirited young nobleman Very likely sir But neither the loss of my dollars nor Lord Rufford s slight vexation will in the least disturb my rest I m not a rich man sir but I should like to watch the way in which such a question will be tried and brought to a conclusion in this aristocratic country I don t quite know what your laws may be mister Mainwaring Just the same as your own mister Gotobed I take it We have no game laws sir As I was saying I don t understand your laws but justice is the same everywhere If this great lord s game has eaten up the poor man s wheat the great lord ought to pay for it The owners of game pay for the damage they do three times over said the parson who was very strongly on that side of the question Do you think that such men as Goarly would be better off if the gentry were never to come into the country at all Perhaps mister Mainwaring I may think that there would be no Goarlys if there were no Ruffords That however is a great question which cannot be argued on this case All we can hope here is that one poor man may have an act of justice done him though in seeking for it he has to struggle against so wealthy a magnate as Lord Rufford What I hope is that he may be found out replied mister Mainwaring with equal enthusiasm and then he will be in Rufford gaol before long That s the justice I look for Who do you think put down the poison in Dillsborough wood How was it that the poor woman lost all her geese asked the Senator She was paid for a great many more than she lost mister Gotobed That doesn t touch upon the injustice of the proceeding Who assessed the loss sir Who valued the geese Am I to keep a pet tiger in my garden and give you a couple of dollars when he destroys your pet dog and think myself justified because dogs as a rule are not worth more than two dollars each She has a right to her own geese on her own ground And Lord Rufford sir as I take it said Runciman who had been allowed to come up and hear the end of the conversation has a right to his own foxes in his own coverts Yes if he could keep them there my friend But as it is the nature of foxes to wander away and to be thieves he has no such right Of course sir begging your pardon said Runciman I was speaking of England Runciman had heard of the Senator Gotobed as indeed had all Dillsborough by this time And I am speaking of justice all the world over said the Senator slapping his hand upon his thigh But I only want to see It may be that England is a country in which a poor man should not attempt to hold a few acres of land On that night the Dillsborough club met as usual and as a matter of course Goarly and the American Senator were the subjects chiefly discussed Everybody in the room knew or thought that he knew that Goarly was a cheating fraudulent knave and that Lord Rufford was at any rate in this case acting properly They all understood the old goose and were aware nearly to a bushel of the amount of wheat which the man had sold off those two fields Runciman knew that the interest on the mortgage had been paid and could only have been paid out of the produce and Larry Twentyman knew that if Goarly took his seven s six d an acre he would be better off than if the wood had not been there But yet among them all they didn t quite see how they were to confute the Senator s logic They could not answer it satisfactorily even among themselves but they felt that if Goarly could be detected in some offence that would confute the Senator Among themselves it was sufficient to repeat the well known fact that Goarly was a rascal but with reference to this aggravating interfering and most obnoxious American it would be necessary to prove it His Lordship has put it into Masters s hands I m told said the doctor At this time neither the attorney nor Larry Twentyman was in the room He couldn t have done better said Runciman speaking from behind a long clay pipe All the same he was nibbling at Goarly said Ned Botsey I don t know that he was nibbling at Goarly at all mister Botsey said the landlord Goarly came to him and Goarly was refused What more would you have It s all one to me said Botsey only I do think that in a sporting county like this the place ought to be made too hot to hold a blackguard like that If he comes out at me with his gun I ll ride over him And I wouldn t mind riding over that American too That s just what would suit Goarly s book said the doctor Exactly what Goarly would like said Harry Stubbings Then mister Masters and Larry entered the room On that evening two things had occurred to the attorney Nickem had returned and had asked for and received an additional week s leave of absence He had declined to explain accurately what he was doing but gave the attorney to understand that he thought that he was on the way to the bottom of the whole thing Then after Nickem had left him mister Masters had a letter of instructions from Lord Rufford s steward When he received it and found that his paid services had been absolutely employed on behalf of his Lordship he almost regretted the encouragement he had given to Nickem In the first place he might want Nickem And then he felt that in his present position he ought not to be a party to anything underhand But Nickem was gone and he was obliged to console himself by thinking that Nickem was at any rate employing his intellect on the right side When he left his house with Larry Twentyman he had told his wife nothing about Lord Rufford Up to this time he and his wife had not as yet reconciled their difference and poor Mary was still living in misery Larry though he had called for the attorney had not sat down in the parlour and had barely spoken to Mary For gracious sake mister Twentyman don t let him stay in that place there half the night said missus Masters It ain t fit for a father of a family Father never does stay half the night said Kate who took more liberties in that house than any one else Hold your tongue miss I don t know whether it wouldn t be better for you mister Twentyman if you were not there so often yourself Poor Larry felt this to be hard He was not even engaged as yet and as far as he could see was not on the way to be engaged In such condition surely his possible mother in law could have no right to interfere with him He condescended to make no reply but crossed the passage and carried the attorney off with him You ve heard what that American gentleman has been about mister Masters asked the landlord I m told he s been with Bearside And has offered to pay his bill for him if he ll carry on the business for Goarly Whoever heard the like of that What sort of a man is he asked the doctor A great man in his own country everybody says answered Runciman I wish he d stayed there He comes over here and thinks he understands everything just as though he had lived here all his life Did you say gin cold Larry and rum for you mister Masters Then the landlord gave the orders to the girl who had answered the bell But they say he s actually going to Lord Rufford s said young Botsey who would have given one of his fingers to be asked to the lord s house They are all going from Bragton said Runciman The young squire is going to ride one of my horses said Harry Stubbings That ll be an easy three pounds in your pockets Harry said the doctor In answer to which Harry remarked that he took all that as it came the heavies and lights together and that there was not much change to be got out of three sovereigns when some gentlemen had had a horse out for the day particularly when a gentleman didn t pay perhaps for twelve months The whole party is going continued the landlord How he is to have the cheek to go into his Lordship s house after what he is doing is more than I can understand What business is it of his said Larry angrily That s what I want to know What d he think if we went and interfered over there I shouldn t be surprised if he got a little rough usage before he s out of the county I m told he came across Bean when he was ferretting about the other day and that Bean gave him quite as good as he brought I say he s a spy said Ribbs the butcher from his seat on the sofa I hates a spy Soon after that mister Masters left the room and Larry Twentyman followed him There was something almost ridiculous in the way the young man would follow the attorney about on these Saturday evenings as though he could make love to the girl by talking to the father But on this occasion he had something special to say So Mary s going to Cheltenham mister Masters Yes she is You don t see any objection to that
4331_57179_000019_000000	train-clean-360	 I hope Not 
none	none	in the least mister Masters I wish she might go anywhere to enjoy herself And from all I ve heard Lady Ushant is a very good sort of lady A very good sort of lady She won t do Mary any harm Twentyman I don t suppose she will But there s one thing I should like to know Why shouldn t she tell me before she goes that she ll have me I wish she would with all my heart And missus Masters is all on my side Quite so And the girls have always been my friends I think we are all your friends Twentyman I m sure Mary is But that isn t marrying is it If you would speak to her mister Masters What would you have me say I couldn t bid my girl to have one man or another I could only tell her what I think and that she knows already If you were to say that you wished it She thinks so much about you I couldn t tell her that I wished it in a manner that would drive her into it Of course it would be a very good match But I have only to think of her happiness and I must leave her to judge what will make her happy I should like to have it fixed some way before she starts said Larry in an altered tone Of course you are your own master Twentyman And you have behaved very well This is a kind of thing that a man can t stand said the young farmer sulkily Good night mister Masters Then he walked off home to Chowton Farm meditating on his own condition and trying to make up his mind to leave the scornful girl and become a free man But he couldn t do it He couldn t even quite make up his mind that he would try to do it There was a bitterness within as he thought of permanent fixed failure which he could not digest There was a craving in his heart which he did not himself quite understand but which made him think that the world would be unfit to be lived in if he were to be altogether separated from Mary Masters He couldn t separate himself from her It was all very well thinking of it talking of it threatening it but in truth he couldn t do it There might of course be an emergency in which he must do it She might declare that she loved some one else and she might marry that other person In that event he saw no other alternative but as he expressed it to himself to run a mucker Whether the mucker should be run against Mary or against the fortunate lover or against himself he did not at present resolve But he did resolve as he reached his own hall door that he would make one more passionate appeal to Mary herself before she started for Cheltenham and that he would not make it out on a public path or in the Masters family parlour before all the Masters family but that he would have her secluded by herself so that he might speak out all that was in him to the best of his ability CHAPTER XX THERE ARE CONVENANCES Before the Monday came the party to Rufford Hall had become quite a settled thing and had been very much discussed On the Saturday the Senator had been driven to the meet a distance of about ten miles on purpose that he might see Lord Rufford and explain his views about Goarly Lord Rufford had bowed and stared and laughed and had then told the Senator that he thought he would find himself in the wrong box That s quite possible my Lord I guess it won t be the first time I ve been in the wrong box my Lord Sometimes I do get right But I thought I would not enter your lordship s house as a guest without telling you what I was doing Then Lord Rufford assured him that this little affair about Goarly would make no difference in that respect mister Gotobed again scrutinised the hounds and Tony Tuppett laughed in his sleeve because a fox wasn t found in the first quarter of an hour and after that was driven back to Bragton The Sunday was a day of preparation for the Trefoils Of course they didn t go to church Arabella indeed was never up in time for church and Lady Augustus only went when her going would be duly registered among fashionable people mister Gotobed laughed when he was invited and asked whether anybody was ever known to go to church two Sundays running at Bragton People have been known to refuse with less acrimony said Morton I always speak my mind sir replied the Senator Poor John Morton therefore went to his parish church alone There were many things to be considered by the Trefoils There was the question of dress If any good was to be done by Arabella at Rufford it must be done with great despatch There would be the dinner on Monday the hunting on Tuesday the ball and then the interesting moment of departure No girl could make better use of her time but then think of her difficulties All that she did would have to be done under the very eyes of the man to whom she was engaged and to whom she wished to remain engaged unless as she said to herself she could pull off the other event A great deal must depend on appearance As she and her mother were out on a lengthened cruise among long suffering acquaintances going to the De Brownes after the Gores and the Smijthes after the De Brownes with as many holes to run to afterwards as a four year old fox though with the same probability of finding them stopped of course she had her wardrobe with her To see her night after night one would think that it was supplied with all that wealth would give But there were deficiencies and there were make shifts very well known to herself and well understood by her maid She could generally supply herself with gloves by bets as to which she had never any scruple in taking either what she did win or did not and in dunning any who might chance to be defaulters On occasions too when not afraid of the bystanders she would venture on a hat and though there was difficulty as to the payment not being able to give her number as she did with gloves so that the tradesmen could send the article still she would manage to get the hat and the trimmings It was said of her that she once offered to lay an Ulster to a sealskin jacket but that the young man had coolly said that a sealskin jacket was beyond a joke and had asked her whether she was ready to put down her Ulster These were little difficulties from which she usually knew how to extricate herself without embarrassment but she had not expected to have to marshal her forces against such an enemy as Lord Rufford or to sit down for the besieging of such a city this campaign There were little things which required to be done and the lady s maid certainly had not time to go to church on Sunday But there were other things which troubled her even more than her clothes She did not much like Bragton and at Bragton in his own house she did not very much like her proposed husband At Washington he had been somebody She had met him everywhere then and had heard him much talked about At Washington he had been a popular man and had had the reputation of being a rich man also but here at home in the country he seemed to her to fall off in importance and he certainly had not made himself pleasant Whether any man could be pleasant to her in the retirement of a country house any man whom she would have no interest in running down she did not ask herself An engagement to her must under any circumstances be a humdrum thing to be brightened only by wealth But here she saw no signs of wealth Nevertheless she was not prepared to shove away the plank from below her feet till she was sure that she had a more substantial board on which to step Her mother who perhaps did not see in the character of Morton all the charms which she would wish to find in a son in law was anxious to shake off the Bragton alliance but Arabella as she said so often both to herself and to her mother was sick of the dust of the battle and conscious of fading strength She would make this one more attempt but must make it with great care When last in town this young lord had whispered a word or two to her which then had set her hoping for a couple of days and now when chance had brought her into his neighbourhood he had gone out of his way very much out of his way to renew his acquaintance with her She would be mad not to give herself the chance but yet she could not afford to let the plank go from under her feet But the part she had to play was one which even she felt to be almost beyond her powers She could perceive that Morton was beginning to be jealous and that his jealousy was not of that nature which strengthens a tie but which is apt to break it altogether His jealousy if fairly aroused would not be appeased by a final return to himself She had already given him occasion to declare himself off and if thoroughly angered he would no doubt use it Day by day and almost hour by hour he was becoming more sombre and hard and she was well aware that there was reason for it It did not suit her to walk about alone with him through the shrubberies It did not suit her to be seen with his arm round her waist Of course the people of Bragton would talk of the engagement but she would prefer that they should talk of it with doubt Even her own maid had declared to missus Hopkins that she did not know whether there was or was not an engagement her own maid being at the time almost in her confidence Very few of the comforts of a lover had been vouchsafed to John Morton during this sojourn at Bragton and very little had been done in accordance with his wishes Even this visit to Rufford as she well knew was being made in opposition to him She hoped that her lover would not attempt to ride to hounds on the Tuesday so that she might be near the lord unseen by him and that he would leave Rufford on the Wednesday before herself and her mother At the ball of course she could dance with Lord Rufford and could keep her eye on her lover at the same time She hardly saw Morton on the Sunday afternoon and she was again closeted on the Monday till lunch They were to start at four and there would not be much more than time after lunch for her to put on her travelling gear Then as they all felt there was a difficulty about the carriages Who was to go with whom Arabella after lunch took the bull by the horns I suppose she said as Morton followed her out into the hall mamma and I had better go in the phaeton I was thinking that Lady Augustus might consent to travel with mister Gotobed and that you and I might have the phaeton Of course it would be very pleasant she answered smiling Then why not let it be so There are convenances How would it be if you and I were going without anybody else Do you mean to say that in that case we might not sit in the same carriage I mean to say that in that case I should not go at all It isn t done in England You have been in the States so long that you forget all our old fashioned ways I do think that is nonsense She only smiled and shook her head Then the Senator shall go in the phaeton and I will go with you and your mother Yes and quarrel with mamma all the time as you always do Let me have it my own way this time Upon my word I believe you are ashamed of me he said leaning back upon the hall table He had shut the dining room door and she was standing close to him What nonsense You have only got to say so Arabella and let there be an end of it all If you wish it mister Morton You know I don t wish it You know I am ready to marry you to morrow You have made ever so many difficulties as far as I can understand You have unreasonable people acting for you Arabella and of course I don t mean to give way to them Pray don t talk to me about money I know nothing about it and have taken no part in the matter I suppose there must be settlements Of course there must And I can only do what other people tell me You at any rate have something to do with it all and I have absolutely nothing That is no reason you shouldn t go in the same carriage with me to Rufford Are you coming back to that just like a big child Do let us consider that as settled I m sure you ll let mamma and me have the use of the phaeton Of course the little contest was ended in the manner proposed by Arabella I do think said Arabella when she and her mother were seated in the carriage that we have treated him very badly Quite as well as he deserves What a house to bring us to and what people Did you ever come across such an old woman before And she has him completely under her thumb Are you prepared to live with that harridan You may let me alone mamma for all that She won t be in my way after I m married I can tell you You ll have something to do then I ain t a bit afraid of her And to ask us to meet such people as this American He s going back to Washington and it suited him to have him I don t quarrel with him for that I wish I were married to him and back in the States You do I do You have given it all up about Lord Rufford then No that s just where it is I haven t given it up and I still see trouble upon trouble before me But I know how it will be He doesn t mean anything He s only amusing himself If he d once say the word he couldn t get back again The Duke would interfere then What would he care for the Duke The Duke is no more than anybody else nowadays I shall just fall to the ground between two stools I know it as well as if it were done already And then I shall have to begin again If it comes to that I shall do something terrible I know I shall Then they turned in at Lord Rufford s gates and as they were driven up beneath the oaks through the gloom both mother and daughter thought how charming it would be to be the mistress of such a park CHAPTER XXI THE FIRST EVENING AT RUFFORD HALL The phaeton arrived the first the driver having been especially told by Arabella that he need not delay on the road for the other carriage She had calculated that she might make her entrance with better effect alone with her mother than in company with Morton and the Senator It would have been worth the while of any one who had witnessed her troubles on that morning to watch the bland serenity and happy ease with which she entered the room Her mother was fond of a prominent place but was quite contented on this occasion to play a second fiddle for her daughter She had seen at a glance that Rufford Hall was a delightful house Oh if it might become the home of her child and her grandchildren and possibly a retreat for herself Arabella was certainly very handsome at this moment Never did she look better than when got up with care for travelling especially as seen by an evening light Her slow motions were adapted to heavy wraps and however she might procure her large sealskin jacket she graced it well when she had it Lord Rufford came to the door to meet them and immediately introduced them to his sister There were six or seven people in the room mostly ladies and tea was offered to the new comers Lady Penwether was largely made like her brother but was a languidly lovely woman not altogether unlike Arabella herself in her figure and movements but with a more expressive face with less colour and much more positive assurance of high breeding Lady Penwether was said to be haughty but it was admitted by all people that when Lady Penwether had said a thing or had done a thing it might be taken for granted that the way in which she had done or said that thing was the right way The only other gentleman there was Major Caneback who had just come in from hunting with some distant pack and who had been brought into the room by Lord Rufford that he might give some account of the doings of the day According to Caneback they had been talking in the Brake country about nothing but Goarly and the enormities which had been perpetrated in the U R U By the bye Miss Trefoil said Lord Rufford what have you done with your Senator He s on the road Lord Rufford examining English institutions as he comes along He ll be here by midnight Imagine the man coming to me and telling me that he was a friend of Goarly s I rather liked him for it There was a thorough pluck about it They say he s going to find all the money I thought mister Scrobby was to do that said Lady Penwether mister Scrobby will not have the slightest objection to have that part of the work done for him If all we hear is true Miss Trefoil s Senator may have to defend both Scrobby and Goarly My Senator as you call him will be quite up to the occasion You knew him in America Miss Trefoil asked Lady Penwether Oh yes We used to meet him and missus Gotobed everywhere But we didn t exactly bring him over with us though our party down to Bragton was made up in Washington she added feeling that she might in this way account in some degree for her own presence in John Morton s house It was mamma and mister Morton arranged it all Oh my dear it was you and the Senator said Lady Augustus ready for the occasion Miss Trefoil said the lord let us have it all out at once Are you taking Goarly s part Taking Goarly s part ejaculated the Major Arabella affected to give a little start as though frightened by the Major s enthusiasm For heaven s sake let us know our foes continued Lord Rufford You see the effect such an announcement had upon Major Caneback Have you made an appointment before dawn with mister Scrobby under the elms Now I look at you I believe in my heart you re a Goarlyite only without the Senator s courage to tell me the truth beforehand I really am very much obliged to Goarly said Arabella because it is so nice to have something to talk about That s just what I think Miss Trefoil declared a young lady Miss Penge who was a friend of Lady Penwether The gentlemen have so much to say about hunting which nobody can understand But now this delightful man has scattered poison all over the country there is something that comes home to our understanding I declare myself a Goarlyite at once Lord Rufford and shall put myself under the Senator s leading directly he comes During all this time not a word had been said of John Morton the master of Bragton the man to whose party these new comers belonged Lady Augustus and Arabella clearly understood that John Morton was only a peg on which the invitation to them had been hung The feeling that it was so grew upon them with every word that was spoken and also the conviction that he must be treated like a peg at Rufford The sight of the hangings of the room so different to the old fashioned dingy curtains at Bragton the brilliancy of the mirrors all the decorations of the place the very blaze from the big grate forced upon the girl s feelings a conviction that this was her proper sphere Here she was being made much of as a new comer and here if possible she must remain Everything smiled on her with gilded dimples and these were the smiles she valued As the softness of the cushions sank into her heart and mellow nothingnesses from well trained voices greeted her ears and the air of wealth and idleness floated about her cheeks her imagination rose within her and assured her that she could secure something better than Bragton The cautions with which she had armed herself faded away This this was the kind of thing for which she had been striving As a girl of spirit was it not worth her while to make another effort even though there might be danger Aut Caesar aut nihil She knew nothing about Caesar but before the tardy wheels which brought the Senator and mister Morton had stopped at the door she had declared to herself that she would be Lady Rufford The fresh party was of course brought into the drawing room and tea was offered but Arabella hardly spoke to them and Lady Augustus did not speak to them at all and they were shown up to their bedrooms with very little preliminary conversation It was very hard to put mister Gotobed down or it might be more correctly said as there was no effort to put him down that it was not often that he failed in coming to the surface He took Lady Penwether out to dinner and was soon explaining to her that this little experiment of his in regard to Goarly was being tried simply with the view of examining the institutions of the country We don t mind it from you said Lady Penwether because you are in a certain degree a foreigner The Senator declared himself flattered by being regarded as a foreigner only in a certain degree You see you speak our language mister Gotobed and we can t help thinking you are half English We are two thirds English my lady said mister Gotobed but then we think the other third is an improvement Very likely We have nothing so nice as this as he spoke he waved his right hand to the different corners of the room Such a dinner table as I am sitting down to now couldn t be fixed in all the United States though a man might spend three times as many dollars on it as his lordship does That is very often done I should think But then as we have nothing so well done as a house like this so also have we nothing so ill done as the houses of your poor people Wages are higher with you mister Gotobed And public spirit and the philanthropy of the age and the enlightenment of the people and the institutions of the country all round They are all higher Canvas back ducks said the Major who was sitting two or three off on the other side Yes sir we have canvas back ducks Make up for a great many faults said the Major Of course sir when a man s stomach rises above his intelligence he ll have to argue accordingly said the Senator Caneback what are you going to ride to morrow asked the lord who saw the necessity of changing the conversation as far at least as the Major was concerned Jemima mare of Purefoy s have my neck broken they tell me It s not improbable said Sir John Purefoy who was sitting at Lady Penwether s left hand Nobody ever could ride her yet I was thinking of asking you to let Miss Trefoil try her said Lord Rufford Arabella was sitting between Sir John Purefoy and the Major Miss Trefoil is quite welcome said Sir John It isn t a bad idea Perhaps she may carry a lady because she has never been tried I know that she objects strongly to carry a man My dear said Lady Augustus you shan t do anything of the kind And Lady Augustus pretended to be frightened Mamma you don t suppose Lord Rufford wants to kill me at once You shall either ride her Miss Trefoil or my little horse Jack But I warn you beforehand that as Jack is the easiest ridden horse in the country and can scramble over anything and never came down in his life you won t get any honour and glory but on Jemima you might make a character that would stick to you till your dying day But if I ride Jemima that dying day might be to morrow I think I ll take Jack Lord Rufford and let Major Caneback have the honour Is Jack fast In this way the anger arising between the Senator and the Major was assuaged The Senator still held his own and before the question was settled between Jack and Jemima had told the company that no Englishman knew how to ride and that the only seat fit for a man on horseback was that suited for the pacing horses of California and Mexico Then he assured Sir John Purefoy that eighty miles a day was no great journey for a pacing horse with a man of fourteen stone and a saddle and accoutrements weighing four more The Major s countenance when the Senator declared that no Englishman could ride was a sight worth seeing That evening even in the drawing room the conversation was chiefly about horses and hunting and those terrible enemies Goarly and Scrobby Lady Penwether and Miss Penge who didn t hunt were distantly civil to Lady Augustus of whom of course a woman so much in the world as Lady Penwether knew something Lady Penwether had shrugged her shoulders when consulted as to these special guests and had expressed a hope that Rufford wasn t going to make a goose of himself But she was fond of her brother and as both Lady Purefoy and Miss Penge were special friends of hers and as she had also been allowed to invite a couple of Godolphin s girls to whom she wished to be civil she did as she was asked The girl she said to Miss Penge that evening was handsome but penniless and a flirt The mother she declared to be a regular old soldier As to Lady Augustus she was right but she had perhaps failed to read Arabella s character correctly Arabella Trefoil was certainly not a flirt In all the horsey conversation Arabella joined and her low clear slow voice could be heard now and then as though she were really animated with the subject At Bragton she had never once spoken as though any matter had interested her During this time Morton fell into conversation first with Lady Purefoy and then with the two Miss Godolphins and afterwards for a few minutes with Lady Penwether who knew that he was a county gentleman and a respectable member of the diplomatic profession But during the whole evening his ear was intent on the notes of Arabella s voice and also during the whole evening her eye was watching him She would not lose her chance with Lord Rufford for want of any effort on her own part If aught were required from her in her present task that might be offensive to mister Morton anything that was peremptorily demanded for the effort she would not scruple to offend the man But if it might be done without offence so much the better Once he came across the room and said a word to her as she was talking to Lord Rufford and the Purefoys You are really in earnest about riding to morrow Oh dear yes Why shouldn t I be in earnest You are coming out yourself I hope said the Lord I have no horses here of my own but I have told that man Stubbings to send me something and as I haven t been at Bragton for the last seven years I have nothing proper to wear I shan t be called a Goarlyite I hope if I appear in trowsers Not unless you have a basket of red herrings on your arm said Lord Rufford Then Morton retired back to the Miss Godolphins finding that he had nothing more to say to Arabella He was very angry though he hardly knew why or with whom A girl when she is engaged is not supposed to talk to no one but her recognised lover in a mixed party of ladies and gentlemen and she is especially absolved from such a duty when they chance to meet in the house of a comparative stranger In such a house and among such people it was natural that the talk should be about hunting and as the girl had accepted the loan of a horse it was natural that she should join in such conversation She had never sat for a moment apart with Lord Rufford It was impossible to say that she had flirted with the man and yet Morton felt that he was neglected and felt also that he was only there because this pleasure seeking young Lord had liked to have in his house the handsome girl whom he Morton intended to marry He felt thoroughly ashamed of being there as it were in the train of Miss Trefoil He was almost disposed to get up and declare that the girl was engaged to marry him He thought that he could put an end to the engagement without breaking his heart but if the engagement was an engagement he could not submit to treatment such as this either from her or from others He would see her for the last time in the country at the ball on the following evening as of course he would not be near her during the hunting and then he would make her understand that she must be altogether his or altogether cease to be his And so resolving he went to bed refusing to join the gentlemen in the smoking room Oh mamma Arabella said to her mother that evening I do so wish I could break my arm to morrow Break your arm my dear Or my leg would be better I wish I could have the courage to chuck myself off going over some gate If I could be laid up here now with a broken limb I really think I could do it CHAPTER XXII JEMIMA As the meet on the next morning was in the park the party at Rufford Hall was able to enjoy the luxury of an easy morning together with the pleasures of the field There was no getting up at eight o clock no hurry and scurry to do twenty miles and yet be in time no necessity for the tardy dressers to swallow their breakfasts while their more energetic companions were raving at them for compromising the chances of the day by their delay There was a public breakfast down stairs at which all the hunting farmers of the country were to be seen and some who only pretended to be hunting farmers on such occasions But up stairs there was a private breakfast for the ladies and such of the gentlemen as preferred tea to champagne and cherry brandy Lord Rufford was in and out of both rooms making himself generally agreeable In the public room there was a great deal said about Goarly to all of which the Senator listened with eager ears for the Senator preferred the public breakfast as offering another institution to his notice He ll swing on a gallows afore he s dead said one energetic farmer who was sitting next to mister Gotobed a fat man with a round head and a bullock s neck dressed in a black coat with breeches and top boots John Runce was not a riding man He was too heavy and short winded too fond of his beer and port wine but he was a hunting man all over one who always had a fox in the springs at the bottom of his big meadows one to whom it was the very breath of his nostrils to shake hands with the hunting gentry and to be known as a staunch friend to the U R U A man did not live in the county more respected than John Runce or who was better able to pay his way To his thinking an animal more injurious than Goarly to the best interests of civilisation could not have been produced by all the evil influences of the world combined Do you really think said the Senator calmly that a man should be hanged for killing a fox John Runce who was not very ready turned round and stared at him I haven t heard of any other harm that he has done and perhaps he had some provocation for that Words were wanting to mister Runce but not indignation He collected together his plate and knife and fork and his two glasses and his lump of bread and looking the Senator full in the face slowly pushed back his chair and carrying his provisions with him toddled off to the other end of the room When he reached a spot where place was made for him he had hardly breath left to speak Well he said I never He sat a minute in silence shaking his head and continued to shake his head and look round upon his neighbours as he devoured his food Up stairs there was a very cosy party who came in by degrees Lady Penwether was there soon after ten with Miss Penge and some of the gentlemen including Morton who was the only man seen in that room in black Young Hampton who was intimate in the house made his way up there and Sir John Purefoy joined the party Sir John was a hunting man who lived in the county and was an old friend of the family Lady Purefoy hunted also and came in later Arabella was the last not from laziness but aware that in this way the effect might be the best Lord Rufford was in the room when she entered it and of course she addressed herself to him Which is it to be Lord Rufford Jack or Jemima Which ever you like I am quite indifferent If you ll put me on the mare I ll ride her or try Indeed you won t said Lady Augustus Mamma knows nothing about it Lord Rufford I believe I could do just as well as Major Caneback She never had a lady on her in her life said Sir John Then it s time for her to begin But at any rate I must have some breakfast first Then Lord Rufford brought her a cup of tea and Sir John gave her a cutlet and she felt herself to be happy She was quite content with her hat and though her habit was not exactly a hunting habit it fitted her well Morton had never before seen her in a riding dress and acknowledged that it became her He struggled to think of something special to say to her but there was nothing He was not at home on such an occasion His long trowsers weighed him down and his ordinary morning coat cowed him He knew in his heart that she thought nothing of him as he was now But she said a word to him with that usual smile of hers Of course mister Morton you are coming with us A little way perhaps You ll find that any horse from Stubbings can go said Lord Rufford I wish I could say as much of all mine Jack can go I hope Lord Rufford Lord Rufford nodded his head And I shall expect you to give me a lead To this he assented though it was perhaps more than he had intended But on such an occasion it is almost impossible to refuse such a request At half past eleven they were all out in the park and Tony was elate as a prince having been regaled with a tumbler of champagne But the great interest of the immediate moment were the frantic efforts made by Jemima to get rid of her rider Once or twice Sir John asked the Major to give it up but the Major swore that the mare was a good mare and only wanted riding She kicked and squealed and backed and went round the park with him at a full gallop In the park there was a rail with a ha ha ditch and the Major rode her at it in a gallop She went through the timber fell in the ditch and then was brought up again without giving the man a fall He at once put her back at the same fence and she took it almost in her stride without touching it Have her like a spaniel before the day s over said the Major who thoroughly enjoyed these little encounters Among the laurels at the bottom of the park a fox was found and then there was a great deal of riding about the grounds All this was much enjoyed by the ladies who were on foot and by the Senator who wandered about the place alone A gentleman s park is not always the happiest place for finding a fox The animal has usually many resources there and does not like to leave it And when he does go away it is not always easy to get after him But ladies in a carriage or on foot on such occasions have their turn of the sport On this occasion it was nearly one before the fox allowed himself to be killed and then he had hardly been outside the park palings There was a good deal of sherry drank before the party got away and hunting men such as Major Caneback began to think that the day was to be thrown away As they started off for Shugborough Springs the little covert on John Runce s farm which was about four miles from Rufford Hall Sir John asked the Major to get on another animal You ve had trouble enough with her for one day and given her enough to do But the Major was not of that way of thinking Let her have the day s work said the Major Do her good Remember what she s learned And so they trotted off to Shugborough While they were riding about the park Morton had kept near to Miss Trefoil Lord Rufford being on his own place and among his own coverts had had cares on his hand and been unable to devote himself to the young lady She had never for a moment looked up at her lover or tried to escape from him She had answered all his questions saying however very little and had bided her time The more gracious she was to Morton now the less ground would he have for complaining of her when she should leave him by and by As they were trotting along the road Lord Rufford came up and apologized I m afraid I ve been very inattentive Miss Trefoil but I dare say you ve been in better hands There hasn t been much to do has there Very little I suppose a man isn t responsible for having foxes that won t break Did you see the Senator He seemed to think it was all right Did you hear of John Runce Then he told the story of John Runce which had been told to him What a fine old fellow I should forgive him his rent He is much better able to pay me double Your Senator mister Morton is a very peculiar man He is peculiar said Morton and I am sorry to say can make himself very disagreeable We might as well trot on as Shugborough is a small place and a fox always goes away from it at once John Runce knows how to train them better than I do Then they made their way on through the straggling horses and John Morton not wishing to seem to be afraid of his rival remained alone I wish Caneback had left that mare behind said the lord as they went It isn t the country for her and she is going very nastily with him Are you fond of hunting Miss Trefoil Very fond of it said Arabella who had been out two or three times in her life I like a girl to ride to hounds said his lordship I don t think she ever looks so well Then Arabella determined that come what might she would ride to hounds At Shugborough Springs a fox was found before half the field was up and he broke almost as soon as he was found Follow me through the handgates said the lord and from the third field out it s fair riding Let him have his head and remember he hangs a moment as he comes to his fence You won t be left behind unless there s something out of the way to stop us Arabella s heart was in her mouth but she was quite resolved Where he went she would follow As for being left behind she would not care the least for that if he were left behind with her They got well away having to pause a moment while the hounds came up to Tony s horn out of the wood Then there was plain sailing and there were very few before them He s one of the old sort my lord said Tony as he pressed on speaking of the fox Not too near me and you ll go like a bird said his lordship He s a nice little horse isn t he When I m going to be married he ll be the first present I shall make her He d tempt almost any girl said Arabella It was wonderful how well she went knowing so little about it as she did The horse was one easily ridden and on plain ground she knew what she was about in a saddle At any rate she did not disgrace herself and when they had already run some three or four miles Lord Rufford had nearly the best of it and she had kept with him You don t know where you are I suppose he said when they came to a check And I don t in the least care if they d only go on said she eagerly We re back at Rufford Park We ve left the road nearly a mile to our left but there we are Those trees are the park But must we stop there That s as the fox may choose to behave We shan t stop unless he does Then young Hampton came up declaring that there was the very mischief going on between Major Caneback and Jemima According to Hampton s account the Major had been down three or four times but was determined to break either the mare s neck or her spirit He had been considerably hurt so Hampton said in one shoulder but had insisted on riding on That s the worst of him said Lord Rufford He never knows when to give up Then the hounds were again on the scent and were running very fast towards the park That s a nasty ditch before us said the Lord Come down a little to the left The hounds are heading that way and there s a gate Young Hampton in the meantime was going straight for the fence I m not afraid said Arabella Very well Give him his head and he ll do it Just at that moment there was a noise behind them and the Major on Jemima rushed up She was covered with foam and he with dirt and her sides were sliced with the spur His hat was crushed and he was riding almost altogether with his right hand He came close to Arabella and she could see the rage in his face as the animal rushed on with her head almost between her knees He ll have another fall there said Lord Rufford Hampton who had passed them was the first over the fence and the other three all took it abreast The Major was to the right the lord to the left and the girl between them The mare s head was perhaps the first She rushed at the fence made no leap at all and of course went headlong into the ditch The Major still stuck to her though two or three voices implored him to get off He afterwards declared that he had not strength to lift himself out of the saddle The mare lay for a moment then blundered out rolled over him jumped on to her feet and lunging out kicked her rider on the head as he was rising Then she went away and afterwards jumped the palings into Rufford Park That evening she was shot The man when kicked had fallen back close under the feet of Miss Trefoil s horse She screamed and half fainting fell also but fell without hurting herself Lord Rufford of course stopped as did also mister Hampton and one of the whips with several others in the course of a minute or two The Major was senseless but they who understood what they were looking at were afraid that the case was very bad He was picked up and put on a door and within half an hour was on his bed in Rufford Hall But he did not speak for some hours and before six o clock that evening the doctor from Rufford had declared that he had mounted his last horse and ridden his last hunt Oh Lord Rufford said Arabella I shall never recover that I heard the horse s feet against his head Lord Rufford shuddered and put his hand round her waist to support her At that time they were standing on the ground Don t mind me if you can do any good to him But there was nothing that Lord Rufford could do as four men were carrying the Major on a shutter So he and Arabella returned together and when she got off her horse she was only able to throw herself into his arms CHAPTER XXIII POOR CANEBACK A closer intimacy will occasionally be created by some accident some fortuitous circumstance than weeks of ordinary intercourse will produce Walk down Bond Street in a hailstorm of peculiar severity and you may make a friend of the first person you meet whereas you would be held to have committed an affront were you to speak to the same person in the same place on a fine day You shall travel smoothly to York with a lady and she will look as though she would call the guard at once were you so much as to suggest that it were a fine day but if you are lucky enough to break a wheel before you get to Darlington she will have told you all her history and shared your sherry by the time you have reached that town Arabella was very much shocked by the dreadful accident she had seen Her nerves had suffered though it may be doubted whether her heart had been affected much But she was quite conscious when she reached her room that the poor Major s misfortune happening as it had done just beneath her horse s feet had been a godsend to her For a moment the young lord s arm had been round her waist and her head had been upon his shoulder And again when she had slipped from her saddle she had felt his embrace His fervour to her had been simply the uncontrolled expression of his feeling at the moment as one man squeezes another tightly by the hand in any crisis of sudden impulse She knew this but she knew also that he would probably revert to the intimacy which the sudden emotion had created The mutual galvanic shock might be continued at the next meeting and so on They had seen the tragedy together and it would not fail to be a bond of union As she told the tragedy to her mother she delicately laid aside her hat and whip and riding dress and then asked whether it was not possible that they might prolong their stay at Rufford But the Gores my dear I put them off you know for two days only Then Arabella declared that she did not care a straw for the Gores In such a matter as this what would it signify though they should quarrel with a whole generation of Gores For some time she thought that she would not come down again that afternoon or even that evening It might well be that the sight of the accident should have made her too ill to appear She felt conscious that in that moment and in the subsequent half hour she had carried herself well and that there would be an interest about her were she to own herself compelled to keep her room Were she now to take to her bed they could not turn her out on the following day But at last her mother s counsel put an end to that plan Time was too precious I think you might lose more than you d gain said her mother Both Lord Rufford and his sister were very much disturbed as to what they should do on the occasion At half past six Lord Rufford was told that the Major had recovered his senses but that the case was almost hopeless Of course he saw his guest I m all right said the Major The Lord sat there by the bedside holding the man s hand for a few moments and then got up to leave him No nonsense about putting off said the Major in a faint voice beastly bosh all that But what was to be done The dozen people who were in the house must of course sit down to dinner And then all the neighbourhood for miles round were coming to a ball It would be impossible to send messages to everybody And there was the feeling too that the man was as yet only ill and that his recovery was possible A ball with a dead man in one of the bedrooms would be dreadful With a dying man it was bad enough but then a dying man is always also a living man Lord Rufford had already telegraphed for a first class surgeon from London it having been whispered to him that perhaps Old Nokes from Rufford might be mistaken The surgeon could not be there till four o clock in the morning by which time care would have been taken to remove the signs of the ball but if there was reason to send for a London surgeon then also was there reason for hope and if there were ground for hope then the desirability of putting off the ball was very much reduced He s at the furthest end of the corridor the Lord said to his sister and won t hear a sound of the music Though the man were to die why shouldn t the people dance Had the Major been dying three or four miles off at the hotel at Rufford there would only have been a few sad looks a few shakings of the head and the people would have danced without any flaw in their gaiety Had it been known at Rufford Hall that he was lying at that moment in his mortal agony at Aberdeen an exclamation or two Poor Caneback poor Major would have been the extent of the wailing and not the pressure of a lover s hand would have been lightened or the note of a fiddle delayed And nobody in that house really cared much for Caneback He was not a man worthy of much care He was possessed of infinite pluck and now that he was dying could bear it well But he had loved no one particularly had been dear to no one in these latter days of his life had been of very little use in the world and had done very little more for society than any other horse trainer But nevertheless it is a bore when a gentleman dies in your house and a worse bore if he dies from an accident than from an illness for which his own body may be supposed to be responsible Though the gout should fly to a man s stomach in your best bedroom the idea never strikes you that your burgundy has done it But here the mare had done the mischief Poor Caneback and poor Lord Rufford The Major was quite certain that it was all over with himself He had broken so many of his bones and had his head so often cracked that he understood his own anatomy pretty well There he lay quiet and composed sipping small modicums of brandy and water and taking his outlook into such transtygian world as he had fashioned for himself in his dull imagination If he had misgivings he showed them to no bystander If he thought then that he might have done better with his energies than devote them to dangerous horses he never said so His voice was weak but it never quailed and the only regret he expressed was that he had not changed the bit in Jemima s mouth Lord Rufford s position was made worse by an expression from Sir John Purefoy that the party ought to be put off Sir John was in a measure responsible for what his mare had done and was in a wretched state If it could possibly affect the poor fellow I would do it said Lord Rufford but it would create very great inconvenience and disappointment I have to think of other people Then I shall send my wife home said Sir John And Lady Purefoy was sent home Sir John himself of course could not leave the house while the man was alive Before they all sat down to dinner the Major was declared to be a little stronger That settled the question and the ball was not put off The ladies came down to dinner in a melancholy guise They were not fully dressed for the evening and were of course inclined to be silent and sad Before Lord Rufford came in Arabella managed to get herself on to the sofa next to Lady Penwether and then to undergo some little hysterical manifestation Oh Lady Penwether if you had seen it and heard it I am very glad that I was spared anything so horrible And the man s face as he passed me going to the leap It will haunt me to my dying day Then she shivered and gurgled in her throat and turning suddenly round hid her face on the elbow of the couch I ve been afraid all the afternoon that she would be ill whispered Lady Augustus to Miss Penge She is so susceptible When Lord Rufford came into the room Arabella at once got up and accosted him with a whisper Either he took her or she took him into a distant part of the room where they conversed apart for five minutes And he as he told her how things were going and what was being done bent over her and whispered also What good would it do you know she said with affected intimacy as he spoke of his difficulty about the ball One would do anything if one could be of service but that would do nothing She felt completely that her presence at the accident had given her a right to have peculiar conversations and to be consulted about everything Of course she was very sorry for Major Caneback But as it had been ordained that Major Caneback was to have his head split in two by a kick from a horse and that Lord Rufford was to be there to see it how great had been the blessing which had brought her to the spot at the same time Everybody there saw the intimacy and most of them understood the way in which it was being used That girl is very clever Rufford his sister whispered to him before dinner She is very much excited rather than clever just at present he answered upon which Lady Penwether shook her head Miss Penge whispered to Miss Godolphin that Miss Trefoil was making the most of it and mister Morton who had come into the room while the conversation apart was going on had certainly been of the same opinion She had seated herself in an arm chair away from the others after that conversation was over and as she sat there Morton came up to her He had been so little intimate with the members of the party assembled and had found himself so much alone that he had only lately heard the story about Major Caneback and had now only heard it imperfectly But he did see that an absolute intimacy had been effected where two days before there had only been a slight acquaintance and he believed that this sudden rush had been in some way due to the accident of which he had been told You know what has happened he said Oh mister Morton do not talk to me about it Were you not speaking of it to Lord Rufford Of course I was We were together Did you see it Then she shuddered put her handkerchief up to her eyes and turned her face away And yet the ball is to go on he asked Pray pray do not dwell on it unless you wish to force me back to my room When I left it I felt that I was attempting to do too much This might have been all very well had she not been so manifestly able to talk to Lord Rufford on the same subject If there is any young man to whom a girl should be able to speak when she is in a state of violent emotion it is the young man to whom she is engaged So at least thought mister John Morton Then dinner was announced and the dinner certainly was sombre enough A dinner before a ball in the country never is very much of a dinner The ladies know that there is work before them and keep themselves for the greater occasion Lady Purefoy had gone and Lady Penwether was not very happy in the prospects for the evening Neither Miss Penge nor either of the two Miss Godolphins had entertained personal hopes in regard to Lord Rufford but nevertheless they took badly the great favour shown to Arabella Lady Augustus did not get on particularly well with any of the other ladies and there seemed during the dinner to be an air of unhappiness over them all They retired as soon as it was possible and then Arabella at once went up to her bedroom mister Nokes says he is a little stronger my Lord said the butler coming into the room mister Nokes had gone home and had returned again He might pull through yet said mister Hampton Lord Rufford shook his head Then mister Gotobed told a wonderful story of an American who had had his brains knocked almost out of his head and had sat in Congress afterwards He was the finest horseman I ever saw on a horse said Hampton A little too much temper said Captain Battersby who was a very old friend of the Major I d give a good deal that that mare had never been brought to my stables said Lord Rufford Purefoy will never get over it and I shan t forget it in a hurry Sir John at this time was up stairs with the sufferer Even while drinking their wine they could not keep themselves from the subject and were convivial in a cadaverous fashion CHAPTER XXIV THE BALL The people came of course but not in such numbers as had been expected Many of those in Rufford had heard of the accident and having been made acquainted with Nokes s report stayed away Everybody was told that supper would be on the table at twelve and that it was generally understood that the house was to be cleared by two Nokes seemed to think that the sufferer would live at least till the morrow and it was ascertained to a certainty that the music could not affect him It was agreed among the party in the house that the ladies staying there should stand up for the first dance or two as otherwise the strangers would be discouraged and the whole thing would be a failure This request was made by Lady Penwether because Miss Penge had said that she thought it impossible for her to dance Poor Miss Penge who was generally regarded as a brilliant young woman had been a good deal eclipsed by Arabella and had seen the necessity of striking out some line for herself Then Arabella had whispered a few words to Lord Rufford and the lord had whispered a few words to his sister and Lady Penwether had explained what was to be done to the ladies around Lady Augustus nodded her head and said that it was all right The other ladies of course agreed and partners were selected within the house party Lord Rufford stood up with Arabella and John Morton with Lady Penwether mister Gotobed selected Miss Penge and Hampton and Battersby the two Miss Godolphins They all took their places with a lugubrious but business like air as aware that they were sacrificing themselves in the performance of a sad duty But Morton was not allowed to dance in the same quadrille with the lady of his affections Lady Penwether explained to him that she and her brother had better divide themselves for the good of the company generally and therefore he and Arabella were also divided A rumour had reached Lady Penwether of the truth in regard to their guests from Bragton mister Gotobed had whispered to her that he had understood that they certainly were engaged and even before that the names of the two lovers had been wafted to her ears from the other side of the Atlantic Both John Morton and Lady Augustus were somebodies and Lady Penwether generally knew what there was to be known of anybody who was anybody But it was quite clear to her more so even than to poor John Morton that the lady was conducting herself now as though she were fettered by no bonds and it seemed to Lady Penwether also that the lady was very anxious to contract other bonds She knew her brother well He was always in love with somebody but as he had hitherto failed of success where marriage was desirable so had he avoided disaster when it was not He was one of those men who are generally supposed to be averse to matrimony Lady Penwether and some other relatives were anxious that he should take a wife but his sister was by no means anxious that he should take such a one as Arabella Trefoil Therefore she thought that she might judiciously ask mister Morton a few questions I believe you knew the Trefoils in Washington she said Morton acknowledged that he had seen much of them there She is very handsome certainly I think so And rides well I suppose I don t know I never heard much of her riding Has she been staying long at Bragton Just a week Do you know Lord Augustus Morton said that he did not know Lord Augustus and then answered sundry other questions of the same nature in the same uncommunicative way Though he had once or twice almost fancied that he would like to proclaim aloud that the girl was engaged to him yet he did not like to have the fact pumped out of him And if she were such a girl as she now appeared to be might it not be better for him to let her go Surely her conduct here at Rufford Hall was opportunity enough No doubt she was handsome No doubt he loved her after his fashion of loving But to lose her now would not break his heart whereas to lose her after he was married to her would he knew well bring him to the very ground He would ask her a question or two this very night and then come to some resolution With such thoughts as these crossing his mind he certainly was not going to proclaim his engagement to Lady Penwether But Lady Penwether was a determined woman Her smile when she condescended to smile was very sweet lighting up her whole face and flattering for the moment the person on whom it shone It was as though a rose in emitting its perfume could confine itself to the nostrils of its one favoured friend And now she smiled on Morton as she asked another question I did hear she said from one of your Foreign Office young men that you and Miss Trefoil were very intimate Who was that Lady Penwether Of course I shall mention no name You might call out the poor lad and shoot him or worse still have him put down to the bottom of his class But I did hear it And then when I find her staying with her mother at your house of course I believe it to be true Now she is staying at your brother s house which is much the same thing But I am here And my grandmother is at Bragton That puts me in mind mister Morton I am so sorry that we did not know it so that we might have asked her She never goes out anywhere Lady Penwether And there is nothing then in the report that I heard Morton paused a moment before he answered and during that moment collected his diplomatic resources He was not a weak man who could be made to tell anything by the wiles of a pretty woman I think he said that when people have anything of that kind which they wish to be known they declare it I beg your pardon I did not mean to unravel a secret There are secrets Lady Penwether which people do like to unravel but which the owners of them sometimes won t abandon Then there was nothing more said on the subject Lady Penwether did not smile again and left him to go about the room on her business as hostess as soon as the dance was over But she was sure that they were engaged In the meantime the conversation between Lord Rufford and Arabella was very different in its tone though on the same subject He was certainly very much struck with her not probably ever waiting to declare to himself that she was the most beautiful woman he had ever seen in his life but still feeling towards her an attraction which for the time was strong A very clever girl would frighten him a very horsey girl would disgust him a very quiet girl would bore him or a very noisy girl annoy him With a shy girl he could never be at his ease not enjoying the labour of overcoming such a barrier and yet he liked to be able to feel that any female intimacy which he admitted was due to his own choice and not to that of the young woman Arabella Trefoil was not very clever but she had given all her mind to this peculiar phase of life and to use a common phrase knew what she was about She was quite alive to the fact that different men require different manners in a young woman and as she had adapted herself to mister Morton at Washington so could she at Rufford adapt herself to Lord Rufford At the present moment the lord was in love with her as much as he was wont to be in love Doesn t it seem an immense time since we came here yesterday she said to him There has been so much done There has been a great misfortune I suppose that is it Only for that how very very pleasant it would have been Yes indeed It was a nice run and that little horse carried you charmingly I wish I could see you ride him again She shook her head as she looked up into his face Why do you shake your head Because I am afraid there is no possible chance of such happiness We are going to such a dull house to morrow And then to so many dull houses afterwards I don t know why you shouldn t come back and have another day or two when all this sadness has gone by Don t talk about it Lord Rufford Why not I never like to talk about any pleasure because it always vanishes as soon as it has come and when it has been real pleasure it never comes back again I don t think I ever enjoyed anything so much as our ride this morning till that tragedy came Poor Caneback I suppose there is no hope He shook his head And we must go on to those Gores to morrow without knowing anything about it I wonder whether you could send me a line Of course I can and I will Then he asked her a question looking into her face You are not going back to Bragton Oh dear no Was Bragton dull Awfully dull frightfully dull You know what they say What who say Lord Rufford People say anything the more ill natured the better they like it I think Have you not heard what they say about you and mister Morton Just because mamma made a promise when in Washington to go to Bragton with that mister Gotobed Don t you find they marry you to everybody They have married me to a good many people Perhaps they ll marry me to you to morrow That would not be so bad Oh Lord Rufford Nobody has ever condemned you to anything so terrible as that There was no truth in it then Miss Trefoil None at all Lord Rufford Only I don t know why you should ask me Well I don t know A man likes sometimes to be sure how the land lies mister Morton looks so cross that I thought that perhaps the very fact of my dancing with you might be an offence Is he cross You know him better than I do Perhaps it s his nature Now I must do one other dance with a native and then my work will be over That isn t very civil Lord Rufford If you do not know what I meant you re not the girl I take you to be Then as she walked with him back out of the ball room into the drawing room she assured him that she did know what he meant and that therefore she was the girl he took her to be She had determined that she would not dance again and had resolved to herd with the other ladies of the house waiting for any opportunity that chance might give her for having a last word with Lord Rufford before they parted for the night when Morton came up to her and demanded rather than asked that she would stand up with him for a quadrille We settled it all among ourselves you know she said We were to dance only once just to set the people off He still persisted but she still refused alleging that she was bound by the general compact and though he was very urgent she would not yield I wonder how you can ask me she said You don t suppose that after what has occurred I can have any pleasure in dancing Upon this he asked her to take a turn with him through the rooms and to that she found herself compelled to assent Then he spoke out to her Arabella he said I am not quite content with what has been going on since we came to this house I am sorry for that Nor indeed have I been made very happy by all that has occurred since your mother and you did me the honour of coming to Bragton I must acknowledge you haven t seemed to be very happy mister Morton I don t want to distress you and as far as possible I wish to avoid distressing myself If it is your wish that our engagement should be over I will endeavour to bear it If it is to be continued I expect that your manner to me should be altered What am I to say Say what you feel I feel that I can t alter my manner as you call it You do wish the engagement to be over then I did not say so The truth is mister Morton that there is some trouble about the lawyers Why do you always call me mister Morton Because I am aware how probable it is that all this may come to nothing I can t walk out of the house and marry you as the cookmaid does the gardener I ve got to wait till I m told that everything is settled and at present I m told that things are not settled because you won t agree I ll leave it to anybody to say whether I ve been unreasonable I won t go into that I haven t meddled with it and I don t know anything about it But until it is all settled as a matter of course there must be some little distance between us It s the commonest thing in the world I should say What is to be the end of it I do not know If you think yourself injured you can back out of it at once I ve nothing more to say about it And you think I can like the way you re going on here If you re jealous mister Morton there s an end of it I tell you fairly once for all that as long as I m a single woman I will regulate my conduct as I please You can do the same and I shall not say a word to you Then she withdrew her arm from him and leaving him walked across the room and joined her mother He went off at once to his own room resolving that he would write to her from Bragton He had made his propositions in regard to money which he was quite aware were as liberal as was fit If she would now fix a day for their marriage he would be a happy man If she would not bring herself to do this then he would have no alternative but to regard their engagement as at an end At two o clock the guests were nearly all gone The Major was alive and likely to live at least for some hours and the Rufford people generally were glad that they had not put off the ball Some of them who were staying in the house had already gone to bed and Lady Penwether with Miss Penge at her side was making her last adieux in the drawing room The ball room was reached from the drawing room with a vestibule between them and opening from this was a small chamber prettily furnished but seldom used which had no peculiar purpose of its own but in which during the present evening many sweet words had probably been spoken Now at this last moment Lord Rufford and Arabella Trefoil were there alone together She had just got up from a sofa and he had taken her hand in his She did not attempt to withdraw it but stood looking down upon the ground Then he passed his arm round her waist and lifting her face to his held her in a close embrace from which she made no effort to free herself As soon as she was released she hastened to the door which was all but closed and as she opened it and passed through to the drawing room said some ordinary word to him quite aloud in her ordinary voice If his action had disturbed her she knew very well how to recover her equanimity CHAPTER XXV THE LAST MORNING AT RUFFORD HALL Well my love said Lady Augustus as soon as her daughter had joined her in her bedroom On such occasions there was always a quarter of an hour before going to bed in which the mother and daughter discussed their affairs while the two lady s maids were discussing their affairs in the other room The two maids probably did not often quarrel but the mother and daughter usually did I wish that stupid man hadn t got himself hurt Of course my dear we all wish that But I really don t see that it has stood much in your way Yes it has After all there is nothing like dancing and we shouldn t all have been sent to bed at two o clock Then it has come to nothing I didn t say that at all mamma I think I have done uncommonly well Indeed I know I have But then if everything had not been upset I might have done so much better What have you done asked Lady Augustus timidly She knew perfectly well that her daughter would tell her nothing and yet she always asked these questions and was always angry when no information was given to her Any young woman would have found it very hard to give the information needed When we were alone he sat for five minutes with his arm round my waist and then he kissed me He didn t say much but then I knew perfectly well that he would be on his guard not to commit himself by words But I ve got him to promise that he ll write to me and of course I ll answer in such a way that he must write again I know he ll want to see me and I think I can go very near doing it But he s an old stager and knows what he s about and of course there ll be ever so many people to tell him I m not the sort of girl he ought to marry He ll hear about Colonel de B and Sir C D and Lord E F and there are ever so many chances against me But I ve made up my mind to try it It s taking the long odds I can hardly expect to win but if I do pull it off I m made for ever A daughter can hardly say all that to her mother Even Arabella Trefoil could not say it to her mother or at any rate she would not What a question that is to ask mamma she did say tossing her head Well my dear unless you tell me something how can I help you I don t know that I want you to help me at any rate not in that way In what way Oh mamma you are so odd Has he said anything Yes he has He said he liked dry champagne and that he never ate supper If you won t tell me how things are going you may fight your own battles by yourself That s just what I must do Nobody else can fight my battles for me What are you going to do about mister Morton Nothing I saw him talking to you and looking as black as thunder He always looks as black as thunder Is that to be all off I insist upon having an answer to that question I believe you fancy mamma that a lot of men can be played like a parcel of chessmen and that as soon as a knight is knocked on the head you can take him up and put him into the box and have done with him You haven t done with mister Morton then Poor mister Morton I do feel he is badly used because he is so honest I sometimes wish that I could afford to be honest too and to tell somebody the downright truth I should like to tell him the truth and I almost think I will My dear fellow I did for a time think I couldn t do better and I m not at all sure now that I can But then you are so very dull and I m not certain that I should care to be Queen of the English society at the Court of the Emperor of Morocco But if you ll wait for another six months I shall be able to tell you That s what I should have to say to him Who is talking nonsense now Arabella I am not But I shan t say it And now mamma I ll tell you what we must do You must tell me why also I can do nothing of the kind He knows the Duke The Duke with the Trefoils always meant the Duke of Mayfair who was Arabella s ducal uncle Intimately Well enough to go there There is to be a great shooting at Mistletoe Mistletoe was the duke s place in January I got that from him and he can go if he likes He won t go as it is but if I tell him I m to be there I think he will What did you tell him Well I told him a tarradiddle of course I made him understand that I could be there if I pleased and he thinks that I mean to be there if he goes But I m sure the Duchess won t have me again She might let me come And what am I to do You could go to Brighton with Miss De Groat or what does it matter for a fortnight You ll get the advantage when it s done It s as well to have the truth out at once mamma I cannot carry on if I m always to be stuck close to your apron strings There are so many people won t have you Arabella I do think you are the most ungrateful hard hearted creature that ever lived Very well I don t know what I have to be grateful about and I need to be hard hearted Of course I am hard hearted The thing will be to get papa to see his brother Your papa Yes that s what I mean to try The Duke of course would like me to marry Lord Rufford Do you think that if I were at home here it wouldn t make Mistletoe a very different sort of place for you The Duke does like papa in a sort of way and he s civil enough to me when I m there He never did like you Everybody is so fond of you It was what you did when young Stranorlar was there which made the Duchess almost turn us out of the house What s the good of your saying that mamma If you go on like that I ll separate myself from you and throw myself on papa Your father wouldn t lift his little finger for you I ll try at any rate Will you consent to my going there without you if I can manage it What did Lord Rufford say Arabella here made a grimace You can tell me something What are the lawyers to say to mister Morton s people Whatever they like If they come to arrangements do you mean to marry him Not for the next two months certainly I shan t see him again now heaven knows when He ll write no doubt one of his awfully sensible letters and I shall take my time about answering him I can stretch it out for two months If I m to do any good with this man it will be all arranged before that time If the Duke could really be made to believe that Lord Rufford was in earnest I m sure he d have me there As to her she always does what he tells her He is going to write to you I told you that before mamma What is the good of asking a lot of questions You know now what my plan is and if you won t help me I must carry it out alone And remember I don t want to start to morrow till after Morton and that American have gone Then without a kiss or wishing her mother good night she went off to her own room The next morning at about nine Arabella heard from her maid that the Major was still alive but senseless The London surgeon had been there and had declared it to be possible that the patient should live but barely possible At ten they were all at breakfast and the carriage from Bragton was already at the door to take back mister Morton and his American friend Lady Augustus had been clever enough to arrange that she should have the phaeton to take her to the Rufford Station a little later on in the day and had already hinted to one of the servants that perhaps a cart might be sent with the luggage The cart was forthcoming Lady Augustus was very clever in arranging her locomotion and seldom paid for much more than her railway tickets I had meant to say a few words to you my lord about that man Goarly said the Senator standing before the fire in the breakfast room but this sad catastrophe has stopped me There isn t much to say about him mister Gotobed Perhaps not only I would not wish you to think that I would oppose you without some cause If the man is in the wrong according to law let him be proved to be so The cost to you will be nothing To him it might be of considerable importance Just so Won t you sit down and have some breakfast If Goarly ever makes himself nuisance enough it may be worth my while to buy him out at three times the value of his land But he ll have to be a very great nuisance before I shall do that Dillsborough wood is not the only fox covert in the county After that there was no more said about it but neither did Lord Rufford understand the Senator nor did the Senator understand Lord Rufford John Runce had a clearer conviction on his mind than either of them Goarly ought to be hanged and no American should under any circumstances be allowed to put his foot upon British soil That was Runce s idea of the matter The parting between Morton and the Trefoils was very chill and uncomfortable Good bye mister Morton we had such a pleasant time at Bragton said Lady Augustus I shall write to you this afternoon he whispered to Arabella as he took her hand She smiled and murmured a word of adieu but made him no reply Then they were gone and as he got into the carriage he told himself that in all probability he would never see her again It might be that he would curtail his leave of absence and get back to Washington as quickly as possible The Trefoils did not start for an hour after this during which Arabella could hardly find an opportunity for a word in private She could not quite appeal to him to walk with her in the grounds or even to take a turn with her round the empty ball room She came down dressed for walking thinking that so she might have the best chance of getting him for a quarter of an hour to herself but he was either too wary or else the habits of his life prevented it And in what she had to do it was so easy to go beyond the proper line She would wish him to understand that she would like to be alone with him after what had passed between them on the previous evening but she must be careful not to let him imagine that she was too anxious And then whatever she did she had to do with so many eyes upon her And when she went as she would do now in so short a time so many hostile tongues would attack her He had everything to protect him and she had nothing absolutely nothing to help her It was thus that she looked at it and yet she had courage for the battle Almost at the last moment she did get a word with him in the hall How is he Oh better decidedly I am so glad If I could only think that he could live Well my Lord we have to say good bye I suppose so You ll write me a line about him Certainly I shall be so glad to have a line from Rufford Maddox Hall you know Stafford I will remember And dear old Jack Tell me when you write what Jack has been doing Then she put out her hand and he held it I wonder whether you will ever remember But she did not quite know what to bid him remember and therefore turned away her face and wiped away a tear and then smiled as she turned her back on him The carriage was at the door and the ladies flocked into the hall and then not another word could be said That s what I call a really nice country house said Lady Augustus as she was driven away Arabella sat back in the phaeton lost in thought and said nothing Everything so well done and yet none of all that fuss that there is at Mistletoe She paused but still her daughter did not speak If I were beginning the world again I would not wish for a better establishment than that Why can t you answer me a word when I speak to you Of course it s all very nice What s the good of going on in that way What a shame it is that a man like that should have so much and that a girl like me should have nothing at all I know twice as much as he does and am twice as clever and yet I ve got to treat him as though he were a god He s all very well but what would anybody think of him if he were a younger brother with Lthree hundred a year This was a kind of philosophy which Lady Augustus hated She threw herself back therefore in the phaeton and pretended to go to sleep The wheels were not out of sight of the house before the attack on the Trefoils began I had heard of Lady Augustus before said Lady Penwether but I didn t think that any woman could be so disagreeable So vulgar said Miss Penge Wasn t she the daughter of an ironmonger asked the elder Miss Godolphin The girl of course is handsome said Lady Penwether But so self sufficient said Miss Godolphin And almost as vulgar as her mother said Miss Penge She may be clever said Lady Penwether but I do not think I should ever like her She is one of those girls whom only gentlemen like said Miss Penge And whom they don t like very long said Lady Penwether How well I understand all this said Lord Rufford turning to the younger Miss Godolphin It is all said for my benefit and considered to be necessary because I danced with the young lady last night I hope you are not attributing such a motive to me said Miss Penge Or to me said Miss Godolphin I look on both of you and Eleanor as all one on the present occasion I am considered to be falling over a precipice and she has got hold of my coat tails Of course you wouldn t be Christians if you didn t both of you seize a foot Looking at it in that light I certainly wish to be understood as holding on very fast said Miss Penge CHAPTER XXVI GIVE ME SIX MONTHS There was a great deal of trouble and some very genuine sorrow in the attorney s house at Dillsborough during the first week in December mister Masters had declared to his wife that Mary should go to Cheltenham and a letter was written to Lady Ushant accepting the invitation The Ltwenty too was forthcoming and the dress and the boots and the hat were bought But while this was going on missus Masters took care that there should be no comfort whatever around them and made every meal a separate curse to the unfortunate lawyer She told him ten times a day that she had been a mother to his daughter but declared that such a position was no longer possible to her as the girl had been taken altogether out of her hands To Mary she hardly spoke at all and made her thoroughly wish that Lady Ushant s kindness had been declined Mamma she said one day I had rather write now and tell her that I cannot come After all the money has been wasted I have only got things that I must have had very soon If you have got anything to say you had better talk to your father I know nothing about it You break my heart when you say that mamma You think nothing about breaking mine or that young man s who is behaving so well to you What makes me mad is to see you shilly shallying with him Mamma I haven t shilly shallied That s what I call it Why can t you speak him fair and tell him you ll have him and settle yourself down properly You ve got some idea into your silly head that what you call a gentleman will come after you Mamma that isn t fair Very well miss As your father takes your part of course you can say what you please to me I say it is so Mary knew very well what her mother meant and was safe at least from any allusion to Reginald Morton There was an idea prevalent in the house and not without some cause that mister Surtees the curate had looked with an eye of favour on Mary Masters mister Surtees was certainly a gentleman but his income was strictly limited to the sum of Lone hundred twenty per annum which he received from mister Mainwaring Now missus Masters disliked clergymen disliked gentlemen and especially disliked poverty and therefore was not disposed to look upon mister Surtees as an eligible suitor for her stepdaughter But as the curate s courtship had hitherto been of the coldest kind and as it had received no encouragement from the young lady Mary was certainly justified in declaring that the allusion was not fair What I want to know is this are you prepared to marry Lawrence Twentyman To this question as Mary could not give a favourable answer she thought it best to make none at all There is a man as has got a house fit for any woman and means to keep it who can give a young woman everything that she ought to want and a handsome fellow too with some life in him one who really dotes on you as men don t often do on young women now as far as I can see I wonder what it is you would have I want nothing mamma Yes you do You have been reading books of poetry till you don t know what it is you do want You ve got your head full of claptraps and tantrums till you haven t a grain of sense belonging to you I hate such ways It s a spurning of the gifts of Providence not to have such a man as Lawrence Twentyman when he comes in your way Who are you I wonder that you shouldn t be contented with such as him He ll go and take some one else and then you ll be fit to break your heart fretting after him and I shan t pity you a bit It ll serve you right and you ll die an old maid and what there will be for you to live upon God in

none	none	You re breaking your father s heart as it is Then she sat down in a rocking chair and throwing her apron over her eyes gave herself up to a deluge of hysterical tears This was very hard upon Mary for though she did not believe all the horrible things which her stepmother said to her she did believe some of them She was not afraid of the fate of an old maid which was threatened but she did think that her marriage with this man would be for the benefit of the family and a great relief to her father And she knew too that he was respectable and believed him to be thoroughly earnest in his love For such love as that it is impossible that a girl should not be grateful There was nothing to allure him nothing to tempt him to such a marriage but a simple appreciation of her personal merits And in life he was at any rate her equal She had told Reginald Morton that Larry Twentyman was a fit companion for her and for her sisters and she owned as much to herself every day When she acknowledged all this she was tempted to ask herself whether she ought not to accept the man if not for her own sake at least for that of the family That same evening her father called her into the office after the clerks were gone and spoke to her thus Your mamma is very unhappy my dear he said I m afraid I have made everybody unhappy by wanting to go to Cheltenham It is not only that That is reasonable enough and you ought to go Mamma would say nothing more about that if you would make up your mind to one thing What thing papa Of course she knew very well what the thing was It is time for you to think of settling in life Mary I never would put it into a girl s head that she ought to worry herself about getting a husband unless the opportunity seemed to come in her way Young women should be quiet and wait till they re sought after But here is a young man seeking you whom we all like and approve A good house is a very good thing when it s fairly come by Yes papa And so is a full house A girl shouldn t run after money but plenty is a great comfort in this world when it can be had without blushing for Yes papa And so is an honest man s love I don t like to see any girl wearying after some fellow to be always fal lalling with her A good girl will be able to be happy and contented without that But a lone life is a poor life and a good husband is about the best blessing that a young woman can have To this proposition Mary perhaps agreed in her own mind but she gave no spoken assent Now this young man that is wanting to marry you has got all these things and as far as I can judge with my experience in the world is as likely to make a good husband as any one I know He paused for an answer but Mary could only lean close upon his arm and be silent Have you anything to say about it my dear You see it has been going on now a long time and of course he ll look to have it decided But still she could say nothing Well now he has been with me to day mister Twentyman Yes mister Twentyman He knows you re going to Cheltenham and of course he has nothing to say against that No young man such as he would be sorry that his sweetheart should be entertained by such a lady as Lady Ushant But he says that he wants to have an answer before you go I did answer him papa Yes you refused him But he hopes that perhaps you may think better of it He has been with me and I have told him that if he will come to morrow you will see him He is to be here after dinner and you had better just take him up stairs and hear what he has to say If you can make up your mind to like him you will please all your family But if you can t I won t quarrel with you my dear Oh papa you are always so good Of course I am anxious that you should have a home of your own but let it be how it may I will not quarrel with my child All that evening and almost all the night and again on the following morning Mary turned it over in her mind She was quite sure that she was not in love with Larry Twentyman but she was by no means sure that it might not be her duty to accept him without being in love with him Of course he must know the whole truth but she could tell him the truth and then leave it for him to decide What right had she to stand in the way of her friends or to be a burden to them when such a mode of life was offered to her She had nothing of her own and regarded herself as being a dead weight on the family And she was conscious in a certain degree of isolation in the household as being her father s only child by the first marriage She would hardly know how to look her father in the face and tell him that she had again refused the man But yet there was something awful to her in the idea of giving herself to a man without loving him in becoming a man s wife when she would fain remain away from him Would it be possible that she should live with him while her feelings were of such a nature And then she blushed as she lay in the dark with her cheek on her pillow when she found herself forced to inquire within her own heart whether she did not love some one else She would not own it and yet she blushed and yet she thought of it If there might be such a man it was not the young clergyman to whom her mother had alluded Through all that morning she was very quiet very pale and in truth very unhappy Her father said no further word to her and her stepmother had been implored to be equally reticent I shan t speak another word said missus Masters her fortune is in her own hands and if she don t choose to take it I ve done with her One man may lead a horse to water but a hundred can t make him drink It s just the same with an obstinate pig headed young woman At three o clock mister Twentyman came and was at once desired to go up to Mary who was waiting for him in the drawing room missus Masters smiled and was gracious as she spoke to him having for the moment wreathed herself in good humour so that he might go to his wooing in better spirit He had learned his lesson by heart as nearly as he was able and began to recite it as soon as he had closed the door So you re going to Cheltenham on Thursday he said Yes mister Twentyman I hope you ll enjoy your visit there I remember Lady Ushant myself very well I don t suppose she will remember me but you can give her my compliments I certainly will do that And now Mary what have you got to say to me He looked for a moment as though he expected she would say what she had to say at once without further question from him but he knew that it could not be so and he had prepared his lesson further than that I think you must believe that I really do love you with all my heart I know that you are very good to me mister Twentyman I don t say anything about being good but I m true that I am I d take you for my wife to morrow if you hadn t a friend in the world just for downright love I ve got you so in my heart Mary that I couldn t get rid of you if I tried ever so You must know that it s true I do know that it s true Well Don t you think that a fellow like that deserves something from a girl Indeed I do Well He deserves a great deal too much for any girl to deceive him You wouldn t like a young woman to marry you without loving you I think you deserve a great deal too well of me for that He paused a moment before he replied I don t know about that he said at last I believe I should be glad to take you just anyhow I don t think you can hate me Certainly not I like you as well mister Twentyman as one friend can like another without loving I ll be content with that Mary and chance it for the rest I ll be that kind to you that I ll make you love me before twelve months are over You come and try You shall be mistress of everything Mother isn t one that will want to be in the way It isn t that Larry she said She hadn t called him Larry for a long time and the sound of his own name from her lips gave him infinite hope Come and try Say you ll try If ever a man did his best to please a woman I ll do it to please you Then he attempted to take her in his arms but she glided away from him round the table I won t ask you not to go to Cheltenham or anything of that You shall have your own time By George you shall have everything your own way Still she did not answer him but stood looking down upon the table Come say a word to a fellow Then at last she spoke Give me six months to think of it Six months If you d say six weeks It is such a serious thing to do It is serious of course I m serious I know I shouldn t hunt above half as often as I do now and as for the club I don t suppose I should go near the place once a month Say six weeks and then if you ll let me have one kiss I ll not trouble you till you re back from Cheltenham Mary at once perceived that he had taken her doubt almost as a complete surrender and had again to become obdurate At last she promised to give him a final answer in two months but declared as she said so that she was afraid she could not bring herself to do as he desired She declined altogether to comply with that other request which he made and then left him in the room declaring that at present she could say nothing further As she did so she felt sure that she would not be able to accept him in two months time whatever she might bring herself to do when the vast abyss of six months should have passed by Larry made his way down into the parlour with hopes considerably raised There he found missus Masters and when he told her what had passed she assured him that the thing was as good as settled Everybody knew she said that when a girl doubted she meant to yield And what were two months The time would have nearly gone by the end of her visit to Cheltenham It was now early in December and they might be married and settled at home before the end of April missus Masters to give him courage took out a bottle of currant wine and drank his health and told him that in three months time she would give him a kiss and call him her son And she believed what she said This she thought was merely Mary s way of letting herself down without a sudden fall Then the attorney came in and also congratulated him When the attorney was told that Mary had taken two months for her decision he also felt that the matter was almost as good as settled This at any rate was clear to him that the existing misery of his household would for the present cease and that Mary would be allowed to go upon her visit without further opposition He at present did not think it wise to say another word to Mary about the young man nor would missus Masters condescend to do so Mary would of course now accept her lover like any other girl and had been such a fool so thought missus Masters that she had thoroughly deserved to lose him CHAPTER XXVII WONDERFUL BIRD There were but two days between the scenes described in the last chapter and the day fixed for Mary s departure and during these two days Larry Twentyman s name was not mentioned in the house missus Masters did not make herself quite pleasant to her stepdaughter having still some grudge against her as to the Ltwenty Nor though she had submitted to the visit to Cheltenham did she approve of it It wasn t the way she said to make such a girl as Mary like her life at Chowton Farm going and sitting and doing nothing in old Lady Ushant s drawing room It was cocking her up with gimcrack notions about ladies till she d be ashamed to look at her own hands after she had done a day s work with them There was no doubt some truth in this The woman understood the world and was able to measure Larry Twentyman and Lady Ushant and the rest of them Books and pretty needlework and easy conversation would consume the time at Cheltenham whereas at Chowton Farm there would be a dairy and a poultry yard under difficulties on account of the foxes with a prospect of baby linen and children s shoes and stockings It was all that question of gentlemen and ladies and of non gentlemen and non ladies They ought missus Masters thought to be kept distinct She had never she said wanted to put her finger into a pie that didn t belong to her She had never tried to be a grand lady But Mary was perilously near the brink on either side and as it was to be her lucky fate at last to sit down to a plentiful but work a day life at Chowton Farm she ought to have been kept away from the maundering idleness of Lady Ushant s lodgings at Cheltenham But Mary heard nothing of this during these two days missus Masters bestowing the load of her wisdom upon her unfortunate husband Reginald Morton had been twice over at missus Masters house with reference to the proposed journey missus Masters was hardly civil to him as he was supposed to be among the enemies but she had no suspicion that he himself was the enemy of enemies Had she entertained such an idea she might have reconciled herself to it as the man was able to support a wife and by such a marriage she would have been at once relieved from all further charge In her own mind she would have felt very strongly that Mary had chosen the wrong man and thrown herself into the inferior mode of life But her own difficulties in the matter would have been solved There was however no dream of such a kind entertained by any of the family Reginald Morton was hardly regarded as a young man and was supposed to be gloomy misanthropic and bookish missus Masters was not at all averse to the companionship for the journey and mister Masters was really grateful to one of the old family for being kind to his girl Nor must it be supposed that Mary herself had any expectations or even any hopes With juvenile aptness to make much of the little things which had interested her and prone to think more than was reasonable of any intercourse with a man who seemed to her to be so superior to others as Reginald Morton she was anxious for an opportunity to set herself right with him about that scene at the bridge She still thought that he was offended and that she had given him cause for offence He had condescended to make her a request to which she had acceded and she had then not done as she had promised She thought she was sure that this was all she had to say to him and yet she was aware that she was unnaturally excited at the idea of spending three or four hours alone with him The fly which was to take him to the railway station called for Mary at the attorney s door at ten o clock and the attorney handed her in It is very good of you indeed mister Morton to take so much trouble with my girl said the attorney really feeling what he said It is very good of you to trust her to me said Reginald also sincerely Mary was still to him the girl who had been brought up by his aunt at Bragton and not the fit companion for Larry Twentyman Reginald Morton had certainly not made up his mind to ask Mary Masters to be his wife Thinking of Mary Masters very often as he had done during the last two months he was quite sure that he did not mean to marry at all He did acknowledge to himself that were he to allow himself to fall in love with any one it would be with Mary Masters but for not doing so there were many reasons He had lived so long alone that a married life would not suit him as a married man he would be a poor man he himself was averse to company whereas most women prefer society And then as to this special girl had he not reason for supposing that she preferred another man to him and a man of such a class that the very preference showed her to be unfit to mate with him He also cozened himself with an idea that it was well that he should have the opportunity which the journey would give him of apologising for his previous rudeness to her In the carriage they had the compartment to themselves with the exception of an old lady at the further end who had a parrot in a cage for which she had taken a first class ticket I can t offer you this seat said the old lady because it has been booked and paid for for my bird As neither of the new passengers had shown the slightest wish for the seat the communication was perhaps unnecessary Neither of the two had any idea of separating from the other for the sake of the old lady s company They had before them a journey of thirty miles on one railway then a stop of half an hour at the Hinxton Junction and then another journey of about equal length In the first hour very little was said that might not have been said in the presence of Lady Ushant or even of missus Masters There might be a question whether upon the whole the parrot had not the best of the conversation as the bird which the old lady declared to be the wonder of his species repeated the last word of nearly every sentence spoken either by our friends or by the old lady herself Don t you think you d be less liable to cold with that window closed the old lady said to Mary Cosed cosed cosed said the bird and Morton was of course constrained to shut the window He is a wonderful bird said the old lady Wonderful bird wonderful bird wonderful bird said the parrot who was quite at home with this expression We shall be able to get some lunch at Hinxton said Reginald Inxton screamed the bird Caw caw caw He s worth a deal of money said the old lady Deal o money Deal o money repeated the bird as he scrambled round the wire cage with a tremendous noise to the great triumph of the old lady No doubt the close attention which the bird paid to everything that passed and the presence of the old lady as well did for a time interfere with their conversation But after awhile the old lady was asleep and the bird having once or twice attempted to imitate the somnolent sounds which his mistress was making seemed also to go to sleep himself Then Reginald beginning with Lady Ushant and the old Morton family generally gradually got the conversation round to Bragton and the little bridge He had been very stern when he had left her there and he knew also that at that subsequent interview when he had brought Lady Ushant s note to her at her father s house he had not been cordially kind to her Now they were thrown together for an hour or so in the closest companionship and he wished to make her comfortable and happy I suppose you remember Bragton he said Every path and almost every tree about the place So do I I called there the other day Family quarrels are so silly you know Did you see mister Morton No and he hasn t returned my visit yet I don t know whether he will and I don t much mind whether he does or not That old woman is there and she is very bitter against me I don t care about the people but I am sorry that I cannot see the place I ought to have walked with you that day she said in a very low tone The parrot opened his eyes and looked at them as though he were striving to catch his cue Of course you ought But as he said this he smiled and there was no offence in his voice I dare say you didn t guess how much I thought of it And then I was a bear to you I always am a bear when I am not pleased Peas peas peas said the parrot I shall be a bear to that brute of a bird before long What a very queer bird he is He is a public nuisance and so is the old lady who brought him here This was said quite in a whisper It is very odd Miss Masters but you are literally the only person in all Dillsborough in regard to whom I have any genuine feeling of old friendship You must remember a great many But I did not know any well enough I was too young to have seen much of your father But when I came back at that time you and I were always together Gedder gedder gedder said the parrot If that bird goes on like that I ll speak to the guard said mister Morton with affected anger Polly mustn t talk said the old lady waking up Tok tok tok tok screamed the parrot Then the old lady threw a shawl over him and again went to sleep If I behaved badly I beg your pardon said Mary That s just what I wanted to say to you Miss Masters only a man never can do those things as well as a lady I did behave badly and I do beg your pardon Of course I ought to have asked mister Twentyman to come with us I know that he is a very good fellow Indeed he is said Mary Masters with all the emphasis in her power Deedy is deedy is deedy is deedy is repeated the parrot in a very angry voice about a dozen times under his shawl and while the old lady was remonstrating with her too talkative companion their tickets were taken and they ran into the Hinxton Station If the old lady is going on to Cheltenham we ll travel third class before we ll sit in the same carriage again with that bird said Morton laughing as he took Mary into the refreshment room But the old lady did not get into the same compartment as they started and the last that was heard of the parrot at Hinxton was a quarrel between him and the guard as to certain railway privileges When they had got back into the railway carriage Morton was very anxious to ask whether she was in truth engaged to marry the young man as to whose good fellowship she and the parrot had spoken up so emphatically but he hardly knew how to put the question And were she to declare that she was engaged to him what should he say then Would he not be bound to congratulate her And yet it would be impossible that any word of such congratulation should pass his lips You will stay a month at Cheltenham he said Your aunt was kind enough to ask me for so long I shall go back on Saturday If I were to stay longer I should feel myself to be in her way And I have come to live a sort of hermit s life I hardly know how to sit down and eat my dinner in company and have no idea of seeing a human being before two o clock What do you do with yourself I rush in and out of the garden and spend my time between my books and my flowers and my tobacco pipes Do you mean to live always like that she asked in perfect innocency I think so Sometimes I doubt whether it s wise I don t think it wise at all said Mary Why not People should live together I think You mean that I ought to have a wife No I didn t mean that Of course that must be just as you might come to like any one well enough But a person need not shut himself up and be a hermit because he is not married Lord Rufford is not married and he goes everywhere He has money and property and is a man of pleasure And your cousin mister John Morton He is essentially a man of business which I never could have been And they say he is going to be married to that Miss Trefoil who has been staying there Unfortunately I have never had anything that I need do in all my life and therefore I have shut myself up as you call it I wonder what your life will be Mary blushed and said nothing If there were anything to tell I wish I knew it There is nothing to tell Nothing She thought a moment before she answered him and then she said Nothing What should I have to tell she added trying to laugh He remained for a few minutes silent and then put his head out towards her as he spoke I was afraid that you might have to tell that you were engaged to marry mister Twentyman I am not Oh I am so glad to hear it I don t know why you should be glad If I had said I was it would have been very uncivil if you hadn t declared yourself glad to hear that Then I must have been uncivil for I couldn t have done it Knowing how my aunt loves you knowing what she thinks of you and what she would think of such a match remembering myself what I do of you I could not have congratulated you on your engagement to a man whom I think so much inferior to yourself in every respect Now you know it all why I was angry at the bridge why I was hardly civil to you at your father s house and to tell the truth why I have been so anxious to be alone with you for half an hour If you think it an offence that I should take so much interest in you I will beg your pardon for that also Oh no I have never spoken to my aunt about it but I do not think that she would have been contented to hear that you were to become the wife of mister Twentyman What answer she was to make to this or whether she was to make any she had not decided when they were interrupted by the reappearance of the old lady and the bird She was declaring to the guard at the window that as she had paid for a first class seat for her parrot she would get into any carriage she liked in which there were two empty seats Her bird had been ill treated by some scurrilous ill conditioned travellers and she had therefore returned to the comparative kindness of her former companions They threatened to put him out of the window sir said the old woman to Morton as she was forcing her way in Windersir windersir said the parrot I hope he ll behave himself here ma am said Morton Heremam heremam heremam said the parrot Now go to bed like a good bird said the old lady putting her shawl over the cage whereupon the parrot made a more diabolical noise than ever under the curtain Mary felt that there was no more to be said about mister Twentyman and her hopes and prospects and for the moment she was glad to be left in peace The old lady and the parrot continued their conversation till they had all arrived in Cheltenham and Mary as she sat alone thinking of it afterwards might perhaps feel a soft regret that Reginald Morton had been interrupted by the talkative animal VOLUME II CHAPTER I MOUNSER GREEN So Peter Boyd is to go to Washington in the Paragon s place and Jack Slade goes to Vienna and young Palliser is to get Slade s berth at Lisbon This information was given by a handsome man known as Mounser Green about six feet high wearing a velvet shooting coat more properly called an office coat from its present uses who had just entered a spacious well carpeted comfortable room in which three other gentlemen were sitting at their different tables This was one of the rooms in the Foreign Office and looked out into saint James s Park Mounser Green was a distinguished clerk in that department and distinguished also in various ways being one of the fashionable men about town a great adept at private theatricals remarkable as a billiard player at his club and a contributor to various magazines At this moment he had a cigar in his mouth and when he entered the room he stood with his back to the fire ready for conversation and looking very unlike a clerk who intended to do any work But there was a general idea that Mounser Green was invaluable to the Foreign Office He could speak and write two or three foreign languages he could do a spurt of work ten hours at a sitting when required he was ready to go through fire and water for his chief and was a gentleman all round Though still nominally a young man being perhaps thirty five years of age he had entered the service before competitive examination had assumed its present shape and had therefore the gifts which were required for his special position Some critics on the Civil Service were no doubt apt to find fault with Mounser Green When called upon at his office he was never seen to be doing anything and he always had a cigar in his mouth These gentlemen found out too that he never entered his office till half past twelve perhaps not having also learned that he was generally there till nearly seven No doubt during the time that he remained there he read a great many newspapers and wrote a great many private notes on official paper But there may be a question whether even these employments did not help to make Mounser Green the valuable man he was What a lounge for Jack Slade said young Hoffmann I ll tell you who it won t be a lounge for Green said Archibald Currie the clerk who held the second authority among them What will Bell Trefoil think of going to Patagonia That s all off said Mounser Green I don t think so said Charley Glossop one of the numerous younger sons of Lord Glossop She was staying only the other day down at the Paragon s place in Rufford and they went together to my cousin Rufford s house His sister that s Lady Penwether told me they were certainly engaged then That was before the Paragon had been named for Patagonia To tell you a little bit of my own private mind which isn t scandal said Mounser Green because it is only given as opinion I think it just possible that the Paragon has taken this very uncomfortable mission because it offered him some chance of escape Then he has more sense about him than I gave him credit for said Archibald Currie Why should a man like Morton go to Patagonia continued Green He has an independent fortune and doesn t want the money He d have been sure to have something comfortable in Europe very soon if he had waited and was much better off as second at a place like Washington I was quite surprised when he took it Patagonia isn t bad at all said Currie That depends on whether a man has got money of his own When I heard about the Paragon and Bell Trefoil at Washington I knew there had been a mistake made He didn t know what he was doing I m a poor man but I wouldn t take her with Lfive thousand a year settled on myself Poor Mounser Green I think she s the handsomest girl in London said Hoffmann who was a young man of German parentage and perhaps of German taste That may be continued Green but heaven and earth what a life she would lead a man like the Paragon He s found it out and therefore thought it well to go to South America She has declined already I m told but he means to stick to the mission During all this time Mounser Green was smoking his cigar with his back to the fire and the other clerks looked as though they had nothing to do but talk about the private affairs of ministers abroad and their friends Of course it will be understood that since we last saw John Morton the position of Minister Plenipotentiary at Patagonia had been offered to him and that he had accepted the place in spite of Bragton and of Arabella Trefoil At that moment a card was handed to Mounser Green by a messenger who was desired to show the gentleman up It s the Paragon himself said Green We ll make him tell us whether he s going out single or double said Archibald Currie After what the Rufford people said to me I m sure he s going to marry her said young Glossop No doubt Lady Penwether had been anxious to make it understood by every one connected with the family that if any gossip should be heard about Rufford and Arabella Trefoil there was nothing in it Then the Paragon was shown into the room and Mounser Green and the young men were delighted to see him Colonial governors at their seats of government and Ministers Plenipotentiary in their ambassadorial residences are very great persons indeed and when met in society at home with the stars and ribbons which are common among them now they are less indeed but still something But at the colonial and foreign offices in London among the assistant secretaries and clerks they are hardly more than common men All the gingerbread is gone there His Excellency is no more than Jones and the Representative or Alter Ego of Royalty mildly asks little favours of the junior clerks Lord Drummond only wants to know what you wish and it shall be done said Mounser Green Lord Drummond was the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the day I hope I need hardly say that we were delighted that you accepted the offer One doesn t like to refuse a step upward said Morton otherwise Patagonia isn t exactly the place one would like Very good climate said Currie Ladies I have known who have gone there have enjoyed it very much A little rough I suppose They didn t seem to say so Young Bartletot took his wife out there just married He liked it There wasn t much society but they didn t care about that just at first Ah I m a single man said Morton laughing He was too good a diplomate to be pumped in that simple way by such a one as Archibald Currie You ll like to see Lord Drummond He is here and will be glad to shake hands with you Come into my room Then Mounser Green led the way into a small inner sanctum in which it may be presumed that he really did his work It was here at any rate that he wrote the notes on official note paper They haven t settled as yet how they re to be off it said Currie in a whisper as soon as the two men were gone but I ll bet a five pound note that Bell Trefoil doesn t go out to Patagonia as his wife We know the Senator here well enough This was said in the inner room by Mounser Green to Morton who had breakfasted with the Senator that morning and had made an appointment to meet him at the Foreign Office The Senator wanted to secure a seat for himself at the opening of Parliament which was appointed to take place in the course of the next month and being a member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs in the American Senate of course thought himself entitled to have things done for him by the Foreign Office clerks Oh yes I ll see him Lord Drummond will get him a seat as a matter of course How is he getting on with your neighbour at Dillsborough So you ve heard of that Heard of it who hasn t heard of it At this moment the messenger came in again and the Senator was announced Lord Drummond will manage about the seats in the House of Lords mister Gotobed Of course he ll see you if you wish it but I ll take a note of it If you ll do that mister Green I shall be fixed up straight And I d a great deal sooner see you than his lordship That s very flattering mister Gotobed but I m sure I don t know why Because Lord Drummond always seems to me to have more on hand than he knows how to get through and you never seem to have anything to do That s not quite so flattering and would be killing only that I feel that your opinion is founded on error Mens conscia recti mister Gotobed Exactly I understand English pretty well better as far as I can see than some of those I meet around me here but I don t go beyond that mister Green I merely meant to observe mister Gotobed that as within my own breast I am conscious of my zeal and diligence in Her Majesty s service your shafts of satire pass me by without hurting me Shall I offer you a cigar A candle burned at both ends is soon consumed It was quite clear that as quickly as the Senator got through one end of his cigar by the usual process of burning so quickly did he eat the other end But he took that which Mounser Green offered him without any displeasure at the allusion I m sorry to say that I haven t a spittoon said Mounser Green but the whole fire place is at your service The Senator could hardly have heard this as it made no difference in his practice Morton at this moment was sent for by the Secretary of State and the Senator expressed his intention of waiting for him in mister Green s room How does the great Goarly case get on mister Gotobed asked the clerk Well I don t know that it s getting on very much You are not growing tired of it Senator Not by any means But it s getting itself complicated mister Green I mean to see the end of it and if I m beat why I can take a beating as well as another man You begin to think you will be beat I didn t say so mister Green It is very hard to understand all the ins and outs of a case like that in a foreign country Then I shouldn t try it Senator There I differ It is my object to learn all I can At any rate I shouldn t pay for the lesson as you are like to do What ll the bill be Four hundred dollars Never mind mister Green If you ll take the opinion of a good deal older man than yourself and one who has perhaps worked harder you ll understand that there s no knowledge got so thoroughly as that for which a man pays Soon after this Morton came out from the great man s room and went away in company with the Senator CHAPTER II THE SENATOR S LETTER Soon after this Senator Gotobed went down alone to Dillsborough and put himself up at the Bush Inn Although he had by no means the reputation of being a rich man he did not seem to care much what money he spent in furthering any object he had taken in hand He never knew how near he had been to meeting the direst inhospitality at mister Runciman s house That worthy innkeeper knowing well the Senator s sympathy with Goarly Scrobby and Bearside and being heart and soul devoted to the Rufford interest had almost refused the Senator the accommodation he wanted It was only when missus Runciman represented to him that she could charge ten shillings a day for the use of her sitting room and also that Lord Rufford himself had condescended to entertain the gentleman that Runciman gave way mister Gotobed would no doubt have delighted in such inhospitality He would have gone to the second rate inn which was very second rate indeed and have acquired a further insight into British manners and British prejudices As it was he made himself at home in the best upstairs sitting room at the Bush and was quite unaware of the indignity offered to him when mister Runciman refused to send him up the best sherry Let us hope that this refusal was remembered by the young woman in the bar when she made out the Senator s bill He stayed at Dillsborough for three or four days during which he saw Goarly once and Bearside on two or three occasions and moreover handed to that busy attorney three bank notes for Lfive each Bearside was clever enough to make him believe that Goarly would certainly obtain serious damages from the lord With Bearside he was fairly satisfied thinking however that the man was much more illiterate and ignorant than the general run of lawyers in the United States but with Goarly he was by no means satisfied Goarly endeavoured to keep out of his way and could not be induced to come to him at the Bush Three times he walked out to the house near Dillsborough Wood on each of which occasions missus Goarly pestered him for money and told him at great length the history of her forlorn goose Scrobby of whom he had heard he could not see at all and he found that Bearside was very unwilling to say anything about Scrobby Scrobby and the red herrings and the strychnine and the dead fox were according to Bearside to be kept quite distinct from the pheasants and the wheat Bearside declared over and over again that there was no evidence to connect his client with the demise of the fox When asked whether he did not think that his client had compassed the death of the animal he assured the Senator that in such matters he never ventured to think Let us go by the evidence mister Gotobed he said But I am paying my money for the sake of getting at the facts Evidence is facts sir said the attorney Any way let us settle about the pheasants first The condition of the Senator s mind may perhaps be best made known by a letter which he wrote from Dillsborough to his especial and well trusted friend Josiah Scroome a member of the House of Representatives from his own state of Mickewa Since he had been in England he had written constantly to his friend giving him the result of his British experiences Bush Inn Dillsborough Ufford County England December sixteen one hundred eighty seven MY DEAR SIR Since my last I have enjoyed myself very well and I am I trust beginning to understand something of the mode of thinking of this very peculiar people That there should be so wide a difference between us Americans and these English from whom we were divided so to say but the other day is one of the most peculiar physiological phenomena that the history of the world will have afforded As far as I can hear a German or even a Frenchman thinks much more as an Englishman thinks than does an American Nor does this come mainly from the greater prevalence with us of democratic institutions I do not think that any one can perceive in half an hour s conversation the difference between a Swiss and a German but I fancy and I may say I flatter myself that an American is as easily distinguished from an Englishman as a sheep from a goat or a tall man from one who is short And yet there is a pleasure in associating with those here of the highest rank which I find it hard to describe and which perhaps I ought to regard as a pernicious temptation to useless luxury There is an ease of manner with them which recalls with unfavourable reminiscences the hard self consciousness of the better class of our citizens There is a story of an old hero who with his companions fell among beautiful women and luscious wine and but that the hero had been warned in time they would all have been turned into filthy animals by yielding to the allurements around them The temptation here is perhaps the same I am not a hero and though I too have been warned by the lessons I have learned under our happy Constitution I feel that I might easily become one of the animals in question And to give them their due it is better than merely beautiful women and luscious wine There is a reality about them and a desire to live up to their principles which is very grand Their principles are no doubt bad utterly antagonistic to all progress unconscious altogether of the demand for progressive equality which is made by the united voices of suffering mankind The man who is born a lord and who sees a dozen serfs around him who have been born to be half starved ploughmen thinks that God arranged it all and that he is bound to maintain a state of things so comfortable to himself as being God s vicegerent here on earth But they do their work as vicegerents with an easy grace and with sweet pleasant voices and soft movements which almost make a man doubt whether the Almighty has not in truth intended that such injustice should be permanent That one man should be rich and another poor is a necessity in the present imperfect state of civilisation but that one man should be born to be a legislator born to have everything born to be a tyrant and should think it all right is to me miraculous But the greatest miracle of all is that they who are not so born who have been born to suffer the reverse side should also think it to be all right With us it is necessary that a man to shine in society should have done something or should at any rate have the capacity of doing something But here the greatest fool that you meet will shine and will be admitted to be brilliant simply because he has possessions Such a one will take his part in conversation though he knows nothing and when inquired into he will own that he knows nothing To know anything is not his line in life But he can move about and chatter like a child of ten and amuse himself from morning to night with various empty playthings and be absolutely proud of his life I have lately become acquainted with a certain young lord here of this class who has treated me with great kindness although I have taken it into my head to oppose him as to a matter in which he is much interested I ventured to inquire of him as to the pursuits of his life He is a lord and therefore a legislator but he made no scruple to tell me that he never goes near the Chamber in which it is his privilege to have a seat But his party does not lose his support Though he never goes near the place he can vote and is enabled to trust his vote to some other more ambitious lord who does go there It required the absolute evidence of personal information from those who are themselves concerned to make me believe that legislation in Great Britain could be carried on after such a fashion as this Then he told me what he does do All the winter he hunts and shoots going about to other rich men s houses when there is no longer sufficient for him to shoot left on his own estate That lasts him from the first of September to the end of March and occupies all his time August he spends in Scotland also shooting other animals During the other months he fishes and plays cricket and tennis and attends races and goes about to parties in London His evenings he spends at a card table when he can get friends to play with him It is the employment of his life to fit in his amusements so that he may not have a dull day Wherever he goes he carries his wine with him and his valet and his grooms and if he thinks there is anything to fear his cook also He very rarely opens a book He is more ignorant than a boy of fifteen with us and yet he manages to have something to say about everything When his ignorance has been made as clear as the sun at noon day he is no whit ashamed One would say that such a life would break the heart of any man but upon my word I doubt whether I ever came across a human being so self satisfied as this young lord I have come down here to support the case of a poor man who is I think being trampled on by this do nothing legislator But I am bound to say that the lord in his kind is very much better than the poor man in his Such a wretched squalid lying cowardly creature I did not think that even England could produce And yet the man has a property in land on which he ought to be able to live in humble comfort I feel sure that I have leagued myself with a rascal whereas I believe the lord in spite of his ignorance and his idleness to be honest But yet the man is being hardly used and has had the spirit or rather perhaps has been instigated by others to rebel His crops have been eaten up by the lord s pheasants and the lord exercising plenary power as though he were subject to no laws will only pay what compensation he himself chooses to award The whole country here is in arms against the rebel thinking it monstrous that a man living in a hovel should contest such a point with the owner of half a dozen palaces I have come forward to help the man for the sake of seeing how the matter will go and I have to confess that though those under the lord have treated me as though I were a miscreant the lord himself and his friends have been civil enough I say what I think wherever I go and I do not find it taken in bad part In that respect we might learn something even from Englishmen When a Britisher over in the States says what he thinks about us we are apt to be a little rough with him I have indeed known towns in which he couldn t speak out with personal safety Here there is no danger of that kind I am getting together the materials for a lecture on British institutions in general in which I shall certainly speak my mind plainly and I think I shall venture to deliver it in London before I leave for New York in the course of next spring I will however write to you again before that time comes Believe me to be Dear sir With much sincerity Yours truly ELIAS GOTOBED The Honble Josiah Scroome one hundred twenty five Q Street Minnesota Avenue Washington On the morning of the Senator s departure from Dillsborough mister Runciman met him standing under the covered way leading from the inn yard into the street He was waiting for the omnibus which was being driven about the town and which was to call for him and take him down to the railway station mister Runciman had not as yet spoken to him since he had been at the inn and had not even made himself personally known to his guest So sir you are going to leave us said the landlord with a smile which was intended probably as a smile of triumph Yes sir said the Senator It s about time I guess that I should get back to London I dare say it is sir said the landlord I dare say you ve seen enough of mister Goarly by this time That s as may be I don t know whom I have the pleasure of speaking to My name is Runciman sir I m the landlord here I hope I see you well mister Runciman I have about come to an end of my business here I dare say you have sir I should say so Perhaps I might express an opinion that you never came across a greater blackguard than Goarly either in this country or your own That s a strong opinion mister Runciman It s the general opinion here sir I should have thought you d found it out before this I don t know that I am prepared at this moment to declare all that I have found out I thought you d have been tired of it by this time mister Gotobed Tired of what Tired of the wrong side sir I don t know that I am on the wrong side A man may be in the right on one point even though his life isn t all that it ought to be That s true sir but if they told you all that they know up street and Runciman pointed to the part of the town in which Bearside s office was situated I should have thought you would have understood who was going to win and who was going to lose Good day sir I hope you ll have a pleasant journey Much obliged to you for your patronage sir and Runciman still smiling unpleasantly touched his hat as the Senator got into the omnibus The Senator was not very happy as to the Goarly business He had paid some money and had half promised more and had found out that he was in a boat with thoroughly disreputable persons As he had said to the landlord a man may have the right on his side in an action at law though he be a knave or a rascal and if a lord be unjust to a poor man the poor man should have justice done him even though he be not quite a pattern poor man But now he was led to believe by what the landlord had said to him that he was being kept in the dark and that there were facts generally known that he did not know He had learned something of English manners and English institutions by his interference but there might be a question whether he was not paying too dearly for his whistle And there was growing upon him a feeling that before he had done he would have to blush for his colleagues As the omnibus went away doctor Nupper joined mister Runciman under the archway I m blessed if I can understand that man said Runciman What is it he s after Notoriety said the doctor with the air of a man who has completely solved a difficult question He ll have to pay for it and that pretty smart said Runciman I never heard of such a foolish thing in all my life What the dickens is it to him One can understand Bearside and Scrobby too When a fellow has something to get one does understand it But why an old fellow like that should come down from the moon to pay ever so much money for such a man as Goarly is what I don t understand Notoriety said the doctor He evidently don t know that Nickem has got round Goarly said the landlord CHAPTER III AT CHELTENHAM The month at Cheltenham was passed very quietly and would have been a very happy month with Mary Masters but that there grew upon her from day to day increasing fears of what she would have to undergo when she returned to Dillsborough At the moment when she was hesitating with Larry Twentyman when she begged him to wait six months and then at last promised to give him an answer at the end of two she had worked herself up to think that it might possibly be her duty to accept her lover for the sake of her family At any rate she had at that moment thought that the question of duty ought to be further considered and therefore she had vacillated When the two months delay was accorded to her and within that period the privilege of a long absence from Dillsborough she put the trouble aside for a while with the common feeling that the chapter of accidents might do something for her Before she had reached Cheltenham the chapter of accidents had done much When Reginald Morton told her that he could not have congratulated her on such prospects and had explained to her why in truth he had been angry at the bridge how he had been anxious to be alone with her that he might learn whether she were really engaged to this man then she had known that her answer to Larry Twentyman at the end of the two months must be a positive refusal But as she became aware of this a new trouble arose and harassed her very soul When she had asked for the six months she had not at the moment been aware she had not then felt that a girl who asks for time is supposed to have already surrendered But since she had made that unhappy request the conviction had grown upon her She had read it in every word her stepmother said to her and in her father s manner The very winks and hints and little jokes which fell from her younger sisters told her that it was so She could see around her the satisfaction which had come from the settlement of that difficult question a satisfaction which was perhaps more apparent with her father than even with the others Then she knew what she had done and remembered to have heard that a girl who expresses a doubt is supposed to have gone beyond doubting While she was still at Dillsborough there was a feeling that no evil would arise from this if she could at last make up her mind to be missus Twentyman but when the settled conviction came upon her after hearing Reginald Morton s words then she was much troubled He stayed only a couple of days at Cheltenham and during that time said very little to her He certainly spoke no word which would give her a right to think that he himself was attached to her He had been interested about her as was his aunt Lady Ushant because she had been known and her mother had been known by the old Mortons But there was nothing of love in all that She had never supposed that there would be and yet there was a vague feeling in her bosom that as he had been strong in expressing his objection to mister Twentyman there might have been something more to stir him than the memory of those old days at Bragton To my thinking there is a sweetness about her which I have never seen equalled in any young woman This was said by Lady Ushant to her nephew after Mary had gone to bed on the night before he left One would suppose he answered that you wanted me to ask her to be my wife I never want anything of that kind Reg I never make in such matters or mar if I can help it There is a man at Dillsborough wants to marry her I can easily believe that there should be two or three Who is the man Do you remember old Twentyman of Chowton He was our near neighbour Of course I remember him I can remember well when they bought the land It is his son Surely he can hardly be worthy of her Reg And yet they say he is very worthy I have asked about him and he is not a bad fellow He keeps his money and has ideas of living decently He doesn t drink or gamble But he s not a gentleman or anything like one I should think he never opens a book Of course it would be a degradation And what does Mary say herself I fancy she has refused him Then he added after a pause Indeed I know she has How should you know Has she told you In answer to this he only nodded his head at the old lady There must have been close friendship Reg between you two when she told you that I hope you have not made her give up one suitor by leading her to love another who does not mean to ask her I certainly have not done that said Reg Men may often do much without knowing that they do anything and such probably had been the case with Reginald Morton during the journey from Dillsborough to Cheltenham What would her father wish They all want her to take the man How can she do better Would you have her marry a man who is not a gentleman whose wife will never be visited by other ladies in marrying whom she would go altogether down into another and a lower world This was a matter on which Lady Ushant and her nephew had conversed often and he thought he knew her to be thoroughly wedded to the privileges which she believed to be attached to her birth With him the same feeling was almost the stronger because he was so well aware of the blot upon himself caused by the lowness of his own father s marriage But a man he held could raise a woman to his own rank whereas a woman must accept the level of her husband Bread and meat and chairs and tables are very serious things Reg You would then recommend her to take this man and pass altogether out of your own sphere What can I do for her I am an old woman who will be dead probably before the first five years of her married life have passed over her And as for recommending I do not know enough to recommend anything Does she like the man I am sure she would feel herself degraded by marrying him I trust she will never live to feel herself degraded I do not believe that she could do anything that she thought would degrade her But I think that you and I had better leave her to herself in this matter Further on in the same evening or rather late in the night for they had then sat talking together for hours over the fire she made a direct statement to him When I die Reg I have but Lfive thousand to leave behind me and this I have divided between you and her I shall not tell her because I might do more harm than good But you may know That would make no difference to me he said Very likely not but I wish you to know it What troubles me is that she will have to pay so much out of it for legacy duty I might leave it all to you and you could give it her An honester or more religious or better woman than old Lady Ushant there was not in Cheltenham but it never crossed her conscience that it would be wrong to cheat the revenue It may be doubted whether any woman has ever been brought to such honesty as that On the next morning Morton went away without saying another word in private to Mary Masters and she was left to her quiet life with the old lady To an ordinary visitor nothing could have been less exciting for Lady Ushant very seldom went out and never entertained company She was a tall thin old lady with bright eyes and grey hair and a face that was still pretty in spite of sunken eyes and sunken cheeks and wrinkled brow There was ever present with her an air of melancholy which told a whole tale of the sadness of a long life Her chief excitement was in her two visits to church on Sunday and in the letter which she wrote every week to her nephew at Dillsborough Now she had her young friend with her and that too was an excitement to her and the more so since she had heard the tidings of Larry Twentyman s courtship She made up her mind that she would not speak on the subject to her young friend unless her young friend should speak to her In the first three weeks nothing was said but four or five days before Mary s departure there came up a conversation about Dillsborough and Bragton There had been many conversations about Dillsborough and Bragton but in all of them the name of Lawrence Twentyman had been scrupulously avoided Each had longed to name him and yet each had determined not to do so But at length it was avoided no longer Lady Ushant had spoken of Chowton Farm and the widow Then Mary had spoken of the place and its inhabitants mister Twentyman comes a great deal to our house now she said Has he any reason my dear He goes with papa once a week to the club and he sometimes lends my sister Kate a pony Kate is very fond of riding There is nothing else He has got to be intimate and I think mamma likes him He is a good young man then Very good said Mary with an emphasis And Chowton belongs to him Oh yes it belongs to him Some young men make such ducks and drakes of their property when they get it They say that he s not like that at all People say that he understands farming very well and that he minds everything himself What an excellent young man There is no other reason for his coming to your house Mary Then the sluice gates were opened and the whole story was told Sitting there late into the night Mary told it all as well as she knew how all of it except in regard to any spark of love which might have fallen upon her in respect of Reginald Morton Of Reginald Morton in her story of course she did not speak but all the rest she declared She did not love the man She was quite sure of that Though she thought so well of him there was she was quite sure no feeling in her heart akin to love She had promised to take time because she had thought that she might perhaps be able to bring herself to marry him without loving him to marry him because her father wished it and because her going from home would be a relief to her stepmother and sisters because it would be well for them all that she should be settled out of the way But since that she had made up her mind she thought that she had quite made up her mind that it would be impossible There is nobody else Mary said Lady Ushant putting her hand on to Mary s lap Mary protested that there was nobody else without any consciousness that she was telling a falsehood And you are quite sure that you cannot do it Do you think that I ought Lady Ushant I should be very sorry to say that my dear A young woman in such a matter must be governed by her feelings Only he seems to be a deserving young man Mary looked askance at her friend remembering at the moment Reginald Morton s assurance that his aunt would have disapproved of such an engagement But I never would persuade a girl to marry a man she did not love I think it would be wicked I always thought so There was nothing about degradation in all this It was quite clear to Mary that had she been able to tell Lady Ushant that she was head over ears in love with this young man and that therefore she was going to marry him her old friend would have found no reason to lament such an arrangement Her old friend would have congratulated her Lady Ushant evidently thought Larry Twentyman to be good enough as soon as she heard what Mary found herself compelled to say in the young man s favour Mary was almost disappointed but reconciled herself to it very quickly telling herself that there was yet time for her to decide in favour of her lover if she could bring herself to do so And she did try that night and all the next day thinking that if she could so make up her mind she would declare her purpose to Lady Ushant before she left Cheltenham But she could not do it and in the struggle with herself at last she learned something of the truth Lady Ushant saw nothing but what was right and proper in a marriage with Lawrence Twentyman but Reginald Morton had declared it to be improper and therefore it was out of her reach She could not do it She could not bring herself after what he had said to look him in the face and tell him that she was going to become the wife of Larry Twentyman Then she asked herself the fatal question was she in love with Reginald Morton I do not think that she answered it in the affirmative but she became more and more sure that she could never marry Larry Twentyman Lady Ushant declared herself to have been more than satisfied with the visit and expressed a hope that it might be repeated in the next year I would ask you to come and make your home here while I have a home to offer you only that you would be so much more buried here than at Dillsborough And you have duties there which perhaps you ought not to leave But come again when your papa will spare you On her journey back she certainly was not very happy There were yet three weeks wanting to the time at which she would be bound to give her answer to Larry Twentyman but why should she keep the man waiting for three weeks when her answer was ready Her stepmother she knew would soon force her answer from her and her father would be anxious to know what had been the result of her meditations The real period of her reprieve had been that of her absence at Cheltenham and that period was now come to an end At each station as she passed them she remembered what Reginald Morton had been saying to her and how their conversation had been interrupted and perhaps occasionally aided by the absurdities of the bird How sweet it had been to be near him and to listen to his whispered voice How great was the difference between him and that other young man the smartness of whose apparel was now becoming peculiarly distasteful to her Certainly it would have been better for her not to have gone to Cheltenham if it was to be her fate to become missus Twentyman She was quite sure of that now She came up from the Dillsborough Station alone in the Bush omnibus She had not expected any one to meet her Why should any one meet her The porter put up her box and the omnibus left her at the door But she remembered well how she had gone down with Reginald Morton and how delightful had been every little incident of the journey Even to walk with him up and down the platform while waiting for the train had been a privilege She thought of it as she got out of the carriage and remembered that she had felt that the train had come too soon At her own door her father met her and took her into the parlour where the tea things were spread and where her sisters were already seated Her stepmother soon came in and kissed her kindly She was asked how she had enjoyed herself and no disagreeable questions were put to her that night No questions at least were asked which she felt herself bound to answer After she was in bed Kate came to her and did say a word Well Mary do tell me I won t tell any one But Mary refused to speak a word CHAPTER IV THE RUFFORD CORRESPONDENCE It might be surmised from the description which Lord Rufford had given of his own position to his sister and his sister s two friends when he pictured himself as falling over the edge of the precipice while they hung on behind to save him that he was sufficiently aware of the inexpediency of the proposed intimacy with Miss Trefoil Any one hearing him would have said that Miss Trefoil s chances in that direction were very poor that a man seeing his danger so plainly and so clearly understanding the nature of it would certainly avoid it But what he had said was no more than Miss Trefoil knew that he would say or at any rate would think Of course she had against her not only all his friends but the man himself also and his own fixed intentions Lord Rufford was not a marrying man which was supposed to signify that he intended to lead a life of pleasure till the necessity of providing an heir should be forced upon him when he would take to himself a wife out of his own class in life twenty years younger than himself for whom he would not care a straw The odds against Miss Trefoil were of course great but girls have won even against such odds as these She knew her own powers and was aware that Lord Rufford was fond of feminine beauty and feminine flutter and feminine flattery though he was not prepared to marry It was quite possible that she might be able to dig such a pit for him that it would be easier for him to marry her than to get out in any other way Of course she must trust something to his own folly at first Nor did she trust in vain Before her week was over at missus Gore s she received from him a letter which with the correspondence to which it immediately led shall be given in this chapter LETTER NO one Rufford Sunday MY DEAR MISS TREFOIL We have had a sad house since you left us Poor Caneback got better and then worse and then better and at last died yesterday afternoon And now there is to be the funeral The poor dear old boy seems to have had nobody belonging to him and very little in the way of possessions I never knew anything of him except that he was or had been in the Blues and that he was about the best man in England to hounds on a bad horse It now turns out that his father made some money in India a sort of Commissary purveyor and bought a commission for him twenty five years ago Everybody knew him but nobody knew anything about him Poor old Caneback I wish he had managed to die anywhere else and I don t feel at all obliged to Purefoy for sending that brute of a mare here He said something to me about that wretched ball not altogether so wretched was it But I didn t like what he said and told him a bit of my mind Now we re two for a while and I don t care for how long unless he comes round I cannot stand a funeral and I shall get away from this I will pay the bill and Purefoy may do the rest I m going for Christmas to Surbiton s near Melton with a string of horses Surbiton is a bachelor and as there will be no young ladies to interfere with me I shall have the more time to think of you We shall have a little play there instead I don t know whether it isn t the better of the two as if one does get sat upon one doesn t feel so confoundedly sheep faced I have been out with the hounds two or three times since you went as I could do no good staying with that poor fellow and there was a time when we thought he would have pulled through I rode Jack one day but he didn t carry me as well as he did you I think he s more of a lady s horse If I go to Mistletoe I shall have some horses somewhere in the neighbourhood and I ll make them take Jack so that you may have a chance I never know how to sign myself to young ladies Suppose I say that I am yours Anything you like best R This was a much nicer letter than Arabella had expected as there were one or two touches in it apart from the dead man and the horses which she thought might lead to something and there was a tone in the letter which seemed to show that he was given to correspondence She took care to answer it so that he should get her letter on his arrival at mister Surbiton s house She found out mister Surbiton s address and then gave a great deal of time to her letter LETTER NO two Murray s Hotel Green Street Thursday MY DEAR LORD RUFFORD As we are passing through London on our way from one purgatory with the Gores to another purgatory with old Lady De Browne and as mamma is asleep in her chair opposite and as I have nothing else on earth to do I think I might as well answer your letter Poor old Major I am sorry for him because he rode so bravely I shall never forget his face as he passed us and again as he rose upon his knee when that horrid blow came How very odd that he should have been like that without any friends What a terrible nuisance to you I think you were quite wise to come away I am sure I should have done so I can t conceive what right Sir John Purefoy can have had to say anything for after all it was his doing Do you remember when you talked of my riding Jemima When I think of it I can hardly hold myself for shuddering It is so kind of you to think of me about Jack I am never very fond of Mistletoe Don t you be mischievous now and tell the Duchess I said so But with Jack in the neighbourhood I can stand even her Grace I think I shall be there about the middle of January but it must depend on all those people mamma is going to I shall have to make a great fight for mamma thinks that ten days in the year at Mistletoe is all that duty requires But I always stick up for my uncle and mean in this instance to have a little of my own way What are parental commands in opposition to Jack and all his glories Besides mamma does not mean to go herself I shall leave it to you to say whether the ball was altogether wretched Of course there must have been infinite vexation to you and to us who knew of it all there was a feeling of deep sorrow But perhaps we were able some of us to make it a little lighter for you At any rate I shall never forget Rufford whether the memory be more pleasant or more painful There are moments which one never can forget Don t go and gamble away your money among a lot of men Though I dare say you have got so much that it doesn t signify whether you lose some of it or not I do think it is such a shame that a man like you should have such a quantity and that a poor girl such as I am shouldn t have enough to pay for her hats and gloves Why shouldn t I send a string of horses about just when I please I believe I could make as good a use of them as you do and then I could lend you Jack I would be so good natured You should have Jack every day you wanted him You must write and tell me what day you will be at Mistletoe It is you that have tempted me and I don t mean to be there without you or I suppose I ought to say without the horse But of course you will have understood that No young lady ever is supposed to desire the presence of any young man It would be very improper of course But a young man s Jack is quite another thing So far her pen had flown with her but then there came the necessity for a conclusion which must be worded in some peculiar way as his had been so peculiar How far might she dare to be affectionate without putting him on his guard Or in what way might she be saucy so as best to please him She tried two or three and at last she ended her letter as follows I have not had much experience in signing myself to young gentlemen and am therefore quite in as great a difficulty as you were but though I can t swear that I am everything that you like best I will protest that I am pretty nearly what you ought to like as far as young ladies go In the meantime I certainly am Yours truly A T P S Mind you write about Jack and address to Lady Smijth Greenacres Manor Hastings There was a great deal in this letter which was not true But then such ladies as Miss Trefoil can never afford to tell the truth The letter was not written from Murray s Hotel Lady Augustus having insisted on staying at certain lodgings in Orchard Street because her funds were low But on previous occasions they had stayed at Murray s And her mamma instead of being asleep when the letter was written was making up her accounts And every word about Mistletoe had been false She had not yet secured her invitation She was hard at work on the attempt having induced her father absolutely to beg the favour from his brother But at the present moment she was altogether diffident of success Should she fail she must only tell Lord Rufford that her mother s numerous engagements had at the last moment made her happiness impossible That she was going to Lady Smijth s was true and at Lady Smijth s house she received the following note from Lord Rufford It was then January and the great Mistletoe question was not as yet settled LETTER NO three December thirty one MY DEAR MISS TREFOIL Here I am still at Surbiton s and we have had such good sport that I m half inclined to give the Duke the slip What a pity that you can t come here instead Wouldn t it be nice for you and half a dozen more without any of the Dowagers or Duennas You might win some of the money which I lose I have been very unlucky and if you had won it all there would be plenty of room for hats and gloves and for sending two or three Jacks about all the winter into the bargain I never did win yet I don t care very much about it but I don t know why I should always be so uncommonly unlucky We had such a day yesterday an hour and ten minutes all in the open and then a kill just as the poor fellow was trying to make a drain under the high road There were only five of us up Surbiton broke his horse s back at a bank and young De Canute came down on to a road and smashed his collar bone Three or four of the hounds were so done that they couldn t be got home I was riding Black Harry and he won t be out again for a fortnight It was the best thing I ve seen these two years We never have it quite like that with the U R U If I don t go to Mistletoe I ll send Jack and a groom if you think the Duke would take them in and let you ride the horse If so I shall stay here pretty nearly all January unless there should be a frost In that case I should go back to Rufford as I have a deal of shooting to do I shall be so sorry not to see you but there is always a sort of sin in not sticking to hunting when it s good It so seldom is just what it ought to be I rather think that after all we shall be down on that fellow who poisoned our fox in spite of your friend the Senator Yours always faithfully R There was a great deal in this letter which was quite terrible to Miss Trefoil In the first place by the time she received it she had managed the matter with her uncle Her father had altogether refused to mention Lord Rufford s name though he had heard the very plain proposition which his daughter made to him with perfect serenity But he had said to the Duke that it would be a great convenience if Bell could be received at Mistletoe for a few days and the Duke had got the Duchess to assent Lady Augustus too had been disposed of and two very handsome new dresses had been acquired Her habit had been altered with reckless disregard of the coming spring and she was fully prepared for her campaign But what would Mistletoe be to her without Lord Rufford In spite of all that had been done she would not go there Unless she could turn him by her entreaties she would pack up everything and start for Patagonia with the determination to throw herself overboard on the way there if she could find the courage She had to think very much of her next letter Should she write in anger or should she write in love or should she mingle both There was no need for care now as there had been at first She must reach him at once or everything would be over She must say something that would bring him to Mistletoe whatever that something might be After much thought she determined that mingled anger and love would be the best So she mingled them as follows LETTER NO four Greenacre Manor Monday Your last letter which I have just got has killed me You must know that I have altered my plans and done it at immense trouble for the sake of meeting you at Mistletoe It will be most unkind I might say worse if you put me off I don t think you can do it as a gentleman I m sure you would not if you knew what I have gone through with mamma and the whole set of them to arrange it Of course I shan t go if you don t come Your talk of sending the horse there is adding an insult to the injury You must have meant to annoy me or you wouldn t have pretended to suppose that it was the horse I wanted to see I didn t think I could have taken so violent a dislike to poor Jack as I did for a moment Let me tell you that I think you are bound to go to Mistletoe though the hunting at Melton should be better than was ever known before When the hunting is good in one place of course it is good in another Even I am sportsman enough to know that I suppose you have been losing a lot of money and are foolish enough to think you can win it back again Please please come It was to be the little cream of the year for me It wasn t Jack There That ought to bring you And yet if you come I will worship Jack I have not said a word to mamma about altering my plans nor shall I while there is a hope But to Mistletoe I will not go unless you are to be there Pray answer this by return of post If we have gone your letter will of course follow us Pray come Yours if you do come what shall I say Fill it as you please A T Lord Rufford when he received the above very ardent epistle was quite aware that he had better not go to Mistletoe He understood the matter nearly as well as Arabella did herself But there was a feeling with him that up to that stage of the affair he ought to do what he was asked by a young lady even though there might be danger Though there was danger there would still be amusement He therefore wrote again as follows LETTER NO five DEAR MISS TREFOIL You shan t be disappointed whether it be Jack or any less useful animal that you wish to see At any rate Jack and the other animal will be at Mistletoe on the fifteenth I have written to the Duke by this post I can only hope that you will be grateful After all your abuse about my getting back my money I think you ought to be very grateful I have got it back again but I can assure you that has had nothing to do with it Yours ever R We had two miserably abortive days last week Arabella felt that a great deal of the compliment was taken away by the postscript but still she was grateful and contented CHAPTER V IT IS A LONG WAY While the correspondence given in the last chapter was going on Miss Trefoil had other troubles besides those there narrated and other letters to answer Soon after her departure from Rufford she received a very serious but still an affectionate epistle from John Morton in which he asked her if it was her intention to become his wife or not The letter was very long as well as very serious and need not be given here at length But that was the gist of it and he went on to say that in regard to money he had made the most liberal proposition in his power that he must decline to have any further communication with lawyers and that he must ask her to let him know at once quite at once whether she did or did not regard herself as engaged to him It was a manly letter and ended by a declaration that as far as he himself was concerned his feelings were not at all altered This she received while staying at the Gores but in accordance with her predetermined strategy did not at once send any answer to it Before she heard again from Morton she had received that pleasant first letter from Lord Rufford and was certainly then in no frame of mind to assure mister Morton that she was ready to declare herself his affianced wife before all the world Then after ten days he had written to her again and had written much more severely It wanted at that time but a few days to Christmas and she was waiting for a second letter from Lord Rufford Let what might come of it she could not now give up the Rufford chance As she sat thinking of it giving the very best of her mind to it she remembered the warmth of that embrace in the little room behind the drawing room and those halcyon minutes in which her head had been on his shoulder and his arm round her waist Not that they were made halcyon to her by any of the joys of love In giving the girl her due it must be owned that she rarely allowed herself to indulge in simple pleasures If Lord Rufford with the same rank and property had been personally disagreeable to her it would have been the same Business to her had for many years been business and her business had been so very hard that she had never allowed lighter things to interfere with it She had had justice on her side when she rebuked her mother for accusing her of flirtations But could such a man as Lord Rufford with his hands so free venture to tell himself that such tokens of affection with such a girl would mean nothing If she might contrive to meet him again of course they would be repeated and then he should be forced to say that they did mean something When therefore the severe letter came from Morton severe and pressing telling her that she was bound to answer him at once and that were she still silent he must in regard to his own honour take that as an indication of her intention to break off the match she felt that she must answer it The answer must however still be ambiguous She would not if possible throw away that stool quite as yet though her mind was intent on ascending to the throne which it might be within her power to reach She wrote to him an ambiguous letter but a letter which certainly was not intended to liberate him He ought she said to understand that a girl situated as she was could not ultimately dispose of herself till her friends had told her that she was free to do so She herself did not pretend to have any interest in the affairs as to which her father and his lawyers were making themselves busy They had never even condescended to tell her what it was they wanted on her behalf nor for the matter of that had he Morton ever told her what it was that he refused to do Of course she could not throw herself into his arms till these things were settled By that expression she had meant a metaphorical throwing of herself and not such a flesh and blood embracing as she had permitted to the lord in the little room at Rufford Then she suggested that he should appeal again to her father It need hardly be said that her father knew very little about it and that the lawyers had long since written to Lady Augustus to say that better terms as to settlement could not be had from mister John Morton Morton when he wrote his second letter had received the offer of the mission to Patagonia and had asked for a few days to think of it After much consideration he had determined that he would say nothing to Arabella of the offer Her treatment of him gave her no right to be consulted Should she at once write back declaring her readiness to become his wife then he would consult her and would not only consult her but would be prepared to abandon the mission at the expression of her lightest wish Indeed in that case he thought that he would himself advise that it should be abandoned Why should he expatriate himself to such a place with such a wife as Arabella Trefoil He received her answer and at once accepted the offer He accepted it though he by no means assured himself that the engagement was irrevocably annulled But now if she came to him she must take her chance She must be told that he at any rate was going to Patagonia and that unless she could make up her mind to do so too she must remain Arabella Trefoil for him He would not even tell her of his appointment He had done all that in him lay and would prepare himself for his journey as a single man A minister going out to Patagonia would of course have some little leave of absence allowed him and he arranged with his friend Mounser Green that he should not start till April But when Lord Rufford s second letter reached Miss Trefoil down at Greenacre Manor where she had learned by common report that mister Morton was to be the new minister at Patagonia when she believed as she then did that the lord was escaping her that seeing and feeling his danger he had determined not to jump into the lion s mouth by meeting her at Mistletoe that her chance there was all over then she remembered her age her many seasons the hard work of her toilet those tedious long and bitter quarrels with her mother the ever renewed trouble of her smiles the hopelessness of her future should she smile in vain to the last and the countless miseries of her endless visitings and she remembered too the Ltwelve hundred a year that Morton had offered to settle on her and the assurance of a home of her own though that home should be at Bragton For an hour or two she had almost given up the hope of Rufford and had meditated some letter to her other lover which might at any rate secure him But she had collected her courage sufficiently to make that last appeal to the lord which had been successful Three weeks now might settle all that and for three weeks it might still be possible so to manage her affairs that she might fall back upon Patagonia as her last resource About this time Morton returned to Bragton waiting however till he was assured that the Senator had completed his visit to Dillsborough He had been a little ashamed of the Senator in regard to the great Goarly conflict and was not desirous of relieving his solitude by the presence of the American On this occasion he went quite alone and ordered no carriages from the Bush and no increased establishment of servants He certainly was not happy in his mind The mission to Patagonia was well paid being worth with house and etceteras nearly Lthree thousand a year and it was great and quick promotion for one so young as himself For one neither a lord nor connected with a Cabinet Minister Patagonia was a great place at which to begin his career as Plenipotentiary on his own bottom but it is a long way off and has its drawbacks He could not look to be there for less than four years and there was hardly reason why a man in his position should expatriate himself to such a place for so long a time He felt that he should not have gone but for his engagement to Arabella Trefoil and that neither would he have gone had his engagement been solid and permanent He was going in order that he might be rid of that trouble and a man s feelings in such circumstances cannot be satisfactory to himself However he had said that he would go and he knew enough of himself to be certain that having said so he would not alter his mind But he was very melancholy and missus Hopkins declared to old missus Twentyman that the young squire was hipped along of his lady love as she thought His hands had been so full of his visitors when at Bragton before and he had been carried off so suddenly to Rufford and then had hurried up to London in such misery that he had hardly had time to attend to his own business mister Masters had made a claim upon him since he had been in England for Lone hundred twenty seven eight s four d in reference to certain long gone affairs in which the attorney declared he had been badly treated by those who had administered the Morton estate John Morton had promised to look into the matter and to see mister Masters He had partially looked into it and now felt ashamed that he had not fully kept his promise The old attorney had not had much hope of getting his money It was doubtful to himself whether he could make good his claim against the Squire at law and it was his settled purpose to make no such attempt although he was quite sure that the money was his due Indeed if mister Morton would not do anything further in the matter neither would he He was almost too mild a man to be a successful lawyer and had a dislike to asking for money mister Morton had promised to see him but mister Morton had probably forgotten it Some gentlemen seem apt to forget such promises mister Masters was somewhat surprised therefore when he was told one morning in his office that mister Morton from Bragton wished to see him He thought that it must be Reginald Morton having not heard that the Squire had returned to the country But John Morton was shown into the office and the old attorney immediately arose from his arm chair Sundown was there and was at once sent out of the room Sundown on such occasions was accustomed to retire to some settlement seldom visited by the public which was called the back office Nickem was away intent on unravelling the Goarly mystery and the attorney could ask his visitor to take a confidential seat mister Morton however had very little to say He was full of apologies and at once handed out a cheque for the sum demanded The money was so much to the attorney that he was flurried by his own success Perhaps said Morton I ought in fairness to add interest Not at all by no means Lawyers never expect that Really mister Morton I am very much obliged It was so long ago that I thought that perhaps you might think I do not doubt that it s all right Yes mister Morton it is all right It is quite right But your coming in this way is quite a compliment I am so proud to see the owner of Bragton once more in this house I respect the family as I always did and as for the money I am only sorry that it has been delayed so long Good morning mister Masters The attorney s affairs were in such a condition that an unexpected cheque for Lone hundred twenty seven eight s four d sufficed to exhilarate him It was as though the money had come down to him from the very skies As it happened Mary returned from Cheltenham on that same evening and the attorney felt that if she had brought back with her an intention to be missus Twentyman he could still be a happy and contented man And there had been another trouble on John Morton s mind He had received his cousin s card but had not returned the visit while his grandmother had been at Bragton Now he walked on to Hoppet Hall and knocked at the door Yes mister Morton was at home and then he was shown into the presence of his cousin whom he had not seen since he was a boy I ought to have come sooner said the Squire who was hardly at his ease I heard you had a house full of people at Bragton Just that and then I went off rather suddenly to the other side of the country and then I had to go up to London Now I m going to Patagonia Patagonia That s a long way off We Foreign Office slaves have to be sent a long way off But we heard John said Reginald who did not feel it to be his duty to stand on any ceremony with his younger cousin we heard that you were going to be married to Miss Trefoil Are you going to take a wife out to Patagonia This was a question which he certainly had not expected I don t know how that may be he said frowning We were told here in Dillsborough that it was all settled I hope I haven t asked an improper question Of course people will talk If it s only talk I beg pardon Whatever concerns Bragton is interesting to me and from the way in which I heard this I thought it was a certainty Patagonia well You don t want an assistant private secretary I suppose I should like to see Patagonia We are not allowed to appoint those gentlemen ourselves And I suppose I should be too old to get in at the bottom It seems a long way off for a man who is the owner of Bragton It is a long way And what will you do with the old place There s no one to live there If you were married you might perhaps take it This was of course said in joke as old missus Morton would have thought Bragton to be disgraced for ever even by such a proposition You might let it Who would take such a place for five years I suppose old missus Hopkins will remain and that it will become more and more desolate every year I mustn t let the old house tumble down that s all Then the Minister Plenipotentiary to Patagonia took his departure and walked back to Bragton thinking of the publicity of his engagement All Dillsborough had heard that he was to be married to Miss Trefoil and this cousin of his had been so sure of the fact that he had not hesitated to ask a question about it in the first moment of their first interview Under such circumstances it would be better for him to go to Patagonia than to remain in England CHAPTER VI THE BEGINNING OF PERSECUTION When Mary Masters got up on the morning after her arrival she knew that she would have to endure much on that day Everybody had smiled on her the preceding evening but the smiles were of a nature which declared themselves to be preparatory to some coming event The people around her were gracious on the presumption that she was going to do as they wished and would be quite prepared to withdraw their smiles should she prove to be contumacious Mary as she crept down in the morning understood all this perfectly She found her stepmother alone in the parlour and was at once attacked with the all important question My dear I hope you have made up your mind about mister Twentyman There were to be two months mamma That s nonsense Mary Of course you must know what you mean to tell him Mary thought that she did know but was not at the present moment disposed to make known her knowledge and therefore remained silent You should remember how much this is to your papa and me and should speak out at once Of course you need not tell mister Twentyman till the end of the time unless you like it I thought I was to be left alone for two months Mary that is wicked When your papa has so many things to think of and so much to provide for you should be more thoughtful of him Of course he will want to be prepared to give you what things will be necessary missus Masters had not as yet heard of mister Morton s cheque and perhaps would not hear of it till her husband s bank book fell into her hands The attorney had lately found it necessary to keep such matters to himself when it was possible as otherwise he was asked for explanations which it was not always easy for him to give You know continued missus Masters how hard your father finds it to get money as it is wanted I don t want anything mamma You must want things if you are to be married in March or April But I shan t be married in March or April Oh mamma pray don t In a week s time or so you must tell Larry After all that has passed of course he won t expect to have to wait long and you can t ask him Kate my dear Kate had just entered the room go into the office and tell your father to come into breakfast in five minutes You must know Mary and I insist on your telling me When I said two months only it was he said two months What difference does it make my dear It was only because he asked me to put it off I knew it could make no difference Do you mean to tell me Mary that you are going to refuse him after all I can t help it said Mary bursting out into tears Can t help it Did anybody ever see such an idiot since girls were first created Not help it after having given him as good as a promise You must help it You must be made to help it There was an injustice in this which nearly killed poor Mary She had been persuaded among them to put off her final decision not because she had any doubt in her own mind but at their request and now she was told that in granting this delay she had given as good as a promise And her stepmother also had declared that she must be made to help it or in other words be made to marry mister Twentyman in opposition to her own wishes She was quite sure that no human being could have such right of compulsion over her Her father would not attempt it and it was after all to her father alone that she was bound by duty At the moment she could make no reply and then her father with the two girls came in from the office The attorney was still a little radiant with his triumph about the cheque and was also pleased with his own discernment in the matter of Goarly He had learned that morning from Nickem that Goarly had consented to take seven s six d an acre from Lord Rufford and was prepared to act quite the honourable part on behalf of his lordship Nickem had seemed to think that the triumph would not end here but had declined to make any very definite statements Nickem clearly fancied that he had been doing great things himself and that he might be allowed to have a little mystery But the attorney took great credit to himself in that he had rejected Goarly s case and had been employed by Lord Rufford in lieu of Goarly When he entered the parlour he had for the moment forgotten Larry Twentyman and was disposed to greet his girl lovingly but he found her dissolved in bitter tears Mary my darling what is it ails you he said Never mind about your darling now but come to breakfast She is giving herself airs as usual But Mary never did give herself airs and her father could not endure the accusation She would not be crying he said unless she had something to cry for Pray don t make a fuss about things you don t understand said his wife Mary are you coming to the table If not you had better go up stairs I hate such ways and I won t have them This comes of Ushanting I knew what it would be The place for girls is to stay at home and mind their work till they have got houses of their own to look after That s what I intend my girls to do There s nothing on earth so bad for girls as that twiddle your thumbs visiting about when they think they ve nothing to do but to show what sort of ribbons and gloves they ve got Now Dolly if you ve got any hands will you cut the bread for your father Mary s a deal too fine a lady to do anything but sit there and rub her eyes After that the breakfast was eaten in silence When the meal was over Mary followed her father into the office and said that she wanted to speak to him When Sundown had disappeared she told her tale Papa she said I am so sorry but I can t do what you want about mister Twentyman Is it so Mary Don t be angry with me papa Angry No I won t be angry I should be very sorry to be angry with my girl But what you tell me will make us all very unhappy very unhappy indeed What will you say to Lawrence Twentyman What I said before papa But he is quite certain now that you mean to take him Of course we were all certain when you only wanted a few more days to think of it Mary felt this to be the cruellest thing of all When he asked me I said I wouldn t pledge you but I certainly had no doubt What is the matter Mary She could understand that a girl might be asked why she wanted to marry a man and that in such a condition she ought to be able to give a reason but it was she thought very hard that she should be asked why she didn t want to marry a man I suppose papa she said after a pause I don t like him in that way Your mamma will be sure to say that it is because you went to Lady Ushant s And so in part it was as Mary herself very well knew though Lady Ushant herself had had nothing to do with it Lady Ushant she said would be very well pleased if she thought that I liked him well enough Did you tell Lady Ushant Yes I told her all about it and how you would all be pleased And I did try to bring myself to it Papa pray pray don t want to send me away from you You would be so near to us all at Chowton Farm I am nearer here papa Then she embraced him and he in a manner yielded to her He yielded to her so far as to part with her at the present moment with soft loving words missus Masters had a long conversation with her husband on the subject that same day and condescended even to say a few words to the two girls She had her own theory and her own plan in the present emergency According to her theory girls shouldn t be indulged in any vagaries and this rejecting of a highly valuable suitor was a most inexcusable vagary And if her plan were followed a considerable amount of wholesome coercion would at once be exercised towards this refractory young woman There was in fact more than a fortnight wanting to the expiration of Larry s two months and missus Masters was strongly of opinion that if Mary were put into a sort of domestic Coventry during this period if she were debarred from friendly intercourse with the family and made to feel that such wickedness as hers if continued would make her an outcast then she would come round and accept Larry Twentyman before the end of the time But this plan could not be carried out without her husband s company operation Were she to attempt it single handed Mary would take refuge in her father s softness of heart and there would simply be two parties in the household If you would leave her to me and not speak to her it would be all right missus Masters said to her husband Not speak to her Not cosset her and spoil her for the next week or two Just leave her to herself and let her feel what she s doing Think what Chowton Farm would be and you with your business all slipping through your fingers I don t know that it s slipping through my fingers at all said the attorney mindful of his recent successes If you mean to say you don t care about it I do care about it very much You know I do You ought not to talk to me in that way Then why won t you be said by me Of course if you cocker her up she ll think she s to have her own way like a grand lady She don t like him because he works for his bread that s what it is and because she s been taught by that old woman to read poetry I never knew that stuff do any good to anybody I hate them fandangled lines that are all cut up short to make pretence If she wants to read why can t she take the cookery book and learn something useful It just comes to this if you want her to marry Larry Twentyman you had better not notice her for the next fortnight Let her go and come and say nothing to her She ll think about it if she s left to herself The attorney did want his daughter to marry the man and was half convinced by his wife He could not bring himself to be cruel and felt that his heart would bleed every hour of the day that he separated himself from his girl but still he thought that he might perhaps best in this way bring about a result which would be so manifestly for her advantage It might be that the books of poetry and the modes of thought which his wife described as Ushanting were of a nature to pervert his girl s mind from the material necessities of life and that a little hardship would bring her round to a more rational condition With a very heavy heart he consented to do his part which was to consist mainly of silence Any words which might be considered expedient were to come from his wife Three or four days went on in this way which were days of absolute misery to Mary She soon perceived and partly understood her father s silence She knew at any rate that for the present she was debarred from his confidence Her mother did not say much but what she did say was all founded on the theory that Ushanting and softness in general are very bad for young women Even Dolly and Kate were hard to her each having some dim idea that Mary was to be coerced towards Larry Twentyman and her own good At the end of that time when Mary had been at home nearly a week Larry came as usual on the Saturday evening She well knowing his habit took care to be out of the way Larry with a pleasant face asked after her and expressed a hope that she had enjoyed herself at Cheltenham A nasty idle place where nobody does anything as I believe said missus Masters Larry received a shock from the tone of the lady s voice He had allowed himself to think that all his troubles were now nearly over but the words and the voice frightened him He had told himself that he was not to speak of his love again till the two months were over and like an honourable man he was prepared to wait the full time He would not now have come to the attorney s house but that he knew the attorney would wait for him before going over to the club He had no right to draw deductions till the time should be up But he could not help his own feelings and was aware that his heart sank within him when he was told that Cheltenham was a nasty idle place Abuse of Cheltenham at the present moment was in fact abuse of Mary and the one sin which Mary could commit was persistence in her rejection of his suit But he determined to be a man as he walked across the street with his old friend and said not a word about his love They tell me that Goarly has taken his seven s six d mister Masters Of course he has taken it Larry The worse luck for me If he had gone on I might have had a bill against his Lordship as long as my arm Now it won t be worth looking after I m sure you re very glad mister Masters Well yes I am glad I do hate to see a fellow like that who hasn t got a farthing of his own propped up from behind just to annoy his betters They say that Bearside got a lot of money out of that American I suppose he got something What an idiot that man must be Can you understand it mister Masters They now entered the club and Goarly and Nickem and Scrobby were of course being discussed Is it true mister Masters that Scrobby is to be arrested asked Fred Botsey at once Upon my word I can t say mister Botsey but if you tell me it is so I shan t cry my eyes out I thought you would have known A gentleman may know a thing mister Botsey said the landlord and not exactly choose to tell it I didn t suppose there was any secret said the brewer As mister Masters made no further remark it was of course conceived that he knew all about it and he was therefore treated with some increased deference But there was on that night great triumph in the club as it was known as a fact that Goarly had withdrawn his claim and that the American Senator had paid his money for nothing It was moreover very generally believed that Goarly was going to turn evidence against Scrobby in reference to the poison CHAPTER VII MARY S LETTER The silent system in regard to Mary was carried on in the attorney s house for a week during which her sufferings were very great From the first she made up her mind to oppose her stepmother s cruelty by sheer obstinacy She had been told that she must be made to marry mister Twentyman and the injustice of that threat had at once made her rebel against her stepmother s authority She would never allow her stepmother to make her marry any one She put herself into a state of general defiance and said as little as was said to her But her father s silence to her nearly broke her heart On one or two occasions as opportunity offered itself to her she said little soft words to him in privacy Then he would partly relent would kiss her and bid her be a good girl and would quickly hurry away from her She could understand that he suffered as well as herself and she perhaps got some consolation from the conviction At last on the following Saturday she watched her opportunity and brought to him when he was alone in his office a letter which she had written to Larry Twentyman Papa she said would you read that He took and read the letter which was as follows MY DEAR mister TWENTYMAN Something was said about two months which are now very nearly over I think I ought to save you from the trouble of coming to me again by telling you in a letter that it cannot be as you would have it I have thought of it a great deal and have of course been anxious to do as my friends wish And I am very grateful to you and know how good and how kind you are And I would do anything for you except this But it never can be I should not write like this unless I were quite certain I hope you won t be angry with me and think that I should have spared you the trouble of doubting so long I know now that I ought not to have doubted at all but I was so anxious not to seem to be obstinate that I became foolish about it when you asked me What I say now is quite certain Dear mister Twentyman I shall always think of you with esteem and regard because I know how good you are and I hope you will come to like somebody a great deal better than me who will always love you with her whole heart Yours very truly MARY MASTERS P S I shall show this letter to papa mister Masters read it as she stood by him and then read it again very slowly rubbing one hand over the other as he did so He was thinking what he should do or rather what he should say The idea of stopping the letter never occurred to him If she chose to refuse the man of course she must do so and perhaps if she did refuse him there was no way better than this Must it be so Mary he said at last Yes papa But why Because I do not love him as I should have to love any man that I wanted to marry I have tried it because you wished it but I cannot do it What will mamma say I am thinking more papa of you she said putting her arm over his shoulder You have always been so good to me and so kind Here his heart misgave him for he felt that during the last week he had not been kind to her But you would not wish me to give myself to a man and then not to care for him No my dear I couldn t do it I should fall down dead first I have thought so much about it for your sake and have tried it with myself I couldn t do it Is there anybody else Mary As he asked the question he held her hand beneath his own on the desk but he did not dare to look into her face He had been told by his wife that there was somebody else that the girl s mind was running upon mister Surtees because mister Surtees was a gentleman He was thinking of mister Surtees and certainly not of Reginald Morton To her the moment was very solemn and when the question was asked she felt that she could not tell her father a falsehood She had gradually grown bold enough to assure herself that her heart was occupied with that man who had travelled with her to Cheltenham and she felt that that feeling alone must keep her apart from any other love And yet as she had no hope as she had assured herself that her love was a burden to be borne and could never become a source of enjoyment why should her secret be wrested from her What good would such a violation do But she could not tell the falsehood and therefore she held her tongue Gradually he looked up into her face still keeping her hand pressed on the desk under his It was his left hand that so guarded her while she stood by his right shoulder Then he gently wound his right arm round her waist and pressed her to him Mary he said if it is so had you not better tell me But she was sure that she had better not mention that name even to him It was impossible that she should mention it She would have outraged to herself her own maiden modesty by doing so Is it he asked very softly is it mister Surtees Oh no she said quickly almost escaping from the grasp of his arm in her start Then he was absolutely at a loss Beyond mister Surtees or Larry Twentyman he did not know what possible lover Dillsborough could have afforded And yet the very rapidity of her answer when the curate s name had been mentioned had convinced him that there was some other person had increased the strength of that conviction which her silence had produced Have you nothing that you can tell me Mary No papa Then he gave her back the letter and she left the room without another word Of course his sanction to the letter had now been given and it was addressed to Chowton Farm and posted before half an hour was over She saw him again in the afternoon of the same day and asked him to tell her stepmother what she had done Mamma ought to know she said But you haven t sent it Yes papa it is in the post Then it occurred to him that his wife would tell him that he should have prevented the sending of the letter that he should have destroyed it and altogether taken the matter with a high hand You can t tell her yourself he asked I would rather you did Mamma has been so hard to me since I came home He did tell his wife and she overwhelmed him by the violence of her reproaches He could never have been in earnest or he would not have allowed such a letter as that to pass through his hands He must be afraid of his own child He did not know his own duty He had been deceiving her his wife from first to last Then she threw herself into a torrent of tears declaring that she had been betrayed There had been a conspiracy between them and now everything might go to the dogs and she would not lift up her hands again to save them But before the evening came round she was again on the alert and again resolved that she would not even yet give way What was there in a letter more than in a spoken word She would tell Larry to disregard the letter But first she made a futile attempt to clutch the letter from the guardianship of the Post Office and she went to the Postmaster assuring him that there had been a mistake in the family that a wrong letter had been put into a wrong envelope and begging that the letter addressed to mister Twentyman might be given back to her The Postmaster half vacillating in his desire to oblige a neighbour produced the letter and missus Masters put out her hand to grasp it but the servant of the public who had been thoroughly grounded in his duties by one of those trusty guardians of our correspondence who inspect and survey our provincial post offices remembered himself at the last moment and expressing the violence of his regret replaced the letter in the box missus Masters in her anger and grief condescended to say very hard things to her neighbour but the man remembered his duty and was firm On that evening Larry Twentyman did not attend the Dillsborough Club having in the course of the week notified to the attorney that he should be a defaulter mister Masters himself went over earlier than usual his own house having become very uncomfortable to him missus Masters for an hour sat expecting that Larry would come and when the evening passed away without his appearance she was convinced that the unusual absence was a part of the conspiracy against her Larry did not get his letter till the Monday morning On the last Thursday and Saturday he had consoled himself for his doubts with the U R U and was minded to do so on the Monday also He had not gone to the club on Saturday and had moped about Chowton all the Sunday in a feverish state because of his doubts It seemed to him that the two months would never be over On the Monday he was out early on the farm and then came down in his boots and breeches and had his red coat ready at the fire while he sat at breakfast The meet was fifteen miles off and he had sent on his hunter intending to travel thither in his dog cart Just as he was cutting himself a slice of beef the postman came and of course he read his letter He read it with the carving knife in his hand and then he stood gazing at his mother What is it Larry she asked is anything wrong Wrong well I don t know he said I don t know what you call wrong I shan t hunt that s all Then he threw aside the knife and pushed away his plate and marched out of the room with the open letter in his hand missus Twentyman knew very well of his love as indeed did nearly all Dillsborough but she had heard nothing of the two months and did not connect the letter with Mary Masters Surely he must have lost a large sum of money That was her idea till she saw him again late in the afternoon He never went near the hounds that day or near his business He was not then man enough for either But he walked about the fields keeping out of sight of everybody It was all over now It must be all over when she wrote to him a letter like that Why had she tempted him to thoughts of happiness and success by that promise of two months grace He supposed that he was not good enough or that she thought he was not good enough Then he remembered his acres and his material comforts and tried to console himself by reflecting that Mary Masters might very well do worse in the world But there was no consolation in it He had tried his best because he had really loved the girl He had failed and all the world all his world would know that he had failed There was not a man in the club hardly a man in the hunt who was not aware that he had offered to Mary Masters During the last two months he had not been so reticent as was prudent and had almost boasted to Fred Botsey of success And then how was he to live at Chowton Farm without Mary Masters as his wife As he returned home he almost made up his mind that he would not continue to live at Chowton Farm He came back through Dillsborough Wood and there prowling about he met Goarly Well mister Twentyman said the man I am making it all straight now with his Lordship I don t care what you re doing said Larry in his misery You are an infernal blackguard and that s the best of you CHAPTER VIII CHOWTON FARM FOR SALE John Morton had returned to town soon after his walk into Dillsborough and had there learned from different sources that both Arabella Trefoil and Lord Rufford had gone or were going to Mistletoe He had seen Lord Augustus who though he could tell him nothing else about his daughter had not been slow to inform him that she was going to the house of her noble uncle When Morton had spoken to him very seriously about the engagement he declared that he knew nothing about it except that he had given his consent if the settlements were all right Lady Augustus managed all that Morton had then said that under those circumstances he feared he must regard the honour which he had hoped to enjoy as being beyond his reach Lord Augustus had shrugged his shoulders and had gone back to his whist this interview having taken place in the strangers room of his club That Lord Rufford was also going to Mistletoe he heard from young Glossop at the Foreign Office It was quite possible that Glossop had been instructed to make this known to Morton by his sister Lady Penwether Then Morton declared that the thing was over and that he would trouble himself no more about it But this resolution did not make him at all contented and in his misery he went again down to his solitude at Bragton And now when he might fairly consider himself to be free and when he should surely have congratulated himself on a most lucky escape from the great danger into which he had fallen his love and admiration for the girl returned to him in a most wonderful manner He thought of her beauty and her grace and the manner in which she would sit at the head of his table when the time should come for him to be promoted to some great capital To him she had fascinations which the reader who perhaps knows her better than he ever did will not share He could forgive the coldness of her conduct to himself he himself not being by nature demonstrative or impassioned if only she were not more kind to any rival It was the fact that she should be visiting at the same house with Lord Rufford after what he had seen at Rufford Hall which had angered him But now in his solitude he thought that he might have been wrong at Rufford Hall If it were the case that the girl feared that her marriage might be prevented by the operations of lawyers and family friends of course she would be right not to throw herself into his arms even metaphorically He was a cold just man who when he had loved could not easily get rid of his love and now he would ask himself whether he was not hard upon the girl It was natural that she should be at Mistletoe but then why should Lord Rufford be there with her His prospects at Patagonia did not console him much No doubt it was a handsome mission for a man of his age and there were sundry Patagonian questions of importance at the present moment which would give him a certain weight Patagonia was repudiating a loan and it was hoped that he might induce a better feeling in the Patagonian Parliament There was the Patagonian railway for joining the Straits to the Cape the details of which he was now studying with great diligence And then there was the vital question of boundary between Patagonia and the Argentine Republic by settling which should he be happy enough to succeed in doing so he would prevent the horrors of warfare He endeavoured to fix his mind with satisfaction on these great objects as he pored over the reports and papers which had been heaped upon him since he had accepted the mission But there was present to him always a feeling that the men at the Foreign Office had been glad to get any respectable diplomate to go to Patagonia and that his brethren in the profession had marvelled at his acceptance of such a mission One never likes to be thanked over much for doing anything It creates a feeling that one has given more than was expedient He knew that he must now go to Patagonia but he repented the alacrity with which he had acceded to the proposition Whether he did marry Arabella Trefoil or whether he did not there was no adequate reason for such a banishment And yet he could not now escape it It was on a Monday morning that Larry Twentyman had found himself unable to go hunting On the Tuesday he gave his workmen about the farm such a routing as they had not received for many a month There had not been a dungheap or a cowshed which he had not visited nor a fence about the place with which he had not found fault He was at it all day trying thus to console himself but in vain and when his mother in the evening said some word of her misery in regard to the turkeys he had told her that as far as he was concerned Goarly might poison every fox in the county Then the poor woman knew that matters were going badly with her son On the Wednesday when the hounds met within two miles of Chowton he again stayed at home but in the afternoon he rode into Dillsborough and contrived to see the attorney without being seen by any of the ladies of the family The interview did not seem to do him any good On the Thursday morning he walked across to Bragton and with a firm voice asked to see the Squire Morton who was deep in the boundary question put aside his papers and welcomed his neighbour Now it must be explained that when in former years his son s debts had accumulated on old mister Reginald Morton so that he had been obliged to part with some portion of his unentailed property he had sold that which lay in the parish of saint John s Dillsborough The lands in Bragton and Mallingham he could not sell but Chowton Farm which was in saint John s had been bought by Larry Twentyman s grandfather For a time there had been some bitterness of feeling but the Twentymans had been well to do respectable people most anxious to be good neighbours and had gradually made themselves liked by the owner of Bragton The present Squire had of course known nothing of Chowton as a part of the Morton property and had no more desire for it than for any of Lord Rufford s acres which were contiguous to his own He shook hands cordially with his neighbour as though this visit were the most natural thing in the world and asked some questions about Goarly and the hunt I believe that ll all come square mister Morton I m not interesting myself much about it now Larry was not dressed like himself He had on a dark brown coat and dark pantaloons and a chimney pot hat He was conspicuous generally for light coloured close fitting garments and for a billycock hat He was very unlike his usual self on the present occasion I thought you were just the man who did interest himself about those things Well yes once it was so mister Morton What I ve got to say now mister Morton is this Chowton Farm is in the market But I wouldn t say a word to any one about it till you had had the offer You going to sell Chowton Yes mister Morton I am From all I have heard of you I wouldn t have believed it if anybody else had told me It s a fact mister Morton There are three hundred and twenty acres I put the rental at thirty s an acre You know what you get mister Morton for the land that lies next to it And I think twenty eight years purchase isn t more than it s worth Those are my ideas as to price mister Morton There isn t a halfpenny owing on it not in the way of mortgage I dare say it s worth that Up at auction I might get a turn more mister Morton but those are my ideas at present John Morton who was a man of business went to work at once with his pencil and in two minutes had made out a total I don t know that I could put my hand on Lfourteen thousand even if I were minded to make the purchase That needn t stand in the way sir Any part you please could lie on mortgage at four one two per cent Larry in the midst of his distress had certain clear ideas about business This is a very serious proposition mister Twentyman Yes indeed sir Have you any other views in life I can t say as I have any fixed I shan t be idle mister Morton I never was idle I was thinking perhaps of New Zealand A very fine colony for a young man no doubt But seeing how well you are established here I can t stay here mister Morton I ve made up my mind about that There are things which a man can t bear not and live quiet As for hunting I don t care about it any more than nothing I am sorry that anything should have made you so unhappy Well I am unhappy That s about the truth of it And I always shall be unhappy here There s nothing else for it but going away If it s anything sudden mister Twentyman allow me to say that you ought not to sell your property without grave consideration I have considered it very grave mister Morton Ah but I mean long consideration Take a year to think of it You can t buy such a place back in a year I don t know you well enough to be justified in inquiring into the circumstances of your trouble but unless it be something which makes it altogether inexpedient or almost impossible that you should remain in the neighbourhood you should not sell Chowton I ll tell you mister Morton said Larry almost weeping Poor Larry whether in his triumph or his sorrow had no gift of reticence and now told his neighbour the whole story of his love He was certain it had become quite hopeless He was sure that she would never have written him a letter if there had been any smallest chance left According to his ideas a girl might say no half a dozen times and yet not mean much but when she had committed herself to a letter she could not go back from it Is there anybody else asked Morton Not as I know I never saw anything like like lightness with her with any man They said something about the curate but I don t believe a word of it And the family approve of it Every one of them father and stepmother and sisters and all My own mother too There ain t a ha porth against it I don t want any one to give me sixpence in money And she should live just like a lady I can keep a servant for her to cook and do every mortal thing But it ain t nothing of all that mister Morton What is it then The poor man paused before he made his answer but when he did he made it plain enough I ain t good enough for her Nor more I ain t mister Morton She was brought up in this house mister Morton by your own grand aunt So I have heard mister Twentyman And there s more of Bragton than there is of Dillsborough about her that s just where it is I know what I am and I know what she is and I ain t good enough for her It should be somebody that can talk books to her I can tell her how to plant a field of wheat or how to run a foal but I can t sit and read poetry nor yet be read to There s plenty of em would sell themselves because the land s all there and the house and the things in it What makes me mad is that I should love her all the better because she won t My belief is mister Morton they re as poor as Job That makes no difference to me because I don t want it but it makes no difference to her neither She s right mister Morton I m not good enough and so I ll just cut it as far as Dillsborough is concerned You ll think of what I said of taking the land mister Morton said much more to him walking with him to the gate of Chowton Farm He assured him that the young lady might yet be won He had only Morton said to plead his case to her as well as he had pleaded up at Bragton and he thought that she would be won I couldn t speak out free to her not if it was to save the whole place said the unfortunate lover But Morton still continued his advice As to leaving Chowton because a young lady refused him that would be unmanly There isn t a bit of a man left about me said Larry weeping Morton nevertheless went on Time would cure these wounds but no time would give him back Chowton should he once part with it If he must leave the place for a time let him put a caretaker on the farm even though by doing so the loss might be great He should do anything rather than surrender his house As to buying the land himself Morton would not talk about it in the present circumstances Then they parted at Chowton gate with many expressions of friendship on each side John Morton as he returned home could not help thinking that the young farmer s condition was after all better than his own There was an honesty about both the persons concerned of which at any rate they might be proud There was real love and though that love was not at present happy it was of a nature to inspire perfect respect But in his own case he was sure of nothing CHAPTER IX MISTLETOE When Arabella Trefoil started from London for Mistletoe with no companion but her own maid she had given more serious consideration to her visit than she had probably ever paid to any matter up to that time She had often been much in earnest but never so much in earnest as now Those other men had perhaps been worthy worthy as far as her ideas went of worth but none of them so worthy as this man Everything was there if she could only get it money rank fashion and an appetite for pleasure 
4331_57179_000002_000004	train-clean-360	And he was handsome too and good humoured though these qualities told less with her than the others 
4331_57179_000002_000005	train-clean-360	And now she was to meet him in the house of her great relations in a position in which her rank and her fashion would seem to be equal to his own 
4331_57179_000002_000006	train-clean-360	And she would meet him with the remembrance fresh in his mind as in her own of those passages of love at Rufford 
4331_57179_000002_000007	train-clean-360	It would be impossible that he should even seem to forget them 
4331_57179_000002_000008	train-clean-360	The most that she could expect would be four or five days of his company and she knew that she must be upon her mettle 
4331_57179_000002_000009	train-clean-360	She must do more now than she had ever attempted before 
4331_57179_000002_000010	train-clean-360	She must scruple at nothing that might bind him 
4331_57179_000002_000011	train-clean-360	She would be in the house of her uncle and that uncle a duke and she thought that those facts might help to quell him 
none	none	And she would be there without her mother who was so often a heavy incubus on her shoulders 
4331_57179_000002_000013	train-clean-360	She thought of it all and made her plans carefully and even painfully 
4331_57179_000002_000014	train-clean-360	She would be at any rate two days in the house before his arrival 
none	none	During that time she would curry favour with her uncle by all her arts and would if possible reconcile herself to her aunt She thought once of taking her aunt into her full confidence and balanced the matter much in her mind The Duchess she knew was afraid of her or rather afraid of the relationship and would of course be pleased to have all fears set at rest by such an alliance But her aunt was a woman who had never suffered hardships whose own marriage had been easily arranged and whose two daughters had been pleasantly married before they were twenty years old She had had no experience of feminine difficulties and would have no mercy for such labours as those to which her less fortunate niece was driven It would have been a great thing to have the cordial company operation of her aunt but she could not venture to ask for it 
4331_57179_000003_000000	train-clean-360	She had stretched her means and her credit to the utmost in regard to her wardrobe and was aware that she had never been so well equipped since those early days of her career in which her father and mother had thought that her beauty assisted by a generous expenditure would serve to dispose of her without delay 
4331_57179_000003_000001	train-clean-360	A generous expenditure may be incurred once even by poor people but cannot possibly be maintained over a dozen years 
4331_57179_000003_000002	train-clean-360	Now she had taken the matter into her own hands and had done that which would be ruinous if not successful She was venturing her all upon the die with the prospect of drowning herself on the way out to Patagonia should the chances of the game go against her 
4331_57179_000003_000003	train-clean-360	She forgot nothing 
4331_57179_000003_000004	train-clean-360	She could hardly hope for more than one day s hunting and yet that had been provided for as though she were going to ride with the hounds through all the remainder of the season 
4331_57179_000004_000000	train-clean-360	When she reached Mistletoe there were people going and coming every day so that an arrival was no event 
none	none	She was kissed by her uncle and welcomed with characteristic coldness by her aunt then allowed to settle in among the other guests as though she had been there all the winter 
4331_57179_000004_000002	train-clean-360	Everybody knew that she was a Trefoil and her presence therefore raised no question 
4331_57179_000004_000003	train-clean-360	The Duchess of Omnium was among the guests 
4331_57179_000004_000004	train-clean-360	The Duchess knew all about her and vouchsafed to her the smallest possible recognition 
4331_57179_000004_000005	train-clean-360	Lady Chiltern had met her before and as Lady Chiltern was always generous she was gracious to Arabella She was sorry to see Lady Drummond because she connected Lady Drummond with the Foreign Office and feared that the conversation might be led to Patagonia and its new minister 
none	none	She contrived to squeeze her uncle s hand and to utter a word of warm thanks which his grace did not perfectly understand 
4331_57179_000004_000007	train-clean-360	The girl was his niece and the Duke had an idea that he should be kind to the family of which he was the head 
4331_57179_000004_000008	train-clean-360	His brother s wife had become objectionable to him but as to the girl if she wanted a home for a week or two he thought it to be his duty to give it to her 
none	none	Mistletoe is an enormous house with a frontage nearly a quarter of a mile long combining as it does all the offices coach houses and stables 
4331_57179_000005_000001	train-clean-360	There is nothing in England more ugly or perhaps more comfortable 
none	none	It stands in a huge park which as it is quite flat never shows its size and is altogether unattractive The Duke himself was a hospitable easy man who was very fond of his dinner and performed his duties well but could never be touched by any sentiment He always spent six months in the country in which he acted as landlord to a great crowd of shooting hunting and flirting visitors and six in London in which he gave dinners and dined out and regularly took his place in the House of Lords without ever opening his mouth 
4331_57179_000005_000005	train-clean-360	He was a grey haired comely man of sixty with a large body and a wonderful appetite 
4331_57179_000005_000006	train-clean-360	By many who understood the subject he was supposed to be the best amateur judge of wine in England 
none	none	His son Lord Mistletoe was member for the county and as the Duke had no younger sons he was supposed to be happy at all points Lord Mistletoe who had a large family of his own lived twenty miles off so that the father and son could meet pleasantly without fear of quarrelling 
4331_57179_000006_000000	train-clean-360	During the first evening Arabella did contrive to make herself very agreeable 
none	none	She was much quieter than had been her wont when at Mistletoe before and though there were present two or three very well circumstanced young men she took but little notice of them She went out to dinner with Sir Jeffrey Bunker and made herself agreeable to that old gentleman in a remarkable manner 
4331_57179_000006_000002	train-clean-360	After dinner something having been said of the respectable old game called cat s cradle she played it to perfection with Sir Jeffrey till her aunt thought that she must have been unaware that Sir Jeffrey had a wife and family 
4331_57179_000006_000003	train-clean-360	She was all smiles and all pleasantness and seemed to want no other happiness than what the present moment gave her 
none	none	Nor did she once mention Lord Rufford s name On the next morning after breakfast her aunt sent for her to come up stairs 
4331_57179_000007_000001	train-clean-360	Such a thing had never happened to her before 
4331_57179_000007_000002	train-clean-360	She could not recollect that on any of those annual visits which she had made to Mistletoe for more years than she now liked to think of she had ever had five minutes conversation alone with her aunt 
4331_57179_000007_000003	train-clean-360	It had always seemed that she was to be allowed to come and go by reason of her relationship but that she was to receive no special mark of confidence or affection 
4331_57179_000007_000004	train-clean-360	The message was whispered into her ear by her aunt s own woman as she was listening with great attention to Lady Drummond s troubles in regard to her nursery arrangements 
4331_57179_000007_000005	train-clean-360	She nodded her head heard a few more words from Lady Drummond and then with a pretty apology and a statement made so that all should hear her that her aunt wanted her followed the maid up stairs 
4331_57179_000007_000006	train-clean-360	 My dear said her aunt when the door was closed I want to ask you whether you would like me to ask mister Morton to come here while you are with us A thunderbolt at her feet could hardly have surprised or annoyed her more 
none	none	If there was one thing that she wanted less than another it was the presence of the Paragon at Mistletoe 
4331_57179_000007_000008	train-clean-360	It would utterly subvert everything and rob her of every chance 
4331_57179_000007_000009	train-clean-360	With a great effort she restrained all emotion and simply shook her head 
4331_57179_000007_000010	train-clean-360	She did it very well and betrayed nothing 
4331_57179_000007_000011	train-clean-360	 I ask said the Duchess because I have been very glad to hear that you are engaged to marry him 
4331_57179_000007_000012	train-clean-360	Lord Drummond tells me that he is a most respectable young man 
none	none	mister Morton will be so much obliged to Lord Drummond
4331_57179_000009_000000	train-clean-360	 And I thought that if it were so you would be glad that he should meet you here 
4331_57179_000009_000001	train-clean-360	I could manage it very well as the Drummonds are here and Lord Drummond would be glad to meet him 
none	none	They had not been above a minute or two together and Arabella had been called upon to expend her energy in suppressing any expression of her horror but still by the time that she was called on to speak she had fabricated her story Thanks aunt it is so good of you and if everything was going straight there would be nothing of course that I should like so much
4331_57179_000011_000000	train-clean-360	 You are engaged to him 
4331_57179_000012_000000	train-clean-360	 Well I was going to tell you 
none	none	I dare say it is not his fault but papa and mamma and the lawyers think that he is not behaving well about money settlements and all that I suppose it will all come right but in the meantime perhaps I had better not meet him
4331_57179_000013_000000	train-clean-360	 But you were engaged to him 
none	none	This had to be answered without a moment s pause
4331_57179_000014_000001	train-clean-360	 Yes said Arabella I was engaged to him 
none	none	And he is going out as minister to Patagonia almost immediately He is going I know
4331_57179_000017_000000	train-clean-360	 I suppose you will go with him 
none	none	This was very hard 
4331_57179_000018_000001	train-clean-360	She could not say that she certainly was not going with him 
4331_57179_000018_000002	train-clean-360	And yet she had to remember that her coming campaign with Lord Rufford must be carried on in part beneath her aunt s eyes When she had come to Mistletoe she had fondly hoped that none of the family there would know anything about mister Morton 
4331_57179_000018_000003	train-clean-360	And now she was called upon to answer these horrid questions without a moment s notice 
none	none	I don t think I shall go with him aunt though I am unable to say anything certain just at present If he behaves badly of course the engagement must be off I hope not 
4331_57179_000019_000001	train-clean-360	You should think of it very seriously 
4331_57179_000019_000002	train-clean-360	As for money you know you have none of your own and I am told that he has a very nice property in Rufford 
4331_57179_000019_000003	train-clean-360	There is a neighbour of his coming here to morrow and perhaps he knows him 
none	none	Who is the neighbour aunt asked Arabella innocently Lord Rufford 
4331_57179_000021_000001	train-clean-360	He is coming to shoot 
4331_57179_000021_000002	train-clean-360	I will ask him about the property 
none	none	Pray don t mention my name aunt It would be so unpleasant if nothing were to come of it I
4331_57179_000023_000000	train-clean-360	 know Lord Rufford very well 
none	none	Know Lord Rufford very well
4331_57179_000024_000000	train-clean-360	 As one does know men that one meets about 
4331_57179_000025_000000	train-clean-360	 I thought it might settle everything if we had mister Morton here 
4331_57179_000026_000000	train-clean-360	 I couldn t meet him aunt I couldn t indeed 
none	none	Mamma doesn t think that he is behaving well To the Duchess condemnation from Lady Augustus almost amounted to praise She felt sure that mister Morton was a worthy man who would not probably behave badly and though she could not unravel the mystery and certainly had no suspicion in regard to Lord Rufford she was sure that there was something wrong But there was nothing more to be said at present 
4331_57179_000026_000003	train-clean-360	After what Arabella had told her mister Morton could not be asked there to meet her niece But all the slight feeling of kindness to the girl which had been created by the tidings of so respectable an engagement were at once obliterated from the Duchess s bosom 
4331_57179_000026_000004	train-clean-360	Arabella with many expressions of thanks and a good humoured countenance left the room cursing the untowardness of her fate which would let nothing run smooth 
4331_57179_000027_000000	train-clean-360	Lord Rufford was to come 
4331_57179_000027_000001	train-clean-360	That at any rate was now almost certain Up to the present she had doubted knowing the way in which such men will change their engagements at the least caprice 
4331_57179_000027_000002	train-clean-360	But the Duchess expected him on the morrow 
none	none	She had prepared the way for meeting him as an old friend without causing surprise and had gained that step But should she succeed as she hoped in exacting continued homage from the man homage for the four or five days of his sojourn at Mistletoe this must be carried on with the knowledge on the part of many in the house that she was engaged to that horrid Patagonian Minister Was ever a girl called upon to risk her entire fate under so many disadvantages 
4331_57179_000028_000000	train-clean-360	When she went up to dress for dinner on the day of his expected arrival Lord Rufford had not come 
none	none	Since the interview in her aunt s room she had not heard his name mentioned 
4331_57179_000028_000002	train-clean-360	When she came into the drawing room a little late he was not there 
4331_57179_000028_000003	train-clean-360	 We won t wait Duchess said the Duke to his wife at three minutes past eight 
4331_57179_000028_000004	train-clean-360	The Duke s punctuality at dinner time was well known and everybody else was then assembled 
4331_57179_000028_000005	train-clean-360	Within two minutes after the Duke s word dinner was announced and a party numbering about thirty walked away into the dinner room 
4331_57179_000028_000006	train-clean-360	Arabella when they were all settled found that there was a vacant seat next herself 
4331_57179_000028_000007	train-clean-360	If the man were to come fortune would have favoured her in that 
4331_57179_000029_000000	train-clean-360	The fish and soup had already disappeared and the Duke was wakening himself to eloquence on the first entree when Lord Rufford entered the room 
4331_57179_000029_000001	train-clean-360	 There never were trains so late as yours Duchess he said nor any part of the world in which hired horses travel so slowly 
4331_57179_000029_000002	train-clean-360	I beg the Duke s pardon but I suffer the less because I know his Grace never waits for anybody 
4331_57179_000030_000000	train-clean-360	 Certainly not said the Duke having some regard for my friends dinners 
4331_57179_000031_000000	train-clean-360	 And I find myself next to you said Lord Rufford as he took his seat 
none	none	Well that is more than I deserve CHAPTER X HOW THINGS WERE ARRANGED
4331_57180_000004_000000	train-clean-360	 Jack is here said Lord Rufford as soon as the fuss of his late arrival had worn itself away 
4331_57180_000005_000000	train-clean-360	 I shall be proud to renew my acquaintance 
4331_57180_000006_000000	train-clean-360	 Can you come to morrow 
4331_57180_000007_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh yes said Arabella rapturously 
4331_57180_000008_000000	train-clean-360	 There are difficulties and I ought to have written to you about them 
4331_57180_000008_000001	train-clean-360	I am going with the Fitzwilliam Now Mistletoe was in Lincolnshire not very far from Peterborough not very far from Stamford not very far from Oakham 
none	none	A regular hunting man like Lord Rufford knew how to compass the difficulties of distance in all hunting countries Horses could go by one train or overnight and he could follow by another 
4331_57180_000008_000004	train-clean-360	And a postchaise could meet him here or there 
4331_57180_000008_000005	train-clean-360	But when a lady is added the difficulty is often increased fivefold 
4331_57180_000009_000000	train-clean-360	 Is it very far asked Arabella 
4331_57180_000010_000000	train-clean-360	 It is a little far 
4331_57180_000010_000001	train-clean-360	I wonder who are going from here 
none	none	Heaven only knows 
4331_57180_000011_000001	train-clean-360	I have passed my time in playing cat s cradle with Sir Jeffrey Bunker for the amusement of the company and in confidential communications with my aunt and Lady Drummond 
none	none	I haven t heard hunting mentioned Have you anything on wheels going across to Holcombe Cross to morrow Duke asked Lord Rufford 
4331_57180_000012_000001	train-clean-360	The Duke said that he did not know of anything on wheels going to Holcombe Cross 
4331_57180_000012_000002	train-clean-360	Then a hunting man who had heard the question said that he and another intended to travel by train to Oundle 
4331_57180_000012_000003	train-clean-360	Upon this Lord Rufford turned round and looked at Arabella mournfully 
4331_57180_000013_000000	train-clean-360	 Cannot I go by train to Oundle she asked 
4331_57180_000014_000000	train-clean-360	 Nothing on earth so jolly if your pastors and masters and all that will let you 
none	none	I haven t got any pastors and masters
4331_57180_000016_000000	train-clean-360	 The Duchess suggested Lord Rufford 
4331_57180_000017_000000	train-clean-360	 I thought all that kind of nonsense was over said Arabella 
4331_57180_000018_000000	train-clean-360	 I believe a great deal is over 
4331_57180_000018_000001	train-clean-360	You can do many things that your mother and grandmother couldn t do but absolute freedom what you may call universal suffrage hasn t come yet I fear 
none	none	It s twenty miles by road and the Duchess would say something awful if I were to propose to take you in a postchaise
4331_57180_000019_000000	train-clean-360	 But the railway 
4331_57180_000020_000000	train-clean-360	 I m afraid that would be worse 
4331_57180_000020_000001	train-clean-360	We couldn t ride back you know as we did at Rufford 
none	none	At the best it would be rather a rough and tumble kind of arrangement I m afraid we must put it off 
4331_57180_000020_000004	train-clean-360	To tell you the truth I m the least bit in the world afraid of the Duchess 
4331_57180_000021_000000	train-clean-360	 I am not at all said Arabella angrily 
4331_57180_000022_000000	train-clean-360	Then Lord Rufford ate his dinner and seemed to think that that matter was settled 
4331_57180_000022_000001	train-clean-360	Arabella knew that he might have hunted elsewhere that the Cottesmore would be out in their own county within twelve miles of them and that the difficulty of that ride would be very much less 
4331_57180_000022_000002	train-clean-360	The Duke might have been persuaded to send a carriage that distance 
4331_57180_000022_000003	train-clean-360	But Lord Rufford cared more about the chance of a good run than her company 
none	none	For a while she was sulky for a little while till she remembered how ill she could afford to indulge in such a feeling Then she said a demure word or two to the gentleman on the other side of her who happened to be a clergyman and did not return to the hunting till Lord Rufford had eaten his cheese
4331_57180_000022_000006	train-clean-360	 And is that to be the end of Jack as far as I m concerned 
4331_57180_000023_000000	train-clean-360	 I have been thinking about it ever since 
4331_57180_000023_000001	train-clean-360	This is Thursday 
4331_57180_000024_000000	train-clean-360	 Not a doubt about it 
4331_57180_000025_000000	train-clean-360	 To morrow will be Friday and the Duke has his great shooting on Saturday 
none	none	There s nothing within a hundred miles of us on Saturday 
4331_57180_000025_000002	train-clean-360	I shall go with the Pytchley if I don t shoot but I shall have to get up just when other people are going to bed 
4331_57180_000025_000003	train-clean-360	That wouldn t suit you 
4331_57180_000026_000000	train-clean-360	 I wouldn t mind if I didn t go to bed at all 
4331_57180_000027_000000	train-clean-360	 At any rate it wouldn t suit the Duchess 
none	none	I had meant to go away on Sunday 
4331_57180_000027_000002	train-clean-360	I hate being anywhere on Sunday except in a railway carriage But if I thought the Duke would keep me till Tuesday morning we might manage Peltry on Monday 
4331_57180_000027_000003	train-clean-360	I meant to have got back to Surbiton s on Sunday and have gone from there 
4331_57180_000028_000000	train-clean-360	 Where is Peltry 
4331_57180_000029_000000	train-clean-360	 It s a Cottesmore meet about five miles this side of Melton 
4331_57180_000030_000000	train-clean-360	 We could ride from here 
4331_57180_000031_000000	train-clean-360	 It s rather far for that but we could talk over the Duke to send a carriage 
4331_57180_000031_000001	train-clean-360	Ladies always like to see a meet and perhaps we could make a party 
4331_57180_000031_000002	train-clean-360	If not we must put a good face on it and go in anything we can get 
4331_57180_000031_000003	train-clean-360	I shouldn t fear the Duchess so much for twelve miles as I should for twenty 
4331_57180_000032_000000	train-clean-360	 I don t mean to let the Duchess interfere with me said Arabella in a whisper 
none	none	That evening Lord Rufford was very good natured and managed to arrange everything Lady Chiltern and another lady said that they would be glad to go to the meet and a carriage or carriages were organised But nothing was said as to Arabella s hunting because the question would immediately be raised as to her return to Mistletoe in the evening 
4331_57180_000033_000003	train-clean-360	It was however understood that she was to have a place in the carriage 
4331_57180_000034_000000	train-clean-360	Arabella had gained two things 
4331_57180_000034_000001	train-clean-360	She would have her one day s hunting and she had secured the presence of Lord Rufford at Mistletoe for Sunday 
4331_57180_000034_000002	train-clean-360	With such a man as his lordship it was almost impossible to find a moment for confidential conversation 
4331_57180_000034_000003	train-clean-360	He worked so hard at his amusements that he was as bad a lover as a barrister who has to be in Court all day almost as bad as a sailor who is always going round the world 
4331_57180_000034_000004	train-clean-360	On this evening it was ten o clock before the gentlemen came into the drawing room and then Lord Rufford s time was spent in arranging the party for the meet on Monday 
4331_57180_000034_000005	train-clean-360	When the ladies went up to bed Arabella had had no other opportunity than what Fortune had given her at dinner 
4331_57180_000035_000000	train-clean-360	And even then she had been watched 
none	none	That juxtaposition at the dinner table had come of chance and had been caused by Lord Rufford s late arrival Old Sir Jeffrey should have been her neighbour with the clergyman on the other side an arrangement which Her Grace had thought safe with reference to the rights of the Minister to Patagonia 
4331_57180_000035_000003	train-clean-360	The Duchess though she was at some distance down the table had seen that her niece and Lord Rufford were intimate and remembered immediately what had been said up stairs 
4331_57180_000035_000004	train-clean-360	They could not have talked as they were then talking sometimes whispering as the Duchess could perceive very well unless there had been considerable former intimacy 
4331_57180_000035_000005	train-clean-360	She began gradually to understand various things why Arabella Trefoil had been so anxious to come to Mistletoe just at this time why she had behaved so unlike her usual self before Lord Rufford s arrival and why she had been so unwilling to have mister Morton invited 
4331_57180_000035_000006	train-clean-360	The Duchess was in her way a clever woman and could see many things 
4331_57180_000035_000007	train-clean-360	She could see that though her niece might be very anxious to marry Lord Rufford Lord Rufford might indulge himself in a close intimacy with the girl without any such intention on his part 
4331_57180_000035_000008	train-clean-360	And as far as the family was concerned she would have been quite contented with the Morton alliance 
4331_57180_000035_000009	train-clean-360	She would have asked Morton now only that it would be impossible that he should come in time to be of service 
none	none	Had she been consulted in the first instance she would have put her veto on that drive to the meet but she had heard nothing about it until Lady Chiltern had said that she would go 
4331_57180_000035_000011	train-clean-360	The Duchess of Omnium had since declared that she also would go and there were to be two carriages 
4331_57180_000035_000012	train-clean-360	But still it never occurred to the Duchess that Arabella intended to hunt 
4331_57180_000035_000013	train-clean-360	Nor did Arabella intend that she should know it till the morning came 
4331_57180_000036_000000	train-clean-360	The Friday was very dull 
none	none	The hunting men of course had gone before Arabella came down to breakfast She would willingly have got up at seven to pour out Lord Rufford s tea had that been possible but as it was she strolled into the breakfast room at half past ten She could see by her aunt s eye and hear in her voice that she was in part detected and that she would do herself no further service by acting the good girl and she therefore resolutely determined to listen to no more twaddle She read a French novel which she had brought with her and spent as much of the day as she could in her bedroom 
4331_57180_000036_000004	train-clean-360	She did not see Lord Rufford before dinner and at dinner sat between Sir Jeffrey and an old gentleman out of Stamford who dined at Mistletoe that evening 
4331_57180_000036_000005	train-clean-360	 We ve had no such luck to night Lord Rufford said to her in the drawing room 
4331_57180_000037_000000	train-clean-360	 The old dragon took care of that replied Arabella 
none	none	Why should the old dragon think that I m dangerous
4331_57180_000039_000000	train-clean-360	 Because I can t very well tell you why but I dare say you know 
none	none	And do you think I am dangerous You re a sort of a five barred gate said Arabella laughing
4331_57180_000041_000001	train-clean-360	 Of course there is a little danger but who is going to be stopped by that 
4331_57180_000042_000000	train-clean-360	He could make no reply to this because the Duchess called him away to give some account to Lady Chiltern about Goarly and the U R U Lady Chiltern s husband being a master of hounds and a great authority on all matters relating to hunting 
4331_57180_000042_000001	train-clean-360	 Nasty old dragon Arabella said to herself when she was thus left alone 
4331_57180_000043_000000	train-clean-360	The Saturday was the day of the great shooting and at two o clock the ladies went out to lunch with the gentlemen by the side of the wood 
4331_57180_000043_000001	train-clean-360	Lord Rufford had at last consented to be one of the party 
4331_57180_000043_000002	train-clean-360	With logs of trees a few hurdles and other field appliances a rustic banqueting hall was prepared and everything was very nice 
4331_57180_000043_000003	train-clean-360	Tons of game had been killed and tons more were to be killed after luncheon The Duchess was not there and Arabella contrived so to place herself that she could be waited upon by Lord Rufford or could wait upon him 
none	none	Of course a great many eyes were upon her but she knew how to sustain that 
4331_57180_000043_000005	train-clean-360	Nobody was present who could dare to interfere with her 
none	none	When the eating and drinking were over she walked with him to his corner by the next covert not heeding the other ladies and she stood with him for some minutes after the slaughter had begun 
4331_57180_000043_000007	train-clean-360	She had come to feel that the time was slipping between her fingers and that she must say something effective 
none	none	The fatal word upon which everything would depend must be spoken at the very latest on their return home on Monday and she was aware that much must probably be said before that
4331_57180_000043_000009	train-clean-360	 Do we hunt or shoot to morrow she said 
4331_57180_000044_000000	train-clean-360	 To morrow is Sunday 
4331_57180_000045_000000	train-clean-360	 I am quite aware of that but I didn t know whether you could live a day without sport 
4331_57180_000046_000000	train-clean-360	 The country is so full of prejudice that I am driven to Sabbatical quiescence 
4331_57180_000047_000000	train-clean-360	 Take a walk with me to morrow said Arabella 
4331_57180_000048_000000	train-clean-360	 But the Duchess exclaimed Lord Rufford in a stage whisper 
4331_57180_000048_000001	train-clean-360	One of the beaters was so near that he could not but have heard but what does a beater signify 
none	none	H mh m the Duchess You be at the path behind the great conservatory at half past three and we won t mind the Duchess Lord Rufford was forced to ask for many other particulars as to the locality and then promised that he would be there at the time named CHAPTER XI YOU ARE SO SEVERE On the next morning Arabella went to church as did of course a great many of the party By remaining at home she could only have excited suspicion The church was close to the house and the family pew consisted of a large room screened off from the rest of the church with a fire place of its own so that the labour of attending divine service was reduced to a minimum At two o clock they lunched and that amusement lasted nearly an hour There was an afternoon service at three in attending which the Duchess was very particular The Duke never went at that time nor was it expected that any of the gentlemen would do so but women are supposed to require more church than men and the Duchess rather made it a point that at any rate the young ladies staying in the house should accompany her Over the other young ladies there her authority could only be that of influence but such authority generally sufficed From her niece it might be supposed that she would exact obedience and in this instance she tried it We start in five minutes she said to Arabella as that young lady was loitering at the table Don t wait for me aunt I m not going said Arabella boldly I hope you will come to church with us said the Duchess sternly Not this afternoon Why not Arabella I never do go to church twice on Sundays Some people do and some people don t I suppose that s about it I think that all young women ought to go to church on Sunday afternoon unless there is something particular to prevent them Arabella shrugged her shoulders and the Duchess stalked angrily away That makes me feel so awfully wicked said the Duchess of Omnium who was the only other lady then left in the room Then she got up and went out and Arabella of course followed her Lord Rufford had heard it all but had stood at the window and said nothing He had not been to church at all and was quite accustomed to the idea that as a young nobleman who only lived for pleasure he was privileged to be wicked Had the Duchess of Mayfair been blessed with a third daughter fit for marriage she would not have thought of repudiating such a suitor as Lord Rufford because he did not go to church When the house was cleared Arabella went upstairs and put on her hat It was a bright beautiful winter s day not painfully cold because the air was dry but still a day that warranted furs and a muff Having prepared herself she made her way alone to a side door which led from a branch of the hall on to the garden terrace and up and down that she walked two or three times so that any of the household that saw her might perceive that she had come out simply for exercise At the end of the third turn instead of coming back she went on quickly to the conservatory and took the path which led round to the further side There was a small lawn here fitted for garden games and on the other end of it an iron gate leading to a path into the woods At the further side of the iron gate and leaning against it stood Lord Rufford smoking a cigar She did not pause a moment but hurried across the lawn to join him He opened the gate and she passed through I m not going to be done by a dragon she said as she took her place alongside of him Upon my word Miss Trefoil I don t think I ever knew a human being with so much pluck as you have got Girls have to have pluck if they don t mean to be sat upon a great deal more than men The idea of telling me that I was to go to church as though I were twelve years old What would she say if she knew that you were walking here with me I don t care what she d say I dare say she walked with somebody once only I should think the somebody must have found it very dull Does she know that you re to hunt to morrow I haven t told her and don t mean I shall just come down in my habit and hat and say nothing about it At what time must we start The carriages are ordered for half past nine But I m afraid you haven t clearly before your eyes all the difficulties which are incidental to hunting What do you mean It looks as like a black frost as anything I ever saw in my life But we should go The horses won t be there if there is a really hard frost Nobody would stir It will be the first question I shall ask the man when he comes to me and if there have been seven or eight degrees of frost I shan t get up How am I to know My man shall tell your maid But everybody will soon know all about it It will alter everything I think I shall go mad In white satin No in my habit and hat It will be the hardest thing after all I ought to have insisted on going to Holcombe Cross on Friday The sun is shining now Surely it cannot freeze It will be uncommonly ill bred if it does But after all the hunting was not the main point The hunting had been only intended as an opportunity and if that were to be lost in which case Lord Rufford would no doubt at once leave Mistletoe there was the more need for using the present hour the more for using even the present minute Though she had said that the sun was shining it was the setting sun and in another half hour the gloom of the evening would be there Even Lord Rufford would not consent to walk about with her in the dark Oh Lord Rufford she said I did so look forward to your giving me another lead Then she put her hand upon his arm and left it there It would have been nice said he drawing her hand a little on and remembering as he did so his own picture of himself on the cliff with his sister holding his coat tails If you could possibly know she said the condition I am in What condition I know that I can trust you I am sure that I can trust you Oh dear yes If you mean about telling I never tell anything That s what I do mean You remember that man at your place What man Poor Caneback Oh dear no I wish they could change places because then he could give me no more trouble That s wishing him to be dead whoever he is Yes Why should he persecute me I mean that man we were staying with at Bragton mister Morton Of course I do Don t you remember your asking me about him and my telling you that I was not engaged to him I remember that Mamma and this horrid old Duchess here want me to marry him They ve got an idea that he is going to be ambassador at Pekin or something very grand and they re at me day and night You needn t take him unless you like him They do make me so miserable And then she leaned heavily upon his arm He was a man who could not stand such pressure as this without returning it Though he were on the precipice and though he must go over still he could not stand it You remember that night after the ball Indeed I do And you too had asked me whether I cared for that horrid man I didn t see anything horrid You had been staying at his house and people had told me What was I to think You ought to have known what to think There let me go for now he had got his arm round her waist You don t care for me a bit I know you don t It would be all the same to you whom I married or whether I died You don t think that Bella He fancied that he had heard her mother call her Bella and that the name was softer and easier than the full four syllables It was at any rate something for her to have gained I do think it When I came here on purpose to have a skurry over the country with you you went away to Holcombe Cross though you could have hunted here close in the neighbourhood And now you tell me there will be a frost to morrow Can I help that darling Darling I ain t your darling You don t care a bit for me I believe you hope there ll be a frost He pressed her tighter but laughed as he did so It was evidently a joke to him a pleasant joke no doubt Leave me alone Lord Rufford I won t let you for I know you don t love me Very suddenly he did leave his hold of her and stood erect with his hands in his pockets for the rustle of a dress was heard It was still daylight but the light was dim and the last morsel of the grandeur of the sun had ceased to be visible through the trees The church going people had been released and the Duchess having probably heard certain tidings had herself come to take a walk in the shrubbery behind the conservatory Arabella had probably been unaware that she and her companion by a turn in the walks were being brought back towards the iron gate As it was they met the Duchess face to face Lord Rufford had spoken the truth when he had said that he was a little afraid of the Duchess Such was his fear that at the moment he hardly knew what he was to say Arabella had boasted when she had declared that she was not at all afraid of her aunt but she was steadfastly minded that she would not be cowed by her fears She had known beforehand that she would have occasion for much presence of mind and was prepared to exercise it at a moment s notice She was the first to speak Is that you aunt you are out of church very soon Lord Rufford said the Duchess I don t think this is a proper time for walking out Don t you Duchess The air is very nice It is becoming dark and my niece had better return to the house with me Arabella you can come this way It is just as short as the other If you go on straight Lord Rufford it will take you to the house Of course Lord Rufford went on straight and of course Arabella had to turn with her aunt Such conduct as this is shocking began the Duchess Aunt let me tell you What can you tell me I can tell you a great deal if you will let me Of course I am quite prepared to own that I did not intend to tell you anything I can well believe that Because I could hardly hope for your sympathy You have never liked me You have no right to say that I don t do it in the way of finding fault I don t know why you should But I have been too much afraid of you to tell you my secrets I must do so now because you have found me walking with Lord Rufford I could not otherwise excuse myself Is he engaged to marry you He has asked me No But he has aunt You must be a little patient and let me tell it you all Mamma did make up an engagement between me and mister Morton at Washington Did you know Lord Rufford then I knew him but did not think he was behaving quite well It is very hard sometimes to know what a man means I was angry when I went to Washington He has told me since that he loves me and has offered But you are engaged to marry the other man Nothing on earth shall make me marry mister Morton Mamma did it and mamma now has very nearly broken it off because she says he is very shabby about money Indeed it is broken off I had told him so even before Lord Rufford had proposed to me When did he propose and where At Rufford We were staying there in November And you asked to come here that you might meet him Just so Was that strange Where could I be better pleased to meet him than in my own uncle s house Yes if you had told us all this before Perhaps I ought but you are so severe that I did not dare Do not turn against me now My uncle could not but like that his niece should marry Lord Rufford How can I turn against you if it is settled Lord Rufford can do as he pleases Has he told your father or your mother Mamma knows it But not from him asked the Duchess Arabella paused a moment but hardly a moment before she answered It was hard upon her that she should have to make up her mind on matters of such importance with so little time for consideration Yes she said mamma knows it from him Papa is so very indifferent about everything that Lord Rufford has not spoken to him If so it will be best that the Duke should speak to him There was another pause but hardly long enough to attract notice Perhaps so she said but not quite yet He is so peculiar so touchy The Duke is not quite like my father and he would think himself suspected I cannot imagine that if he is in earnest That is because you do not know him as I do Only think where I should be if I were to lose him Lose him Oh aunt now that you know it I do hope that you will be my friend It would kill me if he were to throw me over But why should he throw you over if he proposed to you only last month He might do it if he thought that he were interfered with Of course I should like my uncle to speak to him but not quite immediately If he were to say that he had changed his mind what could I do or what could my uncle do That would be very singular conduct Men are so different now aunt They give themselves so much more latitude A man has only to say that he has changed his mind and nothing ever comes of it I have never been used to such men my dear At any rate do not ask the Duke to speak to him to day I will think about it and perhaps you will let me see you to morrow after we all come in To this the Duchess gravely assented And I hope you won t be angry because you found me walking with him or because I did not go to church It is everything to me I am sure dear aunt you will understand that To this the Duchess made no reply and they both entered the house together What became of Lord Rufford neither of them saw Arabella when she regained her room thought that upon the whole fortune had favoured her by throwing her aunt in her way She had no doubt been driven to tell a series of barefaced impudent lies lies of such a nature that they almost made her own hair stand on end as she thought of them but they would matter nothing if she succeeded and if she failed in this matter she did not care much what her aunt thought of her Her aunt might now do her a good turn and some lies she must have told such had been the emergencies of her position As she thought of it all she was glad that her aunt had met her and when Lord Rufford was summoned to take her out to dinner on that very Sunday a matter as to which her aunt managed everything herself she was immediately aware that her lies had done her good service This was more than I expected Lord Rufford said when they were seated She knew that she had overdone it when she sent you away in that cavalier way replied Arabella and now she wants to show that she didn t mean anything CHAPTER XII THE DAY AT PELTRY The Duchess did tell the Duke the whole story about Lord Rufford and Arabella that night as to which it may be said that she also was false But according to her conscience there were two ways of telling such a secret As a matter of course she told her husband everything That idle placid dinner loving man was in truth consulted about each detail of the house and family but the secret was told to him with injunctions that he was to say nothing about it to any one for twenty four hours After that the Duchess was of opinion that he should speak to Lord Rufford What could I say to him asked the Duke I m not her father But your brother is so indifferent No doubt But that gives me no authority If he does mean to marry the girl he must go to her father or it is possible that he might come to me But if he does not mean it what can I do He promised however that he would think of it It was still dark night or the morning was still dark as night when Arabella got out of bed and opened her window The coming of a frost now might ruin her The absence of it might give her everything in life that she wanted Lord Rufford had promised her a tedious communication through servants as to the state of the weather She was far too energetic far too much in earnest to wait for that She opened the window and putting out her hand she felt a drizzle of rain And the air though the damp from it seemed to chill her all through was not a frosty air She stood there a minute so as to be sure and then retreated to her bed Fortune was again favouring her but then how would it be if it should turn to hard rain In that case Lady Chiltern and the other ladies certainly would not go and how in such case should she get herself conveyed to the meet She would at any rate go down in her hat and habit and trust that somebody would provide for her There might be much that would be disagreeable and difficult but hardly anything could be worse than the necessity of telling such lies as those which she had fabricated on the previous afternoon She had been much in doubt whether her aunt had or had not believed her That the belief was not a thorough belief she was almost certain But then there was the great fact that after the story had been told she had been sent out to dinner leaning on Lord Rufford s arm Unless her aunt had believed something that would not have taken place And then so much of it was true Surely it would be impossible that he should not propose after what had occurred Her aunt was evidently alive to the advantage of the marriage to the advantage which would accrue not to her Arabella individually but to the Trefoils generally She almost thought that her aunt would not put spokes in her wheel for this day She wished now that she had told her aunt that she intended to hunt so that there need not be any surprise She slept again and again looked out of the window It rained a little but still there were hours in which the rain might cease Again she slept and at eight her maid brought her word that there would be hunting It did rain a little but very little Of course she would dress herself in riding attire At nine o clock she walked into the breakfast parlour properly equipped for the day s sport There were four or five men there in red coats and top boots among whom Lord Rufford was conspicuous They were just seating themselves at the breakfast table and her aunt was already in her place Lady Chiltern had come into the room with herself and at the door had spoken some good natured words of surprise I did not know that you were a sportswoman Miss Trefoil I do ride a little when I am well mounted Arabella had said as she entered the room Then she collected herself and arranged her countenance and endeavoured to look as though she were doing the most ordinary thing in the world She went round the room and kissed her aunt s brow This she had not done on any other morning but then on other mornings she had been late Are you going to ride said the Duchess I believe so aunt Who is giving you a horse Lord Rufford is lending me one I don t think even his good nature will extend to giving away so perfect an animal I know him well for I rode him when I was at Rufford This she said so that all the room should hear her You need not be afraid Duchess said Lord Rufford He is quite safe And his name is Jack said Arabella laughing as she took her place with a little air of triumph Lord Rufford offered to let me have him all the time I was here but I didn t know whether you would take me in so attended There was not one who heard her who did not feel that she spoke as though Lord Rufford were all her own Lord Rufford felt it himself and almost thought he might as well turn himself round and bid his sister and Miss Penge let him go He must marry some day and why should not this girl do as well as any one else The Duchess did not approve of young ladies hunting She certainly would not have had her niece at Mistletoe had she expected such a performance But she could not find fault now There was a feeling in her bosom that if there were an engagement it would be cruel to cause obstructions She certainly could not allow a lover in her house for her husband s niece without having official authenticated knowledge of the respectability of the lover but the whole thing had come upon her so suddenly that she was at a loss what to do or what to say It certainly did not seem to her that Arabella was in the least afraid of being found out in any untruth If the girl were about to become Lady Rufford then it would be for Lord Rufford to decide whether or no she should hunt Soon after this the Duke came in and he also alluded to his niece s costume and was informed that she was to ride one of Lord Rufford s horses I didn t hear it mentioned before said the Duke He ll carry Miss Trefoil quite safely said Lord Rufford who was at the moment standing over a game pie on the sideboard Then the subject was allowed to drop At half past nine there was no rain and the ladies were so nearly punctual that the carriages absolutely started at ten Some of the men rode on one got a seat on the carriage and Lord Rufford drove himself and a friend in a dog cart tandem The tandem was off before the carriages but Lord Rufford assured them that he would get the master to allow them a quarter of an hour Arabella contrived to say one word to him If you start without me I ll never speak to you again He nodded and smiled but perhaps thought that if so it might be as well that he should start without waiting for her At the last moment the Duchess had taken it into her head that she too would go to the meet No doubt she was actuated by some feeling in regard to her niece but it was not till Arabella was absolutely getting on to Jack at the side of the carriage under the auspices of Jack s owner that the idea occurred to her Grace that there would be a great difficulty as to the return home Arabella how do you mean to get back she asked That will be all right aunt said Arabella I will see to that said Lord Rufford The gracious but impatient master of the hounds had absolutely waited full twenty minutes for the Duchess s party and was not minded to wait a minute longer for conversation The moment that the carriages were there the huntsmen had started so that there was an excuse for hurry Lord Rufford as he was speaking got on to his own horse and before the Duchess could expostulate they were away There was a feeling of triumph in Arabella s bosom as she told herself that she had at any rate secured her day s hunting in spite of such heart breaking difficulties The sport was fairly good They had twenty minutes in the morning and a kill Then they drew a big wood during which they ate their lunch and drank their sherry In the big wood they found a fox but could not do anything with him After that they came on a third in a stubble field and ran him well for half an hour when he went to ground It was then three o clock and as the days were now at the shortest the master declined to draw again They were then about sixteen miles from Mistletoe and about ten from Stamford where Lord Rufford s horses were standing The distance from Stamford to Mistletoe was eight Lord Rufford proposed that they should ride to Stamford and then go home in a hired carriage There seemed indeed to be no other way of getting home without taking three tired horses fourteen miles out of their way Arabella made no objection whatever to the arrangement Lord Rufford did in truth make a slight effort the slightest possible to induce a third person to join their party There was still something pulling at his coat tail so that there might yet be a chance of saving him from the precipice But he failed The tired horseman before whom the suggestion was casually thrown out would have been delighted to accept it instead of riding all the way to Mistletoe but he did not look upon it as made in earnest Two he knew were company and three none The hunting field is by no means a place suited for real love making Very much of preliminary conversation may be done there in a pleasant way and intimacies may be formed But when lovers have already walked with arms round each other in a wood riding together may be very pleasant but can hardly be ecstatic Lord Rufford might indeed have asked her to be Lady R while they were breaking up the first fox or as they loitered about in the big wood but she did not expect that There was no moment during the day s sport in which she had a right to tell herself that he was misbehaving because he did not so ask her But in a postchaise it would be different At the inn at Stamford the horses were given up and Arabella condescended to take a glass of cherry brandy She had gone through a long day it was then half past four and she was not used to be many hours on horseback The fatigue seemed to her to be very much greater than it had been when she got back to Rufford immediately after the fatal accident The ten miles along the road which had been done in little more than an hour had almost overcome her She had determined not to cry for mercy as the hard trot went on She had passed herself off as an accustomed horsewoman and having done so well across the country would not break down coming home But as she got into the carriage she was very tired She could almost have cried with fatigue and yet she told herself that now now must the work be done She would perhaps tell him that she was tired She might even assist her cause by her languor but though she should die for it she would not waste her precious moments by absolute rest May I light a cigar he said as he got in You know you may Wherever I may be with you do you think that I would interfere with your gratifications You are the best girl in all the world he said as he took out his case and threw himself back in the corner Do you call that a long day she asked when he had lit his cigar Not very long Because I am so tired We came home pretty sharp I thought it best not to shock her Grace by too great a stretch into the night As it is you will have time to go to bed for an hour or two before you dress That s what I do when I am in time You ll be right as a trivet then Oh I m right now only tired It was very nice Pretty well We ought to have killed that last fox And why on earth we made nothing of that fellow in Gooseberry Grove I couldn t understand Old Tony would never have left that fox alive above ground Would you like to go to sleep O dear no Afraid of gloves said he drawing nearer to her They might pull him as they liked by his coat tails but as he was in a postchaise with her he must make himself agreeable She shook her head and laughed as she looked at him through the gloom Then of course he kissed her Lord Rufford what does this mean Don t you know what it means Hardly It means that I think you the jolliest girl out I never liked anybody so well as I do you Perhaps you never liked anybody said she Well yes I have but I am not going to boast of what fortune has done for me in that way I wonder whether you care for me Do you want to know I should like to know You have never said that you did Because you have never asked me Am I not asking you now Bella There are different ways of asking but there is only one way that will get an answer from me No no I will not have it I have allowed too much to you already Oh I am so tired Then she sank back almost into his arms but recovered herself very quickly Lord Rufford she said if you are a man of honour let there be an end of this I am sure you do not wish to make me wretched I would do anything to make you happy Then tell me that you love me honestly sincerely with all your heart and I shall be happy You know I do Do you Do you she said and then she flung herself on to his shoulder and for a while she seemed to faint For a few minutes she lay there and as she was lying she calculated whether it would be better to try at this moment to drive him to some clearer declaration or to make use of what he had already said without giving him an opportunity of protesting that he had not meant to make her an offer of marriage He had declared that he loved her honestly and with his whole heart Would not that justify her in setting her uncle at him And might it not be that the Duke would carry great weight with him that the Duke might induce him to utter the fatal word though she were she to demand it now might fail As she thought of it all she affected to swoon and almost herself believed that she was swooning She was conscious but hardly more than conscious that he was kissing her and yet her brain was at work She felt that he would be startled repelled perhaps disgusted were she absolutely to demand more from him now Oh Rufford oh my dearest she said as she woke up and with her face close to his so that he could look into her eyes and see their brightness even through the gloom Then she extricated herself from his embrace with a shudder and a laugh You would hardly believe how tired I am she said putting out her ungloved hand He took it and drew her to him and there she sat in his arms for the short remainder of the journey They were now in the park and as the lights of the house came in sight he gave her some counsel Go up to your room at once dearest and lay down I will I don t think I could go in among them I should fall I will see the Duchess and tell her that you are all right but very tired If she goes up to you you had better see her Oh yes But I had rather not She ll be sure to come And Bella Jack must be yours now You are joking Never more serious in my life Of course he must remain with me just at present but he is your horse Then as the carriage was stopping she took his hand and kissed it She got to her room as quickly as possible and then before she had even taken off her hat she sat down to think of it all sending her maid away meanwhile to fetch her a cup of tea He must have meant it for an offer There had at any rate been enough to justify her in so taking it The present he had made to her of the horse could mean nothing else Under no other circumstances would it be possible that she should either take the horse or use him Certainly it was an offer and as such she would instruct her uncle to use it Then she allowed her imagination to revel in thoughts of Rufford Hall of the Rufford house in town and a final end to all those weary labours which she would thus have brought to so glorious a termination CHAPTER XIII LORD RUFFORD WANTS TO SEE A HORSE Lord Rufford had been quite right about the Duchess Arabella had only taken off her hat and was drinking her tea when the Duchess came up to her Lord Rufford says that you were too tired to come in said the Duchess I am tired aunt very tired But there is nothing the matter with me We had to ride ever so far coming home and it was that knocked me up It was very bad your coming home with him in a postchaise Arabella Why was it bad aunt I thought it very nice My dear it shouldn t have been done You ought to have known that I certainly wouldn t have had you here had I thought that there would be anything of the kind It is going to be all right said Arabella laughing According to her Grace s view of things it was not and could not be made all right It would not have been all right were the girl to become Lady Rufford to morrow The scandal or loud reproach due to evil doings may be silenced by subsequent conduct The merited punishment may not come visibly But nothing happening after could make it right that a young lady should come home from hunting in a postchaise alone with a young unmarried man When the Duchess first heard it she thought what would have been her feelings if such a thing had been suggested in reference to one of her own daughters Lord Rufford had come to her in the drawing room and had told her the story in a quiet pleasant manner merely saying that Miss Trefoil was too much fatigued to show herself at the present moment She had thought from his manner that her niece s story had been true There was a cordiality and apparent earnestness as to the girl s comfort which seemed to be compatible with the story But still she could hardly understand that Lord Rufford should wish to have it known that he travelled about the country in such a fashion with the girl he intended to marry But if it were true then she must look after her niece And even if it were not true in which case she would never have the girl at Mistletoe again yet she could not ignore her presence in the house It was now the eighteenth of January Lord Rufford was to go on the following day and Arabella on the twentieth The invitation had not been given so as to stretch beyond that If it could be at once decided declared by Lord Rufford to the Duke that the match was to be a match then the invitation should be renewed Arabella should be advised to put off her other friends and Lord Rufford should be invited to come back early in the next month and spend a week or two in the proper fashion with his future bride All that had been settled between the Duke and the Duchess So much should be done for the sake of the family But the Duke had not seen his way to asking Lord Rufford any question The Duchess must now find out the truth if she could so that if the story were false she might get rid of the girl and altogether shake her off from the Mistletoe roof tree Arabella s manner was certainly free from any appearance of hesitation or fear I don t know about being all right said the Duchess It cannot be right that you should have come home with him alone in a hired carriage Is a hired carriage wickeder than a private one If a carriage had been sent from here for you it would have been different but even then he should not have come with you But he would I m sure and I should have asked him What the man I m engaged to marry Mayn t he sit in a carriage with me The Duchess could not explain herself and thought that she had better drop that topic What does he mean to do now Arabella What does who mean aunt Lord Rufford He means to marry me And he means to go from here to mister Surbiton s to morrow I don t quite understand the question And what do you mean to do I mean to marry him And I mean to join mamma in London on Wednesday I believe we are to go to the Connop Green s the next day mister Connop Green is a sort of cousin of mamma but they are odious people Who is to see Lord Rufford However my dear if you are very tired I will leave you now No aunt Stay a moment if you will be so very kind I am tired but if I were twice as tired I would find strength to talk about this If my uncle would speak to Lord Rufford at once I should take it as the very kindest thing he could do I could not send him to my uncle for after all one s uncle and one s father are not the same I could only refer him to papa But if the Duke would speak to him Did he renew his offer to day He has done nothing else but renew it ever since he has been in the carriage with me That s the plain truth He made his offer at Rufford He renewed it in the wood yesterday and he repeated it over and over again as we came home to day It may have been very wrong but so it was Miss Trefoil must have thought that kissing and proposing were the same thing Other young ladies have perhaps before now made such a mistake But this young lady had had much experience and should have known better Lord Rufford had better perhaps speak to your uncle Will you tell him so aunt The Duchess thought about it for a moment She certainly could not tell Lord Rufford to speak to the Duke without getting the Duke s leave to tell him so And then if all this were done and Lord Rufford were to assure the Duke that the young lady had made a mistake how derogatory would all that be to the exalted quiescence of the house of Mayfair She thoroughly wished that her niece were out of the house for though she did believe the story her belief was not thorough I will speak to your uncle she said And now you had better go to sleep And dear aunt pray excuse me at dinner I have been so excited so flurried and so fatigued that I fear I should make a fool of myself if I attempted to come down I should get into a swoon which would be dreadful My maid shall bring me a bit of something and a glass of sherry and you shall find me in the drawing room when you come out Then the Duchess went and Arabella was left alone to take another view of the circumstances of the campaign Though there were still infinite dangers yet she could hardly wish that anything should be altered Should Lord Rufford disown her which she knew to be quite possible there would be a general collapse and the world would crash over her head But she had known when she took this business in hand that as success would open Elysium to her so would failure involve her in absolute ruin She was determined that she would mar nothing now by cowardice and having so resolved and having fortified herself with perhaps two glasses of sherry she went down to the drawing room a little before nine and laid herself out upon a sofa till the ladies should come in Lord Rufford had gone to bed as was his wont on such occasions with orders that he should be called to dress for dinner at half past seven But as he laid himself down he made up his mind that instead of sleeping he would give himself up to thinking about Arabella Trefoil The matter was going beyond a joke and would require some thinking He liked her well enough but was certainly not in love with her I doubt whether men ever are in love with girls who throw themselves into their arms A man s love till it has been chastened and fastened by the feeling of duty which marriage brings with it is instigated mainly by the difficulty of pursuit It is hardly possible that anything so sweet as that should ever be mine and yet because I am a man and because it is so heavenly sweet I will try That is what men say to themselves but Lord Rufford had had no opportunity of saying that to himself in regard to Miss Trefoil The thing had been sweet but not heavenly sweet and he had never for a moment doubted the possibility Now at any rate he would make up his mind But instead of doing so he went to sleep and when he got up he was ten minutes late and was forced as he dressed himself to think of the Duke s dinner instead of Arabella Trefoil The Duchess before dinner submitted herself and all her troubles at great length to the Duke but the Duke could give her no substantial comfort Of course it had all been wrong He supposed that they ought not to have been found walking together in the dark on Sunday afternoon The hunting should not have been arranged without sanction and the return home in the hired carriage had no doubt been highly improper But what could he do If the marriage came off it would be all well If not this niece must not be invited to Mistletoe again As to speaking to Lord Rufford he did not quite see how he was to set about it His own girls had been married in so very different a fashion He could imagine nothing so disagreeable as to have to ask a gentleman his intentions Parental duty might make it necessary when a daughter had not known how to keep her own position intact but here there was no parental duty If Lord Rufford would speak to him then indeed there would be no difficulty At last he told his wife that if she could find an opportunity of suggesting to the young Lord that he might perhaps say a word to the young lady s uncle without impropriety if she could do this in a light easy way so as to run no peril of a scene she might do so When the two duchesses and all the other ladies came out into the drawing room Arabella was found upon the sofa Of course she became the centre of a little interest for a few minutes and the more so as her aunt went up to her and made some inquiries Had she had any dinner Was she less fatigued The fact of the improper return home in the postchaise had become generally known and there were some there who would have turned a very cold shoulder to Arabella had not her aunt noticed her Perhaps there were some who had envied her Jack and Lord Rufford s admiration and even the postchaise But as long as her aunt countenanced her it was not likely that any one at Mistletoe would be unkind to her The Duchess of Omnium did indeed remark to Lady Chiltern that she remembered something of the same kind happening to the same girl soon after her own marriage As the Duchess had now been married a great many years this was unkind but it was known that when the Duchess of Omnium did dislike any one she never scrupled to show it Lord Rufford is about the silliest man of his day she said afterwards to the same lady but there is one thing which I do not think even he is silly enough to do It was nearly ten o clock when the gentlemen came into the room and then it was that the Duchess Arabella s aunt must find the opportunity of giving Lord Rufford the hint of which the Duke had spoken He was to leave Mistletoe on the morrow and might not improbably do so early Of all women she was the steadiest the most tranquil the least abrupt in her movements She could not pounce upon a man and nail him down and say what she had to say let him be as unwilling as he might to hear it At last however seeing Lord Rufford standing alone he had then just left the sofa on which Arabella was still lying without any apparent effort she made her way up to his side You had rather a long day she said Not particularly Duchess You had to come home so far About the average distance Did you think it a hard day Maurice Then he called to his aid a certain Lord Maurice saint John a hard riding and hard talking old friend of the Trefoil family who gave the Duchess a very clear account of all the performance during which Lord Rufford fell into an interesting conversation with missus Mulready the wife of the neighbouring bishop After that the Duchess made another attempt Lord Rufford she said we should be so glad if you would come back to us the first week in February The Prices will be here and the Mackenzies and I am pledged to stay with my sister till the fifth and on the sixth Surbiton and all his lot come to me Battersby is it not the sixth that you and Surbiton come to Rufford I rather think it is said Battersby I wish it were possible I like Mistletoe so much It s so central Very well for hunting is it not Lord Rufford But that horrid Captain Battersby did not go out of the way I wonder whether Lady Chiltern would do me a favour said Lord Rufford stepping across the room in search of that lady He might be foolish but when the Duchess of Omnium declared him to be the silliest man of the day I think she used a wrong epithet The Duchess was very patient and intended to try again but on that evening she got no opportunity Captain Battersby was Lord Rufford s particular friend on this occasion and had come over with him from mister Surbiton s house Bat he said as they were sitting close to each other in the smoking room that night I mean to make an early start to morrow What to get to Surbiton s I ve got something to do on the way I want to look at a horse at Stamford I ll be off with you No don t do that I ll go in my own cart I ll make my man get hold of my groom and manage it somehow I can leave my things and you can bring them Only say to morrow that I was obliged to go I understand Heard something you know and all that kind of thing Make my apologies to the Duchess In point of fact I must be in Stamford at ten I ll manage it all said Captain Battersby who made a very shrewd guess at the cause which drew his friend to such an uncomfortable proceeding After that Lord Rufford went to his room and gave a good deal of trouble that night to some of the servants in reference to the steps which would be necessary to take him out of harm s way before the Duchess would be up on the morrow Arabella when she heard of the man s departure on the following morning which she luckily did from her own maid was for some time overwhelmed by it Of course the man was running away from her There could be no doubt of it She had watched him narrowly on the previous evening and had seen that her aunt had tried in vain to speak to him But she did not on that account give up the game At any rate they had not found her out at Mistletoe That was something Of course it would have been infinitely better for her could he have been absolutely caught and nailed down before he left the house but that was perhaps more than she had a right to expect She could still pursue him still write to him and at last if necessary force her father to do so But she must trust now chiefly to her own correspondence He told me aunt the last thing last night that he was going she said Why did you not mention it I thought he would have told you I saw him speaking to you He had received some telegram about a horse He s the most flighty man in the world about such things I am to write to him before I leave this to morrow Then the Duchess did not believe a word of the engagement She felt at any rate certain that if there was an engagement Lord Rufford did not mean to keep it CHAPTER XIV THE SENATOR IS BADLY TREATED While these great efforts were being made by Arabella Trefoil at Mistletoe John Morton was vacillating in an unhappy mood between London and Bragton It may be remembered that an offer was made to him as to the purchase of Chowton Farm At that time the Mistletoe party was broken up and Miss Trefoil was staying with her mother at the Connop Greens By the morning post on the next day he received a note from the Senator in which mister Gotobed stated that business required his presence at Dillsborough and suggested that he should again become a guest at Bragton for a few days Morton was so sick of his own company and so tired of thinking of his own affairs that he was almost glad to welcome the Senator At any rate he had no means of escaping and the Senator came The two men were alone at the house and the Senator was full of his own wrongs as well as those of Englishmen in general mister Bearside had written to him very cautiously but pressing for an immediate remittance of Ltwenty five and explaining that the great case could not be carried on without that sum of money This might have been very well as being open to the idea that the Senator had the option of either paying the money or of allowing the great case to be abandoned but that the attorney in the last paragraph of his letter intimated that the Senator would be of course aware that he was liable for the whole cost of the action be it what it might He had asked a legal friend in London his opinion and the legal friend had seemed to think that perhaps he was liable What orders he had given to Bearside he had given without any witness and at any rate had already paid a certain sum The legal friend when he heard all that mister Gotobed was able to tell him about Goarly had advised the Senator to settle with Bearside taking a due receipt and having some person with him when he did so The legal friend had thought that a small sum of money would suffice He went so far as to suggest said the Senator with indignant energy that if I contested my liability to the man s charges the matter would go against me because I had interfered in such a case on the unpopular side I should think that in this great country I should find justice administered on other terms than that Morton attempted to explain to him that his legal friend had not been administering justice but only giving advice He had so Morton told him undoubtedly taken up the case of one blackguard and in urging it had paid his money to another He had done so as a foreigner loudly proclaiming as his reason for such action that the man he supported would be unfairly treated unless he gave his assistance Of course he could not expect sympathy I want no sympathy said the Senator I only want justice Then the two gentlemen had become a little angry with each other Morton was the last man in the world to have been aggressive on such a matter but with the Senator it was necessary either to be prostrate or to fight But with mister Gotobed such fighting never produced ill blood It was the condition of his life and it must be supposed that he liked it On the next morning he did not scruple to ask his host s advice as to what he had better do and they agreed to walk across to Goarly s house and to ascertain from the man himself what he thought or might have to say about his own case On their way they passed up the road leading to Chowton Farm and at the gate leading into the garden they found Larry Twentyman standing Morton shook hands with the young farmer and introduced the Senator Larry was still woe begone though he endeavoured to shake off his sorrows and to appear to be gay I never see much of the man he said when they told him that they were going across to call upon his neighbour and I don t know that I want to He doesn t seem to have much friendship among you all said the Senator Quite as much as he deserves mister Gotobed replied Larry The Senator s name had lately become familiar as a household word in Dillsborough and was to tell the truth odious to such men as Larry Twentyman He s a thundering rascal and the only place fit for him in the county is Rufford gaol He s like to be there soon I think That s what provokes me said the Senator You think he s a rascal Mister I do And because you take upon yourself to think so you d send him to Rufford gaol There was one gentleman somewhere about here told me he ought to be hung and because I would not agree with him he got up and walked away from me at table carrying his provisions with him Another man in the next field to this insulted me because I said I was going to see Goarly The clergyman in Dillsborough and the hotelkeepers were just as hard upon me But you see Mister that what we want to find out is whether Goarly or the Lord has the right of it in this particular case I know which has the right without any more finding out said Larry The shortest way to his house is by the ride through the wood mister Morton It takes you out on his land on the other side But I don t think you ll find him there One of my men told me that he had made himself scarce Then he added as the two were going on I should like to have just a word with you mister Morton I ve been thinking of what you said and I know it was kind I ll take a month over it I won t talk of selling Chowton till the end of February but if I feel about it then as I do now I can t stay That s right mister Twentyman and work hard like a man through the month Go out hunting and don t allow yourself a moment for moping I will said Larry as he retreated to the house and then he gave directions that his horse might be ready for the morrow They went in through the wood and the Senator pointed out the spot at which Bean the gamekeeper had been so insolent to him He could not understand he said why he should be treated so roughly as these men must be aware that he had nothing to gain himself If I were to go into Mickewa said Morton and interfere there with the peculiarities of the people as you have done here it s my belief that they d have had the eyes out of my head long before this That only shows that you don t know Mickewa said the Senator Its people are the most law abiding population on the face of the earth They passed through the wood and a couple of fields brought them to Goarly s house As they approached it by the back the only live thing they saw was the old goose which had been so cruelly deprived of her companions and progeny The goose was waddling round the dirty pool and there were to be seen sundry ugly signs of a poor man s habitation but it was not till they had knocked at the window as well as the door that missus Goarly showed herself She remembered the Senator at once and curtseyed to him and when Morton introduced himself she curtseyed again to the Squire of Bragton When Goarly was asked for she shook her head and declared that she knew nothing about him He had been gone she said for the last week and had left no word as to whither he was going nor had he told her why Has he given up his action against Lord Rufford asked the Senator Indeed then sir I can t tell you a word about it I ve been told that he has taken Lord Rufford s money He ain t a taken no money as I ve seed sir I wish he had for money s sore wanted here and if the general leman has a mind to be kind hearted Then she intimated her own readiness to take any contribution to the good cause which the Senator might be willing to make at that moment But the Senator buttoned up his breeches pockets with stern resolution Though he still believed Lord Rufford to be altogether wrong he was beginning to think that the Goarlys were not worthy his benevolence As she came to the door with them and accompanied them a few yards across the field she again told the tragic tale of her goose but the Senator had not another word to say to her On that same day Morton drove mister Gotobed into Dillsborough and consented to go with him to mister Bearside s office They found the attorney at home and before anything was said as to payment they heard his account of the action If Goarly had consented to take any money from Lord Rufford he knew nothing about it As far as he was aware the action was going on Ever so many witnesses must be brought from a distance who had seen the crop standing and who would have no bias against the owner as would be the case with neighbours such as Lawrence Twentyman Of course it was not easy to oppose such a man as Lord Rufford and a little money must be spent Indeed such he said was his interest in the case that he had already gone further than he ought to have done out of his own pocket Of course they would be successful that is if the matter were carried on with spirit and then the money would all come back again But just at present a little money must be spent I don t mean to spend it said the Senator I hope you won t stick to that mister Gotobed But I shall sir I understand from your letter that you look to me for funds Certainly I do mister Gotobed because you told me to do so I told you nothing of the kind mister Bearside You paid me Lfifteen on account mister Gotobed I paid you Lfifteen certainly And told me that more should be coming as it was wanted Do you think I should have gone on for such a man as Goarly a fellow without a shilling unless he had some one like you to back him It isn t likely Now mister Morton I appeal to you I don t suppose that my friend has made himself liable for your bill because he paid you Lfifteen with the view of assisting Goarly said Morton But he said that he meant to go on mister Morton He said that plain and I can swear it Now mister Gotobed you just say out like an honest man whether you didn t give me to understand that you meant to go on I never employed you or made myself responsible for your bill You authorized me distinctly most distinctly and I shall stick to it When a gentleman comes to a lawyer s office and pays his money and tells that lawyer as how he means to see the case out explaining his reasons as you did when you said all that against the landlords and squires and nobility of this here country why then that lawyer has a right to think that that gentleman is his mark I thought you were employed by mister Scrobby said Morton who had heard much of the story by this time Then mister Morton I must make bold to say that you have heard wrong I know nothing of mister Scrobby and don t want There ain t nothing about the poisoning of that fox in this case of ours Scrobby and Goarly may have done that or Scrobby and Goarly may be as innocent as two babes unborn for aught I know or care Excuse me mister Morton but I have to be on my p s and q s I see This is a case for trespass and damage against Lord Rufford in which we ask for forty s an acre Of course there is expenses There s my own time I ain t to be kept here talking to you two gentlemen for nothing I suppose Well this gentleman comes to me and pays me Lfifteen to go on I couldn t have gone on without something The gentleman saw that plain enough And he told me he d see me through the rest of it I said nothing of the kind sir Very well Then we must put it to a jury May I make bold to ask whether you are going out of the country all at once I shall be here for the next two months at least Happy to hear it sir and have no doubt it will all be settled before that time amiable or otherwise But as I am money out of pocket I did hope you would have paid me something on account to day Then mister Gotobed made his offer informing mister Bearside that he had brought his friend mister Morton with him in order that there might be a witness I could see that sir with half an eye said the attorney unabashed He was willing to pay mister Bearside a further sum of Lten immediately to be quit of the affair not because he thought that any such sum was due but because he wished to free himself from further trouble in the matter mister Bearside hinted in a very cavalier way that Ltwenty might be thought of A further payment of Ltwenty would cover the money he was out of pocket But this proposition mister Gotobed indignantly refused and then left the office with his friend Wherever there are lawyers there will be rogues said the Senator as soon as he found himself in the street It is a noble profession that of the law the finest perhaps that the work of the world affords but it gives scope and temptation for roguery I do not think however that you would find anything in America so bad as that Why did you go to him without asking any questions Of whom was I to ask questions When I took up Goarly s case he had already put it into this man s hands I am sorry you should be troubled mister Gotobed but upon my word I cannot say but what it serves you right That is because you are offended with me I endeavoured to protect a poor man against a rich man and that in this country is cause of offence After leaving the attorney s office they called on mister Mainwaring the rector and found that he knew or professed to know a great deal more about Goarly than they had learned from Bearside According to his story Nickem who was clerk to mister Masters had Goarly in safe keeping somewhere The rector indeed was acquainted with all the details Scrobby had purchased the red herrings and strychnine and had employed Goarly to walk over by night to Rufford and fetch them The poison at that time had been duly packed in the herrings Goarly had done this and had at Scrobby s instigation laid the bait down in Dillsborough Wood Nickem was now at work trying to learn where Scrobby had purchased the poison as it was feared that Goarly s evidence alone would not suffice to convict the man But if the strychnine could be traced and the herrings then there would be almost a certainty of punishing Scrobby And what about Goarly asked the Senator He would escape of course said the rector He would get a little money and after such an experience would probably become a good friend to fox hunting And quite a respectable man The rector did not guarantee this but seemed to think that there would at any rate be promise of improved conduct The place ought to be too hot to hold him exclaimed the Senator indignantly The rector seemed to think it possible that he might find it uncomfortable at first in which case he would sell the land at a good price to Lord Rufford and every one concerned would have been benefited by the transaction except Scrobby for whom no one would feel any pity The two gentlemen then promised to come and dine with the rector on the following day He feared he said that he could not make up a party as there was he declared nobody in Dillsborough I never knew such a place said the rector Except old Nupper who is there Masters is a very decent fellow himself but he has got out of that kind of thing and you can t ask a man without asking his wife As for clergymen I m sick of dining with my own cloth and discussing the troubles of sermons There never was such a place as Dillsborough Then he whispered a word to the Squire Was the Squire unwilling to meet his cousin Reginald Morton Things were said and people never knew what was true and what was false Then John Morton declared that he would be very happy to meet his cousin CHAPTER XV mister MAINWARING S LITTLE DINNER The company at the rector s house consisted of the Senator the two Mortons mister Surtees the curate and old Doctor Nupper missus Mainwaring was not well enough to appear and the rector therefore was able to indulge himself in what he called a bachelor party As a rule he disliked clergymen but at the last had been driven to invite his curate because he thought six a better number than five for joviality He began by asking questions as to the Trefoils which were not very fortunate Of course he had heard that Morton was to marry Arabella Trefoil and though he made no direct allusion to the fact as Reginald had done he spoke in that bland eulogistic tone which clearly showed his purpose They went with you to Lord Rufford s I was told Yes they did And now they have left the neighbourhood A very clever young lady Miss Trefoil and so is her mother a very clever woman The Senator to whom a sort of appeal was made nodded his assent Lord Augustus I believe is a brother of the Duke of Mayfair Yes he is said Morton I am afraid we are going to have frost again Then Reginald Morton was sure that the marriage would never take place The Trefoils are a very distinguished family continued the rector I remember the present Duke s father when he was in the cabinet and knew this man almost intimately when we were at Christchurch together I don t think this Duke ever took a prominent part in politics I don t know that he ever did said Morton Dear dear how tipsy he was once driving back to Oxford with me in a gig But he has the reputation of being one of the best landlords in the country now I wonder what it is that gives a man the reputation of being a good landlord Is it foxes asked the Senator The rector acknowledged with a smile that foxes helped Or does it mean that he lets his land below the value If so he certainly does more harm than good though he may like the popularity which he is rich enough to buy It means that he does not exact more than his due said the rector indiscreetly When I hear a man so highly praised for common honesty I am of course led to suppose that dishonesty in his particular trade is the common rule The body of English landlords must be exorbitant tyrants when one among them is so highly eulogised for taking no more than his own Luckily at that moment dinner was announced and the exceptional character of the Duke of Mayfair was allowed to drop mister Mainwaring s dinner was very good and his wines were excellent a fact of which mister Mainwaring himself was much better aware than any of his guests There is a difficulty in the giving of dinners of which mister Mainwaring and some other hosts have become painfully aware What service do you do to any one in pouring your best claret down his throat when he knows no difference between that and a much more humble vintage your best claret which you feel so sure you cannot replace Why import canvas back ducks for appetites which would be quite as well satisfied with those out of the next farm yard Your soup which has been a care since yesterday your fish got down with so great trouble from Bond Street on that very day your saddle of mutton in selecting which you have affronted every butcher in the neighbourhood are all plainly thrown away And yet the hospitable hero who would fain treat his friends as he would be treated himself can hardly arrange his dinners according to the palates of his different guests nor will he like when strangers sit at his board to put nothing better on his table than that cheaper wine with which needful economy induces him to solace himself when alone I I who write this have myself seen an honoured guest deluge with the pump my ah so hardly earned most scarce and most peculiar vintage There is a pang in such usage which some will not understand but which cut mister Mainwaring to the very soul There was not one among them there who appreciated the fact that the claret on his dinner table was almost the best that its year had produced It was impossible not to say a word on such a subject at such a moment though our rector was not a man who usually lauded his own viands I think you will find that claret what you like mister Gotobed he said It s a fifty seven Mouton and judges say that it is good Very good indeed said the Senator In the States we haven t got into the way yet of using dinner clarets It was as good as a play to see the rector wince under the ignominious word Your great statesman added much to your national comfort when he took the duty off the lighter kinds of French wines The rector could not stand it He hated light wines He hated cheap things in general And he hated Gladstone in particular Nothing said he that the statesman you speak of ever did could make such wine as that any cheaper I am sorry sir that you don t perceive the difference In the matter of wine said the Senator I don t think that I have happened to come across anything so good in this country as our old Madeiras But then sir we have been fortunate in our climate The English atmosphere is not one in which wine seems to reach its full perfection The rector heaved a deep sigh as he looked up to the ceiling with his hands in his trowsers pockets He knew or thought that he knew that no one could ever get a glass of good wine in the United States He knew or thought that he knew that the best wine in the world was brought to England He knew or thought he knew that in no other country was wine so well understood so diligently sought for and so truly enjoyed as in England And he imagined that it was less understood and less sought for and less enjoyed in the States than in any other country He did not as yet know the Senator well enough to fight with him at his own table and could only groan and moan and look up at the ceiling Doctor Nupper endeavoured to take away the sting by smacking his lips and Reginald Morton who did not in truth care a straw what he drank was moved to pity and declared the claret to be very fine I have nothing to say against it said the Senator who was not in the least abashed But when the cloth was drawn for the rector clung so lovingly to old habits that he delighted to see his mahogany beneath the wine glasses a more serious subject of dispute arose suddenly though perhaps hardly more disagreeable The thing in England said the Senator which I find most difficult to understand is the matter of what you call Church patronage If you ll pass half an hour with mister Surtees to morrow morning he ll explain it all to you said the rector who did not like that any subject connected with his profession should be mooted after dinner I should be delighted said mister Surtees Nothing would give me more pleasure said the Senator but what I mean is this the question is of course one of paramount importance No doubt it is said the deluded rector It is very necessary to get good doctors Well yes rather considering that all men wish to live That observation of course came from Doctor Nupper And care is taken in employing a lawyer though after my experience of yesterday not always I should say so much care as is needful The man who wants such aid looks about him and gets the best doctor he can for his money or the best lawyer But here in England he must take the clergyman provided for him It would be very much better for him if he did said the rector A clergyman at any rate is supposed to be appointed and that clergyman he must pay Not at all said the rector The clergy are paid by the wise provision of former ages We will let that pass for the present said the Senator There he is however he may be paid How does he get there Now it was the fact that mister Mainwaring s living had been bought for him with his wife s money a fact of which mister Gotobed was not aware but which he would hardly have regarded had he known it How does he get there In the majority of cases the bishop puts him there said mister Surtees And how is the bishop governed in his choice As far as I can learn the stipends are absurdly various one man getting Lone hundred a year for working like a horse in a big town and another Lone thousand for living an idle life in a luxurious country house But the bishop of course gives the bigger plums to the best men How is it then that the big plums find their way so often to the sons and sons in law and nephews of the bishops Because the bishop has looked after their education and principles said the rector And taught them how to choose their wives said the Senator with imperturbable gravity I am not the son of a bishop sir exclaimed the rector I wish you had been sir if it would have done you any good A general can t make his son a colonel at the age of twenty five or an admiral his son a first lieutenant or a judge his a Queen s Counsellor nor can the head of an office promote his to be a chief secretary It is only a bishop can do this I suppose because a cure of souls is so much less important than the charge of a ship or the discipline of twenty or thirty clerks The bishops don t do it said the rector fiercely Then the statistics which have been put into my hands belie them But how is it with those the bishops don t appoint There seems to me to be such a complication of absurdities as to defy explanation I think I could explain them all said mister Surtees mildly If you can do so satisfactorily I shall be very glad to hear it continued the Senator who seemed in truth to be glad to hear no one but himself A lad of one and twenty learns his lessons so well that he has to be rewarded at his college and a part of his reward consists in his having a parish entrusted to him when he is forty years old to which he can maintain his right whether he be in any way trained for such work or no Is that true His collegiate education is the best training he can have said the rector I came across a young fellow the other day continued the Senator in a very nice house with Lseven hundred a year and learned that he had inherited the living because he was his father s second son Some poor clergyman had been keeping it ready for him for the last fifteen years and had to turn out as soon as this young spark could be made a clergyman It was his father s property said the rector and the poor man had had great kindness shown him for those fifteen years Exactly his father s property And this is what you call a cure of souls And another man had absolutely had his living bought for him by his uncle just as he might have bought him a farm He couldn t have bought him the command of a regiment or a small judgeship In those matters you require capacity It is only when you deal with the Church that you throw to the winds all ideas of fitness Sir or Madam or perhaps my little dear you are bound to come to your places in Church and hear me expound the Word of God because I have paid a heavy sum of money for the privilege of teaching you at the moderate salary of Lsix hundred a year mister Surtees sat aghast with his mouth open and knew not how to say a word Doctor Nupper rubbed his red nose Reginald Morton attempted some suggestion about the wine which fell wretchedly flat John Morton ventured to tell his friend that he did not understand the subject I shall be most happy to be instructed said the Senator Understand it said the rector almost rising in his chair to rebuke the insolence of his guest He understands nothing about it and yet he ventures to fall foul with unmeasured terms on an establishment which has been brought to its present condition by the fostering care of perhaps the most pious set of divines that ever lived and which has produced results with which those of no other Church can compare Have I represented anything untruly asked the Senator A great deal sir Only put me right and no man will recall his words more readily Is it not the case that livings in the Church of England can be bought and sold The matter is one sir said the rector which cannot be discussed in this manner There are two clergymen present to whom such language is distasteful as it is also I hope to the others who are all members of the Church of England Perhaps you will allow me to request that the subject may be changed After that conversation flagged and the evening was by no means joyous The rector certainly regretted that his fifty seven claret should have been expended on such a man I don t think said he when John Morton had taken the Senator away that in my whole life before I ever met such a brute as that American Senator CHAPTER XVI PERSECUTION There was great consternation in the attorney s house after the writing of the letter to Lawrence Twentyman For twenty four hours missus Masters did not speak to Mary not at all intending to let her sin pass with such moderate punishment as that but thinking during that period that as she might perhaps induce Larry to ignore the letter and look upon it as though it were not written it would be best to say nothing till the time should come in which the lover might again urge his suit But when she found on the evening of the second day that Larry did not come near the place she could control herself no longer and accused her step daughter of ruining herself her father and the whole family That is very unfair mamma Mary said I have done nothing I have only not done that which nobody had a right to ask me to do Right indeed And who are you with your rights A decent well behaved young man with five or six hundred a year has no right to ask you to be his wife All this comes of you staying with an old woman with a handle to her name It was in vain that Mary endeavoured to explain that she had not alluded to Larry when she declared that no one had a right to ask her to do it She had she said always thanked him for his good opinion of her and had spoken well of him whenever his name was mentioned But it was a matter on which a young woman was entitled to judge for herself and no one had a right to scold her because she could not love him missus Masters hated such arguments despised this rodomontade about love and would have crushed the girl into obedience could it have been possible You are an idiot she said an ungrateful idiot and unless you think better of it you ll repent your folly to your dying day Who do you think is to come running after a moping slut like you Then Mary gathered herself up and left the room feeling that she could not live in the house if she were to be called a slut Soon after this Larry came to the attorney and got him to come out into the street and to walk with him round the churchyard It was the spot in Dillsborough in which they would most certainly be left undisturbed This took place on the day before his proposition for the sale of Chowton Farm When he got the attorney into the churchyard he took out Mary s letter and in speechless agony handed it to the attorney I saw it before it went said Masters putting it back with his hand I suppose she means it asked Larry I can t say to you but what she does Twentyman As far as I know her she isn t a girl that would ever say anything that she didn t mean I was sure of that When I got it and read it it was just as though some one had come behind me and hit me over the head with a wheel spoke I couldn t have ate a morsel of breakfast if I knew I wasn t to see another bit of food for four and twenty hours I knew you would feel it Larry Feel it Till it came to this I didn t think of myself but what I had more strength It has knocked me about till I feel all over like drinking Don t do that Larry I won t answer for myself what I ll do A man sets his heart on a thing just on one thing and has grit enough in him to be sure of himself that if he can get that nothing shall knock him over When that thoroughbred mare of mine slipped her foal who can say I ever whimpered When I got pleuro among the cattle I killed a most the lot of em out of hand and never laid awake a night about it But I ve got it so heavy this time I can t stand it You don t think I have any chance mister Masters You can try of course You re welcome to the house But what do you think You must know her Girls do change their minds But she isn t like other girls Is she now I come to you because I sometimes think missus Masters is a little hard on her missus Masters is about the best friend I have There isn t anybody more on my side than she is But I feel sure of this Mary will never be drove I don t think she will Larry She s got a will of her own as well as another No man alive ever had a better daughter I m sure of that mister Masters and no man alive ll ever have a better wife But she won t be drove I might ask her again you think You certainly have my leave But would it be any good I d rather cut my throat and have done with it than go about teasing her because her parents let me come to her Then there was a pause during which they walked on the attorney feeling that he had nothing more to say What I want to know said Larry is this Is there anybody else That was just the point on which the attorney himself was perplexed He had asked Mary that question and her silence had assured him that it was so Then he had suggested to her the name of the only probable suitor that occurred to him and she had repelled the idea in a manner that had convinced him at once There was some one but mister Surtees was not the man There was some one he was sure but he had not been able to cross examine her on the subject He had since that cudgelled his brain to think who that some one might be but had not succeeded in suggesting a name even to himself That of Reginald Morton who hardly ever came to the house and whom he regarded as a silent severe unapproachable man did not come into his mind Among the young ladies of Dillsborough Reginald Morton was never regarded as even a possible lover And yet there was assuredly some one If there is any one else I think you ought to tell me continued Larry It is quite possible Young Surtees I suppose I do not say there is anybody but if there be anybody I do not think it is Surtees Who else then I cannot say Larry I know nothing about it But there is some one I do not say so You ask me and I tell you all I know Again they walked round the churchyard in silence and the attorney began to be anxious that the interview might be over He hardly liked to be interrogated about the state of his daughter s heart and yet he had felt himself bound to tell what he knew to the man who had in all respects behaved well to him When they had returned for the third or fourth time to the gate by which they had entered Larry spoke again I suppose I may as well give it up What can I say You have been fair enough mister Masters And so has she And so has everybody I shall just get away as quick as I can and go and hang myself I feel above bothering her any more When she sat down to write a letter like that she must have been in earnest She certainly was in earnest Larry What s the use of going on after that Only it is so hard for a fellow to feel that everything is gone It is just as though the house was burnt down or I was to wake in the morning and find that the land didn t belong to me Not so bad as that Larry Not so bad mister Masters Then you don t know what it is I m feeling I d let his lordship or Squire Morton have it all and go in upon it as a tenant at thirty s an acre so that I could take her along with me I would and sell the horses and set to and work in my shirt sleeves A man could stand that Nobody wouldn t laugh at me then But there s an emptiness now here that makes me sick all through as though I hadn t got stomach left for anything Then poor Larry put his hand upon his heart and hid his face upon the churchyard wall The attorney made some attempt to say a kind word to him and then leaving him there slowly made his way back to his office We already know what first step Larry took with the intention of running away from his cares In the house at Dillsborough things were almost as bad as they were with him Over and over again missus Masters told her husband that it was all his fault and that if he had torn the letter when it was showed to him everything would have been right by the end of the two months This he bore with what equanimity he could shutting himself up very much in his office occasionally escaping for a quarter of an hour of ease to his friends at the Bush and eating his meals in silence But when he became aware that his girl was being treated with cruelty that she was never spoken to by her stepmother without harsh words and that her sisters were encouraged to be disdainful to her then his heart rose within him and he rebelled He declared aloud that Mary should not be persecuted and if this kind of thing were continued he would defend his girl let the consequences be what they might What are you going to defend her against asked his wife I won t have her ill used because she refuses to marry at your bidding Bah You know as much how to manage a girl as though you were an old maid yourself Cocker her up and make her think that nothing is good enough for her Break her spirit and make her come round and teach her to know what it is to have an honest man s house offered to her If she don t take Larry Twentyman s she s like to have none of her own before long But mister Masters would not assent to this plan of breaking his girl s spirit and so there was continual war in the place and every one there was miserable Mary herself was so unhappy that she convinced herself that it was necessary that some change should be made Then she remembered Lady Ushant s offer of a home and not only the offer but the old lady s assurance that to herself such an arrangement if possible would be very comfortable She did not suggest to herself that she would leave her father s home for ever and always but it might be that an absence of some months might relieve the absolute misery of their present mode of living The effect on her father was so sad that she was almost driven to regret that he should have taken her own part Her stepmother was not a bad woman nor did Mary even now think her to be bad She was a hardworking painstaking wife with a good general idea of justice In the division of puddings and pies and other material comforts of the household she would deal evenly between her own children and her step daughter She had not desired to send Mary away to an inadequate home or with a worthless husband But when the proper home and the proper man were there she was prepared to use any amount of hardship to secure these good things to the family generally This hardship Mary could not endure nor could Mary s father on her behalf and therefore Mary prepared a letter to Lady Ushant in which at great length she told her old friend the whole story She spoke as tenderly as was possible of all concerned but declared that her stepmother s feelings on the subject were so strong that every one in the house was made wretched Under these circumstances for her father s sake if only for that she thought herself bound to leave the house It is quite impossible she said that I should do as they wish me That is a matter on which a young woman must judge for herself If you could have me for a few months it would perhaps all pass by I should not dare to ask this but for what you said yourself and dear Lady Ushant pray remember that I do not want to be idle There are a great many things I can do and though I know that nothing can pay for kindness I might perhaps be able not to be a burden Then she added in a postscript Papa is everything that is kind but then all this makes him so miserable When she had kept the letter by her for a day she showed it to her father and by his consent it was sent After much consultation it was agreed between them that nothing should be said about it to missus Masters till the answer should come and that should the answer be favourable the plan should be carried out in spite of any domestic opposition In this letter Mary told as accurately as she could the whole story of Larry s courtship and was very clear in declaring that under no possible circumstances could she encourage any hope But of course she said not a word as to any other man or as to any love on her side Have you told her everything said her father as he closed the letter Yes papa everything that there is to be told Then there arose within his own bosom an immense desire to know that secret so that if possible he might do something to relieve her pain but he could not bring himself to ask further questions Lady Ushant on receiving the letter much doubted what she ought to do She acknowledged at once Mary s right to appeal to her and assured herself that the girl s presence would be a comfort and a happiness to herself If Mary were quite alone in the world Lady Ushant would have been at once prepared to give her a home But she doubted as to the propriety of taking the girl from her own family She doubted even whether it would not be better that Mary should be left within the influence of Larry Twentyman s charms A settlement an income and assured comforts for life are very serious things to all people who have reached Lady Ushant s age And then she had a doubt within her own mind whether Mary might not be debarred from accepting this young man by some unfortunate preference for Reginald Morton She had seen them together and had suspected something of the truth before it had glimmered before the eyes of any one in Dillsborough Had Reginald been so inclined Lady Ushant would have been very glad to see him marry Mary Masters For both their sakes she would have preferred such a match to one with the owner of Chowton Farm But she did not think that Reginald himself was that way minded and she fancied that poor Mary might be throwing away her prosperity in life were she to wait for Reginald s love Larry Twentyman was at any rate sure and perhaps it might be unwise to separate the girl from her lover In her doubt she determined to refer the case to Reginald himself and instead of writing to Mary she wrote to him She did not send him Mary s letter which would she felt have been a breach of faith nor did she mention the name of Larry Twentyman But she told him that Mary had proposed to come to Cheltenham for a long visit because there were disturbances at home which disturbances had arisen from her rejection of a certain suitor Lady Ushant said a great deal as to the inexpediency of fostering family quarrels and suggested that Mary might perhaps have been a little impetuous The presence of this lover could hardly do her much injury These were not days in which young women were forced to marry men What did he Reginald Morton think about it He was to remember that as far as she herself was concerned she dearly loved Mary Masters and would be delighted to have her at Cheltenham and so remembering he was to see the attorney and Mary herself and if necessary missus Masters and then to report his opinion to Cheltenham Then fearing that her nephew might be away for a day or two or that he might not be able to perform his commission instantly and thinking that Mary might be unhappy if she received no immediate reply to such a request as hers had been Lady Ushant by the same post wrote to her young friend as follows DEAR MARY Reginald will go over and see your father about your proposition As far as I myself am concerned nothing would give me so much pleasure This is quite sincere But the matter is in other respects very important Of course I have kept your letter all to myself and in writing to Reginald I have mentioned no names

none	none	MARGARET USHANT CHAPTER XVII PARTICULARLY PROUD OF YOU Arabella Trefoil left her uncle s mansion on the day after her lover s departure certainly not in triumph but with somewhat recovered spirits When she first heard that Lord Rufford was gone that he had fled away as it were in the middle of the night without saying a word to her without a syllable to make good the slight assurances of his love that had been given to her in the post carriage she felt that she was deserted and betrayed And when she found herself altogether neglected on the following day and that the slightly valuable impression which she had made on her aunt was apparently gone she did for half an hour think in earnest of the Paragon and Patagonia But after a while she called to mind all that she knew of great efforts successfully made in opposition to almost overwhelming difficulties She had heard of forlorn hopes and perhaps in her young days had read something of Caesar still clinging to his Commentaries as he struggled in the waves This was her forlorn hope and she would be as brave as any soldier of them all Lord Rufford s embraces were her Commentaries and let the winds blow and the waves roll as they might she would still cling to them After lunch she spoke to her aunt with great courage as the Duchess thought with great effrontery My uncle wouldn t speak to Lord Rufford before he went How could he speak to a man who ran away from his house in that way The running away as you call it aunt did not take place till two days after I had told you all about it I thought he would have done as much as that for his brother s daughter I don t believe in it at all said the Duchess sternly Don t believe in what aunt You don t mean to say that you don t believe that Lord Rufford has asked me to be his wife Then she paused but the Duchess absolutely lacked the courage to express her conviction again I don t suppose it signifies much continued Arabella but of course it would have been something to me that Lord Rufford should have known that the Duke was anxious for my welfare He was quite prepared to have assured my uncle of his intentions Then why didn t he speak himself Because the Duke is not my father Really aunt when I hear you talk of his running away I do feel it to be unkind As if we didn t all know that a man like that goes and comes as he pleases It was just before dinner that he got the message and was he to run round and wish everybody good bye like a schoolgirl going to bed The Duchess was almost certain that no message had come and from various little things which she had observed and from tidings which had reached her very much doubted whether Arabella had known anything of his intended going She too had a maid of her own who on occasions could bring information But she had nothing further to say on the subject If Arabella should ever become Lady Rufford she would of course among other visitors be occasionally received at Mistletoe She could never be a favourite but things would to a certain degree have rectified themselves But if as the Duchess expected no such marriage took place then this ill conducted niece should never be admitted within the house again Later on in the afternoon some hours after it became dusk Arabella contrived to meet her aunt in the hall with a letter in her hand and asked where the letter box was She knew where to deposit her letters as well as did the Duchess herself but she desired an opportunity of proclaiming what she had done I am writing to Lord Rufford Perhaps as I am in your house I ought to tell you what I have done The letter box is in the billiard room close to the door said the Duchess passing on Then she added as she went The post for to day has gone already His Lordship will have to wait a day for his letter I dare say it won t break his heart said Arabella as she turned away to the billiard room All this had been planned and moreover she had so written her letter that if her magnificent aunt should condescend to tamper with it all that was in it should seem to corroborate her own story The Duchess would have considered herself disgraced if ever she had done such a thing but the niece of the Duchess did not quite understand that this would be so The letter was as follows Mistletoe nineteenth Jany eighteen seventy five DEAREST R Your going off like that was after all very horrid My aunt thinks that you were running away from me I think that you were running away from her Which was true In real earnest I don t for a moment think that either I or the Duchess had anything to do with it and that you did go because some horrid man wrote and asked you I know you don t like being bound by any of the conventionalities I hope there is such a word and that if not you ll understand it just the same Oh Peltry and oh Jack and oh that road back to Stamford I am so stiff that I can t sit upright and everybody is cross to me and everything is uncomfortable What horrible things women are There isn t one here not even old Lady Rumpus who hasn t an unmarried daughter left in the world who isn t jealous of me because because I must leave you to guess why they all hate me so And I m sure if you had given Jack to any other woman I should hate her though you may give every horse you have to any man that you please I wonder whether I shall have another day s hunting before it is all over I suppose not It was almost by a miracle that we managed yesterday only fancy yesterday It seems to be an age ago Pray pray pray write to me at once to the Connop Greens so that I may get a nice soft pleasant word directly I get among those nasty hard unpleasant people They have lots of money and plenty of furniture and I dare say the best things to eat and drink in the world but nothing else There will be no Jack and if there were alas alas no one to show me the way to ride him I start to morrow and as far as I understand shall have to make my way into Hampshire all by myself with only such security as my maid can give me I shall make her go in the same carriage and shall have the gratification of looking at her all the way I suppose I ought not to say that I will shut my eyes and try to think that somebody else is there Good bye dear dear dear R I shall be dying for a letter from you Yours ever with all my heart A I shall write you such a serious epistle when I get to the Greens This was not such a letter as she thought that her aunt would approve but it was she fancied such as the Duchess would believe that she would write to her lover And if it were allowed to go on its way it would make Lord Rufford feel that she was neither alarmed nor displeased by the suddenness of his departure But it was not expected to do much good It might produce some short joking half affectionate reply but would not draw from him that serious word which was so necessary for the success of her scheme Therefore she had told him that she intended to prepare a serious missile Should this pleasant little message of love miscarry the serious missile would still be sent and the miscarriage would occasion no harm But then further plans were necessary It might be that Lord Rufford would take no notice of the serious missile which she thought very probable Or it might be that he would send back a serious reply in which he would calmly explain to her that she had unfortunately mistaken his sentiments which she believed would be a stretch of manhood beyond his reach But in either case she would be prepared with the course which she would follow In the first she would begin by forcing her father to write to him a letter which she herself would dictate In the second she would set the whole family at him as far as the family were within her reach With her cousin Lord Mistletoe who was only two years older than herself she had always held pleasant relations They had been children together and as they had grown up the young Lord had liked his pretty cousin Latterly they had seen each other but rarely and therefore the feeling still remained She would tell Lord Mistletoe her whole story that is the story as she would please to tell it and implore his aid Her father should be driven to demand from Lord Rufford an execution of his alleged promises She herself would write such a letter to the Duke as an uncle should be unable not to notice She would move heaven and earth as to her wrongs She thought that if her friends would stick to her Lord Rufford would be weak as water in their hands But it must be all done immediately so that if everything failed she might be ready to start to Patagonia some time in April When she looked back and remembered that it was hardly more than two months since she had been taken to Rufford Hall by mister Morton she could not accuse herself of having lost any time In London she met her mother as to which meeting there had been some doubt and underwent the tortures of a close examination She had thought it prudent on this occasion to tell her mother something but not to tell anything quite truly He has proposed to me she said He has said Lady Augustus holding up her hands almost in awe Is there anything so wonderful in that Then it is all arranged Does the Duke know it It is not all arranged by any means and the Duke does know it Now mamma after that I must decline to answer any more questions I have done this all myself and I mean to continue it in the same way Did he speak to the Duke You will tell me that I will tell you nothing You will drive me mad Arabella That will be better than your driving me mad just at present You ought to feel that I have a great deal to think of And have not I You can t help me not at present But he did propose in absolute words Mamma what a goose you are Do you suppose that men do it all now just as it is done in books Miss Arabella Trefoil will you do me the honour to become my wife Do you think that Lord Rufford would ask the question in that way It is a very good way Any way is a good way that answers the purpose He has proposed and I mean to make him stick to it You doubt then Mamma you are so silly Do you not know what such a man is well enough to be sure that he ll change his mind half a dozen times if he can I don t mean to let him and now after that I won t say another word I have got a letter here from mister Short saying that something must be fixed about mister Morton mister Short was the lawyer who had been instructed to prepare the settlements mister Short may do whatever he likes said Arabella There were very hot words between them that night in London but the mother could obtain no further information from her daughter That serious epistle had been commenced even before Arabella had left Mistletoe but the composition was one which required great care and it was not completed and copied and recopied till she had been two days in Hampshire Not even when it was finished did she say a word to her mother about it She had doubted much as to the phrases which in such an emergency she ought to use but she thought it safer to trust to herself than to her mother In writing such a letter as that posted at Mistletoe she believed herself to be happy She could write it quickly and understood that she could convey to her correspondent some sense of her assumed mood But her serious letter would she feared be stiff and repulsive Whether her fears were right the reader shall judge for the letter when written was as follows Marygold Place Basingstoke Saturday MY DEAR LORD RUFFORD You will I suppose have got the letter that I wrote before I left Mistletoe and which I directed to mister Surbiton s There was not much in it except a word or two as to your going and as to my desolation and just a reminiscence of the hunting There was no reproach that you should have left me without any farewell or that you should have gone so suddenly after saying so much without saying more I wanted you to feel that you had made me very happy and not to feel that your departure in such a way had robbed me of part of the happiness It was a little bad of you because it did of course leave me to the hardness of my aunt and because all the other women there would of course follow her She had inquired about our journey home that dear journey home and I had of course told her well I had better say it out at once I told her that we were engaged You I am sure will think that the truth was best She wanted to know why you did not go to the Duke I told her that the Duke was not my father but that as far as I was concerned the Duke might speak to you or not as he pleased I had nothing to conceal I am very glad he did not because he is pompous and you would have been bored If there is one thing I desire more than another it is that nothing belonging to me shall ever be a bore to you I hope I may never stand in the way of anything that will gratify you as I said when you lit that cigar You will have forgotten I dare say But dear Rufford dearest I may say that mayn t I say something or do something to make me satisfied You know what I mean don t you It isn t that I am a bit afraid myself I don t think so little of myself or so badly of you But I don t like other women to look at me as though I ought not to be proud of anything I am proud of everything particularly proud of you and of Jack Now there is my serious epistle and I am sure that you will answer it like a dear good kind hearted loving lover I won t be afraid of writing the word nor of saying that I love you with all my heart and that I am always your own ARABELLA She kept the letter till the Sunday thinking that she might have an answer to that written from Mistletoe and that his reply might alter its tone or induce her to put it aside altogether but when on Sunday morning none came her own was sent The word in it which frightened herself was the word engaged She tried various other phrases but declared to herself at last that it was useless to beat about the bush He must know the light in which she was pleased to regard those passages of love which she had permitted so that there might be no mistake Whether the letter would be to his liking or not it must be of such a nature that it would certainly draw from him an answer on which she could act She herself did not like the letter but considering her difficulties we may own that it was not much amiss CHAPTER XVIII LORD RUFFORD MAKES UP HIS MIND As it happened Lord Rufford got the two letters together 
6131-57188-0000	train-other-500	the cause of which was as follows When he ran away from Mistletoe as he certainly did he had thought much about that journey home in the carriage and was quite aware that he had made an ass of himself
none	none	 As he sat at dinner on that day at Mistletoe 
6131-57188-0001	train-other-500	his neighbour had said some word to him in joke as to his attachment to Miss Trefoil and after the ladies had left the room another neighbour of the other sex had hoped that he had had a pleasant time on the road
6131-57188-0002	train-other-500	Again in the drawing room it had seemed to him that he was observed He could not refrain from saying a few words to Arabella as she lay on the sofa Not to do so after what had occurred would have been in itself peculiar But when he did so
6131-57188-0003	train-other-500	some other man who was near her made way for him as though she were acknowledged to be altogether his property And then the Duchess had striven to catch him and lead him into special conversation When this attempt was made
6131-57188-0004	train-other-500	he decided that he must at once retreat or else make up his mind to marry the young lady And therefore he retreated He breakfasted that morning at the inn at Stamford and as he smoked his cigar afterwards
6131-57188-0005	train-other-500	he positively resolved that he would under no circumstances marry Arabella Trefoil He was being hunted and run down and with the instinct of all animals that are hunted he prepared himself for escape
6131-57188-0006	train-other-500	It might be said no doubt would be said that he behaved badly That would be said because it would not be open to him to tell the truth The lady in such a case can always tell her story
6131-57188-0007	train-other-500	with what exaggeration she may please to give and can complain The man never can do so
none	none	 When inquired into he cannot say that he has been pursued He cannot tell her friends that she began it and in point of fact did it all 
6131-57188-0008	train-other-500	She would fall into my arms she would embrace me she persisted in asking me whether I loved her Though a man have to be shot for it or kicked for it or even though he have to endure perpetual scorn for it
6131-57188-0009	train-other-500	he cannot say that let it be ever so true And yet is a man to be forced into a marriage which he despises He would not be forced into the marriage and the sooner he retreated
6131-57188-0010	train-other-500	the less would be the metaphorical shooting and kicking and the real scorn He must get out of it as best he could but that he would get out of it he was quite determined
6131-57188-0011	train-other-500	That afternoon he reached mister Surbiton s house as did also Captain Battersby and his horses grooms and other belongings When there he received a lot of letters and
none	none	 among others one from mister Runciman of the Bush 
6131-57188-0012	train-other-500	inquiring as to a certain hiring of rooms and preparation for a dinner or dinners which had been spoken of in reference to a final shooting decreed to take place in the neighbourhood of Dillsborough in the last week of January
6131-57188-0013	train-other-500	Such things were often planned by Lord Rufford and afterwards forgotten or neglected
none	none	 When he declared his purpose to Runciman 
6131-57188-0014	train-other-500	he had not intended to go to Mistletoe nor to stay so long with his friend Surbiton But now he almost thought that it would be better for him to be back at Rufford Hall where at present his sister was staying with her husband Sir George Penwether
none	none	 In the evening of the second or third day 
6131-57188-0015	train-other-500	his old friend Tom Surbiton said a few words to him which had the effect of sending him back to Rufford They had sat out the rest of the men who formed the party and were alone in the smoking room So you re going to marry Miss Trefoil said Tom Surbiton
6131-57188-0016	train-other-500	who perhaps of all his friends was the most intimate Who says so I am saying so at present You are not saying it on your own authority You have never seen me and Miss Trefoil in a room together
none	none	 Everybody says so 
6131-57188-0017	train-other-500	Of course such a thing cannot be arranged without being talked about It has not been arranged If you don t mean to have it arranged you had better look to it I am speaking in earnest Rufford I am not going to give up authorities Indeed if I did
none	none	 I might give up everybody The 
6131-57188-0018	train-other-500	very servants suppose that they know it and there isn t a groom or horseboy about who isn t in his heart
none	none	 congratulating the young lady on her promotion 
6131-57188-0019	train-other-500	I ll tell you what it is Tom Well what is it If this had come from any other man than yourself I should quarrel with him I am not engaged to the young lady nor have I done anything to warrant anybody in saying so
6131-57188-0020	train-other-500	Then I may contradict it I don t want you either to contradict it or affirm it It would be an impertinence to the young lady if I were to instruct any one to contradict such a report But as a fact I am not engaged to marry Miss Trefoil
6131-57188-0021	train-other-500	nor is there the slightest chance that I ever shall be so engaged So saying he took up his candlestick and walked off Early on the next morning he saw his friend and made some sort of laughing apology for his heat on the previous evening
6131-57188-0022	train-other-500	It is so d hard when these kind of things are said because a man has lent a young lady a horse However Tom between you and me the thing is a lie I am very glad to hear it said Tom
6131-57188-0023	train-other-500	And now I want you to come over to Rufford on the twenty eighth Then he explained the details of his proposed party and got his friend to promise that he would come He also made it understood that he was going home at once
6131-57188-0024	train-other-500	There were a hundred things he said which made it necessary
none	none	 So the horses and grooms and servant and portmanteaus were again made to move 
6131-57188-0025	train-other-500	and Lord Rufford left his friend on that day and went up to London on his road to Rufford He was certainly disturbed in his mind foreseeing that there might be much difficulty in his way
6131-57188-0026	train-other-500	He remembered with fair accuracy all that had occurred during the journey from Stamford to Mistletoe He felt assured that up to that time he had said nothing which could be taken to mean a real declaration of love All that at Rufford had been nothing
none	none	 He had never said a word which could justify the girl in a hope 
6131-57188-0027	train-other-500	In the carriage she had asked him whether he loved her and he had said that he did He had also declared that he would do anything in his power to make her happy Was a man to be bound to marry a girl because of such a scene as that There was however
6131-57188-0028	train-other-500	nothing for him to do except to keep out of the girl s way If she took any steps then he must act But as he thought of it he swore to himself that nothing should induce him to marry her
6131-57188-0029	train-other-500	He remained a couple of days in town and reached Rufford Hall on the Monday just a week from the day of that fatal meet at Peltry There he found Sir George and his sister and Miss Penge and spent his first evening in quiet
none	none	 On the Tuesday he hunted with the U R U and made his arrangements with Runciman 
6131-57188-0030	train-other-500	He invited Hampton to shoot with him Surbiton and Battersby were coming and his brother in law Not wishing to have less than six guns he asked Hampton how he could make up his party Morton doesn t shoot he said and is as stiff as a post
none	none	 Then he was told that John Morton was supposed to be very ill at Bragton 
6131-57188-0031	train-other-500	I m sick of both the Botseys continued the lord thinking more of his party than of mister Morton s health Purefoy is still sulky with me because he killed poor old Caneback Then Hampton suggested that if he would ask
none	none	 Lawrence Twentyman 
6131-57188-0032	train-other-500	it might be the means of saving that unfortunate young man s life The story of his unrequited love was known to every one at Dillsborough and it was now told to Lord Rufford He is not half a bad fellow said Hampton
6131-57188-0033	train-other-500	and quite as much like a gentleman as either of the Botseys I shall be delighted to save the life of so good a man on such easy terms said the lord Then and there with a pencil on the back of an old letter
6131-57188-0034	train-other-500	he wrote a line to Larry asking him to shoot on next Saturday and to dine with him afterwards at the Bush That evening on his return home he found both the letters from Arabella As it happened he read them in the order in which they had been written
6131-57188-0035	train-other-500	first the laughing letter and then the one that was declared to be serious The earlier of the two did not annoy him much It contained hardly more than those former letters which had induced him to go to Mistletoe
6131-57188-0036	train-other-500	But the second letter opened up her entire strategy She had told the Duchess that she was engaged to him and the Duchess of course would have told the Duke And now she wrote to him asking him to acknowledge the engagement in black and white
6131-57188-0037	train-other-500	The first letter he might have ignored He might have left it unanswered without gross misconduct But the second letter which she herself had declared to be a serious epistle was one which he could not neglect
6131-57188-0038	train-other-500	Now had come his difficulty What must he do How should he answer it Was it imperative on him to write the words with his own hand Would it be possible that he should get his sister to undertake the commission
6131-57188-0039	train-other-500	He said nothing about it to any one for four and twenty hours but he passed those hours in much discomfort It did seem so hard to him that because he had been forced to carry a lady home from hunting in a postchaise
6131-57188-0040	train-other-500	that he should be driven to such straits as this The girl was evidently prepared to make a fight of it There would be the Duke and the Duchess and that prig Mistletoe and that idle ass Lord Augustus
6131-57188-0041	train-other-500	and that venomous old woman her mother all at him He almost doubted whether a shooting excursion in Central Africa or a visit to the Pampas would not be the best thing for him But still
6131-57188-0042	train-other-500	though he should resolve to pass five years among the Andes he must answer the lady s letter before he went Then he made up his mind that he would tell everything to his brother in law as far as everything can be told in such a matter
6131-57188-0043	train-other-500	Sir George was near fifty full fifteen years older than his wife who was again older than her brother He was a man of moderate wealth very much respected and supposed to be possessed of almost infinite wisdom
6131-57188-0044	train-other-500	He was one of those few human beings who seem never to make a mistake Whatever he put his hand to came out well and yet everybody liked him His brother in law was a little afraid of him but yet was always glad to see him
6131-57188-0045	train-other-500	He kept an excellent house in London but having no country house of his own passed much of his time at Rufford Hall when the owner was not there
none	none	 In spite of the young peer s numerous faults 
6131-57188-0046	train-other-500	Sir George was much attached to him and always ready to help him in his difficulties Penwether said the Lord I have got myself into an awful scrape I am sorry to hear it A woman I suppose Oh yes
6131-57188-0047	train-other-500	I never gamble and therefore no other scrape can be awful A young lady wants to marry me That is not unnatural But I am quite determined let the result be what it may that I won t marry the young lady
none	none	 That will be unfortunate for her and the more so if she has a right to expect it 
6131-57188-0048	train-other-500	Is the young lady Miss Trefoil I did not mean to mention any name till I was sure it might be necessary But it is Miss Trefoil Eleanor had told me something of it
none	none	 Eleanor knows nothing about this and I do not wish you to tell her 
6131-57188-0049	train-other-500	The young lady was here with her mother and for the matter of that with a gentleman to whom she was certainly engaged but nothing particular occurred here That unfortunate ball was going on when poor Caneback was dying
6131-57188-0050	train-other-500	But I met her since that at Mistletoe I can hardly advise you know unless you tell me everything Then Lord Rufford began These kind of things are sometimes deuced hard upon a man
6131-57188-0051	train-other-500	Of course if a man were a saint or a philosopher or a Joseph he wouldn t get into such scrapes and perhaps every man ought to be something of that sort
6131-57188-0052	train-other-500	But I don t know how a man is to do it unless it s born with him A little prudence I should say You might as well tell a fellow that it is his duty to be six feet high But what have you said to the young lady
6131-57188-0053	train-other-500	or what has she said to you There has been a great deal more of the latter than the former I say so to you but of course it is not to be said that I have said so I cannot go forth to the world complaining of a young lady s conduct to me
6131-57188-0054	train-other-500	It is a matter in which a man must not tell the truth But what is the truth She writes me word to say that she has told all her friends that I am engaged to her
6131-57188-0055	train-other-500	and kindly presses me to make good her assurances by becoming so And what has passed between you A fainting fit in a carriage and half a dozen kisses Nothing more Nothing more that is material
6131-57188-0056	train-other-500	Of course one cannot tell it all down to each mawkish word of humbugging sentiment There are her letters and what I want you to remember is that I never asked her to be my wife and that no consideration on earth shall induce me to become her husband
6131-57188-0057	train-other-500	Though all the duchesses in England were to persecute me to the death I mean to stick to that Then Sir George read the letters and handed them back She seems to me said he to have more wit about her
6131-57188-0058	train-other-500	than any of the family that I have had the honour of meeting She has wit enough and pluck too You have never said a word to her to encourage these hopes My dear Penwether
6131-57188-0059	train-other-500	don t you know that if a man with a large income says to a girl like that that the sun shines he encourages hope I understand that well enough I am a rich man with a title and a big house and a great command of luxuries
6131-57188-0060	train-other-500	There are so many young ladies who would also like to be rich and to have a title and a big house and a command of luxuries One sometimes feels oneself like a carcase in the midst of vultures Marry after a proper fashion
6131-57188-0061	train-other-500	and you ll get rid of all that I ll think about it but in the meantime what can I say to this young woman When I acknowledge that I kissed her of course I encouraged hopes No doubt
6131-57188-0062	train-other-500	But saint Anthony would have had to kiss this young woman if she had made her attack upon him as she did on me and after all a kiss doesn t go for everything These are things Penwether that must not be inquired into too curiously
6131-57188-0063	train-other-500	But I won t marry her though it were a score of kisses And now what must I do Sir George said that he would take till the next morning to think about it
none	none	 meaning to make a draft of the reply which he thought his brother in law might best send to the lady CHAPTER XIX IT CANNOT BE ARRANGED When Reginald Morton received his aunt s letter he understood from it more than she had intended Of course the man to whom allusion was made was mister Twentyman and of course the discomfort at home had come from missus Masters approval of that suitor s claim Reginald though he had seen but little of the inside of the attorney s household thought it very probable that the stepmother would make the girl s home very uncomfortable for her Though he knew well all the young farmer s qualifications as a husband namely that he was well to do in the world and bore a good character for honesty and general conduct still he thoroughly nay heartily approved of Mary s rejection of the man s hand It seemed to him to be sacrilege that such a one should have given to him such a woman There was to his thinking something about Mary Masters that made it altogether unfit that she should pass her life as the mistress of Chowton Farm and he honoured her for the persistence of her refusal He took his pipe and went out into the garden in order that he might think of it all as he strolled round his little domain But why should he think so much about it Why should he take so deep an interest in the matter What was it to him whether Mary Masters married after her kind or descended into what he felt to be an inferior manner of life Then he tried to tell himself what were the gifts in the girl s possession which made her what she was and he pictured her to himself running over all her attributes It was not that she specially excelled in beauty He had seen Miss Trefoil as she was being driven about the neighbourhood and having heard much of the young lady as the future wife of his own cousin had acknowledged to himself that she was very handsome But he had thought at the same time that under no possible circumstances could he have fallen in love with Miss Trefoil He believed that he did not care much for female beauty and yet he felt that he could sit and look at Mary Masters by the hour together There was a quiet even composure about her always lightened by the brightness of her modest eyes which seemed to tell him of some mysterious world within which was like the unseen loveliness that one fancies to be hidden within the bosom of distant mountains There was a poem to be read there of surpassing beauty rhythmical and eloquent as the music of the spheres if it might only be given to a man to read it There was an absence too of all attempt at feminine self glorification which he did not analyse but thoroughly appreciated There was no fussy amplification of hair no made up smiles no affectation either in her good humour or her anger no attempt at effect in her gait in her speech or her looks She seemed to him to be one who had something within her on which she could feed independently of the grosser details of the world to which it was her duty to lend her hand And then her colour charmed his eyes Miss Trefoil was white and red white as pearl powder and red as paint Mary Masters to tell the truth was brown No doubt that was the prevailing colour if one colour must be named But there was so rich a tint of young life beneath the surface so soft but yet so visible an assurance of blood and health and spirit that no one could describe her complexion by so ugly a word without falsifying her gifts In all her movements she was tranquil as a noble woman should be Even when she had turned from him with some anger at the bridge she had walked like a princess There was a certainty of modesty about her which was like a granite wall or a strong fortress As he thought of it all he did not understand how such a one as Lawrence Twentyman should have dared to ask her to be his wife or should even have wished it We know what were her feelings in regard to himself how she had come to look almost with worship on the walls within which he lived but he had guessed nothing of this Even now when he knew that she had applied to his aunt in order that she might escape from her lover it did not occur to him that she could care for himself He was older than she nearly twenty years older and even in his younger years in the hard struggles of his early life had never regarded himself as a man likely to find favour with women There was in his character much of that modesty for which he gave her such infinite credit Though he thought but little of most of those around him he thought also but little of himself It would break his heart to ask and be refused but he could he fancied live very well without Mary Masters Such at any rate had been his own idea of himself hitherto and now though he was driven to think much of her though on the present occasion he was forced to act on her behalf he would not tell himself that he wanted to take her for his wife He constantly assured himself that he wanted no wife that for him a solitary life would be the best But yet it made him wretched when he reflected that some man would assuredly marry Mary Masters He had heard of that excellent but empty headed young man mister Surtees When the idea occurred to him he found himself reviling mister Surtees as being of all men the most puny the most unmanly and the least worthy of marrying Mary Masters Now that mister Twentyman was certainly disposed of he almost became jealous of mister Surtees It was not till three or four o clock in the afternoon that he went out on his commission to the attorney s house having made up his mind that he would do everything in his power to facilitate Mary s proposed return to Cheltenham He asked first for mister Masters and then for Miss Masters and learned that they were both out together But he had been desired also to see missus Masters and on inquiring for her was again shown into the grand drawing room Here he remained a quarter of an hour while the lady of the house was changing her cap and apron which he spent in convincing himself that this house was altogether an unfit residence for Mary In the chamber in which he was standing it was clear enough that no human being ever lived Mary s drawing room ought to be a bower in which she at least might pass her time with books and music and pretty things around her The squalor of the real living room might be conjectured from the untouched cleanliness of this useless sanctum At last the lady came to him and welcomed him with very grim courtesy As a client of her husband he was very well but as a nephew of Lady Ushant he was injurious It was he who had carried Mary away to Cheltenham where she had been instigated to throw her bread and butter into the fire as missus Masters expressed it by that pernicious old woman Lady Ushant mister Masters is out walking she said Reginald clearly understood by the contempt which she threw almost unconsciously into her words that she did not approve of her husband going out walking at such an hour I had a message for him and also for you My aunt Lady Ushant is very anxious that your daughter Mary should return to her at Cheltenham for a while The proposition to missus Masters thinking was so monstrous and was at the same time so unexpected that it almost took away her breath At any rate she stood for a moment speechless My aunt is very fond of your daughter he continued and if she can be spared would be delighted to have her Perhaps she has written to Miss Masters but she has asked me to come over and see if it cannot be arranged It cannot be arranged said missus Masters Nothing of the kind can be arranged I am sorry for that It is only disturbing the girl and upsetting her and filling her head full of nonsense What is she to do at Cheltenham This is her home and here she had better be Though things had hitherto gone very badly though Larry Twentyman had not shown himself since the receipt of the letter still missus Masters had not abandoned all hope She was fixed in opinion that if her husband were joined with her they could still between them so break the girl s spirit as to force her into a marriage As for letters she continued I don t know anything about them There may have been letters but if so they have been kept from me She was so angry that she could not even attempt to conceal her wrath Lady Ushant thinks began the messenger Oh yes Lady Ushant is very well of course Lady Ushant is your aunt mister Morton and I haven t anything to say against her But Lady Ushant can t do any good to that girl She has got her bread to earn and if she won t do it one way then she must do it another She s obstinate and pigheaded that s the truth of it And her father s just as bad He has taken her out now merely because she likes to be idle and to go about thinking herself a fine lady Lady Ushant doesn t do her any good at all by cockering her up My aunt you know saw very much of her when she was young I know she did mister Morton and all that has to be undone and I have got the undoing of it Lady Ushant is one thing and her papa s business is quite another At any rate if I have my say she ll not go to Cheltenham any more I don t mean to be uncivil to you mister Morton or to say anything as oughtn t to be said of your aunt But when you can t make people anything but what they are it s my opinion that it s best to leave them alone Good day to you sir and I hope you understand what it is that I mean Then Morton retreated and went down the stairs leaving the lady in possession of her own grandeur He had not quite understood what she had meant and was still wondering at the energy of her opposition when he met Mary herself at the front door Her father was not with her but his retreating form was to be seen entering the portal of the Bush Oh mister Morton exclaimed Mary surprised to have the house door opened for her by him I have come with a message from my aunt She told me that you would do so Lady Ushant would of course be delighted to have you if it could be arranged Then Lady Ushant will be disappointed said missus Masters who had descended the stairs There has been something going on behind my back I wrote to Lady Ushant said Mary I call that sly and deceitful very sly and very deceitful If I know it you won t stir out of this house to go to Cheltenham I wonder Lady Ushant would go to put you up in that way against those you re bound to obey I thought missus Masters had been told said Reginald Papa did know that I wrote said Mary Yes and in this way a conspiracy is to be made up in the house If she goes to Cheltenham I won t stay here You may tell Lady Ushant that I say that I m not going to be one thing one day and another another and to be made a tool of all round By this time Dolly and Kate had come down from the upper regions and were standing behind their mother What do you two do there standing gaping like fools said the angry mother I suppose your father has gone over to the public house again That miss is what comes from your pigheadedness Didn t I tell you that you were ruining everybody belonging to you Before all this was over Reginald Morton had escaped feeling that he could do no good to either side by remaining a witness to such a scene He must take some other opportunity of finding the attorney and of learning from him whether he intended that his daughter should be allowed to accept Lady Ushant s invitation Poor Mary as she shrunk into the house was nearly heartbroken That such things should be at all was very dreadful but that the scene should have taken place in the presence of Reginald Morton was an aggravation of the misery which nearly overwhelmed her How could she make him understand whence had arisen her stepmother s anger and that she herself had been neither sly nor deceitful nor pigheaded CHAPTER XX BUT THERE IS SOME ONE When mister Masters had gone across to the Bush his purpose had certainly been ignoble but it had had no reference to brandy and water And the allusion made by missus Masters to the probable ruin which was to come from his tendencies in that direction had been calumnious for she knew that the man was not given to excess in liquor But as he approached his own house he bethought himself that it would not lead to domestic comfort if he were seen returning from his walk with Mary and he had therefore made some excuse as to the expediency of saying a word to Runciman whom he espied at his own door He said his word to Runciman and so loitered away perhaps a quarter of an hour and then went back to his office But his wife had kept her anger at burning heat and pounced upon him before he had taken his seat Sundown was there copying sitting with his eyes intent on the board before him as though he were quite unaware of the sudden entrance of his master s wife She in her fury did not regard Sundown in the least but at once commenced her attack What is all this mister Masters she said about Lady Ushant and going to Cheltenham I won t have any going to Cheltenham and that s flat Now the attorney had altogether made up his mind that his daughter should go to Cheltenham if her friend would receive her Whatever might be the consequences they must be borne But he thought it best to say nothing at the first moment of the attack and simply turned his sorrowful round face in silence up to the partner of all his cares and the source of so many of them There have been letters continued the lady letters which nobody has told me nothing about That proud peacock from Hoppet Hall has been here as though he had nothing to do but carry Mary away about the country just as he pleased Mary won t go to Cheltenham with him nor yet without him not if I am to remain here Where else should you remain my dear asked the attorney I d sooner go into the workhouse than have all this turmoil That s where we are all likely to go if you pass your time between walking about with that minx and the public house opposite Then the attorney was aware that he had been watched and his spirit began to rise within him He looked at Sundown but the man went on copying quicker than ever My dear said mister Masters you shouldn t talk in that way before the clerk I wanted to speak to mister Runciman and as to the workhouse I don t know that there is any more danger now than there has been for the last twenty years It s always off and on as far as I can see Do you mean to send that girl to Cheltenham I rather think she had better go for a time Then I shall leave this house and go with my girls to Norrington Now this threat which had been made before was quite without meaning missus Masters parents were both dead and her brother who had a large family certainly would not receive her I won t remain here mister Masters if I ain t to be mistress of my own house What is she to go to Cheltenham for I should like to know Then Sundown was desired by his wretched employer to go into the back settlement and the poor man prepared himself for the battle as well as he could She is not happy here he said Whose fault is that Why shouldn t she be happy Of course you know what it means She has got round you because 
5789_57195_000033_000004	train-clean-100	she wants to be a fine lady 
none	none	What means have you to make her a fine lady If you was to die to morrow what would there be for any of em My little bit of money is all gone Let her stay here and be made to marry Lawrence Twentyman That s what I say She will never marry mister Twentyman Not if you go on like this she won t If you d done your duty by her like a real father instead of being afraid of her when she puts on her tantrums she d have been at Chowton Farm by this time It was clear to him that now was the time not to be afraid of his wife when she put on her tantrums or at any rate to appear not to be afraid She has been very unhappy of late Oh unhappy She s been made more of than anybody else in this house And a change will do her good She has my permission to go and go she shall Then the word had been spoken She shall It is very much for the best While she is here the house is made wretched for us all It ll be wretcheder yet unless it would make you happy to see me dead on the threshold which I believe it would As for her she s an ungrateful sly wicked slut She has done nothing wicked that I know of Not writing to that old woman behind my back She told me what she was doing and showed me the letter Yes of course The two of you were in it Does that make it any better I say it was sly and wicked and you were sly and wicked as well as she She has got the better of you and now you are going to send her away from the only chance she ll ever get of having a decent home of her own over her head There s nothing more to be said about it my dear She ll go to Lady Ushant Having thus pronounced his dictum with all the marital authority he was able to assume he took his hat and sallied forth missus Masters when she was left alone stamped her foot and hit the desk with a ruler that was lying there Then she went up stairs and threw herself on her bed in a paroxysm of weeping and wailing mister Masters when he closed his door looked up the street and down the street and then again went across to the Bush mister Runciman was still there and was standing with a letter in his hand while one of the grooms from Rufford Hall was holding a horse beside him Any answer mister Runciman said the groom Only to tell his lordship that everything will be ready for him You d better go through and give the horse a feed of corn and get a bit of something to eat and a glass of beer yourself The man wasn t slow to do as he was bid and in this way the Bush had become very popular with the servants of the gentry around the place His lordship is to be here from Friday to Sunday with a party mister Masters Oh indeed For the end of the shooting And who do you think he has asked to be one of the party Not mister Reginald I don t think they ever spoke in their lives Who but Larry Twentyman No It ll be the making of Larry I only hope he won t cock his beaver too high Is he coming I suppose so He ll be sure to come His Lordship only tells me that there are to be six of em on Saturday and five on Friday night But the lad there knew who they all were There s mister Surbiton and Captain Battersby and Sir George are to come over with his lordship from Rufford And young mister Hampton is to join them here and Larry Twentyman is to shoot with them on Saturday and dine afterwards Won t those two Botseys be jealous that s all It only shows what they think of Larry said the attorney Larry Twentyman is a very good fellow said the landlord I don t know a better fellow round Dillsborough or one who is more always on the square But he s weak You know him as well as I mister Masters He s not so weak but what he can keep what he s got This ll be the way to try him He d melt away like water into sand if he were to live for a few weeks with such men as his Lordship s friends I suppose there s no chance of his taking a wife home to Chowton with him The attorney shook his head That d be the making of him mister Masters a good girl like that who d keep him at home If he takes it to heart he ll burst out somewhere and spend a lot of money The attorney declined mister Runciman s offer of a glass of beer and slowly made his way round the corner of the inn by Hobb s gate to the front door of Hoppet Hall Then he passed on to the churchyard still thinking of the misery of his position When he reached the church he turned back still going very slowly and knocked at the door of Hoppet Hall He was shown at once by Reginald s old housekeeper up to the library and there in a few minutes he was joined by the master of the house I was over looking for you an hour or two ago said Reginald I heard you were there mister Morton and so I thought I would come to you You didn t see Mary I just saw her but could hardly say much She had written to my aunt about going to Cheltenham I saw the letter before she sent it mister Morton So she told me My aunt would be delighted to have her but it seems that missus Masters does not wish her to go There is some trouble about it mister Morton but I may as well tell you at once that I wish her to go She would be better for awhile at Cheltenham with such a lady as your aunt than she can be at home Her stepmother and she cannot agree on a certain point I dare say you know what it is mister Morton In regard I suppose to mister Twentyman Just that missus Masters thinks that mister Twentyman would make an excellent husband And so do I There s nothing in the world against him and as compared with me he s a rich man I couldn t give the poor girl any fortune and he wouldn t want any But money isn t everything No indeed He s an industrious steady young man too and he has had my word with him all through But I can t compel my girl to marry him if she don t like him I can t even try to compel her She s as good a girl as ever stirred about a house I can well believe that And nothing would take such a load off me as to know that she was going to be well married But as she don t like the young man well enough I won t have her hardly used missus Masters perhaps is hard to her God forbid I should say anything against my wife I never did and I won t now But Mary will be better away and if Lady Ushant will be good enough to take her she shall go When will she be ready mister Masters I must ask her about that in a week perhaps or ten days She is quite decided against the young man Quite At the bidding of all of us she said she d take two months to think of it But before the time was up she wrote to him to say it could never be It quite upset my wife because it would have been such an excellent arrangement Reginald wished to learn more but hardly knew how to ask the father questions Yet as he had been trusted so far he thought that he might be trusted altogether I must own he said that I think that mister Twentyman would hardly be a fit husband for your daughter He is a very good young man Very likely but she is something more than a very good young woman A young lady with her gifts will be sure to settle well in life some day The attorney shook his head He had lived long enough to see many young ladies with good gifts find it difficult to settle in life and perhaps that mysterious poem which Reginald found in Mary s eyes was neither visible nor audible to Mary s father I did hear said Reginald that mister Surtees There s nothing in that Oh indeed I thought that perhaps as she is so determined not to do as her friends would wish that there might be something else He said this almost as a question looking close into the attorney s eyes as he spoke It is always possible said mister Masters But you don t think there is anybody It is very hard to say mister Morton You don t expect anything of that sort Then the attorney broke forth into sudden confidence To tell the truth then mister Morton I think there is somebody though who it is I know as little as the baby unborn She sees nobody here at Dillsborough to be intimate with She isn t one of those who would write letters or do anything on the sly But there is some one She told me as much herself That is when I asked her she would not deny it Then I thought that perhaps it might be somebody at Cheltenham I think not She was there so short a time mister Morton and Lady Ushant would be the last person in the world to let such a thing as that go on without telling her parents I don t think there was any one at Cheltenham She was only there a month I did fancy that perhaps that was one reason why she should want to go back I don t believe it I don t in the least believe it said Reginald enthusiastically My aunt would have been sure to have seen it It would have been impossible without her knowledge But there is somebody I think so mister Morton and if she does go to Cheltenham perhaps Lady Ushant had better know To this Reginald agreed or half agreed It did not seem to him to be of much consequence what might be done at Cheltenham He felt certain that the lover was not there And yet who was there at Dillsborough He had seen those young Botseys about Could it possibly be one of them And during the Christmas vacation the rector s scamp of a son had been home from Oxford to whom Mary Masters had barely spoken Was it young Mainwaring Or could it be possible that she had turned an eye of favour on doctor Nupper s elegantly dressed assistant There was nothing too monstrous for him to suggest to himself as soon as the attorney had left him But there was a young man in Dillsborough one man at any rate young enough to be a lover of whom Reginald did not think as to whom had his name been suggested as that of the young man to whom Mary s heart had been given he would have repudiated such a suggestion with astonishment and anger But now having heard this from the girl s father he was again vexed and almost as much disgusted as when he had first become aware that Larry Twentyman was a suitor for her hand Why should he trouble himself about a girl who was ready to fall in love with the first man that she saw about the place He tried to pacify himself by some such question as this but tried in vain CHAPTER XXI THE DINNER AT THE BUSH Here is the letter which at his brother in law s advice Lord Rufford wrote to Arabella Rufford three February eighteen seventy five MY DEAR MISS TREFOIL It is a great grief to me that I should have to answer your letter in a manner that will I fear not be satisfactory to you I can only say that you have altogether mistaken me if you think that I have said anything which was intended as an offer of marriage I cannot but be much flattered by your good opinion I have had much pleasure from our acquaintance and I should have been glad if it could have been continued But I have had no thoughts of marriage If I have said a word which has unintentionally on my part given rise to such an idea I can only beg your pardon heartily If I were to add more after what I have now said perhaps you would take it as an impertinence Yours most sincerely RUFFORD He had desired to make various additions and suggestions which however had all been disallowed by Sir George Penwether He had proposed among other things to ask her whether he should keep Jack for her for the remainder of the season or whether he should send the horse elsewhere but Sir George would not allow a word in the letter about Jack You did give her the horse then he asked I had hardly any alternative as the things went She would have been quite welcome to the horse if she would have let me alone afterwards No doubt but when young gentlemen give young ladies horses I know all about it my dear fellow Pray don t preach more than you can help Of course I have been an infernal ass I know all that But as the horse is hers Say nothing about the horse Were she to ask for it of course she could have it but that is not likely And you think I had better say nothing else Not a word Of course it will be shown to all her friends and may possibly find its way into print I don t know what steps such a young lady may be advised to take Her uncle is a man of honour Her father is an ass and careless about everything Mistletoe will not improbably feel himself bound to act as though he were her brother They will of course all think you to be a rascal and will say so If Mistletoe says so I ll horsewhip him No you won t Rufford You will remember that this woman is a woman and that a woman s friends are bound to stand up for her After all your hands are not quite clean in the matter I am heavy enough on myself Penwether I have been a fool and I own it But I have done nothing unbecoming a gentleman He was almost tempted to quarrel with his brother in law but at last he allowed the letter to be sent just as Sir George had written it and then tried to banish the affair from his mind for the present so that he might enjoy his life till the next hostile step should be taken by the Trefoil clan When Larry Twentyman received the lord s note which was left at Chowton Farm by Hampton s groom he was in the lowest depth of desolation He had intended to hunt that day in compliance with John Morton s advice but had felt himself quite unable to make the effort It was not only that he had been thrown over by Mary Masters but that everybody knew that he had been thrown over If he had kept the matter secret perhaps he might have borne it but it is so hard to bear a sorrow of which all one s neighbours are conscious When a man is reduced by poverty to the drinking of beer instead of wine it is not the loss of the wine that is so heavy on him as the consciousness that those around him are aware of the reason And he is apt to extend his idea of this consciousness to a circle that is altogether indifferent of the fact That a man should fail in his love seems to him to be of all failures the most contemptible and Larry thought that there would not be one in the field unaware of his miserable rejection In spite of his mother s prayers he had refused to go and had hung about the farm all day Then there came to him Lord Rufford s note It had been quite unexpected and a month or two before when his hopes had still been high in regard to Mary Masters would have filled him with delight It was the foible of his life to be esteemed a gentleman and his poor ambition to be allowed to live among men of higher social standing than himself Those dinners of Lord Rufford s at the Bush had been a special grief to him The young lord had been always courteous to him in the field and he had been able as he thought to requite such courtesy by little attentions in the way of game preserving If pheasants from Dillsborough Wood ate Goarly s wheat so did they eat Larry Twentyman s barley He had a sportsman s heart above complaint as to such matters and had always been neighbourly to the lord No doubt pheasants and hares were left at his house whenever there was shooting in the neighbourhood which to his mother afforded great consolation But Larry did not care for the pheasants and hares Had he so pleased he could have shot them on his own land but he did not preserve and as a good neighbour he regarded the pheasants and hares as Lord Rufford s property He felt that he was behaving as a gentleman as well as a neighbour and that he should be treated as such Fred Botsey had dined at the Bush with Lord Rufford and Larry looked on Fred as in no way better than himself Now at last the invitation had come He was asked to a day s shooting and to dine with the lord and his party at the inn How pleasant would it be to give a friendly nod to Runciman as he went into the room and to assert afterwards in Botsey s hearing something of the joviality of the evening Of course Hampton would be there as Hampton s servant had brought the note and he was very anxious to be on friendly terms with mister Hampton Next to the lord himself there was no one in the hunt who carried his head so high as young Hampton But there arose to him the question whether all this had not arrived too late Of what good is it to open up the true delights of life to a man when you have so scotched and wounded him that he has no capability left of enjoying anything As he sat lonely with his pipe in his mouth he thought for a while that he would decline the invitation The idea of selling Chowton Farm and of establishing himself at some Antipodes in which the name of Mary Masters should never have been heard was growing upon him Of what use would the friendship of Lord Rufford be to him at the other side of the globe At last however the hope of giving that friendly nod to Runciman overcame him and he determined to go He wrote a note which caused him no little thought presenting his compliments to Lord Rufford and promising to meet his lordship s party at Dillsborough Wood The shooting went off very well and Larry behaved himself with propriety He wanted the party to come in and lunch and had given sundry instructions to his mother on that head But they did not remain near to his place throughout the day and his efforts in that direction were not successful Between five and six he went home and at half past seven appeared at the Bush attired in his best He never yet had sat down with a lord and his mind misgave him a little but he had spirit enough to look about for Runciman who however was not to be seen Sir George was not there but the party had been made up as regarded the dinner by the addition of Captain Glomax who had returned from hunting Captain Glomax was in high glee having had as he declared the run of the season When a Master has been deserted on any day by the choice spirits of his hunt he is always apt to boast to them that he had on that occasion the run of the season He had taken a fox from Impington right across to Hogsborough which as every one knows is just on the borders of the U R U had then run him for five miles into Lord Chiltern s country and had killed him in the centre of the Brake Hunt after an hour and a half almost without a check It was one of those straight things that one doesn t often see now a days said Glomax Any pace asked Lord Rufford Very good indeed for the first forty minutes I wish you had all been there It was better fun I take it than shooting rabbits Then Hampton put the Captain through his facings as to time and distance and exact places that had been passed and ended by expressing an opinion that he could have kicked his hat as fast on foot Whereupon the Captain begged him to try and hinted that he did not know the country In answer to which Hampton offered to bet a five pound note that young Jack Runce would say that the pace had been slow Jack was the son of the old farmer whom the Senator had so disgusted and was supposed to know what he was about on a horse But Glomax declined the bet saying that he did not care a for Jack Runce He knew as much about pace as any farmer or for the matter of that any gentleman in Ufford or Rufford and the pace for forty minutes had been very good Nevertheless all the party were convinced that the thing had been so slow that it had not been worth riding to a conviction which is not uncommon with gentlemen when they have missed a run In all this discussion poor Larry took no great part though he knew the country as well as any one Larry had not as yet got over the awe inspired by the lord in his black coat Perhaps Larry s happiest moment in the evening was when Runciman himself brought in the soup for at that moment Lord Rufford put his hand on his shoulder and desired him to sit down and Runciman both heard and saw it And at dinner when the champagne had been twice round he became more comfortable The conversation got upon Goarly and in reference to that matter he was quite at home It s not my doing said Lord Rufford I have instructed no one to keep him locked up It s a very good job from all that I can hear said Tom Surbiton All I did was to get mister Masters here to take up the case for me and I learned from him to day that the rascal had already agreed to take the money I offered He only bargains that it shall be paid into his own hands no doubt desiring to sell the attorney he has employed Bearside has got his money from the American Senator my lord said Larry They may fight it out among them I don t care who gets the money or who pays it as long as I m not imposed upon We must proceed against that man Scrobby said Glomax with all the authority of a Master You ll never convict him on Goarly s evidence said the Lord Then Larry could give them further information Nickem had positively traced the purchase of the red herrings An old woman in Rufford was ready to swear that she herself had sold them to missus Scrobby Tom Surbiton suggested that the possession of red herrings was not of itself a crime Hampton thought that it was corroborative Captain Battersby wanted to know whether any of the herrings were still in existence so that they could be sworn to Glomax was of opinion that villainy of so deep a dye could not have taken place in any other hunting country in England There s been strychnine put down in the Brake too said Hampton But not in cartloads said the Master I rather think said Larry that Nickem knows where the strychnine was bought That ll make a clear case of it Hanging would be too good for such a scoundrel This was said after the third glass of champagne but the opinion was one which was well received by the whole company After that the Senator s conduct was discussed and they all agreed that in the whole affair that was the most marvellous circumstance They must be queer people over there said Larry Brutes said Glomax They once tried a pack of hounds somewhere in one of the States but they never could run a yard There was a good deal of wine drank which was not unusual at Lord Rufford s dinners Most of the company were seasoned vessels and none of them were much the worse for what they drank But the generous wine got to Larry s heart and perhaps made his brain a little soft Lord Rufford remembering what had been said about the young man s misery tried to console him by attention and as the evening wore on and when the second cigars had been lit all round the two were seated together in confidential conversation at a corner of the table Yes my lord I think I shall hook it said Larry Something has occurred that has made the place not quite so comfortable to me and as it is all my own I think I shall sell it We should miss you immensely in the hunt said Lord Rufford who of course knew what the something was It s very kind of you to say so my lord But there are things which may make a man go Nothing serious I hope Just a young woman my lord I don t want it talked about but I don t mind mentioning it to you You should never let those troubles touch you so closely said his lordship whose own withers at this moment were by no means unwrung I dare say not But if you feel it how are you to help it I shall do very well when I get away Chowton Farm is not the only spot in the world But a man so fond of hunting as you are Well yes I shall miss the hunting my lord shan t I If mister Morton don t buy the place I should like it to go to your lordship I offered it to him first because it came from them Quite right By the bye I hear that mister Morton is very ill So I heard said Larry Nupper has been with him I know and I fancy they have sent for somebody from London I don t know that he cares much about the land He thinks more of the foreign parts he s always in I don t believe we should fall out about the price my lord Then Lord Rufford explained that he would not go into that matter just at present but that if the place were in the market he would certainly like to buy it He however did as John Morton had done before and endeavoured to persuade the poor fellow that he should not alter the whole tenor of his life because a young lady would not look at him Good night mister Runciman said Larry as he made his way down stairs to the yard We ve had an uncommon pleasant evening I m glad you ve enjoyed yourself Larry Larry thought that his Christian name from the hotel keeper s lips had never sounded so offensively as on the present occasion CHAPTER XXII MISS TREFOIL S DECISION Lord Rufford s letter reached Arabella at her cousin s house in due course and was handed to her in the morning as she came down to breakfast The envelope bore his crest and coronet and she was sure that more than one pair of eyes had already seen it Her mother had been in the room some time before her and would of course know that the letter was from Lord Rufford An indiscreet word or two had been said in the hearing of missus Connop Green as to which Arabella had already scolded her mother most vehemently and missus Connop Green too would probably have seen the letter and would know that it had come from the lover of whom boasts had been made The Connop Greens would be ready to worship Arabella down to the very soles of her feet if she were certainly without a vestige of doubt engaged to be the wife of Lord Rufford But there had been so many previous mistakes And they too had heard of mister John Morton They too were a little afraid of Arabella though she was undoubtedly the niece of a Duke She was aware now as always how much depended on her personal bearing but this was a moment of moments She would fain have kept the letter and have opened it in the retirement of her own room She knew its terrible importance and was afraid of her own countenance when she should read it All the hopes of her life were contained in that letter But were she to put it in her pocket she would betray her anxiety by doing so She found herself bound to open it and read it at once and she did open it and read it After all it was what she had expected It was very decided very short very cold and carrying with it no sign of weakness But it was of such a letter that she had thought when she resolved that she would apply to Lord Mistletoe and endeavour to put the whole family of Trefoil in arms She had been so she had assured herself quite sure that that kind loving response which she had solicited would not be given to her But yet the stern fact now that it was absolutely in her hands almost overwhelmed her She could not restrain the dull dead look of heart breaking sorrow which for a few moments clouded her face a look which took away all her beauty lengthening her cheeks and robbing her eyes of that vivacity which it was the task of her life to assume Is anything the matter my dear asked missus Connop Green Then she made a final effort an heroic effort What do you think mamma she said paying no attention to her cousin s inquiry What is it Arabella Jack got some injury that day at Peltry and is so lame that they don t know whether he ll ever put his foot to the ground again Poor fellow said mister Green Who is Jack Jack is a horse mister Green and such a horse that one cannot but be sorry for him Poor Jack I don t know any Christian whose lameness would be such a nuisance Does Lord Rufford write about his horses asked missus Connop Green thus betraying that knowledge as to the letter which she had obtained from the envelope If you must know all the truth about it said Arabella the horse is my horse and not Lord Rufford s And as he is the only horse I have got and as he s the dearest horse in all the world you must excuse my being a little sorry about him Poor Jack After that the breakfast was eaten and everybody in the room believed the story of the horse s lameness except Lady Augustus When breakfast and the loitering after breakfast were well over so that she could escape without exciting any notice she made her way up to her bedroom In a few minutes so that again there should be nothing noticeable her mother followed her But her door was locked It is I Arabella said her mother You can t come in at present mamma I am busy But Arabella You can t come in at present mamma Then Lady Augustus slowly glided away to her own room and there waited for tidings The whole form of the girl s face was altered when she was alone Her features in themselves were not lovely Her cheeks and chin were heavy Her brow was too low and her upper lip too long Her nose and teeth were good and would have been very handsome had they belonged to a man Her complexion had always been good till it had been injured by being improved and so was the carriage of her head and the outside lines of her bust and figure and her large eyes though never soft could be bright and sparkle Skill had done much for her and continued effort almost more But now the effort was dropped and that which skill had done turned against her She was haggard lumpy and almost hideous in her bewildered grief Had there been a word of weakness in the short letter she might have founded upon it some hope It did not occur to her that he had had the letter written for him and she was astonished at its curt strength How could he dare to say that she had mistaken him Had she not lain in his arms while he embraced her How could he have found the courage to say that he had had no thought of marriage when he had declared to her that he loved her She must have known that she had hunted him as a fox is hunted and yet she believed that she was being cruelly ill used For a time all that dependence on Lord Mistletoe and her uncle deserted her What effect could they have on a man who would write such a letter as that Had she known that the words were the words of his brother in law even that would have given her some hope But what should she do Whatever steps she took she must take at once And she must tell her mother Her mother s help would be necessary to her now in whatever direction she might turn her mind She almost thought that she would abandon him without another word She had been strong in her reliance on family aid till the time for invoking it had come but now she believed that it would be useless Could it be that such a man as this would be driven into marriage by the interference of Lord Mistletoe She would much like to bring down some punishment on his head but in doing so she would cut all other ground from under her own feet There were still open to her Patagonia and the Paragon She hated the Paragon and she recoiled with shuddering from the idea of Patagonia But as for hating she hated Lord Rufford most And what was there that she loved She tried to ask herself some question even as to that There certainly was no man for whom she cared a straw nor had there been for the last six or eight years Even when he was kissing her she was thinking of her built up hair of her pearl powder her paint and of possible accidents and untoward revelations The loan of her lips had been for use only and not for any pleasure which she had even in pleasing him In her very swoon she had felt the need of being careful at all points It was all labour and all care and alas alas all disappointment But there was a future through which she must live How might she best avoid the misfortune of poverty for the twenty thirty or forty years which might be accorded to her What did it matter whom or what she hated The housemaid probably did not like cleaning grates nor the butcher killing sheep nor the sempstress stitching silks She must live And if she could only get away from her mother that in itself would be something Most people were distasteful to her but no one so much as her mother Here in England she knew that she was despised among the people with whom she lived And now she would be more despised than ever Her uncle and aunt though she disliked them had been much to her It was something that annual visit to Mistletoe though she never enjoyed it when she was there But she could well understand that after such a failure as this after such a game played before their own eyes in their own house her uncle and her aunt would drop her altogether She had played this game so boldly that there was no retreat Would it not therefore be better that she should fly altogether There was a time on that morning in which she had made up her mind that she would write a most affectionate letter to Morton telling him that her people had now agreed to his propositions as to settlement and assuring him that from henceforward she would be all his own She did think that were she to do so she might still go with him to Patagonia But if so she must do it at once The delay had already been almost too long In that case she would not say a word in reply to Lord Rufford and would allow all that to be as though it had never been Then again there arose to her mind the remembrance of Rufford Hall of all the glories of the triumph over everybody Then again there was the idea of a forlorn hope She thought that she could have brought herself to do it if only death would have been the alternative of success when she had resolved to make the rush It was nearly one when she went to her mother and even then she was undecided But the joint agony of the solitude and the doubts had been too much for her and she found herself constrained to seek a counsellor He has thrown you over said Lady Augustus as soon as the door was closed Of course he has said Arabella walking up the room and again playing her part even before her mother I knew it would be so You knew nothing of the kind mamma and your saying so is simply an untruth It was you who put me up to it Arabella that is false It wasn t you I suppose who made me throw over mister Morton and Bragton Certainly not That is so like you mamma There isn t a single thing that you do or say that you don t deny afterwards These little compliments were so usual among them that at the present moment they excited no great danger There s his letter I suppose you had better read it And she chucked the document to her mother It is very decided said Lady Augustus It is the falsest the most impudent and the most scandalous letter that a man ever wrote to a woman I could horsewhip him for it myself if I could get near him Is it all over Arabella All over What questions you do ask mamma No It is not all over I ll stick to him like a leech He proposed to me as plainly as any man ever did to any woman I don t care what people may say or think He hasn t heard the last of me and so he ll find And thus in her passion she made up her mind that she would not yet abandon the hunt What will you do my dear What will I do How am I to say what I will do If I were standing near him with a knife in my hand I would stick it into his heart I would Mistaken him Liar They talk of girls lying but what girl would lie like that But something must be done If papa were not such a fool as he is he could manage it all for me said Arabella dutifully I must see my father and I must dictate a letter for him Where is papa In London I suppose You must come up to London with me to morrow We shall have to go to his club and get him out It must be done immediately and then I must see Lord Mistletoe and I will write to the Duke Would it not be better to write to your papa said Lady Augustus not liking the idea of being dragged away so quickly from comfortable quarters No it wouldn t If you won t go I shall and you must give me some money I shall write to Lord Rufford too And so it was at last decided the wretched old woman being dragged away up to London on some excuse which the Connop Greens were not sorry to accept But on that same afternoon Arabella wrote to Lord Rufford Your letter has amazed me I cannot understand it It seems to be almost impossible that it should really have come from you How can you say that I have mistaken you There has been no mistake Surely that letter cannot have been written by you Of course I have been obliged to tell my father everything ARABELLA On the following day at about four in the afternoon the mother and daughter drove up to the door of Graham s Club in Bond Street and there they found Lord Augustus With considerable difficulty he was induced to come down from the whist room and was forced into the brougham He was a handsome fat man with a long grey beard who passed his whole life in eating drinking and playing whist and was troubled by no scruples and no principles He would not cheat at cards because it was dangerous and ungentlemanlike and if discovered would lead to his social annihilation but as to paying money that he owed to tradesmen it never occurred to him as being a desirable thing as long as he could get what he wanted without doing so He had expended his own patrimony and his wife s fortune and now lived on an allowance made to him by his brother Whatever funds his wife might have not a shilling of them ever came from him When he began to understand something of the nature of the business on hand he suggested that his brother the Duke could do what was desirable infinitely better than he could He won t think anything of me said Lord Augustus We ll make him think something said Arabella sternly You must do it papa They d turn you out of the club if they knew that you had refused Then he looked up in the brougham and snarled at her Papa you must copy the letter and sign it How am I to know the truth of it all he asked It is quite true said Lady Augustus There was very much more of it but at last he was carried away bodily and in his daughter s presence he did write and sign the following letter MY LORD I have heard from my daughter a story which has surprised me very much It appears that she has been staying with you at Rufford Hall and again at Mistletoe and that while at the latter place you proposed marriage to her She tells me with heart breaking concern that you have now repudiated your own proposition not only once made but repeated Her condition is most distressing She is in all respects your Lordship s equal As her father I am driven to ask you what excuse you have to make or whether she has interpreted you aright I have the honour to be Your very humble servant AUGUSTUS TREFOIL CHAPTER XXIII IN THESE DAYS ONE CAN T MAKE A MAN MARRY This was going on while Lord Rufford was shooting in the neighbourhood of Dillsborough and when the letter was being put into its envelope at the lodgings in Orchard Street his Lordship was just sitting down to dinner with his guests at the Bush At the same time John Morton was lying ill at Bragton a fact of which Arabella was not aware The letter from Lord Augustus was put into the post on Saturday evening but when that line of action was decided upon by Arabella she was aware that she must not trust solely to her father Various plans were fermenting in her brain all or any of which if carried out at all must be carried out at the same time and at once There must be no delay or that final chance of Patagonia would be gone The leader of a forlorn hope though he be ever so resolved to die in the breach still makes some preparation for his escape Among her plans the first in order was a resolution to see Lord Mistletoe whom she knew to be in town Parliament was to meet in the course of the next week and he was to move the address There had been much said about all this at Mistletoe from which she knew that he was in London preparing himself among the gentlemen at the Treasury Then she herself would write to the Duke She thought that she could concoct a letter that would move even his heart She would tell him that she was a daughter of the house of Trefoil and all that kind of thing She had it distinctly laid down in her mind And then there was another move which she would make before she altogether threw up the game She would force herself into Lord Rufford s presence and throw herself into his arms at his feet if need be and force him into compliance Should she fail then she too had an idea what a raging woman could do But her first step now must be with her cousin Mistletoe She would not write to the Duke till she had seen her cousin Lord Mistletoe when in London lived at the family house in Piccadilly and thither early on the Sunday morning she sent a note to say that she especially wished to see her cousin and would call at three o clock on that day The messenger brought back word that Lord Mistletoe would be at home and exactly at that hour the hired brougham stopped at the door Her mother had wished to accompany her but she had declared that if she could not go alone she would not go at all In that she was right for whatever favour the young heir to the family honours might retain for his fair cousin who was at any rate a Trefoil he had none for his uncle s wife She was shown into his own sitting room on the ground floor and then he immediately joined her I wouldn t have you shown upstairs he said because I understand from your note that you want to see me in particular That is so kind of you Lord Mistletoe was a young man about thirty less in stature than his father or uncle but with the same handsome inexpressive face Almost all men take to some line in life His father was known as a manager of estates his uncle as a whist player he was minded to follow the steps of his grandfather and be a statesman He was eaten up by no high ambition but lived in the hope that by perseverance he might live to become a useful Under Secretary and perhaps ultimately a Privy Seal As he was well educated and laborious and had no objection to sitting for five hours together in the House of Commons with nothing to do and sometimes with very little to hear it was thought by his friends that he would succeed And what is it I can do he said with that affable smile to which he had already become accustomed as a government politician I am in great trouble said Arabella leaving her hand for a moment in his as she spoke I am sorry for that What sort of trouble He knew that his uncle and his aunt s family were always short of money and was already considering to what extent he would go in granting her petition Do you know Lord Rufford Lord Rufford Yes I know him but very slightly My father knows him very much better than I do I have just been at Mistletoe and he was there My story is so hard to tell I had better out with it at once Lord Rufford has asked me to be his wife The deuce he has It s a very fine property and quite unembarrassed And now he repudiates his engagement Upon hearing this the young lord s face became very long He also had heard something of the past life of his handsome cousin though he had always felt kindly to her It was not once only Dear me I should have thought your father would be the proper person Papa has written but you know what papa is Does the Duke know of it or my mother It partly went on at Mistletoe I would tell you the whole story if I knew how Then she did tell him her story during the telling of which he sat profoundly silent She had gone to stay with Lady Penwether at Lord Rufford s house and then he had first told her of his love Then they had agreed to meet at Mistletoe and she had begged her aunt to receive her She had not told her aunt at once and her aunt had been angry with her because they had walked together Then she had told everything to the Duchess and had begged the Duchess to ask the Duke to speak to Lord Rufford At Mistletoe Lord Rufford had twice renewed his offer and she had then accepted him But the Duke had not spoken to him before he left the place She owned that she thought the Duchess had been a little hard to her Of course she did not mean to complain but the Duchess had been angry with her because she had hunted And now in answer to the note from herself had come a letter from Lord Rufford in which he repudiated the engagement I only got it yesterday and I came at once to you I do not think you will see your cousin treated in that way without raising your hand You will remember that I have no brother But what can I do asked Lord Mistletoe She had taken great trouble with her face so that she was able to burst out into tears She had on a veil which partly concealed her She did not believe in the effect of a pocket handkerchief but sat with her face half averted Tell him what you think about it she said Such engagements Arabella he said should always be authenticated by a third party It is for that reason that a girl generally refers her lover to her father before she allows herself to be considered as engaged Think what my position has been I wanted to refer him to my uncle and asked the Duchess My mother must have had some reason I m sure she must There isn t a woman in London knows how such things should be done better than my mother I can write to Lord Rufford and ask him for an explanation but I do not see what good it would do If you were in earnest about it he would be afraid of you I don t think he would in the least If I were to make a noise about it it would only do you harm You wouldn t wish all the world to know that he had Jilted me I don t care what the world knows Am I to put up with such treatment as that and do nothing Do you like to see your cousin treated in that way I don t like it at all Lord Rufford is a good sort of man in his way and has a large property I wish with all my heart that it had come off all right but in these days one can t make a man marry There used to be the alternative of going out and being shot at but that is over now And a man is to do just as he pleases I am afraid so If a man is known to have behaved badly to a girl public opinion will condemn him Can anything be worse than this treatment of me Lord Mistletoe could not tell her that he had alluded to absolute knowledge and that at present he had no more than her version of the story or that the world would require more than that before the general condemnation of which he had spoken would come So he sat in silence and shook his head And you think that I should put up with it quietly I think that your father should see the man Arabella shook her head contemptuously If you wish it I will write to my mother I would rather trust to my uncle I don t know what he could do but I will write to him if you please And you won t see Lord Rufford He sat silent for a minute or two during which she pressed him over and over again to have an interview with her recreant lover bringing up all the arguments that she knew reminding him of their former affection for each other telling him that she had no brother of her own and that her own father was worse than useless in such a matter A word or two she said of the nature of the prize to be gained and many words as to her absolute right to regard that prize as her own But at last he refused I am not the person to do it he said Even if I were your brother I should not be so unless with the view of punishing him for his conduct in which place the punishment to you would be worse than any I could inflict on him It cannot be good that any young lady should have her name in the mouths of all the lovers of gossip in the country She was going to burst out at him in her anger but before the words were out of her mouth she remembered herself She could not afford to make enemies and certainly not an enemy of him Perhaps then she said you had better tell your mother all that I have told you I will write to the Duke myself And so she left him and as she returned to Orchard Street in the brougham she applied to him every term of reproach she could bring to mind He was selfish and a coward and utterly devoid of all feeling of family honour He was a prig and unmanly and false A real cousin would have burst out into a passion and have declared himself ready to seize Lord Rufford by the throat and shake him into instant matrimony But this man through whose veins water was running instead of blood had no feeling no heart no capability for anger Oh what a vile world it was A little help so very little would have made everything straight for her If her aunt had only behaved at Mistletoe as aunts should behave there would have been no difficulty In her misery she thought that the world was more cruel to her than to any other person in it On her arrival at home she was astounded by a letter that she found there a letter of such a nature that it altogether drove out of her head the purpose which she had of writing to the Duke on that evening The letter was from John Morton and now reached her through the lawyer to whom it had been sent by private hand for immediate delivery It ran as follows DEAREST ARABELLA I am very ill so ill that doctor Fanning who has come down from London has I think but a poor opinion of my case He does not say that it is hopeless and that is all I think it right to tell you this as my affection for you is what it always has been If you wish to see me you and your mother had better come to Bragton at once You can telegraph I am too weak to write more Yours most affectionately JOHN MORTON There is nothing infectious John Morton is dying she almost screamed out to her mother Dying So he says Oh what an unfortunate wretch I am Everything that touches me comes to grief Then she burst out into a flood of true unfeigned tears It won t matter so much said Lady Augustus if you mean to write to the Duke and go on with this other affair Oh mamma how can you talk in that way Well my dear you know I am heartless I know that But you are ten times worse Think how I have treated him I don t want him to die my dear but what can I say I can t do him any good It is all in God s hands and if he must die why it won t make so much difference to you I have looked upon all that as over for a long time It is not over After all he has liked me better than any of them He wants me to go to Bragton That of course is out of the question It is not out of the question at all I shall go Arabella And you must go with me mamma I will do no such thing said Lady Augustus to whom the idea of Bragton was terrible Indeed you must He has asked me to go and I shall do it You can hardly let me go alone And what will you say to Lord Rufford I don t care for Lord Rufford Is he to prevent my going where I please And your father and the Duke and the Duchess How can you go there after all that you have been doing since you left What do I care for the Duke and the Duchess It has come to that that I care for no one They are all throwing me over That little wretch Mistletoe will do nothing This man really loved me He has never treated me badly Whether he live or whether he die he has been true to me Then she sat and thought of it all What would Lord Rufford care for her father s letter If her cousin Mistletoe would not stir in her behalf what chance had she with her uncle And though she had thoroughly despised her cousin she had understood and had unconsciously believed much that he had said to her In these days one can t make a man marry What horrid days they were But John Morton would marry her to morrow if he were well in spite of all her ill usage Of course he would die and so she would again be overwhelmed but yet she would go and see him As she determined to do so there was something even in her hard callous heart softer than the love of money and more human than the dream of an advantageous settlement in life CHAPTER XXIV THE SENATOR S SECOND LETTER In the mean time our friend the Senator up in London was much distracted in his mind finding no one to sympathise with him in his efforts conscious of his own rectitude of purpose always brave against others and yet with a sad doubt in his own mind whether it could be possible that he should always be right and everybody around him wrong Coming away from mister Mainwaring s dinner he had almost quarrelled with John Morton or rather John Morton had altogether quarrelled with him On their way back from Dillsborough to Bragton the minister elect to Patagonia had told him in so many words that he had misbehaved himself at the clergyman s house Did I say anything that was untrue asked the Senator Was I inaccurate in my statements If so no man alive will be more ready to recall what he has said and to ask for pardon mister Morton endeavoured to explain to him that it was not his statements which were at fault so much as the opinions based on them and the language in which those opinions were given But the Senator could not be made to understand that a man had not a right to his opinions and a right also to the use of forcible language as long as he abstained from personalities It was extremely personal all that you said about the purchase of livings said Morton How was I to know that rejoined the Senator When in private society I inveigh against pickpockets I cannot imagine sir that there should be a pickpocket in the company As the Senator said this he was grieving in his heart at the trouble he had occasioned and was almost repenting the duties he had imposed on himself but yet his voice was bellicose and antagonistic The conversation was carried on till Morton found himself constrained to say that though he entertained great personal respect for his guest he could not go with him again into society He was ill at the time though neither he himself knew it nor the Senator On the next morning mister Gotobed returned to London without seeing his host and before the day was over mister Nupper was at Morton s bedside He was already suffering from gastric fever The Senator was in truth unhappy as he returned to town The intimacy between him and the late Secretary of Legation at his capital had arisen from a mutual understanding between them that each was to be allowed to see the faults and to admire the virtues of their two countries and that conversation between them was to be based on the mutual system But nobody can in truth endure to be told of shortcomings either on his own part or on that of his country He himself can abuse himself or his country but he cannot endure it from alien lips mister Gotobed had hardly said a word about England which Morton himself might not have said but such words coming from an American had been too much even for the guarded temper of an unprejudiced and phlegmatic Englishman The Senator as he returned alone to London understood something of this and when a few days later he heard that the friend who had quarrelled with him was ill he was discontented with himself and sore at heart But he had his task to perform and he meant to perform it to the best of his ability In his own country he had heard vehement abuse of the old land from the lips of politicians and had found at the same time almost on all sides great social admiration for the people so abused He had observed that every Englishman of distinction was received in the States as a demigod and that some who were not very great in their own land had been converted into heroes in his English books were read there English laws were obeyed there English habits were cultivated often at the expense of American comfort And yet it was the fashion among orators to speak of the English as a worn out stupid and enslaved people He was a thoughtful man and all this had perplexed him so that he had obtained leave from his State and from Congress to be absent during a part of a short Session and had come over determined to learn as much as he could Everything he heard and almost everything he saw offended him at some point And yet in the midst of it all he was conscious that he was surrounded by people who claimed and made good their claims to superiority What was a lord let him be ever so rich and have ever so many titles And yet even with such a popinjay as Lord Rufford he himself felt the lordship When that old farmer at the hunt breakfast had removed himself and his belongings to the other side of the table the Senator though aware of the justice of his cause had been keenly alive to the rebuke He had expressed himself very boldly at the rector s house at Dillsborough and had been certain that not a word of real argument had been possible in answer to him But yet he left the house with a feeling almost of shame which had grown into real penitence before he reached Bragton He knew that he had already been condemned by Englishmen as ill mannered ill conditioned and absurd He was as much alive as any man to the inward distress of heart which such a conviction brings with it to all sensitive minds And yet he had his purpose and would follow it out He was already hard at work on the lecture which he meant to deliver somewhere in London before he went back to his home duties and had made it known to the world at large that he meant to say some sharp things of the country he was visiting Soon after his return to town he was present at the opening of Parliament mister Mounser Green of the Foreign Office having seen that he was properly accommodated with a seat Then he went down to the election of a member of Parliament in the little borough of Quinborough It was unfortunate for Great Britain which was on its trial and unpleasant also for the poor Senator who had appointed himself judge that such a seat should have fallen vacant at that moment Quinborough was a little town of three thousand inhabitants clustering round the gates of a great Whig Marquis which had been spared who can say why at the first Reform Bill and having but one member had come out scatheless from the second Quinborough still returned its one member with something less than five hundred constituents and in spite of household suffrage and the ballot had always returned the member favoured by the Marquis This nobleman driven no doubt by his conscience to make some return to the country for the favour shown to his family had always sent to Parliament some useful and distinguished man who without such patronage might have been unable to serve his country On the present occasion a friend of the people so called an unlettered demagogue such as is in England in truth distasteful to all classes had taken himself down to Quinborough as a candidate in opposition to the nobleman s nominee He had been backed by all the sympathies of the American Senator who knew nothing of him or his unfitness and nothing whatever of the patriotism of the Marquis But he did know what was the population and what the constituency of Liverpool and also what were those of Quinborough He supposed that he knew what was the theory of representation in England and he understood correctly that hitherto the member for Quinborough had been the nominee of that great lord These things were horrid to him There was to his thinking a fiction more than fiction a falseness about all this which not only would but ought to bring the country prostrate to the dust When the working man s candidate whose political programme consisted of a general disbelief in all religions received by ballot only nine votes from those five hundred voters the Senator declared to himself that the country must be rotten to the core It was not only that Britons were slaves but that they hugged their chains To the gentleman who assured him that the Right Honble would make a much better member of Parliament than Tom Bobster the plasterer from Shoreditch he in vain tried to prove that the respective merits of the two men had nothing to do with the question It had been the duty of those five hundred voters to show to the world that in the exercise of a privilege entrusted to them for the public service they had not been under the dictation of their rich neighbour Instead of doing so they had almost unanimously grovelled in the dust at their rich neighbour s feet There are but one or two such places left in all England said the gentleman But those one or two answered the Senator were wilfully left there by the Parliament which represented the whole nation Then quite early in the Session immediately after the voting of the address a motion had been made by the Government of the day for introducing household suffrage into the counties No one knew the labour to which the Senator subjected himself in order that he might master all these peculiarities that he might learn how men became members of Parliament and how they ceased to be so in what degree the House of Commons was made up of different elements how it came to pass that though there was a House of Lords so many lords sat in the lower chamber All those matters which to ordinary educated Englishmen are almost as common as the breath of their nostrils had been to him matter of long and serious study And as the intent student who has zealously buried himself for a week among commentaries and notes feels himself qualified to question Porson and to Be Bentley Bentley so did our Senator believe while still he was groping among the rudiments that he had all our political intricacies at his fingers ends When he heard the arguments used for a difference of suffrage in the towns and counties and found that even they who were proposing the change were not ready absolutely to assimilate the two and still held that rural ascendancy feudalism as he called it should maintain itself by barring a fraction of the House of Commons from the votes of the majority he pronounced the whole thing to be a sham The intention was he said to delude the people It is all coming said the gentleman who was accustomed to argue with him in those days He spoke in a sad vein which was in itself distressing to the Senator Why should you be in such a hurry The Senator suggested that if the country delayed much longer this imperative task of putting its house in order the roof would have fallen in before the repairs were done Then he found that this gentleman too avoided his company and declined to sit with him any more in the Gallery of the House of Commons Added to all this was a private rankling sore in regard to Goarly and Bearside He had now learned nearly all the truth about Goarly and had learned also that Bearside had known the whole when he had last visited that eminent lawyer s office Goarly had deserted his supporters and had turned evidence against Scrobby his partner in iniquity That Goarly was a rascal the Senator had acknowledged So far the general opinion down in Rufford had been correct But he could get nobody to see or at any rate could get nobody to acknowledge that the rascality of Goarly had had nothing to do with the question as he had taken it up The man s right to his own land his right to be protected from pheasants and foxes from horses and hounds was not lessened by the fact that he was a poor ignorant squalid dishonest wretch mister Gotobed had now received a bill from Bearside for Lforty two seven s nine d for costs in the case leaving after the deduction of Lfifteen already paid a sum of Ltwenty seven seven s nine d stated to be still due And this was accompanied by an intimation that as he mister Gotobed was a foreigner soon about to leave the country mister Bearside must request that his claim might be settled quite at once No one could be less likely than our Senator to leave a foreign country without paying his bills He had quarrelled with Morton who also at this time was too ill to have given him much assistance Though he had become acquainted with half Dillsborough there was nobody there to whom he could apply Thus he was driven to employ a London attorney and the London attorney told him that he had better pay Bearside the Senator remembering at the time that he would also have to pay the London attorney for his advice He gave this second lawyer authority to conclude the matter and at last Bearside accepted Ltwenty When the London attorney refused to take anything for his trouble the Senator felt such conduct almost as an additional grievance In his existing frame of mind he would sooner have expended a few more dollars than be driven to think well of anything connected with English law It was immediately after he had handed over the money in liquidation of Bearside s claim that he sat down to write a further letter to his friend and correspondent Josiah Scroome His letter was not written in the best of tempers but still through it all there was a desire to be just and an anxiety to abstain from the use of hard phrases The letter was as follows Fenton s Hotel saint James Street London Feb twelve one hundred eighty seven MY DEAR SIR Since I last wrote I have had much to trouble me and little perhaps to compensate me for my trouble I told you I think in one of my former letters that wherever I went I found myself able to say what I pleased as to the peculiarities of this very peculiar people I am not now going to contradict what I said then Wherever I go I do speak out and my eyes are still in my head and my head is on my shoulders But I have to acknowledge to myself that I give offence mister Morton whom you knew at the British Embassy in Washington and who I fear is now very ill parted from me when last I saw him in anger because of certain opinions I had expressed in a clergyman s house not as being ill founded but as being antagonistic to the clergyman himself This I feel to be unreasonable And in the neighbourhood of mister Morton s house I have encountered the ill will of a great many not for having spoken untruth for that I have never heard alleged but because I have not been reticent in describing the things which I have seen I told you I think that I had returned to mister Morton s neighbourhood with the view of defending an oppressed man against the power of the lord who was oppressing him Unfortunately for me the lord though a scapegrace spends his money freely and is a hospitable kindly hearted honest fellow whereas the injured victim has turned out to be a wretched scoundrel Scoundrel though he is he has still been ill used and the lord though good natured has been a tyrant But the poor wretch has thrown me over and sold himself to the other side and I have been held up to ignominy by all the provincial newspapers I have also had to pay through the nose one hundred seventy five dollars for my quixotism a sum which I cannot very well afford This money I have lost solely with the view of defending the weak but nobody with whom I have discussed the matter seems to recognise the purity of my object I am only reminded that I have put myself into the same boat with a rascal I feel from day to day how thoroughly I could have enjoyed a sojourn in this country if I had come here without any line of duty laid down for myself Could I have swum with the stream and have said yes or no as yes or no were expected I might have revelled in generous hospitality Nothing can be pleasanter than the houses here if you will only be as idle as the owners of them But when once you show them that you have an object they become afraid of you And industry in such houses as I now speak of is a crime You are there to glide through the day luxuriously in the house or to rush through it impetuously on horseback or with a gun if you be a sportsman Sometimes when I have asked questions about the most material institutions of the country I have felt that I was looked upon with absolute loathing This is disagreeable And yet I find it more easy in this country to sympathise with the rich than with the poor I do not here describe my own actual sympathies but only the easiness with which they might be evoked The rich are at any rate pleasant The poor are very much the reverse There is no backbone of mutiny in them against the oppression to which they are subjected but only the whining of a dog that knows itself to be a slave and pleads with his soft paw for tenderness from his master or the futile growlings of the caged tiger who paces up and down before his bars and has long ago forgotten to attempt to break them They are a long suffering race who only now and then feel themselves stirred up to contest a point against their masters on the basis of starvation We won t work but on such and such terms and if we cannot get them we will lie down and die That I take it is the real argument of a strike But they never do lie down and die If one in every parish one in every county would do so then the agricultural labourers of the country might live almost as well as the farmers pigs I was present the other day at the opening of Parliament It was a very grand ceremony though the Queen did not find herself well enough to do her duty in person But the grandeur was everything A royal programme was read from the foot of the throne of which even I knew all the details beforehand having read them in the newspapers Two opening speeches were then made by two young lords not after all so very young which sounded like lessons recited by schoolboys There was no touch of eloquence no approach to it It was clear that either of them would have been afraid to attempt the idiosyncrasy of passionate expression But they were exquisitely dressed and had learned their lessons to a marvel The flutter of the ladies dresses and the presence of the peers and the historic ornamentation of the house were all very pleasant but they reminded me of a last year s nut of which the outside appearance has been mellowed and improved by time but the fruit inside has withered away and become tasteless Since that I have been much interested with an attempt a further morsel of cobbling which is being done to improve the representation of the people Though it be but cobbling if it be in the right direction one is glad of it I do not know how far you may have studied the theories and system of the British House of Commons but for myself I must own that it was not till the other day that I was aware that though it acts together as one whole it is formed of two distinct parts The one part is sent thither from the towns by household suffrage and this which may be said to be the healthier of the two as coming more directly from the people is nevertheless disfigured by a multitude of anomalies Population hardly bears upon the question A town with fifteen thousand inhabitants has two members whereas another with four hundred thousand has only three and another with fifty thousand has one But there is worse disorder than this In the happy little village of Portarlington two hundred constituents choose a member among them or have one chosen for them by their careful lord whereas in the great city of London something like twenty five thousand registered electors only send four to Parliament With this the country is presumed to be satisfied But in the counties which by a different system send up the other part of the House there exists still a heavy property qualification for voting There is apparent to all a necessity for change here but the change proposed is simply a reduction of the qualification so that the rural labourer whose class is probably the largest as it is the poorest in the country is still disfranchised and will remain so unless it be his chance to live within the arbitrary line of some so called borough For these boroughs you must know are sometimes strictly confined to the aggregations of houses which constitute the town but sometimes stretch out their arms so as to include rural districts The divisions I am assured were made to suit the aspirations of political magnates when the first Reform Bill was passed What is to be expected of a country in which such absurdities are loved and sheltered I am still determined to express my views on these matters before I leave England and am with great labour preparing a lecture on the subject I am assured that I shall not be debarred from my utterances because that which I say is unpopular I am told that as long as I do not touch Her Majesty or Her Majesty s family or the Christian religion which is only the second Holy of Holies I may say anything Good taste would save me from the former offence and my own convictions from the latter But my friend who so informs me doubts whether many will come to hear me He tells me that the serious American is not popular here whereas the joker is much run after Of that I must take my chance In all this I am endeavouring to do a duty feeling every day more strongly my own inadequacy Were I to follow my own wishes I should return by the next steamer to my duties at home Believe me to be Dear Sir With much sincerity Yours truly ELIAS GOTOBED The Honble Josiah Scroome one hundred twenty five Q Street Minnesota Avenue Washington CHAPTER XXV PROVIDENCE INTERFERES The battle was carried on very fiercely in mister Masters house in Dillsborough to the misery of all within it but the conviction gained ground with every one there that Mary was to be sent to Cheltenham for some indefinite time Dolly and Kate seemed to think that she was to go never to return Six months which had been vaguely mentioned as the proposed period of her sojourn was to them almost as indefinite as eternity The two girls had been intensely anxious for the marriage wishing to have Larry for a brother looking forward with delight to their share in the unrestricted plenteousness of Chowton Farm longing to be allowed to consider themselves at home among the ricks and barns and wide fields but at this moment things had become so tragic that they were cowed and unhappy not that Mary should still refuse Larry Twentyman but that she should be going away for so long a time They could quarrel with their elder sister while the assurance was still with them that she would be there to forgive them but now that she was going away and that it had come to be believed by both of them that poor Lawrence had no chance they were sad and downhearted 
5789_57195_000005_000005	train-clean-100	In all that misery the poor attorney had the worst of it 
5789_57195_000005_000006	train-clean-100	Mary was free from her stepmother s zeal and her stepmother s persecution at any rate at night but the poor father was hardly allowed to sleep 
none	none	For missus Masters never gave up her game as altogether lost Though she might be driven alternately into towering passion and prostrate hysterics she would still come again to the battle A word of encouragement would she said bring Larry Twentyman back to his courtship and that word might be spoken if Mary s visit to Cheltenham were forbidden What did the letter signify or all the girl s protestations Did not everybody know how self willed young women were but how they could be brought round by proper usage Let Mary once be made to understand that she would not be allowed to be a fine lady and then she would marry mister Twentyman quick enough But this Ushanting this journeying to Cheltenham in order that nothing might be done was the very way to promote the disease This missus Masters said in season and out of season night and day till the poor husband longed for his daughter s departure in order that that point might at any rate be settled 
5789_57195_000005_000015	train-clean-100	In all these disputes he never quite yielded 
none	none	Though his heart sank within him he was still firm He would turn his back to his wife and let her run on with her arguments without a word of answer till at last he would bounce out of bed and swear that if she did not leave him alone he would go and lock himself into the office and sleep with his head on the office desk missus Masters was almost driven to despair but at last there came to her a gleam of hope most unexpectedly It had been settled that Mary should make her journey on Friday the twelfth February and that Reginald Morton was again to accompany her This in itself was to missus Masters an aggravation of the evil which was being done She was not in the least afraid of Reginald Morton but this attendance on Mary was in the eyes of her stepmother a cockering of her up a making a fine lady of her which was in itself of all things the most pernicious 
5789_57195_000006_000004	train-clean-100	If Mary must go to Cheltenham why could she not go by herself second class like any other young woman 
none	none	Nobody would eat her missus Masters declared But Reginald was firm in his purpose of accompanying her He had no objection whatever to the second class if mister Masters preferred it But as he meant to make the journey on the same day of course they would go together mister Masters said that he was very much obliged missus Masters protested that it was all trash from beginning to the end Then there came a sudden disruption to all these plans and a sudden renewal of her hopes to missus Masters which for one half day nearly restored her to good humour Lady Ushant wrote to postpone the visit because she herself had been summoned to Bragton 
5789_57195_000007_000002	train-clean-100	Her letter to Mary though affectionate was very short 
none	none	Her grand nephew John the head of the family had expressed a desire to see her and with that wish she was bound to comply Of course she said she would see Mary at Bragton or if that were not possible she herself would come into Dillsborough She did not know what might be the length of her visit but when it was over she hoped that Mary would return with her to Cheltenham The old lady s letter to Reginald was much longer because in that she had to speak of the state of John Morton s health and of her surprise that she should be summoned to his bedside Of course she would go though she could not look forward with satisfaction to a meeting with the Honble missus Morton Then she could not refrain from alluding to the fact that if anything were to happen to John Morton Reginald himself would be the Squire of Bragton Reginald when he received this at once went over to the attorney s house but he did not succeed in seeing Mary He learned however that they were all aware that the journey had been postponed To missus Masters it seemed that all this had been a dispensation of Providence Lady Ushant s letter had been received on the Thursday and missus Masters at once found it expedient to communicate with Larry Twentyman 
5789_57195_000008_000002	train-clean-100	She was not excellent herself at the writing of letters and therefore she got Dolly to be the scribe 
none	none	Before the Thursday evening the following note was sent to Chowton Farm DEAR LARRY Pray come and go to the club with father on Saturday We haven t seen you for so long Mother has got something to tell you Your affectionate friend DOLLY When this was received the poor man was smoking his moody pipe in silence as he roamed about his own farmyard in the darkness of the night He had not as yet known any comfort and was still firm in his purpose of selling the farm He had been out hunting once or twice but fancied that people looked at him with peculiar eyes He could not ride though he made one or two forlorn attempts to break his neck He did not care in the least whether they found or not and when Captain Glomax was held to have disgraced himself thoroughly by wasting an hour in digging out and then killing a vixen he had not a word to say about it But as he read Dolly s note there came back something of life into his eyes He had forsworn the club but would certainly go when thus invited 
5789_57195_000013_000007	train-clean-100	He wrote a scrawl to Dolly I ll come and having sent it off by the messenger tried to trust that there might yet be ground for hope 
none	none	missus Masters would not have allowed Dolly to send such a message without good reason On the Friday missus Masters could not abstain from proposing that Mary s visit to Cheltenham should be regarded as altogether out of the question 
5789_57195_000014_000001	train-clean-100	She had no new argument to offer except this last interposition of Providence in her favour 
none	none	mister Masters said that he did not see why Mary should not return with Lady Ushant Various things however might happen John Morton might die and then who could tell whether Lady Ushant would ever return to Cheltenham In this way the short lived peace soon came to an end especially as missus Masters endeavoured to utilize for general family purposes certain articles which had been purchased with a view to Mary s prolonged residence away from home This was resented by the attorney and the peace was short lived On the Saturday Larry came to the astonishment of mister Masters who was still in his office at half past seven missus Masters at once got hold of him and conveyed him away into the sacred drawing room Mary is not going she said Not going to Cheltenham
5789_57195_000017_000000	train-clean-100	 It has all been put off 
5789_57195_000017_000001	train-clean-100	She shan t go at all if I can help it

5789_57195_000035_000003	train-clean-100	That s the way to win her Larry did go to the club and did think very much of it as he walked home 
none	none	He had promised to come on the Sunday afternoon but he could not bring himself to believe in that theory of books and poetry put forward by missus Masters Books and poetry would not teach a girl like Mary to reject her suitor if she really loved him CHAPTER XXVI LADY USHANT AT BRAGTON On the Sunday Larry came into Dillsborough and had his gossip with the girls according to order but it was not very successful missus Masters who opened the door for him instructed him in a special whisper to talk away just as though he did not care a fig for Mary He made the attempt manfully but with slight effect His love was too genuine too absorbing to leave with him the power which missus Masters assumed him to have when she gave him such advice A man cannot walk when he has broken his ankle bone let him be ever so brave in the attempt Larry s heart was so weighed that he could not hide the weight Dolly and Kate had also received hints and struggled hard to be merry In the afternoon a walk was suggested and Mary complied but when an attempt was made by the younger girls to leave the lover and Mary together she resented it by clinging closely to Dolly and then all Larry s courage deserted him Very little good was done on the occasion by missus Masters manoeuvres On the Monday morning in compliance with a request made by Lady Ushant Mary walked over to Bragton to see her old friend missus Masters had declared the request to be very unreasonable Who is to walk five miles and back to see an old woman like that To this Mary had replied that the distance across the fields to Bragton was only four miles and that she had often walked it with her sisters for the very pleasure of the walk Not in weather like this said missus Masters But the day was well enough Roads in February are often a little wet but there was no rain falling I say it s unreasonable said missus Masters If she can t send a carriage she oughtn t to expect it This coming from missus Masters whose great doctrine it was that young women ought not to be afraid of work was so clearly the effect of sheer opposition that Mary disdained to answer it Then she was accused of treating her stepmother with contempt She did walk to Bragton taking the path by the fields and over the bridge and loitering for a few minutes as she leant upon the rail It was there and there only that she had seen together the two men who between them seemed to cloud all her life the man whom she loved and the man who loved her She knew now she thought that she knew quite well that her feelings for Reginald Morton were of such a nature that she could not possibly become the wife of any one else But had she not seen him for those few minutes on this spot had he not fired her imagination by telling her of his desire to go back with her over the sites which they had seen together when she was a child she would not she thought have been driven to make to herself so grievous a confession In that case it might have been that she would have brought herself to give her hand to the suitor of whom all her friends approved And then with infinite tenderness she thought of all Larry s virtues and especially of that great virtue in a woman s eyes the constancy of his devotion to herself She did love him but with a varied love a love which was most earnest in wishing his happiness which would have been desirous of the closest friendship if only nothing more were required She swore to herself a thousand times that she did not look down upon him because he was only a farmer that she did not think herself in any way superior to him But it was impossible that she should consent to be his wife And then she thought of the other man with feelings much less kind Why had he thrust himself upon her life and disturbed her Why had he taught her to think herself unfit to mate with this lover who was her equal Why had he assured her that were she to do so her old friends would be revolted Why had he exacted from her a promise a promise which was sacred to her that she would not so give herself away Yes the promise was certainly sacred but he had been cold and cruel in forcing it from her lips What business was it of his Why should he have meddled with her In the shallow streamlet of her lowly life the waters might have glided on slow but smoothly had he not taught them to be ambitious of a rapider grander course Now they were disturbed by mud and there could be no pleasure in them She went on over the bridge and round by the shrubbery to the hall door which was opened to her by missus Hopkins Yes Lady Ushant was there but the young Squire was very ill and his aunt was then with him mister Reginald was in the library Would Miss Masters be shown in there or would she go up to Lady Ushant s own room Of course she replied that she would go up stairs and there wait for Lady Ushant When she was found by her friend she was told at length the story of all the circumstances which had brought Lady Ushant to Bragton When John Morton had first been taken ill before any fixed idea of danger had occurred to himself or to others his grandmother had come to him Then as he gradually became weaker he made various propositions which were all of them terribly distasteful to the old woman In the first place he had insisted on sending for Miss Trefoil Up to this period Mary Masters had hardly heard the name of Miss Trefoil and almost shuddered as she was at once immersed in all these family secrets She is to be here to morrow said Lady Ushant Oh dear how sad He insists upon it and she is coming She was here before and it now turns out that all the world knew that they were engaged That was no secret for everybody had heard it And where is missus Morton now Then Lady Ushant went on with her story The sick man had insisted on making his will and had declared his purpose of leaving the property to his cousin Reginald As Lady Ushant said there was no one else to whom he could leave it with any propriety but this had become matter for bitter contention between the old woman and her grandson Who did she think should have it asked Mary Ah that I don t know That he has never told me But she has had the wickedness to say oh such things of Reginald I knew all that before but that she should repeat them now is terrible I suppose she wanted it for some of her own people But it was so horrible you know when he was so ill Then he said that he should send for me so that what is left of the family might be together After that she went away in anger missus Hopkins says that she did not even see him the morning she left Bragton She was always high tempered said Mary And dictatorial beyond measure She nearly broke my poor dear father s heart And then she left the house because he would not shut his doors against Reginald s mother And now I hardly know what I am to do here or what I must say to this young lady when she comes to morrow Is she coming alone We don t know She has a mother Lady Augustus Trefoil but whether Lady Augustus will accompany her daughter we have not heard Reginald says certainly not or they would have told us so You have seen Reginald No Lady Ushant You must see him He is here now Think what a difference it will make to him But Lady Ushant is he so bad doctor Fanning almost says that there is no hope This poor young woman that is coming what am I to say to her He has made his will That was done before I came I don t know why he shouldn t have sent for your father but he had a gentleman down from town I suppose he will leave her something but it is a great thing that Bragton should remain in the family Oh dear oh dear if any one but a Morton were to be here it would break my heart Reginald is the only one left now of the old branch He s getting old and he ought to marry It is so serious when there s an old family property I suppose he will only Yes exactly One can t even think about it while this poor young man is lying so ill missus Morton has been almost like his mother and has lived upon the Bragton property absolutely lived upon it and now she is away from him because he chooses to do what he likes with his own Is it not awful And she would not put her foot in the house if she knew that Reginald was here She told missus Hopkins as much and she said that she wouldn t so much as write a line to me Poor fellow he wrote it himself And now he thinks so much about it When doctor Fanning went back to London yesterday I think he took some message to her Mary remained there till lunch was announced but refused to go down into the parlour urging that she was expected home for dinner And there is no chance for mister Twentyman asked Lady Ushant Mary shook her head Poor man I do feel sorry for him as everybody speaks so well of him Of course my dear I have nothing to say about it I don t think girls should ever be in a hurry to marry and if you can t love him Dear Lady Ushant it is quite settled Poor young man But you must go and see Reginald Then she was taken into the library and did see Reginald Were she to avoid him specially she would tell her tale almost as plainly as though she were to run after him He greeted her kindly almost affectionately expressing his extreme regret that his visit to Cheltenham should have been postponed and a hope that she would be much at Bragton The distance is so great Reginald said Lady Ushant I can drive her over It is a long walk and I had made up my mind to get Runciman s little phaeton I shall order it for to morrow if Miss Masters will come But Miss Masters would not agree to this She would walk over again some day as she liked the walk but no doubt she would only be in the way if she were to come often I have told her about Miss Trefoil said Lady Ushant You know my dear I look upon you almost as one of ourselves because you lived here so long But perhaps you had better postpone coming again till she has gone Certainly Lady Ushant It might be difficult to explain I don t suppose she will stay long Perhaps she will go back the same day I am sure I shan t know what to say to her But when anything is fixed I will send you in word by the postman Reginald would have walked back with her across the bridge but that he had promised to go to his cousin immediately after lunch As it was he offered to accompany her a part of the way but was stopped by his aunt greatly to Mary s comfort He was now more beyond her reach than ever more utterly removed from her He would probably become Squire of Bragton and she in her earliest days had heard the late Squire spoken of as though he were one of the potentates of the earth She had never thought it possible but now it was less possible than ever There was something in his manner to her almost protective almost fatherly as though he had some authority over her Lady Ushant had authority once but he had none In every tone of his voice she felt that she heard an expression of interest in her welfare but it was the interest which a grown up person takes in a child or a superior in an inferior Of course he was her superior but yet the tone of his voice was distasteful to her As she walked back to Dillsborough she told herself that she would not go again to Bragton without assuring herself that he was not there When she reached home many questions were asked of her but she told nothing of the secrets of the Morton family which had been so openly confided to her She would only say that she was afraid that mister John Morton was very ill CHAPTER XXVII ARABELLA AGAIN AT BRAGTON Arabella Trefoil had adhered without flinching to the purpose she had expressed of going down to Bragton to see the sick man And yet at that very time she was in the midst of her contest with Lord Rufford She was aware that a correspondence was going on between her father and the young lord and that her father had demanded an interview She was aware also that the matter had been discussed at the family mansion in Piccadilly the Duke having come up to London for the purpose and that the Duke and his brother who hardly ever spoke to each other had absolutely had a conference And this conference had had results The Duke had not himself consented to interfere but he had agreed to a compromise proposed by his son Lord Augustus should be authorised to ask Lord Rufford to meet him in the library of the Piccadilly mansion so that there should be some savour of the dukedom in what might be done and said there Lord Rufford would by the surroundings be made to feel that in rejecting Arabella he was rejecting the Duke and all the Mayfair belongings and that in accepting her he would be entitled to regard himself as accepting them all But by allowing thus much the Duke would not compromise himself nor the Duchess nor Lord Mistletoe Lord Mistletoe with that prudence which will certainly in future years make him a useful assistant to some minister of the day had seen all this and so it had been arranged But in spite of these doings Arabella had insisted on complying with John Morton s wish that she go down and visit him in his bed at Bragton Her mother who in these days was driven almost to desperation by her daughter s conduct tried her best to prevent the useless journey but tried in vain Then she said in wrath to Arabella I will tell your father and I will tell the Duke and I will tell Lord Rufford that they need not trouble themselves any further You know mamma that you will do nothing of the kind said Arabella And the poor woman did do nothing of the kind What is it to them whether I see the man or not the girl said They are not such fools as to suppose that because Lord Rufford has engaged himself to me now I was never engaged to any one before There isn t one of them doesn t know that you had made up an engagement between us and had afterwards tried to break it off When she heard this the unfortunate mother raved but she raved in vain She told her daughter that she would not supply her with money for the expenses of her journey but her daughter replied that she would have no difficulty in finding her way to a pawn shop What is to be got by it asked the unfortunate mother In reply to this Arabella would say Mamma you have no heart absolutely none You ought to manoeuvre better than you do for your feelings never stand in your way for a moment All this had to be borne and the old woman was forced at last not only to yield but to promise that she would accompany her daughter to Bragton I know how all this will end she said to Arabella You will have to go your way and I must go mine Just so replied the daughter I do not often agree with you mamma but I do there altogether Lady Augustus was absolutely at a loss to understand what were the motives and what the ideas which induced her daughter to take the journey If the man were to die no good could come of it If he were to live then surely that love which had induced him to make so foolish a petition would suffice to ensure the marriage if the marriage should then be thought desirable But at the present moment Arabella was still hot in pursuit of Lord Rufford to whom this journey as soon as it should be known to him would give the easiest mode of escape How would it be possible that they two should get out at the Dillsborough Station and be taken to Bragton without all Rufford knowing it Of course there would be hymns sung in praise of Arabella s love and constancy but such hymns would be absolutely ruinous to her It was growing clear to Lady Augustus that her daughter was giving up the game and becoming frantic as she thought of her age her failure and her future If so it would be well that they should separate On the day fixed a close carriage awaited them at the Dillsborough Station They arrived both dressed in black and both veiled and with but one maid between them This arrangement had been made with some vague idea of escaping scrutiny rather than from economy They had never hitherto been known to go anywhere without one apiece There were no airs on the station now as on that former occasion no loud talking not even a word spoken Lady Augustus was asking herself why why she should have been put into so lamentable a position and Arabella was endeavouring to think what she would say to the dying man She did think that he was dying It was not the purport of her present visit to strengthen her position by making certain of the man s hand should he live When she said that she was not as yet quite so hard hearted as her mother she spoke the truth Something of regret something of penitence had at times crept over her in reference to her conduct to this man He had been very unlike others on whom she had played her arts None of her lovers or mock lovers had been serious and stern and uncomfortable as he There had been no other who had ever attempted to earn his bread To her the butterflies of the world had been all in all and the working bees had been a tribe apart with which she was no more called upon to mix than is my lady s spaniel with the kennel hounds But the chance had come She had consented to exhibit her allurements before a man of business and the man of business had at once sat at her feet She had soon repented as the reader has seen The alliance had been distasteful to her She had found that the man s ways were in no wise like her ways and she had found also that were she to become his wife he certainly would not change She had looked about for a means of escape but as she did so she had recognized the man s truth No doubt he had been different from the others less gay in his attire less jocund in his words less given to flattery and sport and gems and all the little wickednesses which she had loved But they those others had one and all struggled to escape from her Through all the gems and mirth and flattery there had been the same purpose They liked the softness of her hand they liked the flutter of her silk they liked to have whispered in their ears the bold words of her practised raillery Each liked for a month or two to be her special friend But then after that each had deserted her as had done the one before till in each new alliance she felt that such was to be her destiny and that she was rolling a stone which would never settle itself straining for waters which would never come lip high But John Morton after once saying that he loved her had never tired had never wished to escape He had been so true to his love so true to his word that he had borne from her usage which would have fully justified escape had escape been to his taste But to the last he had really loved her and now on his death bed he had sent for her to come to him She would not be coward enough to refuse his request Should he say anything to you about his will don t refuse to hear him because it may be of the greatest importance Lady Augustus whispered to her daughter as the carriage was driven up to the front door It was then four o clock and it was understood that the two ladies were to stay that one night at Bragton a letter having been received by Lady Ushant that morning informing her that the mother as well as the daughter was coming Poor Lady Ushant was almost beside herself not knowing what she would do with the two women and having no one in the house to help her Something she had heard of Lady Augustus but chiefly from missus Hopkins who certainly had not admired her master s future mother in law Nor had Arabella been popular but of her missus Hopkins had only dared to say that she was very handsome and a little upstartish How she was to spend the evening with them Lady Ushant could not conceive it having been decided in accordance with the doctor s orders that the interview should not take place till the next morning When they were shown in Lady Ushant stood just within the drawing room door and muttered a few words as she gave her hand to each How is he asked Arabella throwing up her veil boldly as soon as the door was closed Lady Ushant only shook her head I knew it would be so It is always so with anything I care for She is so distressed Lady Ushant said the mother that she hardly knows what she does Arabella shook her head It is so Lady Ushant Am I to go to him now said Arabella Then the old lady explained the doctor s orders and offered to take them to their rooms Perhaps I might say a word to you alone I will stay here if you will go with mamma And she did stay till Lady Ushant came down to her Do you mean to say it is certain she asked certain that he must die No I do not say that It is possible that he may recover Certainly it is possible What is not possible with God Ah that means that he will die Then she sat herself down and almost unconsciously took off her bonnet and laid it aside Lady Ushant then looking into her face for the first time was at a loss to understand what she had heard of her beauty Could it be the same girl of whom missus Hopkins had spoken and of whose brilliant beauty Reginald had repeated what he had heard She was haggard almost old with black lines round her eyes There was nothing soft or gracious in the tresses of her hair When Lady Ushant had been young men had liked hair such as was that of Mary Masters Arabella s yellow locks whencesoever they might have come were rough and uncombed But it was the look of age and the almost masculine strength of the lower face which astonished Lady Ushant the most Has he spoken to you about me she said Not to me Then Lady Ushant went on to explain that though she was there now as the female representative of the family she had never been so intimate with John Morton as to admit of such confidence as that suggested I wonder whether he can love me said the girl Assuredly he does Miss Trefoil Why else should he send for you Because he is an honest man I hardly think that he can love me much He was to have been my husband but he will escape that If I thought that he would live I would tell him that he was free He would not want to be free He ought to want it I am not fit for him I have come here Lady Ushant because I want to tell him the truth But you love him Arabella made no answer but sat looking steadily into Lady Ushant s face Surely you do love him I do not know I don t think I did love him though now I may It is so horrible that he should die and die while all this is going on That softens one you know Have you ever heard of Lord Rufford Lord Rufford the young man Yes the young man Never particularly I knew his father But not this man mister Morton never spoke to you of him Not a word I have been engaged to him since I became engaged to your nephew Engaged to Lord Rufford to marry him Yes indeed And will you marry him I cannot say I tell you this Lady Ushant because I must tell somebody in this house I have behaved very badly to mister Morton and Lord Rufford is behaving as badly to me Did John know of this No but I meant to tell him I determined that I would tell him had he lived When he sent for me I swore that I would tell him If he is dying how can I say it Lady Ushant sat bewildered thinking over it understanding nothing of the world in which this girl had lived and not knowing now how things could have been as she described them It was not as yet three months since to her knowledge this young woman had been staying at Bragton as the affianced bride of the owner of the house staying there with her own mother and his grandmother and now she declared that since that time she had become engaged to another man and that that other man had already jilted her And yet she was here that she might make a deathbed parting with the man who regarded himself as her affianced husband If I were sure that he were dying why should I trouble him she said again Lady Ushant found herself utterly unable to give any counsel to such a condition of circumstances Why should she be asked This young woman had her mother with her Did her mother know all this and nevertheless bring her daughter to the house of a man who had been so treated I really do not know what to say she replied at last But I was determined that I would tell some one I thought that missus Morton would have been here Lady Ushant shook her head I am glad she is not because she was not civil to me when I was here before She would have said hard things to me though not perhaps harder than I have deserved I suppose I may still see him to morrow Oh yes he expects it I shall not tell him now I could not tell him if I thought he were dying If he gets better you must tell him all I don t think I could do that Miss Trefoil Pray do pray do I call upon you to tell him everything Tell him that you will be married to Lord Rufford No not that If mister Morton were well to morrow I would have him if he chose to take me after what I have told you You do love him then At any rate I like no one better Not the young lord No why should I like him He does not love me I hate him I would marry mister Morton to morrow and go with him to Patagonia or anywhere else if he would have me after hearing what I have done Then she rose from her chair but before she left the room she said a word further Do not speak a word to my mother about this Mamma knows nothing of my purpose Mamma only wants me to marry Lord Rufford and to throw mister Morton over Do not tell anyone else Lady Ushant but if he is ever well enough then you must tell him After that she went leaving Lady Ushant in the room astounded by the story she had heard VOLUME III CHAPTER I I HAVE TOLD HIM EVERYTHING That evening was very long and very sad to the three ladies assembled in the drawing room at Bragton Park but it was probably more so to Lady Augustus than the other two She hardly spoke to either of them nor did they to her while a certain amount of conversation in a low tone was carried on between Lady Ushant and Miss Trefoil When Arabella came down to dinner she received a message from the sick man He sent his love and would so willingly have seen her instantly only that the doctor would not allow it But he was so glad so very glad that she had come This Lady Ushant said to her in a whisper and seemed to say it as though she had heard nothing of that frightful story which had been told to her not much more than an hour ago Arabella did not utter a word in reply but put out her hand secretly as it were and grasped that of the old lady to whom she had told the tale of her later intrigues The dinner did not keep them long but it was very grievous to them all Lady Ushant might have made some effort to be at least a complaisant hostess to Lady Augustus had she not heard this story had she not been told that the woman knowing her daughter to be engaged to John Morton had wanted her to marry Lord Rufford The story having come from the lips of the girl herself had moved some pity in the old woman s breast in regard to her but for Lady Augustus she could feel nothing but horror In the evening Lady Augustus sat alone not even pretending to open a book or to employ her fingers She seated herself on one side of the fire with a screen in her hand turning over such thoughts in her mind as were perhaps customary to her Would there ever come a period to her misery an hour of release in which she might be in comfort ere she died Hitherto from one year to another from one decade to the following it had all been struggle and misery contumely and contempt She thought that she had done her duty by her child and her child hated and despised her It was but the other day that Arabella had openly declared that in the event of her marriage she would not have her mother as a guest in her own house There could be no longer hope for triumph and glory but how might she find peace so that she might no longer be driven hither and thither by this ungrateful tyrant child Oh how hard she had worked in the world and how little the world had given her in return Lady Ushant and Arabella sat at the other side of the fire at some distance from it on a sofa and carried on a fitful conversation in whispers of which a word would now and then reach the ears of the wretched mother It consisted chiefly of a description of the man s illness and of the different sayings which had come from the doctors who had attended him It was marvellous to Lady Augustus as she sat there listening that her daughter should condescend to take an interest in such details What could it be to her now how the fever had taken him or why or when On the very next day the very morning on which she would go and sit ah so uselessly by the dying man s bedside her father was to meet Lord Rufford at the ducal mansion in Piccadilly to see if anything could be done in that quarter It was impossible that she should really care whether John Morton s lease of life was to be computed at a week s purchase or at that of a month And yet Arabella sat there asking sick room questions and listening to sick room replies as though her very nature had been changed Lady Augustus heard her daughter inquire what food the sick man took and then Lady Ushant at great length gave the list of his nourishment What sickening hypocrisy thought Lady Augustus Lady Augustus must have known her daughter well and yet it was not hypocrisy The girl s nature which had become thoroughly evil from the treatment it had received was not altered Such sudden changes do not occur more frequently than other miracles But zealously as she had practised her arts she had not as yet practised them long enough not to be cowed by certain outward circumstances There were moments when she still heard in her imagination the sound of that horse s foot as it struck the skull of the unfortunate fallen rider and now the prospect of the death of this man whom she had known so intimately and who had behaved so well to her to whom her own conduct had been so foully false for a time brought her back to humanity But Lady Augustus had got beyond that and could not at all understand it By nine they had all retired for the night It was necessary that Lady Ushant should again visit her nephew and the mother and daughter went to their own rooms I cannot in the least make out what you are doing said Lady Augustus in her most severe voice I dare say not mamma I have been brought here at a terrible sacrifice Sacrifice What sacrifice You are as well here as anywhere else I say I have been brought here at a terrible sacrifice for no purpose whatever What use is it to be And then you pretend to care what this poor man is eating and drinking and what physic he is taking when the last time you were in his company you wouldn t so much as look at him for fear you should make another man jealous He was not dying then Psha Oh yes I know all that I do feel a little ashamed of myself when I am almost crying for him As if you loved him Dear mamma I do own that it is foolish Having listened to you on these subjects for a dozen years at least I ought to have got rid of all that I don t suppose I do love him Two or three weeks ago I almost thought I loved Lord Rufford and now I am quite sure that I hate him But if I heard to morrow that he had broken his neck out hunting I ain t sure but what I should feel something But he would not send for me as this man has done It was very impertinent Perhaps it was ill bred as he must have suspected something as to Lord Rufford However we are here now I will never allow you to drag me anywhere again It will be for yourself to judge of that If I want to go anywhere I shall go What s the good of quarrelling You know that I mean to have my way The next morning neither Lady Augustus nor Miss Trefoil came down to breakfast but at ten o clock Arabella was ready as appointed to be taken into the sick man s bedroom She was still dressed in black but had taken some trouble with her face and hair She followed Lady Ushant in and silently standing by the bedside put her hand upon that of John Morton which was laying outside on the bed I will leave you now John said Lady Ushant retiring and come again in half an hour When I ring he said You mustn t let him talk for more than that said the old lady to Arabella as she went It was more than an hour afterwards when Arabella crept into her mother s room during which time Lady Ushant had twice knocked at her nephew s door and had twice been sent away It is all over mamma she said Lady Augustus looked into her daughter s eyes and saw that she had really been weeping All over I mean for me and you We have only got to go away Will he die It will make no matter though he should live for ever I have told him everything I did not mean to do it because I thought that he would be weak but he has been strong enough for that What have you told him Just everything about you and Lord Rufford and myself and what an escape he had had not to marry me He understands it all now It is a great deal more than I do He knows that Lord Rufford has been engaged to me She clung to this statement so vehemently that she had really taught herself to believe that it was so Well And he knows also how his lordship is behaving to me Of course he thinks that I have deserved it Of course I have deserved it We have nothing to do now but to go back to London You have brought me here all the way for that Only for that As the man was dying I thought that I would be honest just for once Now that I have told him I don t believe that he will die He does not look to be so very ill And you have thrown away that chance Altogether You didn t like Bragton you know and therefore it can t matter to you Like it To be sure you would have got rid of me had I gone to Patagonia But he will not go to Patagonia now even if he gets well and so there was nothing to be gained The carriage is to be here at two to take us to the station and you may as well let Judith come and put the things up Just before they took their departure Lady Ushant came to Arabella saying that mister Morton wanted to speak one other word to her before she went So she returned to the room and was again left alone at the man s bedside Arabella he said I thought that I would tell you that I have forgiven everything How can you have forgiven me There are things which a man cannot forgive Give me your hand he said and she gave him her hand I do forgive it all Even should I live it would be impossible that we should be man and wife Oh yes But nevertheless I love you Try try to be true to some one There is no truth left in me mister Morton I should not dishonour my husband if I had one but still I should be a curse to him I shall marry some day I suppose and I know it will be so I wish I could change with you and die You are unhappy now Indeed I am I am always unhappy I do not think you can tell what it is to be so wretched But I am glad that you have forgiven me Then she stooped down and kissed his hand As she did so he touched her brow with his hot lips and then she left him again Lady Ushant was waiting outside the door He knows it all said Arabella You need not trouble yourself with the message I gave you The carriage is at the door Good bye You need not come down Mamma will not expect it Lady Ushant hardly knowing how she ought to behave did not go down Lady Augustus and her daughter got into mister Runciman s carriage without any farewells and were driven back from the park to the Dillsborough Station To poor Lady Ushant the whole thing had been very terrible She sat silent and unoccupied the whole of that evening wondering at the horror of such a history This girl had absolutely dared to tell the dying man all her own disgrace and had travelled down from London to Bragton with the purpose of doing so When next she crept into the sick room she almost expected that her nephew would speak to her on the subject but he only asked whether that sound of wheels which he heard beneath his window had come from the carriage which had taken them away and then did not say a further word of either Lady Augustus or her daughter And what do you mean to do now said Lady Augustus as the train approached the London terminus Nothing You have given up Lord Rufford Indeed I have not Your journey to Bragton will hardly help you much with him I don t want it to help me at all What have I done that Lord Rufford can complain of I have not abandoned Lord Rufford for the sake of mister Morton Lord Rufford ought only to be too proud if he knew it all Of course he could make use of such an escapade as this Let him try I have not done with Lord Rufford yet and so I can tell him I shall be at the Duke s in Piccadilly to morrow morning That will be impossible Arabella They shall see whether it is impossible I have got beyond caring very much what people say now I know the kind of way papa would be thrown over if there is no one there to back him I shall be there and I will ask Lord Rufford to his face whether we did not become engaged when we were at Mistletoe They won t let you in I ll find a way to make my way in I shall never be his wife I don t know that I want it After all what s the good of living with a man if you hate each other or living apart like you and papa He has income enough for anything exclaimed Lady Augustus shocked at her daughter s apparent blindness It isn t that I m thinking of but I ll have my revenge on him Liar To write and say that I had made a mistake He had not the courage to get out of it when we were together but when he had run away in the night like a thief and got into his own house then he could write and say that I had made a mistake I have sometimes pitied men when I have seen girls hunting them down but upon my word they deserve it This renewal of spirit did something to comfort Lady Augustus She had begun to fear that her daughter in her despair would abandon altogether the one pursuit of her life but it now seemed that there was still some courage left for the battle That night nothing more was said but Arabella applied all her mind to the present condition of her circumstances Should she or should she not go to the house in Piccadilly on the following morning At last she determined that she would not do so believing that should her father fail she might make a better opportunity for herself afterwards At her uncle s house she would hardly have known where or how to wait for the proper moment of her appearance So you are not going to Piccadilly said her mother on the following morning It appears not said Arabella CHAPTER II NOW WHAT HAVE YOU GOT TO SAY It may be a question whether Lord Augustus Trefoil or Lord Rufford looked forward to the interview which was to take place at the Duke s mansion with the greater dismay The unfortunate father whose only principle in life had been that of avoiding trouble would have rather that his daughter should have been jilted a score of times than that he should have been called upon to interfere once There was in this demand upon him a breach of a silent but well understood compact His wife and daughter had been allowed to do just what they pleased and to be free of his authority upon an understanding that they were never to give him any trouble She might have married Lord Rufford or mister Morton or any other man she might have succeeded in catching and he would not have troubled her either before or after her marriage But it was not fair that he should be called upon to interfere in her failures And what was he to say to this young lord Being fat and old and plethoric he could not be expected to use a stick and thrash the young lord Pistols were gone a remembrance of which fact perhaps afforded some consolation Nobody now need be afraid of anybody and the young lord would not be afraid of him Arabella declared that there had been an engagement The young lord would of course declare that there had been none Upon the whole he was inclined to believe it most probable that his daughter was lying He did not think it likely that Lord Rufford should have been such a fool As for taking Lord Rufford by the back of his neck and shaking him into matrimony he knew that that would be altogether out of his power And then the hour was so wretchedly early It was that little fool Mistletoe who had named ten o clock a fellow who took Parliamentary papers to bed with him and had a blue book brought to him every morning at half past seven with a cup of tea By ten o clock Lord Augustus would not have had time to take his first glass of soda and brandy preparatory to the labour of getting into his clothes But he was afraid of his wife and daughter and absolutely did get into a cab at the door of his lodgings in Duke Street saint James precisely at a quarter past ten As the Duke s house was close to the corner of Clarges Street the journey he had to make was not long Lord Rufford would not have agreed to the interview but that it was forced upon him by his brother in law What good can it do Lord Rufford had asked But his brother in law had held that that was a question to be answered by the other side In such a position Sir George thought that he was bound to concede as much as this in fact to concede almost anything short of marriage He can t do the girl any good by talking Lord Rufford had said Sir George assented to this but nevertheless thought that any friend deputed by her should be allowed to talk at any rate once I don t know what he ll say Do you think he ll bring a big stick Sir George who knew Lord Augustus did not imagine that a stick would be brought I couldn t hit him you know He s so fat that a blow would kill him Lord Rufford wanted his brother in law to go with him but Sir George assured him that this was impossible It was a great bore He had to go up to London all alone in February when the weather was quite open and hunting was nearly coming to an end And for what Was it likely that such a man as Lord Augustus should succeed in talking him into marrying any girl Nevertheless he went prepared to be very civil full of sorrow at the misunderstanding but strong in his determination not to yield an inch He arrived at the mansion precisely at ten o clock and was at once shown into a back room on the ground floor He saw no one but a very demure old servant who seemed to look upon him as one who was sinning against the Trefoil family in general and who shut the door upon him leaving him as it were in prison He was so accustomed to be the absolute master of his own minutes and hours that he chafed greatly as he walked up and down the room for what seemed to him the greater part of a day He looked repeatedly at his watch and at half past ten declared to himself that if that fat old fool did not come within two minutes he would make his escape The fat old fool when he reached the house asked for his nephew and endeavoured to persuade Lord Mistletoe to go with him to the interview But Lord Mistletoe was as firm in refusing as had been Sir George Penwether You are quite wrong said the young man with well informed sententious gravity I could do nothing to help you You are Arabella s father and no one can plead her cause but yourself Lord Augustus dropped his eyebrows over his eyes as this was said They who knew him well and had seen the same thing done when his partner would not answer his call at whist or had led up to his discard were aware that the motion was tantamount to a very strong expression of disgust He did not however argue the matter any further but allowed himself to be led away slowly by the same solemn servant Lord Rufford had taken up his hat preparatory to his departure when Lord Augustus was announced just five minutes after the half hour When the elder man entered the room the younger one put down his hat and bowed Lord Augustus also bowed and then stood for a few moments silent with his fat hands extended on the round table in the middle of the room This is a very disagreeable kind of thing my Lord he said Very disagreeable and one that I lament above all things answered Lord Rufford That s all very well very well indeed but damme what s the meaning of it all That s what I want to ask What s the meaning of it all Then he paused as though he had completed the first part of his business and might now wait awhile till the necessary explanation had been given But Lord Rufford did not seem disposed to give any immediate answer He shrugged his shoulders and taking up his hat passed his hand once or twice round the nap Lord Augustus opened his eyes very wide as he waited and looked at the other man but it seemed that the other man had nothing to say for himself You don t mean to tell me I suppose that what my daughter says isn t true Some unfortunate mistake Lord Augustus most unfortunate Mistake be He stopped himself before the sentence was completed remembering that such an interview should be conducted on the part of him as father with something of dignity I don t understand anything about mistakes Ladies don t make mistakes of that kind I won t hear of mistakes Lord Rufford again shrugged his shoulders You have engaged my daughter s affections I have the greatest regard for Miss Trefoil Regard be Then again he remembered himself Lord Rufford you ve got to marry her That s the long and the short of it I m sure I ought to be proud So you ought But I don t know the meaning of but my Lord I want to know what you mean to do Marriage isn t in my line at all Then what the d business have you to go about and talk to a girl like that Marriage not in your line Who cares for your line I never heard such impudence in all my life You get yourself engaged to a young lady of high rank and position and then you say that marriage isn t in your line Upon that he opened his eyes still wider and glared upon the offender wrathfully I can t admit that I was ever engaged to Miss Trefoil Didn t you make love to her The poor victim paused a moment before he answered this question thereby confessing his guilt before he denied it No my Lord I don t think I ever did You don t think You don t know whether you asked my daughter to marry you or not You don t think you made love to her I am sure I didn t ask her to marry me I am sure you did And now what have you got to say Here there was another shrug of the shoulders I suppose you think because you are a rich man that you may do whatever you please But you ll have to learn the difference You must be exposed Sir I hope for the lady s sake that as little as possible may be said of it D the Lord Augustus in his assumed wrath was about to be very severe on his daughter but he checked himself again I m not going to stop here talking all day he said I want to hear your explanation and then I shall know how to act Up to this time he had been standing which was unusual with him Now he flung himself into an armchair Really Lord Augustus I don t know what I ve got to say I admire your daughter exceedingly I was very much honoured when she and her mother came to my house at Rufford I was delighted to be able to show her a little sport It gave me the greatest satisfaction when I met her again at your brother s house Coming home from hunting we happened to be thrown together It s a kind of thing that will occur you know The Duchess seemed to think a great deal of it but what can one do We could have had two postchaises of course only one doesn t generally send a young lady alone She was very tired and fainted with the fatigue That I think is about all But damme Sir what did you say to her Lord Rufford again rubbed the nap of his hat What did you say to her first of all at your own house A poor fellow was killed out hunting and everybody was talking about that Your daughter saw it herself Excuse me Lord Rufford if I say that that s what we used to call shuffling at school Because a man broke his neck out hunting It was a kick on the head Lord Augustus I don t care where he was kicked What has that to do with your asking my daughter to be your wife But I didn t I say you did over and over again Here Lord Augustus got out of his chair and made a little attempt to reach the recreant lover but he failed and fell back again into his armchair It was first at Rufford and then you made an appointment to meet her at Mistletoe How do you explain that Miss Trefoil is very fond of hunting I don t believe she ever went out hunting in her life before she saw you You mounted her and gave her a horse and took her out and brought her home Everybody at Mistletoe knew all about it My brother and the Duchess were told of it It was one of those things that are plain to everybody as the nose on your face What did you say to her when you were coming home in that postchaise She was fainting What has that to do with it I don t care whether she fainted or not I don t believe she fainted at all When she got into that carriage she was engaged to you and when she got out of it she was engaged ever so much more The Duchess knew all about it Now what have you got to say Lord Rufford felt that he had nothing to say I insist upon having an answer It s one of the most unfortunate mistakes that ever were made By G exclaimed Lord Augustus turning his eyes up against the wall and appealing to some dark ancestor who hung there I never heard of such a thing in all my life never I suppose I might as well go now said Lord Rufford after a pause You may go to the D Sir for the present Then Lord Rufford took his departure leaving the injured parent panting with his exertions As Lord Rufford went away he felt that that difficulty had been overcome with much more ease than he had expected He hardly knew what it was that he had dreaded but he had feared something much worse than that Had an appeal been made to his affections he would hardly have known how to answer He remembered well that he had assured the lady that he loved her and had a direct question been asked him on that subject he would not have lied He must have confessed that such a declaration had been made by him But he had escaped that He was quite sure that he had never uttered a hint in regard to marriage and he came away from the Duke s house almost with an assurance that he had done nothing that was worthy of much blame Lord Augustus looked at his watch rang the bell and ordered a cab He must now go and see his daughter and then he would have done with the matter for ever But as he was passing through the hall his nephew caught hold of him and took him back into the room What does he say for himself asked Lord Mistletoe I don t know what he says Of course he swears that he never spoke a word to her My mother saw him paying her the closest attention How can I help that What can I do Why didn t your mother pin him then and there Women can always do that kind of thing if they choose It is all over then I can t make a man marry if he won t He ought to be thrashed within an inch of his life But if one does that kind of thing the police are down upon one All the same I think the Duchess might have managed it if she had chosen After that he went to the lodgings in Orchard Street and there repeated his story I have done all I can he said and I don t mean to interfere any further Arabella should know how to manage her own affairs And you don t mean to punish him asked the mother Punish him How am I to punish him If I were to throw a decanter at his head what good would that do And you mean to say that she must put up with it Arabella was sitting by as these questions were asked He says that he never said a word to her Whom am I to believe You did believe him papa Who said so Miss But I don t see why his word isn t as good as yours There was nobody to hear it I suppose Why didn t you get it in writing or make your uncle fix him at once If you mismanage your own affairs I can t put them right for you Thank you papa I am so much obliged to you You come back and tell me that every word he says is to be taken for gospel and that you don t believe a word I have spoken That is so kind of you I suppose he and you will be the best friends in the world now But I don t mean to let him off in that way As you won t help me I must help myself What did you expect me to do Never to leave him till you had forced him to keep his word I should have thought that you would have taken him by the throat in such a cause Any other father would have done so You are an impudent wicked girl and I don t believe he was ever engaged to you at all said Lord Augustus as he took his leave Now you have made your father your enemy said the mother Everybody is my enemy said Arabella There are no such things as love and friendship Papa pretends that he does not believe me just because he wants to shirk the trouble I suppose you ll say you don t believe me next CHAPTER III missus MORTON RETURNS A few days after that on which Lady Augustus and her daughter left Bragton old missus Morton returned to that place She had gone away in very bitterness of spirit against her grandson in the early days of his illness For some period antecedent to that there had been causes for quarrelling John Morton had told her that he had been to Reginald s house and she in her wrath replied that he had disgraced himself by doing so When those harsh words had been forgotten or at any rate forgiven other causes of anger had sprung up She had endeavoured to drive him to repudiate Arabella Trefoil and in order that she might do so effectually had contrived to find out something of Arabella s doings at Rufford and at Mistletoe Her efforts in this direction had had an effect directly contrary to that which she had intended There had been moments in which Morton had been willing enough to rid himself of that burden He had felt the lady s conduct in his own house and had seen it at Rufford He too had heard something of Mistletoe But the spirit within him was aroused at the idea of dictation and he had been prompted to contradict the old woman s accusation against his intended bride by the very fact that they were made by her And then she threatened him If he did these things if he would consort with an outcast from the family such as Reginald Morton and take to himself such a bride as Arabella Trefoil he could never more be to her as her child This of course was tantamount to saying that she would leave her money to some one else money which as he well knew had all been collected from the Bragton property He had ever been to her as her son and yet he was aware of a propensity on her part to enrich her own noble relatives with her hoards a desire from gratifying which she had hitherto been restrained by conscience Morton had been anxious enough for his grandmother s money but even in the hope of receiving it would not bear indignity beyond a certain point He had therefore declared it to be his purpose to marry Arabella Trefoil and because he had so declared he had almost brought himself to forgive that young lady s sins against him Then as his illness became serious there arose the question of disposing of the property in the event of his death missus Morton was herself very old and was near her grave She was apt to speak of herself as one who had but a few days left to her in this world But to her property was more important than life or death and rank probably more important than either She was a brave fierce evil minded but conscientious old woman one we may say with very bad lights indeed but who was steadfastly minded to walk by those lights such as they were She did not scruple to tell her grandson that it was his duty to leave the property away from his cousin Reginald nor to allege as a reason for his doing so that in all probability Reginald Morton was not the legitimate heir of his great grandfather Sir Reginald For such an assertion John Morton knew there was not a shadow of ground No one but this old woman had ever suspected that the Canadian girl whom Reginald s father had brought with him to Bragton had been other than his honest wife and her suspicions had only come from vague assertions made by herself in blind anger till at last she had learned to believe them Then when in addition to this he asserted his purpose of asking Arabella Trefoil to come to him at Bragton the cup of her wrath was overflowing and she withdrew from the house altogether It might be that he was dying She did in truth believe that he was dying But there were things more serious to her than life or death Should she allow him to trample upon all her feelings because he was on his death bed when perhaps in very truth he might not be on his death bed at all She at any rate was near her death and she would do her duty So she packed up her things to the last black skirt of an old gown so that every one at Bragton might know that it was her purpose to come back no more And she went away Then Lady Ushant came to take her place and with Lady Ushant came Reginald Morton The one lived in the house and the other visited it daily And as the reader knows Lady Augustus came with her daughter missus Morton though she had gone for ever took care to know of the comings and goings at Bragton missus Hopkins was enjoined to write to her and tell her everything and though missus Hopkins with all her heart took the side of Lady Ushant and Reginald she had never been well inclined to Miss Trefoil Presents too were given and promises were made and missus Hopkins not without some little treachery did from time to time send to the old lady a record of what took place at Bragton Arabella came and went and missus Hopkins thought that her coming had not led to much Lady Ushant was always with mister John such was the account given by missus Hopkins and the general opinion was that the squire s days were numbered Then the old woman s jealousy was aroused and perhaps her heart was softened It was still hard black winter and she was living alone in lodgings in London The noble cousin a man nearly as old as herself whose children she was desirous to enrich took but little notice of her nor would she have been happy had she lived with him Her life had been usually solitary with little breaks to its loneliness occasioned by the visits to England of him whom she had called her child That this child should die before her should die in his youth did not shock her much Her husband had done so and her own son and sundry of her noble brothers and sisters She was hardened against death Life to her had never been joyous though the trappings of life were so great in her eyes But it broke her heart that her child should die in the arms of another old woman who had always been to her as an enemy Lady Ushant in days now long gone by but still remembered as though they were yesterday had counselled the reception of the Canadian female And Lady Ushant when the Canadian female and her husband were dead had been a mother to the boy whom she missus Morton would so fain have repudiated altogether Lady Ushant had always been on the other side and now Lady Ushant was paramount at Bragton And doubtless there was some tenderness though missus Morton was unwilling to own even to herself that she was moved by any such feeling If she had done her duty in counselling him to reject both Reginald Morton and Arabella Trefoil as to which she admitted no doubt in her own mind and if duty had required her to absent herself when her counsel was spurned then would she be weak and unmindful of duty should she allow any softness of heart to lure her back again It was so she reasoned But still some softness was there and when she heard that Miss Trefoil had gone and that her visit had not in missus Hopkins s opinion led to much she wrote to say that she would return She made no request and clothed her suggestion in no words of tenderness but simply told her grandson that she would come back as the Trefoils had left him And she did come When the news were first told to Lady Ushant by the sick man himself that Lady proposed that she should at once go back to Cheltenham But when she was asked whether her animosity to missus Morton was so great that she could not consent to remain under the same roof she at once declared that she had no animosity whatsoever The idea of animosity running over nearly half a century was horrible to her and therefore though she did in her heart of hearts dread the other old woman she consented to stay And what shall Reginald do she asked John Morton had thought about this too and expressed a wish that Reginald should come regularly as he had come during the last week or two It was just a week from the day on which the Trefoils had gone that missus Morton was driven up to the door in mister Runciman s fly This was at four in the afternoon and had the old woman looked out of the fly window she might have seen Reginald making his way by the little path to the bridge which led back to Dillsborough It was at this hour that he went daily and he had not now thought it worth his while to remain to welcome missus Morton And she might also have seen had she looked out that with him was walking a young woman She would not have known Mary Masters but had she seen them both and had she known the young woman she would have declared in her pride that they were fit associates But she saw nothing of this sitting there behind her veil thinking whether she might still do anything and if so what she might do to avert the present evil destination of the Bragton estate There was an honourable nephew of her own or rather a great nephew who might easily take the name who would so willingly take the name Or if this were impracticable there was a distant Morton very distant whom she had never seen and certainly did not love but who was clearly a Morton and who would certainly be preferable to that enemy of forty years standing Might there not be some bargain made Would not her dying grandson be alive to the evident duty of enriching the property and leaving behind him a wealthy heir She could enrich the property and make the heir wealthy by her money How is he That of course was the first question when missus Hopkins met her in the hall missus Hopkins only shook her head and said that perhaps he had taken his food that day a little better than on the last Then there was a whisper to which missus Hopkins whispered back her answer Yes Lady Ushant was in the house was at this moment in the sick man s room mister Reginald was not staying there had never stayed there but came every day He had only just left And is he to come still asked missus Morton with wrath in her eyes missus Hopkins did not know but was disposed to think that mister Reginald would come every day Then missus Morton went up to her own room and while she prepared herself for her visit to the sick room Lady Ushant retired She had a cup of tea refusing all other refreshment and then walking erect as though she had been forty instead of seventy five she entered her grandson s chamber and took her old place at his bedside Nothing was then said about Arabella nor indeed at any future time was her name mentioned between them nor was anything then said about the future fate of the estate She did not dare to bring up the subject at once though on the journey down from London she had determined that she would do so But she was awed by his appearance and by the increased appanages of his sick bed He spoke indeed of the property and expressed his anxiety that Chowton Farm should be bought if it came into market He thought that the old acres should be redeemed if the opportunity arose and if the money could be found Chowton Farm exclaimed the old woman who remembered well the agony which had attended the alienation of that portion of the Morton lands It may be that it will be sold Lawrence Twentyman sell Chowton Farm I thought he was well off Little as she had been at Bragton she knew all about Chowton Farm except that its owner was so wounded by vain love as to be like a hurt deer Her grandson did not tell her all the story but explained to her that Lawrence Twentyman though not poor had other plans of life and thought of leaving the neighbourhood She of course had the money and as she believed that land was the one proper possession for an English gentleman of ancient family she doubtless would have been willing to buy it had she approved of the hands into which it would fall It seemed to her that it was her duty to do as much for the estate with which all her fortune had been concerned Yes she said it should be bought if other things suited We will talk of it to morrow John Then he spoke of his mission to Patagonia and of his regret that it should be abandoned Even were he ever to be well again his strength would return to him too late for this purpose He had already made known to the Foreign Office his inability to undertake that service But she could perceive that he had not in truth abandoned his hopes of living for he spoke much of his ambition as to the public service The more he thought of it he said the more certain he became that it would suit him better to go on with his profession than to live the life of a country squire in England And yet she could see the change which had taken place since she was last there and was aware that he was fading away from day to day It was not till they were summoned to dine together that she saw Lady Ushant Very many years had passed since last they were together and yet neither seemed to the other to be much changed Lady Ushant was still soft retiring and almost timid whereas missus Morton showed her inclination to domineer even in the way in which she helped herself to salt While the servant was with them very little was said on either side There was a word or two from missus Morton to show that she considered herself the mistress there and a word from the other lady proclaiming that she had no pretensions of that kind But after dinner in the little drawing room they were more communicative Something of course was said as to the health of the invalid Lady Ushant was not the woman to give a pronounced opinion on such a subject She used doubtful hesitating words and would in one minute almost contradict what she had said in the former But missus Morton was clever enough to perceive that Lady Ushant was almost without hope Then she made a little speech with a fixed purpose It must be a great trouble to you Lady Ushant to be so long away from home Not at all said Lady Ushant in perfect innocence I have nothing to bind me anywhere I shall think it my duty to remain here now till the end I suppose so He has always been almost the same to you as your own Quite so quite the same He is my own And yet thought Lady Ushant she left him in his illness She too had heard something from missus Hopkins of the temper in which missus Morton had last left Bragton But you are not bound to him in that way Not in that way certainly In no way I may say It was very kind of you to come when business made it imperative on me to go to town but I do not think we can call upon you for further sacrifice It is no sacrifice missus Morton Lady Ushant was as meek as a worm but a worm will turn And though innocent she was quick enough to perceive that at this their first meeting the other old woman was endeavouring to turn her out of the house I mean that it can hardly be necessary to call upon you to give up your time What has an old woman to do with her time missus Morton Hitherto missus Morton had smiled The smile indeed had been grim but it had been intended to betoken outward civility Now there came a frown upon her brow which was more grim and by no means civil The truth is that at such a time one who is almost a stranger I am no stranger said Lady Ushant You had not seen him since he was an infant My name was Morton as is his and my dear father was the owner of this house Your husband missus Morton was his grandfather and my brother I will allow no one to tell me that I am a stranger at Bragton I have lived here many more years than you A stranger to him I meant And now that he is ill I shall stay with him till he desires me to go away He asked me to stay and that is quite enough Then she got up and left the room with more dignity as also she had spoken with more earnestness than missus Morton had given her credit for possessing After that the two ladies did not meet again till the next day CHAPTER IV THE TWO OLD LADIES On the next morning missus Morton did not come down to breakfast but sat alone upstairs nursing her wrath During the night she had made up her mind to one or two things She would never enter her grandson s chambers when Lady Ushant was there She would not speak to Reginald Morton and should he come into her presence while she was at Bragton she would leave the room She would do her best to make the house in common parlance too hot to hold that other woman And she would make use of those words which John had spoken concerning Chowton Farm as a peg on which she might hang her discourse in reference to his will If in doing all this she should receive that dutiful assistance which she thought that he owed her then she should stand by his bed side and be tender to him and nurse him to the last as a mother would nurse a child But if as she feared he were headstrong in disobeying then she would remember that her duty to her family if done with a firm purpose would have lasting results while his life might probably be an affair of a few weeks or even days At about eleven Lady Ushant was with her patient when a message was brought by missus Hopkins missus Morton wished to see her grandson and desired to know whether it would suit him that she should come now Why not said the sick man who was sitting up in his bed Then Lady Ushant collected her knitting and was about to depart Must you go because she is coming Morton asked Lady Ushant shocked at the necessity of explaining to him the ill feeling that existed said that perhaps it would be best Why should it be best Lady Ushant shook her head and smiled and put her hand upon the counterpane and retired As she passed the door of her rival s room she could see the black silk dress moving behind the partly open door and as she entered her own she heard missus Morton s steps upon the corridor The place was already almost too hot for her Anything would be better than scenes like this in the house of a dying man Need my aunt have gone away he asked after the first greeting I did not say so She seemed to think that she was not to stay Can I help what she thinks John Of course she feels that she is Is what An interloper if I must say it But I have sent for her and I have begged her to stay Of course she can stay if she wishes But dear John there must be much to be said between you and me which which cannot interest her or which at least she ought not to hear He did not contradict this in words feeling himself to be too weak for contest but within his own mind he declared that it was not so The things which interested him now were as likely to interest his great aunt as his grandmother and to be as fit for the ears of the one as for those of the other An hour had passed after this during which she tended him giving him food and medicine and he had slept before she ventured to allude to the subject which was nearest to her heart John she said at last I have been thinking about Chowton Farm Well It certainly should be bought If the man resolves on selling it Of course I mean that How much would it be Then he mentioned the sum which Twentyman had named saying that he had inquired and had been told that the price was reasonable It is a large sum of money John There might be a mortgage for part of it I don t like mortgages The property would not be yours at all if it were mortgaged as soon as bought You would pay five per cent for the money and only get three per cent from the land The old lady understood all about it I could pay it off in two years said the sick man There need be no paying off and no mortgage if I did it I almost believe I have got enough to do it He knew very well that she had much more than enough I think more of this property than of anything in the world my dear Chowton Farm could be yours you know What should I do with Chowton Farm I shall probably be in my grave before the slow lawyer would have executed the deeds And I in mine thought he to himself before the present owner has quite made up his mind to part with his land What would a little place like that do for me But in my father in law s time it was part of the Bragton property He sold it to pay the debts of a younger son forgetting as I thought what he owed to the estate It had in truth been sold on behalf of the husband of this old woman who was now complaining And if it can be recovered it is our duty to get it back again A property like this should never be lessened It is in that way that the country is given over to shopkeepers and speculators and is made to be like France or Italy I quite think that Chowton Farm should be bought And though I might die before it was done I would find the money I knew what your feeling would be Yes John You could not but know it well But Then she paused a moment looking into his face But I should wish to know what would become of it eventually If it were yours you could do what you pleased with it But it would be yours Then it would go with the rest of the property To whom would it go We have all to die my dear and who can say whom it may please the Almighty to take first In this house ma am every one can give a shrewd guess I know my own condition If I die without children of my own every acre I possess will go to the proper heir Thinking as you do you ought to agree with me in that But who is the proper heir My cousin Reginald Do not let us contest it ma am As certainly as I lie here he will have Bragton when I am gone Will you not listen to me John Not about that How could I die in peace were I to rob him It is all your own to do as you like with It is all my own but not to do as I like with With your feelings with your ideas how can you urge me to such an injustice Do I want it for myself I do not even want it for any one belonging to me There is your cousin Peter If he were the heir he should have it though I know nothing of him and believe him to be but a poor creature and very unfit to have the custody of a family property But he is his father s son I will believe nothing of that said the sick man raising himself in his bed It is a slander it is based on no evidence whatsoever No one even thought of it but you John is that the way to speak to me It is the way to speak of an assertion so injurious Then he fell back again on his pillows and she sat by his bedside for a full half hour speechless thinking of it all At the end of that time she had resolved that she would not yet give it up Should he regain his health and strength and she would pray fervently night and day that God would be so good to him then everything would be well Then he would marry and have children and Bragton would descend in the right line But were it to be ordained otherwise should it be God s will that he must die then as he grew weaker he would become more plastic in her hands and she might still prevail At present he was stubborn with the old stubbornness and would not see with her eyes She would bide her time and be careful to have a lawyer ready She turned it all over in her mind as she sat there watching him in his sleep She knew of no one but mister Masters whom she distrusted as being connected with the other side of the family whose father had made that will by which the property in Dillsborough had been dissevered from Bragton But mister Masters would probably obey instructions if they were given to him definitely She thought of it all and then went down to lunch She did not dare to refuse altogether to meet the other woman lest such resolve on her part might teach those in the house to think that Lady Ushant was the mistress She took her place at the head of the table and interchanged a few words with her grandson s guest which of course had reference to his health Lady Ushant was very ill able to carry on a battle of any sort and was willing to show her submission in everything unless she were desired to leave the house While they were still sitting at table Reginald Morton walked into the room It had been his habit to do so regularly for the last week A daily visitor does not wait to have himself announced Reginald had considered the matter and had determined that he would follow his practice just as though missus Morton were not there If she were civil to him then would he be very courteous to her It had never occurred to him to expect conduct such as that with which she greeted him The old woman got up and looked at him sternly My nephew Reginald said Lady Ushant supposing that some introduction might be necessary missus Morton gathered the folds of her dress together and without a word stalked out of the room And yet she believed she could not but believe that her grandson was on his deathbed in the room above O Reginald what are we to do said Lady Ushant Is she like that to you She told me last night that I was a stranger and that I ought to leave the house And what did you say I told her I should stay while he wished me to stay But it is all so terrible that I think I had better go I would not stir a step on her account But why should she be so bitter I have done nothing to offend her It is more than half of even my long lifetime since I saw her She is nothing but I have to think of his comfort I suppose she is good to him and though he may bid me stay such scenes as this in the house must be a trouble to him Nevertheless Reginald was strong in opinion that Lady Ushant ought not to allow herself to be driven away and declared his own purpose of coming daily as had of late been his wont Soon after this Reginald was summoned to go upstairs and he again met the angry woman in the passage passing her of course without a word And then Mary came to see her friend and she also encountered missus Morton who was determined that no one should come into that house without her knowledge Who is that young woman said missus Morton to the old housekeeper That is Miss Masters my Lady And who is Miss Masters and why does she come here at such a time as this She is the daughter of Attorney Masters my Lady It was she as was brought up here by Lady Ushant Oh that young person She s come here generally of a day now to see her ladyship And is she taken up to my grandson Oh dear no my Lady She sits with Lady Ushant for an hour or so and then goes back with mister Reginald Oh that is it is it The house is made use of for such purposes as that I don t think there is any purposes my Lady said missus Hopkins almost roused to indignation although she was talking to the acknowledged mistress of the house whom she always called my lady Lady Ushant told the whole story to her young friend bitterly bewailing her position Reginald tells me not to go but I do not think that I can stand it I should not mind the quarrel so much only that he is so ill She must be a very evil minded person She was always arrogant and always hard I can remember her just the same but that was so many years ago She left Bragton then because she could not banish his mother from the house But to bear it all in her heart so long is not like a human being let alone a woman What did he say to you going home yesterday Nothing Lady Ushant Does he know that it will all be his if that poor young man should die He never speaks to me as if he thought of it He would certainly not speak to me about it I do not think he thinks of it He is not like that Men do consider such things And they are only cousins and they have never known each other Oh Mary What are you thinking of Lady Ushant Men ought not to care for money or position but they do If he comes here all that I have will be yours Oh Lady Ushant It is not much but it will be enough I do not want to hear about such things now But you ought to be told Ah dear if it could be as I wish The imprudent weak minded loving old woman longed to hear a tale of mutual love longed to do something which should cause such a tale to be true on both sides And yet she could not quite bring herself to express her wish either to the man or to the woman Poor Mary almost understood it but was not quite sure of her friend s meaning She was however quite sure that if such were the wish of Lady Ushant s heart Lady Ushant was wishing in vain She had twice walked back to Dillsborough with Reginald Morton and he had been more sedate more middle aged less like a lover than ever She knew now that she might safely walk with him being sure that he was no more likely to talk of love than would have been old doctor Nupper had she accepted the offer which he had made her of a cast in his gig And now that Reginald would probably become Squire of Bragton it was more impossible than ever As Squire of Bragton he would seek some highly born bride quite out of her way whom she could never know And then she would see neither him nor Bragton any more Would it not have been better that she should have married Larry Twentyman and put an end to so many troubles beside her own Again she walked back with him to Dillsborough passing as they always did across the little bridge He seemed to be very silent as he went more so than usual and as was her wont with him she only spoke to him when he addressed her It was only when he got out on the road that he told her what was on his mind Mary he said how will it be with me if that poor fellow dies In what way mister Morton All that place will be mine He told me so just now But that would be of course Not at all He might give it to you if he pleased He could not have an heir who would care for it less But it is right that it should be so Whether it would suit my taste or not to live as Squire of Bragton and I do not think it would suit my taste well it ought to be so I am the next and it will be my duty I am sure you do not want him to die No indeed If I could save him by my right hand if I could save him by my life I would do it But of all lives it must surely be the best Do you think so What is such a one likely to do But then what do I do as it is It is the sort of life you would like if you were a man Yes if I were a man said Mary Then he again relapsed into silence and hardly spoke again till he left her at her father s door CHAPTER V THE LAST EFFORT When Mary reached her home she was at once met by her stepmother in the passage with tidings of importance He is up stairs in the drawing room said missus Masters Mary whose mind was laden with thoughts of Reginald Morton asked who was the he Lawrence Twentyman said missus Masters And now my dear do do think of it before you go to him There was no anger now in her stepmother s face but entreaty and almost love She had not called Mary my dear for many weeks past not since that journey to Cheltenham Now she grasped the girl s hand as she went on with her prayer He is so good and so true And what better can there be for you With your advantages and Lady Ushant and all that you would be quite the lady at Chowton Think of your father and sisters what a good you could do them And think of the respect they all have for him dining with Lord Rufford the other day and all the other gentlemen It isn t only that he has got plenty to live on but he knows how to keep it as a man ought He s sure to hold up his head and be as good a squire as any of em This was a very different tale a note altogether changed It must not be said that the difference of the tale and the change of the note affected Mary s heart but her stepmother s manner to her did soften her And then why should she regard herself or her own feelings Like others she had thought much of her own happiness had made herself the centre of her own circle had in her imagination built castles in the air and filled them according to her fancy But her fancies had been all shattered into fragments not a stone of her castles was standing she had told herself unconsciously that there was no longer a circle and no need for a centre That last half hour which she had passed with Reginald Morton on the road home had made quite sure that which had been sure enough before He was now altogether out of her reach thinking only of the new duties which were coming to him She would never walk with him again never put herself in the way of indulging some fragment of an illusory hope She was nothing now nothing even to herself Why should she not give herself and her services to this young man if the young man chose to take her as she was It would be well that she should do something in the world Why should she not look after his house and mend his shirts and reign over his poultry yard In this way she would be useful and respected by all unless perhaps by the man she loved Mary say that you will think of it once more pleaded missus Masters I may go up stairs to my own room Certainly do go up and smooth your hair I will tell him that you are coming to him He will wait But he is so much in earnest now and so sad that I know he will not come again Then Mary went up stairs determined to think of it She began at once woman like to smooth her hair as her stepmother had recommended and to remove the dust of the road from her face and dress But not the less was she thinking of it the while Could she do it how much pain would be spared even to herself How much that was now bitter as gall in her mouth would become not sweet but tasteless There are times in one s life in which the absence of all savour seems to be sufficient for life in this world Were she to do this thing she thought that she would have strength to banish that other man from her mind and at last from her heart He would be there close to her but of a different kind and leading a different life missus Masters had told her that Larry would be as good a squire as the best of them but it should be her care to keep him and herself in their proper position to teach him the vanity of such aspirations And the real squire opposite who would despise her for had he not told her that she would be despicable if she married this man would not trouble her then They might meet on the roads and there would be a cold question or two as to each other s welfare and a vain shaking of hands but they would know nothing and care for nothing as to each other s thoughts And there would come some stately dame who hearing how things had been many years ago would perhaps But no the stately dame should be received with courtesy but there should be no patronising Even in these few minutes up stairs she thought much of the stately dame and was quite sure that she would endure no patronage from Bragton She almost thought that she could do it There were hideous ideas afflicting her soul dreadfully but which she strove to banish Of course she could not love him not at first But all those who wished her to marry him including himself knew that and still they wished her to marry him How could that be disgraceful which all her friends desired Her father to whom she was as she knew well the very apple of his eye wished her to marry this man and yet her father knew that her heart was elsewhere Had not women done it by hundreds by thousands and had afterwards performed their duties well as mothers and wives In other countries as she had read girls took the husbands found for them by their parents as a matter of course As she left the room and slowly crept down stairs she almost thought she would do it She almost thought but yet when her hand was on the lock she could not bring herself to say that it should be so He was not dressed as usual In the first place there was a round hat on the table such as men wear in cities She had never before seen such a hat with him except on a Sunday And he wore a black cloth coat and dark brown pantaloons and a black silk handkerchief She observed it all and thought that he had not changed for the better As she looked into his face it seemed to her more common meaner than before No doubt he was good looking but his good looks were almost repulsive to her He had altogether lost his little swagger but he had borne that little swagger well and in her presence it had never been offensive Now he seemed as though he had thrown aside all the old habits of his life and was pining to death from the loss of them Mary he said I have come to you for the last time I thought I would give myself one more chance and your father told me that I might have it He paused as though expecting an answer But she had not yet quite made up her mind Had she known her mind she would have answered him frankly She was quite resolved as to that If she could once bring herself to give him her hand she would not coy it for a moment I will be your wife Larry That was the form on which she had determined should she find herself able to yield But she had not brought herself to it as yet If you can take me Mary you will well save me from lifelong misery and make the man who loves you the best contented and the happiest man in England But Larry I do not love you I will make you love me Good usage will make a wife love her husband Don t you think you can trust me I do believe that I can trust you for everything good Is that nothing It is a great deal Larry but not enough not enough to bring together a man and woman as husband and wife I would sooner marry a man I loved though I knew he would ill use me Would you To marry either would be wrong I sometimes think dearest that if I could talk better I should be better able to persuade you I sometimes think you talk so well that I ought to be persuaded but I can t It is not lack of talking What is it then Just this my heart does not turn itself that way It is the same chance that has made you partial to me Partial Why I love the very air you breathe When I am near you everything smells sweet There isn t anything that belongs to you but I think I should know it though I found it a hundred miles away To have you in the room with me would be like heaven if I only knew that you were thinking kindly of me I always think kindly of you Larry Then say that you will be my wife She paused and became red up to the roots of her hair She seated herself on a chair and then rose again and again sat down The struggle was going on within her and he perceived something of the truth Say the word once Mary say it but once And as he prayed to her he came forward and went down upon his knees I cannot do it she replied at last speaking very hoarsely not looking at him not even addressing herself to him Mary Larry I cannot do it I have tried but I cannot do it O Larry dear Larry do not ask me again Larry I have no heart to give Another man has it all Is it so She bowed her head in token of assent Is it that young parson exclaimed Larry in anger It is not But Larry you must ask no questions now I have told you my secret that all this might be set at rest But if you are generous as I know you are you will keep my secret and will ask no questions And Larry if you are unhappy so am I If your heart is sore so is mine He knows nothing of my love and cares nothing for me Then throw him aside She smiled and shook her head Do you think I would not if I could Why do you not throw me aside Oh Mary Cannot I love as well as you You are a man and have the liberty to speak of it Though I cannot return it I can be proud of your love and feel grateful to you I cannot tell mine I cannot think of it without blushing But I can feel it and know it and be as sure that it has trodden me down and got the better of me as you can But you can go out into the world and teach yourself to forget I must go away from here then You have your business and your pleasures your horses and your fields and your friends I have nothing but to remain here and know that I have disobliged all those that love me Do you think Larry I would not go and be your wife if I could I have told you all Larry and now do not ask me again Is it so Yes it is so Then I shall cut it all I shall sell Chowton and go away You tell me I have my horses and my pleasures What pleasures I know nothing of my horses not whether they are lame or sound I could not tell you of one of them whether he is fit to go to morrow Business The place may farm itself for me for I can t stay there Everything sickens me to look at it Pleasures indeed Is that manly Larry How can a man be manly when the manliness is knocked out of him A man s courage lies in his heart but if his heart is broken where will his courage be then I couldn t hold my head up here any more and I shall go You must not do that she said getting up and laying hold of his arm But I must do it For my sake you must stay here Larry so that I may not have to think that I have injured you so deeply Larry though I cannot be your wife I think I could die of sorrow if you were always unhappy What is a poor girl that you should grieve for her in that way I think if I were a man I would master my love better than that He shook his head and faintly strove to drag his arm from out of her grasp Promise me that you will take a year to think of it before you go Will you take a year to think of me said he rising again to sudden hope No Larry no I should deceive you were I to say so I deceived you before when I put it off for two months But you can promise me without deceit For my sake Larry And she almost embraced him as she begged for his promise I know you would wish to spare me pain Think what will be my sufferings if I hear that you have really gone from Chowton You will promise me Larry Promise what That the farm shall not be sold for twelve months Oh yes I ll promise I don t care for the farm And stay there if you can Don t leave the place to strangers And go about your business and hunt and be a man I shall always be thinking of what you do I shall always watch you I shall always love you always always always I always have loved you because you are so good But it is a different love And now Larry good bye So saying she raised her face to look into his eyes Then he suddenly put his arm round her waist kissed her forehead and left the room without another word missus Masters saw him as he went and must have known from his gait what was the nature of the answer he had received But yet she went quickly upstairs to inquire The matter was one of too much consequence for a mere inference Mary had gone from the sitting room but her stepmother followed her upstairs to her bed chamber Mamma she said I couldn t do it I couldn t do it I did try Pray do not scold me I did try but I could not do it Then she threw herself into the arms of the unsympathetic woman who however was now somewhat less unsympathetic than she had hitherto been missus Masters did not understand it at all but she did perceive that there was something which she did not understand What did the girl mean by saying that she had tried and could not do it Try to do it If she tried why could she not tell the man that she would have him There was surely some shamefacedness in this some overstrained modesty which she missus Masters could not comprehend How could she have tried to accept a man who was so anxious to marry her and have failed in the effort Scolding I suppose will be no good now she said Oh no But Well I suppose we must put up with it Everything on earth that a girl could possibly wish for He was that in love that it s my belief he d have settled it all on you if you d only asked him Let it go mamma Let it go It s gone I suppose Well I ain t going to say any more about it But as for not sorrowing how is a woman not to sorrow when so much has been lost It s your poor father I m thinking of Mary This was so much better than she had expected that poor Mary almost felt that her heart was lightened CHAPTER VI AGAIN AT MISTLETOE The reader will have been aware that Arabella Trefoil was not a favourite at Mistletoe She was so much disliked by the Duchess that there had almost been words about her between her Grace and the Duke since her departure The Duchess always submitted and it was the rule of her life to submit with so good a grace that her husband never fearing rebellion should never be driven to assume the tyrant But on this occasion the Duke had objected to the term thoroughly bad girl which had been applied by his wife to his niece He had said that thoroughly bad girl was strong language and when the Duchess defended the phrase he had expressed his opinion that Arabella was only a bad girl and not a thoroughly bad girl The Duchess had said that it was the same thing Then said the Duke why use a redundant expletive against your own relative The Duchess when she was accused of strong language had not minded it much but her feelings were hurt when a redundant expletive was attributed to her The effect of all this had been that the Duke in a mild way had taken up Arabella s part and that the Duchess following her husband at last had been brought round to own that Arabella though bad had been badly treated She had disbelieved and then believed and had again disbelieved Arabella s own statement as to the offer of marriage But the girl had certainly been in earnest when she had begged her aunt to ask her uncle to speak to Lord Rufford Surely when she did she must have thought that an offer had been made to her Such offer if made had no doubt been produced by very hard pressure but still an offer of marriage is an offer and a girl if she can obtain it has a right to use such an offer as so much property Then came Lord Mistletoe s report after his meeting with Arabella up in London He had been unable to give his cousin any satisfaction but he was clearly of opinion that she had been ill used He did not venture to suggest any steps but did think that Lord Rufford was bound as a gentleman to marry the young lady After that Lord Augustus saw her mother up in town and said that it was a d shame He in truth had believed nothing and would have been delighted to allow the matter to drop But as this was not permitted he thought it easier to take his daughter s part than to encounter family enmity by entering the lists against her So it came to pass that down at Mistletoe there grew an opinion that Lord Rufford ought to marry Arabella Trefoil But what should be done The Duke was alive to the feeling that as the girl was certainly his niece and as she was not to be regarded as a thoroughly bad girl some assistance was due to her from the family Lord Mistletoe volunteered to write to Lord Rufford Lord Augustus thought that his brother should have a personal interview with his young brother peer and bring his strawberry leaves to bear The Duke himself suggested that the Duchess should see Lady Penwether a scheme to which her Grace objected strongly knowing something of Lady Penwether and being sure that her strawberry leaves would have no effect whatever on the baronet s wife At last it was decided that a family meeting should be held and Lord Augustus was absolutely summoned to meet Lord Mistletoe at the paternal mansion It was now some years since Lord Augustus had been at Mistletoe As he had never been separated that is formally separated from his wife he and she had been always invited there together Year after year she had accepted the invitation and it had been declined on his behalf because it did not suit him and his wife to meet each other But now he was obliged to go there just at the time of the year when whist at his club was most attractive To meet the convenience of Lord Mistletoe and the House of Commons a Saturday afternoon was named for the conference which made it worse for Lord Augustus as he was one of a little party which had private gatherings for whist on Sunday afternoons But he went to the conference travelling down by the same train with his nephew but not in the same compartment as he solaced with tobacco the time which Lord Mistletoe devoted to parliamentary erudition The four met in her Grace s boudoir and the Duke began by declaring that all this was very sad Lord Augustus shook his head and put his hands in his trousers pockets which was as much as to say that his feelings as a British parent were almost too strong for him Your mother and I think that something ought to be done said the Duke turning to his son Something ought to be done said Lord Mistletoe They won t let a fellow go out with a fellow now said Lord Augustus Heaven forbid said the Duchess raising both her hands I was thinking Mistletoe that your mother might have met Lady Penwether What could I do with Lady Penwether Duke Or what could she do with him A man won t care for what his sister says to him And I don t suppose she d undertake to speak to Lord Rufford on the subject Lady Penwether is an honourable and an accomplished woman I dare say though she gives herself abominable airs Of course if you don t like it my dear it shan t be pressed I thought perhaps you d see him yourself said Lord Augustus turning to his brother You d carry more weight than anybody Of course I will if it be necessary but it would be disagreeable very disagreeable The appeal should be made to his feelings and that I think would better come through female influence As far as I know the world a man is always more prone to be led in such matters by a woman than by another man If you mean me said the Duchess I don t think I could see him Of course Augustus I don t wish to say anything hard of Arabella The fact that we have all met here to take her part will prove that I think But I didn t quite approve of all that was done here Lord Augustus stroked his beard and looked out of the window I don t think my dear we need go into that just now said the Duke Not at all said the Duchess and I don t intend to say a word Only if I were to meet Lord Rufford he might refer to things which which which In point of fact I had rather not I might see him suggested Lord Mistletoe No doubt that might be done with advantage said the Duke Only that as he is my senior in age what I might say to him would lack that weight which any observations which might be made on such a matter should carry with them He didn t care a straw for me said Lord Augustus And then continued Lord Mistletoe I so completely agree with what my father says as to the advantage of female influence With a man of Lord Rufford s temperament female influence is everything If my aunt were to try it Lord Augustus blew the breath out of his mouth and raised his eyebrows Knowing what he did of his wife or thinking that he knew what he did he did not conceive it possible that a worse messenger should be chosen He had known himself to be a very bad one but he did honestly believe her to be even less fitted for the task than he himself But he said nothing simply wishing that he had not left his whist for such a purpose as this Perhaps Lady Augustus had better see him said the Duke The Duchess who did not love hypocrisy would not actually assent to this but she said nothing I suppose my sister in law would not object Augustus G Almighty only knows said the younger brother The Duchess grievously offended by the impropriety of this language drew herself up haughtily Perhaps you would not mind suggesting it to her sir said Lord Mistletoe I could do that by letter said the Duke And when she has assented as of course she will then perhaps you wouldn t mind writing a line to him to make an appointment If you were to do so he could not refuse To this proposition the Duke returned no immediate answer but looked at it round and round carefully At last however he acceded to this also and so the matter was arranged All these influential members of the ducal family met together at the ducal mansion on Arabella s behalf and settled their difficulty by deputing the work of bearding the lion of tying the bell on the cat to an absent lady whom they all despised and disliked That afternoon the Duke with the assistance of his son who was a great writer of letters prepared an epistle to his sister in law and another to Lord Rufford which was to be sent as soon as Lady Augusta had agreed to the arrangement In the former letter a good deal was said as to a mother s solicitude for her daughter It had been felt the letter said that no one could speak for a daughter so well as a mother that no other s words would so surely reach the heart of a man who was not all evil but who was tempted by the surroundings of the world to do evil in this particular case The letter began My dear sister in law and ended Your affectionate brother in law Mayfair and was in fact the first letter that the Duke had ever written to his brother s wife The other letter was more difficult but it was accomplished at last and confined itself to a request that Lord Rufford would meet Lady Augustus Trefoil at a place and at a time both of which were for the present left blank On the Monday Lord Augustus and Lord Mistletoe were driven to the station in the same carriage and on this occasion the uncle said a few strong words to his nephew on the subject Lord Augustus though perhaps a coward in the presence of his brother was not so with other members of the family It may be very well you know but it s all d nonsense I m sorry that you should think so uncle What do you suppose her mother can do a thoroughly vulgar woman I never could live with her As far as I can see wherever she goes everybody hates her My dear uncle Rufford will only laugh at her If Mayfair would have gone himself it is just possible that he might have done something My father is so unwilling to mix himself up in these things Of course he is Everybody knows that What the deuce was the good then of our going down there I couldn t do anything and I knew he wouldn t The truth is Mistletoe a man now a days may do just what he pleases You ain t in that line and it won t do you any good knowing it but since we did away with pistols everybody may do just what he likes I don t like brute force said Lord Mistletoe You may call it what you please but I don t know that it was so brutal after all At the station they separated again as Lord Augustus was panting for tobacco and Lord Mistletoe for parliamentary erudition CHAPTER VII THE SUCCESS OF LADY AUGUSTUS Lady Augustus was still staying with the Connop Greens in Hampshire when she received the Duke s letter and Arabella was with her The story of Lord Rufford s infidelity had been told to missus Connop Green and of course through her to mister Connop Green Both the mother and daughter affected to despise the Connop Greens but it is so hard to restrain oneself from confidences when difficulties arise Arabella had by this time quite persuaded herself that there had been an absolute engagement and did in truth believe that she had been most cruelly ill used She was headstrong fickle and beyond measure insolent to her mother She had as we know at one time gone down to the house of her former lover thereby indicating that she had abandoned all hope of catching Lord Rufford But still the Connop Greens either felt or pretended to feel great sympathy with her and she would still declare from time to time that Lord Rufford had not heard the last of her It was now more than a month since she had seen that perjured lord at Mistletoe and more than a week since her father had brought him so uselessly up to London Though determined that Lord Rufford should hear more of her she hardly knew how to go to work and on these days spent most of her time in idle denunciations of her false lover Then came her uncle s letter which was of course shown to her She was quite of opinion that they must do as the Duke directed It was so great a thing to have the Duke interesting himself in the matter that she would have assented to anything proposed by him The suggestion even inspired some temporary respect or at any rate observance towards her mother Hitherto her mother had been nobody to her in the matter a person belonging to her whom she had to regard simply as a burden She could not at all understand how the Duke had been guided in making such a choice of a new emissary but there it was under his own hand and she must now in some measure submit herself to her mother unless she were prepared to repudiate altogether the Duke s assistance As to Lady Augustus herself the suggestion gave to her quite a new life She had no clear conception what she should say to Lord Rufford if the meeting were arranged but it was gratifying to her to find herself brought back into authority over her daughter She read the Duke s letter to missus Connop Green with certain very slight additions or innuendos as to additions and was pleased to find that the letter was taken by missus Connop Green as positive proof of the existence of the engagement She wrote begging the Duke to allow her to have the meeting at the family house in Piccadilly and to this prayer the Duke was obliged to assent It would she said give her so much assistance in speaking to Lord Rufford She named a day also and then spent her time in preparing herself for the interview by counsel with missus Green and by exacting explanations from her daughter This was a very bad time for Arabella so bad that had she known to what she would be driven she would probably have repudiated the Duke and her mother altogether Now my dear she began you must tell me everything that occurred first at Rufford and then at Mistletoe You know very well what occurred mamma I know nothing about it and unless everything is told me I will not undertake this mission Your uncle evidently thinks that by my interference the thing may be arranged I have had the same idea all through myself but as you have been so obstinate I have not liked to say so Now Arabella begin from the beginning When was it that he first suggested to you the idea of marriage Good heavens mamma I must have it from the beginning to the end Did he speak of marriage at Rufford I suppose he did because you told me that you were engaged to him when you went to Mistletoe So I was What had he said What nonsense How am I to remember what he said As if a girl ever knows what a man says to her Did he kiss you Yes At Rufford I cannot stand this mamma If you like to go you may go My uncle seems to think it is the best thing and so I suppose it ought to be done But I won t answer such questions as you are asking for Lord Rufford and all that he possesses What am I to say then How am I to call back to his recollection the fact that he committed himself unless you will tell me how and when he did so Ask him if he did not assure me of his love when we were in the carriage together What carriage Coming home from hunting Was that at Mistletoe or Rufford At Mistletoe mamma replied Arabella stamping her foot But you must let me know how it was that you became engaged to him at Rufford Mamma you mean to drive me mad exclaimed Arabella as she bounced out of the room There was very much more of this till at last Arabella found herself compelled to invent facts Lord Rufford she said had assured her of his everlasting affection in the little room at Rufford and had absolutely asked her to be his wife coming home in the carriage with her to Stamford She told herself that though this was not strictly true it was as good as true as that which was actually done and said by Lord Rufford on those occasions could have had no other meaning But before her mother had completed her investigation Arabella had become so sick of the matter that she shut herself up in her room and declared that nothing on earth should induce her to open her mouth on the subject again When Lord Rufford received the letter he was aghast with new disgust He had begun to flatter himself that his interview with Lord Augustus would be the end of the affair Looking at it by degrees with coolness he had allowed himself to think that nothing very terrible could be done to him Some few people particularly interested in the Mistletoe family might give him a cold shoulder or perhaps cut him directly but such people would not belong to his own peculiar circle and the annoyance would not be great But if all the family one after another were to demand interviews with him up in London he did not see when the end of it would be There would be the Duke himself and the Duchess and Mistletoe And the affair would in this way become gossip for the whole town He was almost minded to write to the Duke saying that such an interview could do no good but at last he thought it best to submit the matter to his mentor Sir George Penwether Sir George was clearly of opinion that it was Lord Rufford s duty to see Lady Augustus Yes you must have interviews with all of them if they ask it said Sir George You must show that you are not afraid to hear what her friends have got to say When a man gets wrong he can t put himself right without some little annoyance Since the world began said Lord Rufford I don t think that there was ever a man born so well adapted for preaching sermons as you are Nevertheless he did as he was bid and consented to meet Lady Augustus in Piccadilly on the day named by her On that very day the hounds met at Impington and Lord Rufford began to feel his punishment He assented to the proposal made and went up to London leaving the members of the U R U to have the run of the season from the Impington coverts When Lady Augustus was sitting in the back room of the mansion waiting for Lord Rufford she was very much puzzled to think what she would say to him when he came With all her investigation she had received no clear idea of the circumstances as they occurred That her daughter had told her a fib in saying that she was engaged when she went to Mistletoe she was all but certain That something had occurred in the carriage which might be taken for an offer she thought possible She therefore determined to harp upon the carriage as much as possible and to say as little as might be as to the doings at Rufford Then as she was trying to arrange her countenance and her dress and her voice so that they might tell on his feelings Lord Rufford was announced Lady Augustus said he at once beginning the lesson which he had taught himself I hope I see you quite well I have come here because you have asked me but I really don t know that I have anything to say Lord Rufford you must hear me Oh yes I will hear you certainly only this kind of thing is so painful to all parties and I don t see the use of it Are you aware that you have plunged me and my daughter into a state of misery too deep to be fathomed I should be sorry to think that How can it be otherwise When you assure a girl in her position in life that you love her a lady whose rank is quite as high as your own Quite so quite so And when in return for that assurance you have received vows of love from her what is she to think and what are her friends to think Lord Rufford had always kept in his mind a clear remembrance of the transaction in the carriage and was well aware that the young lady s mother had inverted the circumstances or as he expressed it to himself had put the cart before the horse He had assured the young lady that he loved her and he had also been assured of her love but her assurance had come first He felt that this made all the difference in the world so much difference that no one cognisant in such matters would hold that his assurance obtained after such a fashion meant anything at all But how was he to explain this to the lady s mother You will admit that such assurances were given continued Lady Augustus Upon my word I don t know There was a little foolish talk but it meant nothing My lord What am I to say I don t want to give offence and I am heartily sorry that you and your daughter should be under any misapprehension But as I sit here there was no engagement between us nor if I must speak out Lady Augustus could your daughter have thought that there was an engagement Did you not embrace her I did That s the truth And after that you mean to say After that I mean to say that nothing more was intended There was a certain meanness of appearance about the mother which emboldened him What a declaration to make to the mother of a young lady and that young lady the niece of the Duke of Mayfair It s not the first time such a thing has been done Lady Augustus I know nothing about that nothing I don t know whom you may have lived with It never was done to her before If I understand right she was engaged to marry mister Morton when she came to Rufford It was all at an end before that At any rate you both came from his house Where he had been staying with missus Morton And where she has been since without missus Morton Lady Ushant was there Lord Rufford But she has been staying at the house of this gentleman to whom you admit that she was engaged a short time before she came to us He is on his death bed and he thought that he had behaved badly to her She did go to Bragton the other day at his request merely that she might say that she forgave him I only hope that she will forgive me too There is really nothing else to be said If there were anything I could do to atone to her for this trouble If you only could know the brightness of the hopes you have shattered and the purity of that girl s affection for yourself It was then that an idea a low minded idea occurred to Lord Rufford While all this was going on he had of course made various inquiries about this branch of the Trefoil family and had learned that Arabella was altogether portionless He was told too that Lady Augustus was much harassed by impecuniosity Might it be possible to offer a recompense If I could do anything else Lady Augustus but really I am not a marrying man Then Lady Augustus wept bitterly but while she was weeping a low minded idea occurred to her also It was clear to her that there could be no marriage She had never expected that there would be a marriage But if this man who was rolling in wealth should offer some sum of money to her daughter something so considerable as to divest the transaction of the meanness which would be attached to a small bribe something which might be really useful throughout life would it not be her duty on behalf of her dear child to accept such an offer But the beginnings of such dealings are always difficult Couldn t my lawyer see yours Lady Augustus said Lord Rufford I don t want the family lawyer to know anything about it said Lady Augustus Then there was silence between them for a few moments You don t know what we have to bear Lord Rufford My husband has spent all my fortune which was considerable and the Duke does nothing for us Then he took a bit of paper and writing on it the figures Lsix thousand pushed it across the table She gazed at the scrap for a minute and then borrowing his pencil without a word scratched out his Lordship s figures and wrote Leight thousand beneath them and then added No one to know it After that he held the scrap for two or three minutes in his hands and then wrote beneath the figures Very well To be settled on your daughter No one shall know it She bowed her head but kept the scrap of paper in her possession Shall I ring for your carriage he asked The bell was rung and Lady Augustus was taken back to the lodgings in Orchard Street in the hired brougham As she went she told herself that if everything else failed Lfour hundred a year would support her daughter or that in the event of any further matrimonial attempt such a fortune would be a great assistance She had been sure that there could be no marriage and was disposed to think that she had done a good morning s work on behalf of her unnatural child CHAPTER VIII WE SHALL KILL EACH OTHER Lady Augustus as she was driven back to Orchard Street and as she remained alone during the rest of that day and the next in London became a little afraid of what she had done She began to think how she should communicate her tidings to her daughter and thinking of it grew to be nervous and ill at ease How would it be with her should Arabella still cling to the hope of marrying the lord That any such hope would be altogether illusory Lady Augustus was now sure She had been quite certain that there was no ground for such hope when she had spoken to the man of her own poverty She was almost certain that there had never been an offer of marriage made In the first place Lord Rufford s word went further with her than Arabella s and then his story had been consistent and probable whereas hers had been inconsistent and improbable At any rate ropes and horses would not bring Lord Rufford to the hymeneal altar That being so was it not natural that she should then have considered what result would be next best to a marriage She was very poor having saved only some few hundreds a year from the wreck of her own fortune Independently of her her daughter had nothing And in spite of this poverty Arabella was very extravagant running up bills for finery without remorse wherever credit could be found and excusing herself by saying that on this or that occasion such expenditure was justified by the matrimonial prospects which it opened out to her And now of late Arabella had been talking of living separately from her mother Lady Augustus who was thoroughly tired of her daughter s company was not at all averse to such a scheme but any such scheme was impracticable without money By a happy accident the money would now be forthcoming There would be Lfour hundred a year for ever and nobody would know whence it came She was confident that they might trust to the lord s honour for secrecy As far as her own opinion went the result of the transaction would be most happy But still she feared Arabella She felt that she would not know how to tell her story when she got back to Marygold Place My dear he won t marry you but he is to give you Leight thousand That was what she would have to say but she doubted her own courage to put her story into words so curt and explanatory Even at thirty Lfour hundred a year has not the charms which accompany it to eyes which have seen sixty years She remained in town that night and the next day and went down by train to Basingstoke on the following morning with her heart not altogether free from trepidation Lord Rufford the very moment that the interview was over started off to his lawyer Considering how very little had been given to him the sum he was to pay was prodigious In his desire to get rid of the bore of these appeals he had allowed himself to be foolishly generous He certainly never would kiss a young lady in a carriage again nor even lend a horse to a young lady till he was better acquainted with her ambition and character But the word had gone from him and he must be as good as his word The girl must have her Leight thousand and must have it instantly He would put the matter into such a position that if any more interviews were suggested he might with perfect safety refer the suggester back to Miss Trefoil There was to be secrecy and he would be secret as the grave But in such matters one s lawyer is the grave He had proposed that two lawyers should arrange it Objection had been made to this because Lady Augustus had no lawyer ready but on his side some one must be employed So he went to his own solicitor and begged that the thing might be done quite at once He was very definite in his instructions and would listen to no doubts Would the lawyer write to Miss Trefoil on that very day or rather not on that very day but the next As he suggested this he thought it well that Lady Augustus should have an opportunity of explaining the transaction to her daughter before the lawyer s letter should be received He had he said his own reason for such haste Consequently the lawyer did prepare the letter to Miss Trefoil at once drafting it in his noble client s presence In what way should the money be disposed so as best to suit her convenience The letter was very short with an intimation that Lady Augustus would no doubt have explained the details of the arrangement When Lady Augustus reached Marygold the family were at lunch and as strangers were present nothing was said as to the great mission The mother had already bethought herself how she must tell this and that lie to the Connop Greens explaining that Lord Rufford had confessed his iniquity but had disclosed that for certain mysterious reasons he could not marry Arabella though he loved her better than all the world Arabella asked some questions about her mother s shopping and general business in town and did not leave the room till she could do so without the slightest appearance of anxiety missus Connop Green marvelled at her coolness knowing how much must depend on the answer which her mother had brought back from London and knowing nothing of the contents of the letter which Arabella had received that morning from the lawyer In a moment or two Lady Augustus followed her daughter upstairs and on going into her own room found the damsel standing in the middle of it with an open paper in her hand Mamma she said shut the door Then the door was closed What is the meaning of this and she held out the lawyer s letter The meaning of what said Lady Augustus trembling I have no doubt you know but you had better read it Lady Augustus read the letter and attempted to smile He has been very quick she said I thought I should have been the first to tell you What is the meaning of it Why is the man to give me all that money Is it not a good escape from so great a trouble Think what Leight thousand will do It will enable you to live in comfort wherever you may please to go I am to understand then you have sold me sold all my hopes and my very name and character for Leight thousand Your name and character will not be touched my dear As for his marrying you I soon found that that was absolutely out of the question This is what has come of sending you to see him Of course I shall tell my uncle everything You will do no such thing Arabella do not make a fool of yourself Do you know what Leight thousand will do for you It is to be your own absolutely beyond my reach or your father s I would sooner go into the Thames off Waterloo Bridge than touch a farthing of his money said Arabella with a spirit which the other woman did not at all understand Hitherto in all these little dirty ways they had run with equal steps The pretences the subterfuges the lies of the one had always been open to the other Arabella earnest in supplying herself with gloves from the pockets of her male acquaintances had endured her mother s tricks with complacency She had condescended when living in humble lodgings to date her letters from a well known hotel and had not feared to declare that she had done so in their family conversations Together they had fished in turbid waters for marital nibbles and had told mutual falsehoods to unbelieving tradesmen And yet the younger woman when tempted with a bribe worth lies and tricks as deep and as black as Acheron now stood on her dignity and her purity and stamped her foot with honest indignation I don t think you can understand it said Lady Augustus I can understand this that you have betrayed me and that I shall tell him so in the plainest words that I can use To get his lawyer to write and offer me money He should not have gone to his lawyer I do think he was wrong there But you settled it with him you my mother a price at which he should buy himself off Would he have offered me money if he did not know that he had bound himself to me Nothing on earth would make him marry you I would not for a moment have allowed him to allude to money if that had not been quite certain Who proposed the money first Lady Augustus considered a moment before she answered Upon my word my dear I can t say He wrote the figures on a bit of paper that was the way Then she produced the scrap He wrote the figures first and then I altered them just as you see The proposition came first from him of course And you did not spit at him said Arabella as she tore the scrap into fragments Arabella said the mother it is clear that you do not look into the future How do you mean to live You are getting old Old Yes my love old Of course I am willing to do everything for you as I always have done for so many years but there isn t a man in London who does not know how long you have been about it Hold your tongue mamma said Arabella jumping up That is all very well but the truth has to be spoken You and I cannot go on as we have been doing Certainly not I would sooner be in a workhouse And here there is provided for you an income on which you can live Not a soul will know anything about it Even your own father need not be told As for the lawyer that is nothing They never talk of things It would make a man comparatively poor quite a fit match Or if you do not marry it would enable you to live where you pleased independently of me You had better think twice of it before you refuse it I will not think of it at all As sure as I am living here I will write to Rufford this very evening and tell him in what light I regard both him and you And what will you do then Hang myself That is all very well Arabella but hanging yourself and jumping off Waterloo Bridge do not mean anything You must live and you must pay your debts I can t pay them for you You go into your own room and think of it all and be thankful for what Providence has sent you You may as well understand that I am in earnest the daughter said as she left the room I shall write to Lord Rufford to day and tell him what I think of him and his money You need not trouble yourself as to what shall be done with it for I certainly shall not take it And she did write to Lord Rufford as follows MY LORD I have been much astonished by a letter I have received from a gentleman in London mister Shaw who I presume is your lawyer When I received it I had not as yet seen mamma I now understand that you and she between you have determined that I should be compensated by a sum of money for the injury you have done me I scorn your money I cannot think where you found the audacity to make such a proposal or how you have taught yourself to imagine that I should listen to it As to mamma she was not commissioned to act for me and I have nothing to do with anything she may have said I can hardly believe that she should have agreed to such a proposal It was very little like a gentleman in you to offer it Why did you offer it You would not have proposed to give me a large sum of money like that without some reason I have been shocked to hear that you have denied that you ever engaged yourself to me You know that you were engaged to me It would have been more honest and more manly if you had declared at once that you repented of your engagement But the truth is that till I see you myself and hear what you have to say out of your own mouth I cannot believe what other people tell me I must ask you to name some place where we can meet As for this offer of money it goes for nothing You must have known that I would not take it ARABELLA It was now just the end of February and the visit of the Trefoil ladies to the Connop Greens had to come to an end They had already overstaid the time at first arranged and Lady Augustus when she hinted that another week at Marygold just till this painful affair was finally settled would be beneficial to her was informed that the Connop Greens themselves were about to leave home Lady Augustus had reported to missus Connop Green that Lord Rufford was behaving very badly but that the matter was still in a transition state missus Connop Green was very sorry but So Lady Augustus and Arabella betook themselves to Orchard Street being at that moment unable to enter in upon better quarters What a home it was and what a journey up to town Arabella had told her mother that the letter to Lord Rufford had been written and posted and since that hardly a word had passed between them When they left Marygold in the Connop Green carriage they smiled and shook hands and kissed their friends in unison and then sank back into silence At the station they walked up and down the platform together for the sake of appearance but did not speak In the train there were others with them and they both feigned to be asleep Then they were driven to their lodgings in a cab still speechless It was the mother who first saw that the horror of this if continued would be too great to be endured Arabella she said in a hoarse voice why don t you speak Because I ve got nothing to say That s nonsense There is always something to say You have ruined me mamma just ruined me I did for you the very best I could If you would have been advised by me instead of being ruined you would have had a handsome fortune I have slaved for you for the last twelve years No mother ever sacrificed herself for her child more than I have done for you and now see the return I get I sometimes think that it will kill me That s nonsense Everything I say is nonsense while you tell me one day that you are going to hang yourself and another day that you will drown yourself So I would if I dared What is it that you have brought me to Who will have me in their houses when they hear that you consented to take Lord Rufford s money Nobody will hear it unless you tell them I shall tell my uncle and my aunt and Mistletoe in order that they may know how it is that Lord Rufford has been allowed to escape I say that you have ruined me If it had not been for your vulgar bargain with him he must have been brought to keep his word at last Oh that he should have ever thought it was possible that I was to be bought off for a sum of money Later on in the evening the mother again implored her daughter to speak to her What s the use mamma when you know what we think of each other What s the good of pretending There is nobody here to hear us Later on still she herself began I don t know how much you ve got mamma but whatever it is we d better divide it After what you did in Piccadilly we shall never get on together again There is not enough to divide said Lady Augustus If I had not you to go about with me I could get taken in pretty nearly all the year round Who d take you Leave that to me I would manage it and you could join with some other old person We shall kill each other if we stay like this said Arabella as she took up her candle You have pretty nearly killed me as it is said the old woman as the other shut the door CHAPTER IX CHANGES AT BRAGTON Day after day old missus Morton urged her purpose with her grandson at Bragton not quite directly as she had done at first but by gradual approaches and little soft attempts made in the midst of all the tenderness which as a nurse she was able to display It soon came to pass that the intruders were banished from the house or almost banished Mary s daily visits were discontinued immediately after that last walk home with Reginald Morton which has been described Twice in the course of the next week she went over but on both occasions she did so early in the day and returned alone just as he was reaching the house And then before a week was over early in March Lady Ushant told the invalid that she would be better away missus Morton doesn t like me she said and I had better go But I shall stay for a while at Hoppet Hall and come in and see you from time to time till you get better John Morton replied that he should never get better but though he said so then there was at times evidence that he did not yet quite despond as to himself He could still talk to missus Morton of buying Chowton Farm and was very anxious that he should not be forgotten at the Foreign Office Lady Ushant had herself driven to Hoppet Hall and there took up her residence with her nephew Every other day mister Runciman s fly came for her and carried her backwards and forwards to Bragton On those occasions she would remain an hour with the invalid and then would go back again never even seeing missus Morton though always seen by her And twice after this banishment Reginald walked over But on the second occasion there was a scene missus Morton to whom he had never spoken since he was a boy met him in the hall and told him that his visits only disturbed his sick cousin I certainly will not disturb him Reginald had said In the condition in which he is now he should not see many people rejoined the lady If you will ask doctor Fanning he will tell you the same doctor Fanning was the London doctor who came down once a week whom it was improbable that Reginald should have an opportunity of consulting But he remembered or thought that he remembered that his cousin had been fretful and ill pleased during his last visit and so turned himself round and went home without another word I am afraid there may be I don t know what said Lady Ushant to him in a whisper the next morning What do you mean I don t know what I mean Perhaps I ought not to say a word Only so much does depend on it If you are thinking about the property aunt wipe it out of your mind Let him do what he pleases and don t think about it No one should trouble their minds about such things It is his to do what he pleases with it It is not him that I fear Reginald If he chooses to be guided by her who shall say that he is wrong Get it out of your mind The very thinking about such things is dirtiness The poor old lady submitted to the rebuke and did not dare to say another word Daily Lady Ushant would send over for Mary Masters thinking it cruel that her young friend should leave her alone and yet understanding in part the reason why Mary did not come to her constantly at Hoppet Hall Poor Mary was troubled much by these messages Of course she went now and again She had no alternative but to go and yet feeling that the house was his house she was most unwilling to enter it Then grew within her a feeling which she could not analyse that he had ill used her Of course she was not entitled to his love She would acknowledge to herself over and over again that he had never spoken a word to her which could justify her in expecting his love But why had he not let her alone Why had he striven by his words and his society to make her other than she would have been had she been left to the atmosphere of her stepmother s home Why had he spoken so strongly to her as to that young man s love And then she was almost angry with him because by a turn in the wheel of fortune he was about to become as she thought Squire of Bragton Had he remained simply mister Morton of Hoppet Hall it would still have been impossible But this exaltation of her idol altogether out of her reach was an added injustice She could remember not the person but all the recent memories of the old Squire the veneration with which he was named the masterdom which was attributed to him the unequalled nobility of his position in regard to Dillsborough His successor would be to her as some one crowned and removed by his crown altogether from her world Then she pictured to herself the stately dame who would certainly come and she made fresh resolutions with a sore heart I don t know why you should be so very little with me said Lady Ushant almost whining When I was at Cheltenham you wanted to come to me There are so many things to be done at home And yet you would have come to Cheltenham We were in great trouble then Lady Ushant Of course I would like to be with you You ought not to scold me because you know how I love you Has the young man gone away altogether now Mary Altogether And missus Masters is satisfied She knows it can never be and therefore she is quiet about it I was sorry for that young man because he was so true You couldn t be more sorry than I was Lady Ushant I love him as though he were a brother But Mary dear Mary I fear you are in trouble I think it is all trouble said Mary rushing forward and hiding her face in her old friend s lap as she knelt on the ground before her Lady Ushant longed to ask a question but she did not dare And Mary Masters longed to have one friend to whom she could confide her secret but neither did she dare On the next day very early in the morning there came a note from missus Morton to mister Masters the attorney Could mister Masters come out on that day to Bragton and see missus Morton The note was very particular in saying that missus Morton was to be the person seen The messenger who waited for an answer brought back word that mister Masters would be there at noon The circumstance was one which agitated him considerably as he had not been inside the house at Bragton since the days immediately following the death of the old Squire As it happened Lady Ushant was going to Bragton on the same day and at the suggestion of mister Runciman whose horses in the hunting season barely sufficed for his trade the old lady and the lawyer went together Not a word was said between them as to the cause which took either of them on their journey but they spoke much of the days in which they had known each other when the old Squire was alive and mister Masters thanked Lady Ushant for her kindness to his daughter I love her almost as though she were my own said Lady Ushant When I am dead she will have half of what I have got She will have no right to expect that said the gratified father She will have half or the whole just as Reginald may be situated then I don t know why I shouldn t tell her father what it is I mean to do The attorney knew to a shilling the amount of Lady Ushant s income and thought that this was the best news he had heard for many a day While Lady Ushant was in the sick man s room missus Morton was closeted with the attorney She had thought much of this step before she had dared to take it and even now doubted whether it would avail her anything As she entered the book room in which mister Masters was seated she almost repented But the man was there and she was compelled to go on with her scheme mister Masters she said it is I think a long time since you have been employed by this family A very long time Madam And I have now sent for you under circumstances of great difficulty she answered but as he said nothing she was forced to go on My grandson made his will the other day up in London when he thought that he was going out to Patagonia mister Masters bowed It was done when he was in sound health and he is now not satisfied with it Then there was another bow but not a word was spoken Of course you know that he is very ill We have all been very much grieved to hear it I am sure you would be for the sake of old days When doctor Fanning was last here he thought that my grandson was something better He held out stronger hopes than before But still he is very ill His mind has never wavered for a moment mister Masters Again mister Masters bowed And now he thinks that some changes should be made indeed that there should be a new will Does he wish me to see him missus Morton Not to day I think He is not quite prepared to day But I wanted to ask whether you could come at a moment s notice quite at a moment s notice I thought it better so that you should know why we sent for you if we did send so that you might be prepared It could be done here I suppose It would be possible missus Morton And you could do it Then there was a long pause Altering a will is a very serious thing missus Morton And when it is done on what perhaps may be a death bed it is a very serious thing indeed mister Morton I believe employs a London solicitor I know the firm and more respectable gentlemen do not exist A telegram would bring down one of the firm from London by the next train A frown a very heavy frown came across the old woman s brow She would have repressed it had it been possible but she could not command herself and the frown was there If that had been practicable mister Masters she said we should not have sent for you I was only suggesting madame what might be the best course Exactly And of course I am much obliged But if we are driven to call upon you for your assistance we shall find it Madame said the attorney very slowly it is of course part of my business to make wills and when called upon to do so I perform my business to the best of my ability But in altering a will during illness great care is necessary A codicil might be added A new will would be necessary A new will thought the attorney could only be necessary for altering the disposition of the whole estate He knew enough of the family circumstances to be aware that the property should go to Reginald Morton whether with or without a will and also enough to be aware that this old lady was Reginald s bitter enemy He did not think that he could bring himself to take instructions from a dying man from the Squire of Bragton on his death bed for an instrument which should alienate the property from the proper heir He too had his strong feelings perhaps his prejudices about Bragton I would wish that the task were in other hands missus Morton Why so It is hard to measure the capacity of an invalid His mind is as clear as yours It might be so and yet I might not be able to satisfy myself that it was so I should have to ask long and tedious questions which would be offensive And I should find myself giving advice which would not be called for For instance were your grandson to wish to leave this estate away from the heir I am not discussing his wishes mister Masters I beg your pardon missus Morton for making the suggestion but as I said before I should prefer that he should employ some one else You refuse then If mister Morton were to send for me I should go to him instantly But I fear I might be slow in taking his instructions and it is possible that I might refuse to act on them Then she got up from her chair and bowing to him with stately displeasure left the room All this she had done without any authority from her grandson simply encouraged in her object by his saying in his weakness that he would think of her proposition So intent was she on her business that she was resolved to have everything ready if only he could once be brought to say that Peter Morton should be his heir Having abandoned all hopes for her noble cousin she could tell her conscience that she was instigated simply by an idea of justice Peter Morton was at any rate the legitimate son of a well born father and a well born mother What had she or any one belonging to her to gain by it But forty years since a brat had been born at Bragton in opposition to her wishes by whose means she had been expelled from the place and now it seemed to her to be simple justice that he should on this account be robbed of that which would otherwise be naturally his own As mister Masters would not serve her turn she must write to the London lawyers The thing would be more difficult but nevertheless if the sick man could once be got to say that Peter should be his heir she thought that she could keep him to his word Lady Ushant and mister Masters went back to Dillsborough in Runciman s fly and it need hardly be said that the attorney said nothing of the business which had taken him to Bragton This happened on a Wednesday Wednesday the third of March On Friday morning at four o clock during the darkness of the night John Morton was lying dead on his bed and the old woman was at his bedside She had done her duty by him as far as she knew how in tending him had been assiduous with the diligence of much younger years but now as she sat there having had the fact absolutely announced to her by doctor Nupper her greatest agony arose from the feeling that the roof which covered her probably the chair in which she sat were the property of Reginald Morton Bastard she said to herself between her teeth but she so said it that neither doctor Nupper who was in the room nor the woman who was with her should hear it doctor Nupper took the news into Dillsborough and as the folk sat down to breakfast they all heard that the Squire of Bragton was dead The man had been too little known had been too short a time in the neighbourhood to give occasion for tears There was certainly more of interest than of grief in the matter mister Masters said to himself that the time had been too short for any change in the will and therefore felt tolerably certain that Reginald would be the heir But for some days this opinion was not general in Dillsborough mister Mainwaring had heard that Reginald had been sent away from Bragton with a flea in his ear and was pretty certain that when the will was read it would be found that the property was to go to missus Morton s friends doctor Nupper was of the same opinion There were many in Dillsborough with whom Reginald was not popular and who thought that some man of a different kind would do better as Squire of Bragton He don t know a fox when he sees un said Tony Tuppett to Larry Twentyman whom he had come across the county to call upon and to console CHAPTER X THE WILL On that Saturday the club met at Dillsborough even though the Squire of Bragton had died on Friday morning Through the whole of that Saturday the town had been much exercised in its belief and expressions as to the disposition of the property The town knew very well that mister Masters the attorney had been sent for to Bragton on the previous Wednesday whence the deduction as to a new will made of course under the auspices of missus Morton would have been quite plain to the town had not a portion of the town heard that the attorney had not been for a moment with the dying man during his visit This latter piece of information had come through Lady Ushant who had been in her nephew s bedroom the whole time but Lady Ushant had not much personal communication with the town generally and would probably have said nothing on this subject had not mister Runciman walked up to Hoppet Hall behind the fly after mister Masters had left it and while helping her ladyship out made inquiry as to the condition of things at Bragton generally I was sorry to hear of their sending for any lawyer said mister Runciman Then Lady Ushant protested that the lawyer had not been sent for by her nephew and that her nephew had not even seen him Oh indeed said mister Runciman who immediately took a walk round his own paddock with the object of putting two and two together mister Runciman was a discreet man and did not allow this piece of information to spread itself generally He told doctor Nupper and mister Hampton and Lord Rufford for the hounds went out on Friday though the Squire of Bragton was lying dead but he did not tell mister Mainwaring whom he encountered in the street of the town as he was coming home early and who was very keen to learn whatever news there was Reginald Morton on Friday did not go near Bragton That of course was palpable to all and was a great sign that he himself did not regard himself as the heir He had for awhile been very intimate at the house visiting it daily and during a part of that time the grandmother had been altogether absent Then she had come back and he had discontinued his visits And now he did not even go over to seal up the drawers and to make arrangements as to the funeral He did not at any rate go on the Friday nor on the Saturday And on the Saturday mister Wobytrade the undertaker had received orders from missus Morton to go at once to Bragton All this was felt to be strong against Reginald But when it was discovered that on the Saturday afternoon missus Morton herself had gone up to London not waiting even for the coming of any one else to take possession of the house and that she had again carried all her own personal luggage with her then opinion in Dillsborough again veered Upon the whole the betting was a point or two in favour of Reginald when the club met missus Masters who had been much quelled of late had been urgent with her husband to go over to the Bush but he was unwilling he said to be making jolly while the Squire of Bragton was lying unburied He was nothing to you Gregory said his wife who had in vain endeavoured to learn from him why he had been summoned to Bragton You will hear something over there and it will relieve your spirits So instigated he did go across and found all the accustomed members of the club congregated in the room Even Larry Twentyman was present who of late had kept himself aloof from all such meetings Both the Botseys were there and Nupper and Harry Stubbings and Ribbs the butcher Runciman himself of course was in the room and he had introduced on this occasion Captain Glomax the master of the hunt who was staying at his house that night perhaps with a view to hunting duties on the Monday perhaps in order that he might hear something as to the Bragton property It had already been suggested to him that he might possibly hire the house for a year or two at little more than a nominal rent that the old kennels might be resuscitated and that such arrangements would be in all respects convenient He was the master of the hunt and of course there was no difficulty as to introducing him to the club Captain Glomax was speaking in a somewhat dictatorial voice as becomes a Master of Hounds when in the field though perhaps it should be dropped afterwards when the Attorney entered There was a sudden rise of voices striving to interrupt the Captain as it was felt by them all that mister Masters must be in possession of information but the Captain himself went on Of course it is the place for the hounds Nobody can doubt that who knows the country and understands the working of it The hunt ought to have subscribed and hired the kennels and stables permanently There would have wanted two to that bargain Captain said mister Runciman Of course there would but what would you think of a man who would refuse such a proposition when he didn t want the place himself Do you think if I d been there foxes would have been poisoned in Dillsborough wood I d have had that fellow Goarly under my thumb Then you d have had an awful blackguard under your thumb Captain Glomax said Larry who could not restrain his wrath when Goarly s name was mentioned What does that matter if you get foxes continued the Master But the fact is gentlemen in a county like this always want to have everything done for them and never to do anything for themselves I m sick of it I know Nobody is fonder of hunting a country than I am and I think I know what I m about That you do said Fred Botsey who like most men was always ready to flatter the Master And I don t care how hard I work From the first of August till the end of May I never have a day to myself what with cubbing and then the season and entering the young hounds and buying and selling horses by George I m at it the whole year A Master of Hounds looks for that Captain said the innkeeper Looks for it Yes he must look for it But I wouldn t mind that if I could get gentlemen to pull a little with me I can t stand being out of pocket as I have been and so I must let them know If the country would get the kennels and the stables and lay out a few pounds so that horses and hounds and men could go into them I wouldn t mind having a shot for the house It s killing work where I am now the other side of Rufford you may say Then he stopped but no one would undertake to answer him The meaning of it was that Captain Glomax wanted Lfive hundred a year more than he received and every one there knew that there was not Lfive hundred a year more to be got out of the country unless Lord Rufford would put his hand into his pocket Now the present stables and the present kennels had been made comfortable by Lord Rufford and it was not thought probable that he would pay for the move to Bragton When s the funeral to be mister Masters asked Runciman who knew very well the day fixed but who thought it well to get back to the subject of real interest in the town Next Thursday I m told There s no hurry with weather like this said Nupper professionally They can t open the will till the late squire is buried continued the innkeeper and there will be one or two very anxious to know what is in it I suppose it will all go to the man who lives up here at Hoppet Hall said the Captain a man that was never outside a horse in his life He s not a bad fellow said Runciman He is a very good fellow said the Attorney and I trust he may have the property If it be left away from him I for one shall think that a great injustice has been done This was listened to with attention as every one there thought that mister Masters must know I can t understand said Glomax how any man can be considered a good fellow as a country gentleman who does not care for sport Just look at it all round Suppose others were like him what would become of us all Yes indeed what would become of us asked the two Botseys in a breath Ho d ire our orses Runciman suggested Harry Stubbings with a laugh Think what England would be said the Captain When I hear of a country gentleman sticking to books and all that I feel that the glory is departing from the land Where are the sinews of war to come from That s what I want to know Who will it be mister Masters if the gent don t get it asked Ribbs from his corner on the sofa This was felt to be a pushing question How am I to know mister Ribbs said the Attorney I didn t make the late squire s will and if I did you don t suppose I should tell you I m told that the next is Peter Morton said Fred Botsey He s something in a public office up in London It won t go to him said Fred s brother That old lady has relations of her own who have had their mouths open for the last forty years Away from the Mortons altogether said Harry That would be an awful shame I don t see what good the Mortons have done this last half century said the Captain You don t remember the old squire Captain said the innkeeper and I don t remember him well Indeed I was only a little chap when they buried him But there s that feeling left behind him to this day that not a poor man in the country wouldn t be sorry to think that there wasn t a Morton left among em Of course a hunting gentleman is a good thing About the best thing out said the Captain But a hunting gentleman isn t everything I know nothing of the old lady s people only this that none of their money ever came into Dillsborough I m all for Reginald Morton He s my landlord as it is and he s a gentleman I hate foreigners coming said Ribbs E ain t too old to take it yet said Harry Fred Botsey declared that he didn t believe in men hunting unless they began young Whereupon doctor Nupper declared that he had never ridden over a fence till he was forty five and that he was ready now to ride Fred across country for a new hat Larry suggested that a man might be a good friend to sport though he didn t ride much himself and Runciman again asserted that hunting wasn t everything Upon the whole Reginald was the favourite But the occasion was so special that a little supper was ordered and I fear the attorney did not get home till after twelve Till the news reached Hoppet Hall that missus Morton had taken herself off to London there was great doubt there as to what ought to be done and even then the difficulty was not altogether over Till she was gone neither Lady Ushant nor her nephew would go there and he could only declare his purpose of attending the funeral whether he were asked or not When his aunt again spoke of the will he desired her with much emphasis not to allude to the subject If the property is to come to me he said anything of good that may be in it cannot be much sweeter by anticipation And if it is not I shall only encourage disappointment by thinking of it But it would be such a shame That I deny altogether It was his own to do as he liked with it Had he married I should not have expected it because I am the heir But if you please aunt do not say a word more about it On the Sunday morning he heard that missus Morton was gone to London and then he walked over to Bragton He found that she had locked and sealed up everything with so much precision that she must have worked hard at the task from the hour of his death almost to that of her departure She never rested herself all day said missus Hopkins till I thought she would sink from very weariness She had gone into every room and opened every drawer and had had every piece of plate through her fingers and then missus Hopkins told him that just as she was departing she had said that the keys would be given to the lawyer After that he wandered about the place thinking what his life would be should he find himself the owner of Bragton At this moment he almost felt that he disliked the place though there had been times in which he had thought that he loved it too well Of one thing he was conscious that if Bragton should become his it would be his duty to live there He must move his books and pipes and other household gods from Hoppet Hall and become an English Squire Would it be too late for him to learn to ride to hounds Would it be possible that he should ever succeed in shooting a pheasant if he were to study the art patiently Could he interest himself as to the prevalence or decadence of ground game And what must he do with his neighbours Of course he would have to entertain mister Mainwaring and the other parsons and perhaps once in the year to ask Lord Rufford to dine with him If Lord Rufford came what on earth would he say to him And then there arose another question Would it not be his duty to marry and if so whom He had been distinctly told that Mary Masters had given her heart to some one and he certainly was not the man to ask for the hand of a girl who had not a heart to give And yet he thought that it would be impossible that he should marry any other person He spent hours in walking about the grounds looking at the garden and belongings which would so probably be his own within a week and thinking whether it would be possible that he should bring a mistress to preside over them Before he reached home he had made up his mind that only one mistress would be possible and that she was beyond his reach On the Tuesday he received a scrawl from missus Hopkins with a letter from the lawyer addressed to her The lawyer wrote to say that he would be down on Wednesday evening would attend the funeral and read his client s will after they had performed the ceremony He went on to add that in obedience to missus Morton s directions he had invited mister Peter Morton to be present on the occasion On the Wednesday Reginald again went over but left before the arrival of the two gentlemen On the Thursday he was there early and of course took upon himself the duty of chief mourner Peter Morton was there and showed in a bewildered way that he had been summoned rather to the opening of the will than to the funeral of a man he had never seen Then the will was read There were only two names mentioned in it John Morton left Lfive thousand and his watch and chain and rings to Arabella Trefoil and everything else of which he was possessed to his cousin Reginald Morton Upon my word I don t know why they sent for me said the other cousin Peter missus Morton seemed to think that you would like to pay a tribute of respect said the lawyer Peter looked at him and went upstairs and packed his portmanteau The lawyer handed over the keys to the new squire and then everything was done CHAPTER XI THE NEW MINISTER Poor old Paragon exclaimed Archibald Currie as he stood with his back to the fire among his colleagues at the Foreign Office on the day after John Morton s death Poor young Paragon that s the pity of it said Mounser Green I don t suppose he was turned thirty and he was a useful man a very useful man That s the worst of it He was just one of those men that the country can t afford to lose and whom it is so very hard to replace Mounser Green was always eloquent as to the needs of the public service and did really in his heart of hearts care about his office Who is to go to Patagonia I m sure I don t know Platitude was asking me about it and I told him that I couldn t name a man Old Platitude always thinks that the world is coming to an end said Currie There are as good fish in the sea as ever were caught Who is there Monsoon won t go even if they ask him The Paragon was just the fellow for it He had his heart in the work An immense deal depends on what sort of man we have in Patagonia at the present moment If Paraguay gets the better of the Patagonese all Brazil will be in a ferment and you know how that kind of thing spreads among half caste Spaniards and Portuguese Nobody can interfere but the British Minister When I suggested Morton I knew I had the right man if he d only take it And now he has gone and died said Hoffmann And now he has gone and died continued Mounser Green I never nursed a dear gazelle and all the rest of it Poor Paragon I fear he was a little cut about Miss Trefoil She was down with him the day before he died said young Glossop I happen to know that It was before he thought of going to Patagonia that she was at Bragton said Currie That s all you know about it old fellow said the indignant young one She was there a second time just before his death I had it from Lady Penwether who was in the neighbourhood My dear little boy said Mounser Green that was exactly what was likely to happen and he yet may have broken his heart I have seen a good deal of the lady lately and under no circumstances would she have married him When he accepted the mission that at any rate was all over The Rufford affair had begun before that said Hoffmann The Rufford affair as you call it said Glossop was no affair at all What do you mean by that asked Currie I mean that Rufford was never engaged to her not for an instant said the lad urgent in spreading the lesson which he had received from his cousin It was all a dead take in Who was taken in asked Mounser Green Well nobody was taken in as it happened But I suppose there can t be a doubt that she tried her best to catch him and that the Duke and Duchess and Mistletoe and old Trefoil all backed her up It was a regular plant The only thing is it didn t come off Look here young shaver this was Mounser Green again when you speak of a young lady do you be a little more discreet But didn t she do it Green That s more than you or I can tell If you want to know what I think I believe he paid her a great deal of attention and then behaved very badly to her He didn t behave badly at all said young Glossop My dear boy when you are as old as I am you will have learned how very hard it is to know everything I only say what I believe and perhaps I may have better ground for believing than you He certainly paid her a great deal of attention and then her friends especially the Duchess went to work They ve wanted to get her off their hands these six or eight years said Currie That s nonsense again continued the new advocate for there is no doubt she might have married Morton all the time had she pleased Yes but Rufford a fellow with sixty thousand a year said Glossop About a third of that would be nearer the mark Glossy Take my word for it you don t know everything yet though you have so many advantages After that Mounser Green retreated to his own room with a look and tone as though he were angry What makes him so ferocious about it asked Glossop when the door was shut You are always putting your foot in it said Currie I kept on winking to you but it was no good He sees her almost every day now She s staying with old missus Green in Portugal Street There has been some break up between her and her mother and old missus Green has taken her in There s some sort of relationship Mounser is the old woman s nephew and she is aunt by marriage to the Connop Greens down in Hampshire and missus Connop Green is first cousin to Lady Augustus If Dick s sister married Tom s brother what relation would Dick be to Tom s mother That s the kind of thing isn t it suggested Hoffmann At any rate there she is and Mounser sees her every day It don t make any difference about Rufford said young Glossop stoutly All this happened before the will had been declared when Arabella did not dream that she was an heiress A day or two afterwards she received a letter from the lawyer telling her of her good fortune and informing her that the trinkets would be given up to her and the money paid short of legacy duty whenever she would fix a time and place The news almost stunned her There was a moment in which she thought that she was bound to reject this money as she had rejected that tendered to her by the other man Poor as she was greedy as she was alive as she was to the necessity of doing something for herself still this legacy was to her at first bitter rather than sweet She had never treated any man so ill as she had treated this man and it was thus that he punished her She was alive to the feeling that he had always been true to her In her intercourse with other men there had been generally a battle carried on with some fairness Diamond had striven to cut diamond But here the dishonesty had all been on one side and she was aware that it had been so In her later affair with Lord Rufford she really did think that she had been ill used but she was quite alive to the fact that her treatment of John Morton had been abominable The one man in order that he might escape without further trouble had in the grossest manner sent to her the offer of a bribe The other in regard to whose end her hard heart was touched even her conscience seared had named her in his will as though his affection was unimpaired Of course she took the money but she took it with inward groans She took the money and the trinkets and the matter was all arranged for her by Mounser Green So after all the Paragon left her whatever he could leave said Currie in the same room at the Foreign Office A week had passed since the last conversation and at this moment Mounser Green was not in the room Oh dear no said young Glossy She doesn t have Bragton That goes to his cousin That was entailed Glossy my boy Not a bit of it Everybody thought he would leave the place to another Morton a fellow he d never seen in one of those Somerset House Offices He and this fellow who is to have it were enemies but he wouldn t put it out of the right line It s all very well for Mounser to be down on me but I do happen to know what goes on in that country She gets a pot of money and no end of family jewels but he didn t leave her the estate as he might have done At that moment Mounser Green came into the room It was rather later than usual being past one o clock and he looked as though he were flurried He didn t speak for a few minutes but stood before the fire smoking a cigar And there was a general silence there being now a feeling among them that Arabella Trefoil was not to be talked about in the old way before Mounser Green At last he spoke himself I suppose you haven t heard who is to go to Patagonia after all Is it settled asked Currie Anybody we know asked Hoffmann I hope it s no d outsider said the too energetic Glossop It is settled and it is somebody you know and it is not a d outsider unless indeed he may be considered to be an outsider in reference to that branch of the service It s some consul said Currie Backstairs from Panama I ll bet a crown It isn t Backstairs it isn t a consul Gentlemen get out your pocket handkerchiefs Mounser Green has consented to be expatriated for the good of his country You going to Patagonia said Currie You re chaffing said Glossop I never was so shot in my life said Hoffmann It s true my dear boys I never was so sorry for anything in all my born days said Glossop almost crying Why on earth should you go to Patagonia Patagonia ejaculated Currie What will you do in Patagonia It s an opening my dear fellow said Mounser Green leaning affectionately on Glossop s shoulder What should I do by remaining here When Drummond asked me I saw he wanted me to go They don t forget that kind of thing At that moment a messenger opened the door and the Senator Gotobed almost without being announced entered the room He had become so intimate of late at the Foreign Office and his visits were so frequent that he was almost able to dispense with the assistance of any messenger Perhaps Mounser Green and his colleagues were a little tired of him but yet after their fashion they were always civil to him and remembered as they were bound to do that he was one of the leading politicians of a great nation I have secured the hall he said at once as though aware that no news could be so important as the news he thus conveyed Have you indeed said Currie Secured it for the fifteenth Now the question is What do you think said Glossop interrupting him without the slightest hesitation Mounser Green is going to Patagonia in place of the poor Paragon I beg to congratulate mister Green with all my heart By George I don t said the juvenile clerk Fancy congratulating a fellow on going to Patagonia It s what I call an awful sell for everybody But as I was saying I have the hall for the fifteenth You mean to lecture then after all said Green Certainly I do I am not going to be deterred from doing my duty because I am told there is a little danger What I want to know is whether I can depend on having a staff of policemen Of course there will be police said Green But I mean some extra strength I don t mind for myself but I should be so unhappy if there were anything of a commotion Then he was assured that the officers of the police force would look to that and was assured also that Mounser Green and the other gentlemen in the room would certainly attend the lecture I don t suppose I shall be gone by that time said Mounser Green in a melancholy tone of voice CHAPTER XII I MUST GO Rufford March fifth MY DEAR MISS TREFOIL I am indeed sorry that I should have offended you by acceding to a suggestion which I think I may say originated with your mother When she told me that her circumstances and yours were not in a pecuniary point of view so comfortable as they might be I did feel that it was in my power to alleviate that trouble The sum of money mentioned by my lawyer was certainly named by your mother At any rate pray believe that I meant to be of service As to naming a place where we might meet it really could be of no service It would be painful to both of us and could have no good result Again apologizing for having inadvertently offended you by adopting the views which Lady Augustus entertained I beg to assure you that I am Yours faithfully RUFFORD This letter came from the peer himself without assistance After his interview with Lady Augustus he simply told his Mentor Sir George that he had steadfastly denied the existence of any engagement not daring to acquaint him with the offer he had made Neither therefore could he tell Sir George of the manner in which the young lady had repudiated the offer That she should have repudiated it was no doubt to her credit As he thought of it afterwards he felt that had she accepted it she would have been base indeed And yet as he thought of what had taken place at the house in Piccadilly he was confident that the proposition had in some way come from her mother No doubt he had first written a sum of money on the fragment of paper which she had preserved and the evidence would so far go against him But Lady Augustus had spoken piteously of their joint poverty and had done so in lieu of insisting with a mother s indignation on her daughter s rights Of course she had intended to ask for money What other purpose could she have had It was so he had argued at the moment and so he had argued since If it were so he would not admit that he had behaved unlike a gentleman in offering the money Yet he did not dare to tell Sir George and therefore was obliged to answer Arabella s letter without assistance He was not altogether sorry to have his Leight thousand being fully as much alive to the value of money as any brother peer in the kingdom but he would sooner have paid the money than be subject to an additional interview He had been forced up to London to see first the father and then the mother and thought that he had paid penalty enough for any offence that he might have committed An additional interview with the young lady herself would distress him beyond anything would be worse than any other interview He would sooner leave Rufford and go abroad than encounter it He promised himself that nothing should induce him to encounter it Therefore he wrote the above letter Arabella when she received it had ceased to care very much about the insult of the offer She had then quarrelled with her mother and had insisted on some separation even without any arrangement as to funds Requiring some confidant she had told a great deal though not quite all to missus Connop Green and that lady had passed her on for a while to her husband s aunt in London At this time she had heard nothing of John Morton s will and had perhaps thought with some tender regret of the munificence of her other lover which she had scorned But she was still intent on doing something The fury of her despair was still on her so that she could not weigh the injury she might do herself against some possible gratification to her wounded spirit Up to this moment she had formed no future hope At this epoch she had no string to her bow John Morton was dead and she had absolutely wept for him in solitude though she had certainly never loved him Nor did she love Lord Rufford As far as she knew how to define her feelings she thought that she hated him But she told herself hourly that she had not done with him She was instigated by the true feminine Medea feeling that she would find some way to wring his heart even though in the process she might suffer twice as much as he did She had convinced herself that in this instance he was the offender Painful to both of us No doubt But because it would be painful to him it should be exacted Though he was a coward and would fain shirk such pain she could be brave enough Even though she should be driven to catch him by the arm in the open street she would have it out with him He was a liar and a coward and she would at any rate have the satisfaction of telling him so She thought much about it before she could resolve on what she would do She could not ask old missus Green to help her missus Green was a kind old woman who had lived much in the world and would wish to see much of it still had age allowed her Arabella Trefoil was at any rate the niece of a Duke and the Duke in this affair with Lord Rufford had taken his niece s part She opened her house and as much of her heart as was left to Arabella and was ready to mourn with her over the wicked lord She could sympathise with her too as to the iniquities of her mother whom none of the Greens loved But she would have been frightened by any proposition as to Medean vengeance In these days still winter days and not open to much feminine gaiety in London even if in the present constitution of her circumstances gaiety would have come in her way in these days the hours in her life which interested her most were those in which mister Mounser Green was dutifully respectful to his aunt Patagonia had not yet presented itself to him Some four or five hundred a year which the old lady had at her own disposal had for years past contributed to Mounser s ideas of duty And now Arabella s presence at the small house in Portugal Street certainly added a new zest to those ideas The niece of the Duke of Mayfair and the rejected of Lord Rufford was at the present moment an interesting young woman in Mounser Green s world There were many who thought that she had been ill used Had she succeeded all the world would have pitied Lord Rufford but as he had escaped there was a strong party for the lady And gradually Mounser Green who some weeks ago had not thought very much of her became one of the party She had brought her maid with her and when she found that Mounser Green came to the house every evening either before or after dinner she had recourse to her accustomed lures She would sit quiet dejected almost broken hearted in the corner of a sofa but when he spoke to her she would come to life and raise her eyes not ignoring the recognised dejection of her jilted position not pretending to this minor stag of six tines that she was a sprightly unwooed young fawn fresh out of the forest almost asking him to weep with her and playing her accustomed lures though in a part which she had not hitherto filled But still she was resolved that her Jason should not as yet be quit of his Medea So she made her plot She would herself go down to Rufford and force her way into her late lover s presence in spite of all obstacles It was possible that she should do this and get back to London the same day but to do so she must leave London by an early train at seven A M stay seven or eight hours at Rufford and reach the London station at ten P M For such a journey there must be some valid excuse made to missus Green There must be some necessity shown for such a journey She would declare that a meeting was necessary with her mother and that her mother was at any town she chose to name at the requisite distance from London In this way she might start with her maid before daylight and get back after dark and have the meeting with her mother or with Lord Rufford as the case might be But Mounser Green knew very well that Lady Augustus was in Orchard Street and knew also that Arabella was determined not to see her mother And if she declared her purpose without a caution to Mounser Green the old woman would tell her nephew and the nephew would unwittingly expose the deceit It was necessary therefore that she should admit Mounser Green to at any rate half a confidence This she did Don t ask me any questions she said I know I can trust you I must be out of town the whole day and perhaps the next And your aunt must not know why I am going or where You will help me Of course he said that he would help her and the lie with a vast accompaniment of little lies was told There must be a meeting on business matters between her and her mother and her mother was now in the neighbourhood of Birmingham This was the lie told to missus Green She would go down and if possible be back on the same day She would take her maid with her She thought that in such a matter as that she could trust her maid and was in truth afraid to travel alone I will come in the morning and take Miss Trefoil to the station said Mounser and will meet her in the evening And so the matter was arranged The journey was not without its drawbacks and almost its perils Summer or winter Arabella Trefoil was seldom out of bed before nine It was incumbent on her now to get up on a cold March morning when the lion had not as yet made way for the lamb at half past five That itself seemed to be all but impossible to her Nevertheless she was ready and had tried to swallow half a cup of tea when Mounser Green came to the door with a cab a little after six She had endeavoured to dispense with this new friend s attendance but he had insisted assuring her that without some such aid no cab would be forthcoming She had not told him and did not intend that he should know to what station she was going You begged me to ask no questions he said when he was in the cab with her the maid having been induced most unwillingly to seat herself with the cabman on the box and I have obeyed you But I wish I knew how I could help you You have helped me and you are helping me But do not ask anything more Will you be angry with me if I say that I fear you are intending something rash Of course I am How could it be otherwise with me Don t you think there are turns in a person s life when she must do something rash Think of yourself If everybody crushed you if you were ill treated beyond all belief if the very people who ought to trust you doubted you wouldn t you turn upon somebody and rend him Are you going to rend anybody I do not know as yet I wish you would let me go down with you No that you certainly cannot You must not come even into the station with me You have been very good to me You will not now turn against me I certainly will do nothing but what you tell me Then here we are and now you must go Jane can carry my hand bag and cloak If you choose to come in the evening at ten it will be an additional favour I certainly will do so But Miss Trefoil one word They were now standing under cover of the portico in front of the railway station into which he was not to be allowed to enter What I fear is this that in your first anger you may be tempted to do something which may be injurious to to your prospects in life I have no prospects in life mister Green Ah that is just it There are for most of us moments of unhappiness in which we are tempted by our misery to think that we are relieved at any rate from the burden of caution because nothing that can occur to us can make us worse than we are Nothing can make me worse than I am But in a few months or weeks continued Mounser Green bringing up in his benevolence all the wisdom of his experience we have got a new footing amidst our troubles and then we may find how terrible is the injury which our own indiscretion has brought on us I do not want to ask any questions but it might be so much better that you should abandon your intention and go back with me She seemed to be almost undecided for a moment as she thought over his words But she remembered her pledge to herself that Lord Rufford should find that she had not done with him yet I must go she said in a hoarse voice If you must I must go I have no way out of it Good bye mister Green I cannot tell you how much obliged to you I am Then he turned back and she went into the station and took two first class tickets for Rufford At that moment Lord Rufford was turning himself comfortably in his bed How would he have sprung up and how would he have fled had he known the evil that was coming upon him This happened on a Thursday a day on which as Arabella knew the U R U did not go out the very Thursday on which John Morton was buried and the will was read at Bragton She was fully determined to speak her mind to the man and to be checked by no feminine squeamishness She would speak her mind to him if she could force her way into his presence And in doing this she would be debarred by no etiquette It might be that she would fail that he would lack the courage to see her and would run away even before all his servants when he should hear who was standing in his hall But if he did so she would try again even though she should have to ride out into the hunting field after him Face to face she would tell him that he was a liar and a slanderer and no gentleman though she should have to run round the world to catch him When she reached Rufford she went to the town and ordered breakfast and a carriage As soon as she had eaten the meal she desired the driver in a clear voice to take her to Rufford Hall Was her maid to go with her No She would be back soon and her maid would wait there till she had returned CHAPTER XIII IN THE PARK This thing that she was doing required an infinite amount of pluck of that sort of hardihood which we may not quite call courage but which in a world well provided with policemen is infinitely more useful than courage Lord Rufford himself was endowed with all the ordinary bravery of an Englishman but he could have flown as soon as run into a lion s den as Arabella was doing She had learned that Lady Penwether and Miss Penge were both at Rufford Hall and understood well the difficulty there would be in explaining her conduct should she find herself in their presence And there were all the servants there to stare at her and the probability that she might be shown to the door and told that no one there would speak to her She saw it all before her and knew how bitter it might be but her heart was big enough to carry her through it She was dressed very simply but still by no means dowdily in a black silk dress and though she wore a thick veil when she got out of the fly and rang the door bell she had been at some pains with her hair before she left the inn Her purpose was revenge but still she had an eye to the possible chance the chance barely possible of bringing the man to submit When the door was opened she raised her veil and asked for Lord Rufford but as she did so she walked on through the broad passage which led from the front door into a wide central space which they called the billiard room but which really was the hall of the house This she did as a manifesto that she did not mean to leave the house because she might be told that he was out or could not be seen or that he was engaged It was then nearly one o clock and no doubt he would be there for luncheon Of course he might be in truth away from home but she must do her best to judge of that by the servant s manner The man knew her well and not improbably had heard something of his master s danger He was however very respectful and told her that his lordship was out in the grounds but that Lady Penwether was in the drawing room Then a sudden thought struck her and she asked the man whether he would show her in what part of the grounds she might find Lord Rufford Upon that he took her to the front door and pointing across the park to a belt of trees showed her three or four men standing round some piece of work He believed he said that one of those men was his lordship She bowed her thanks and was descending the steps on her way to join the group when whom should she see but Lady Penwether coming into the house with her garden hat and gloves It was unfortunate but she would not allow herself to be stopped by Lady Penwether She bowed stiffly and would have passed on without a word but that was impossible Miss Trefoil said Lady Penwether with astonishment Your brother is just across the park I think I see him and will go to him I had better send and tell him that you are here said her ladyship I need not trouble you so far I can be my own messenger Perhaps you will allow the fly to be sent round to the yard for half an hour As she said this she was still passing down the steps But Lady Penwether knew that it behoved her to prevent this if it might be possible Of late she had had little or no conversation with her brother about Miss Trefoil but she had heard much from her husband She would be justified she thought in saying or in doing almost anything which would save him from such an encounter I really think she said that he had better be told that you are here and as she spoke she strove to put herself in the visitor s way You had better come in Miss Trefoil and he shall be informed at once By no means Lady Penwether I would not for worlds give him or you so much trouble I see him and I will go to him Then Lady Penwether absolutely put out her hand to detain her but Arabella shook it off angrily and looked into the other woman s face with fierce eyes Allow me she said to conduct myself at this moment as I may think best I shall do so at any rate Then she stalked on and Lady Penwether saw that any contest was hopeless Had she sent the servant on with all his speed so as to gain three or four moments her brother could hardly have fled through the trees in face of the enemy Lord Rufford who was busy planning the prolongation of a ha ha fence saw nothing of all this but after a while he was aware that a woman was coming to him and then gradually he saw who that woman was Arabella when she had found herself advancing closer went slowly enough She was sure of her prey now and was wisely mindful that it might be well that she should husband her breath The nearer she drew to him the slower became her pace and more majestic Her veil was well thrown back and her head was raised in the air She knew these little tricks of deportment and could carry herself like a queen He had taken a moment or two to consider Should he fly It was possible He might vault over a railed fence in among the trees at a spot not ten yards from her and then it would be impossible that she should run him down He might have done it had not the men been there to see it As it was he left them in the other direction and came forward to meet her He tried to smile pleasantly as he spoke to her So I see that you would not take my advice he said Neither your advice nor your money my lord Ah I was so sorry about that But indeed indeed the fault was not mine They were your figures that I saw upon the paper and by your orders no doubt that the lawyer acted But I have not come to say much of that You meant I suppose to be gracious I meant to be goodnatured I daresay You were willing enough to give away what you did not want But there must be more between us than any question of money Lord Rufford you have treated me most shamefully I hope not I think not And you yourself must be well aware of it quite as well aware of it as I am You have thrown me over and absolutely destroyed me and why He shrugged his shoulders Because you have been afraid of others because your sister has told you that you were mistaken in your choice The women around you have been too many for you and have not allowed you to dispose of your hand and your name and your property as you pleased I defy you to say that this was not your sister s doing He was too much astounded to contradict her rapidly and then she passed on not choosing to give him time for contradiction Will you have the hardihood to say that you did not love me Then she paused thinking that he would not dare to contradict her then feeling that in that she was on strong ground Were you lying when you told me that you did What did you mean when I was in your arms up in the house there What did you intend me to think that you meant Then she stopped standing well in front of him and looking fixedly into his face This was the very thing that he had feared Lord Augustus had been a trouble The Duke s letter had been a trouble Lady Augustus had been a trouble and Sir George s sermons had been troublesome But what were they all when compared to this How is it possible that a man should tell a girl that he has not loved her when he has embraced her again and again He may know it and she may know it and each may know that the other knows it but to say that he does not and did not then love her is beyond the scope of his audacity unless he be a heartless Nero No one can grieve about this so much as I do he said weakly Cannot I grieve more do you think I who told all my relatives that I was to become your wife and was justified in so telling them Was I not justified I think not You think not What did you mean then What were you thinking of when we were coming back in the carriage from Stamford when with your arms round me you swore that you loved me better than all the world Is that true Did you so swear What a question for a man to have to answer It was becoming clear to him that there was nothing for him but to endure and be silent Even to this interview the gods would at last give an end The hour would pass though alas so slowly and she could not expect that he should stand there to be rated much after the accustomed time for feeding You acknowledge that and do you dare to say that I had no right to tell my friends There was a moment in which he thought it was almost a pity that he had not married her She was very beautiful in her present form more beautiful he thought than ever She was the niece of a Duke and certainly a very clever woman He had not wanted money and why shouldn t he have married her As for hunting him that was a matter of course He was as much born and bred to be hunted as a fox He could not do it now as he had put too much power into the hands of the Penwethers but he almost wished that he had I never intended it he said What did you intend After what has occurred I suppose I have a right to ask such a question I have made a somewhat unpleasant journey to day all alone on purpose to ask that question What did you intend In his great annoyance he struck his shovel angrily against the ground And I will not leave you till I get an answer to the question What did you intend Lord Rufford There was nothing for him but silence and a gradual progress back towards the house But from the latter resource she cut him off for a time You will do me the favour to remain with me here till this conversation is ended You cannot refuse me so slight a request as that seeing the trouble to which you have put me I never saw a man so forgetful of words You cannot speak Have you no excuse to offer not a word to say in explanation of conduct so black that I don t think here in England I ever heard a case to equal it If your sister had been treated so It would have been impossible I believe it Her cautious nature would have trusted no man as I trusted you Her lips doubtless were never unfrozen till the settlements had been signed With her it was a matter of bargain not of love I can well believe that I will not talk about my sister It seems to me Lord Rufford that you object to talk about anything You certainly have been very uncommunicative with reference to yourself Were you lying when you told me that you loved me No Did I lie when I told the Duchess that you had promised me your love Did I lie when I told my mother that in these days a man does not always mention marriage when he asks a girl to be his wife You said you loved me and I believed you and the rest was a thing of course And you meant it You know you meant it When you held me in your arms in the carriage you know you meant me to suppose that it would always be so Then the fear of your sister came upon you and of your sister s husband and you ran away I wonder whether you think yourself a man And yet she felt that she had not hit him yet He was wretched enough and she could see that he was wretched but the wretchedness would pass away as soon as she was gone How could she stab him so that the wound would remain With what virus could she poison her arrow so that the agony might be prolonged And such a coward too I began to suspect it when you started that night from Mistletoe though I did not think then that you could be all mean all cowardly From that day to this you have not dared to speak a word of truth Every word has been a falsehood By heavens no Every word a falsehood and I a lady a lady whom you have so deeply injured whose cruel injury even you have not the face to deny am forced by your cowardice to come to you here because you have not dared to come out to meet me Is that true What good can it do None to me God knows You are such a thing that I would not have you now I know you though you were twice Lord Rufford But I have chosen to speak my mind to you and to tell you what I think Did you suppose that when I said I would meet you face to face I was to be deterred by such girl s excuses as you made I chose to tell you to your face that you are false a coward and no gentleman and though you had hidden yourself under the very earth I would have found you Then she turned round and saw Sir George Penwether standing close to them Lord Rufford had seen him approaching for some time and had made one or two futile attempts to meet him Arabella s back had been turned to the house and she had not heard the steps or observed the direction of her companion s eyes He came so near before he was seen that he heard her concluding words Then Lord Rufford with a ghastly attempt at pleasantry introduced them George he said I do not think you know Miss Trefoil Sir George Penwether Miss Trefoil The interview had been watched from the house and the husband had been sent down by his wife to mitigate the purgatory which she knew that her brother must be enduring My wife said Sir George has sent me to ask Miss Trefoil whether she will not come into lunch I believe it is Lord Rufford s house said Arabella If Miss Trefoil s frame of mind will allow her to sit at table with me I shall be proud to see her said Lord Rufford Miss Trefoil s frame of mind will not allow her to eat or to drink with such a dastard said she turning away in the direction of the park gates Perhaps Sir George you will be kind enough to direct the man who brought me here to pick me up at the lodge And so she walked away a mile across the park neither of them caring to follow her It seemed to her as she stood at the lodge gate having obstinately refused to enter the house to be an eternity before the fly came to her When it did come she felt as though her strength would barely enable her to climb into it And when she was there she wept with bitter throbbing woe all the way to Rufford It was over now at any rate Now there was not a possible chance on which a gleam of hope might be made to settle And how handsome he was and how beautiful the place and how perfect would have been the triumph could she have achieved it One more word one other pressure of the hand in the post chaise might have done it Had he really promised her marriage she did not even now think that he would have gone back from his word If that heavy stupid duke would have spoken to him that night at Mistletoe all would have been well But now now there was nothing for her but weeping and gnashing of teeth He was gone and poor Morton was gone and all those others whose memories rose like ghosts before her they were all gone And she wept as she thought that she might perhaps have made a better use of the gifts which Providence had put in her way When Mounser Green met her at the station she was beyond measure weary Through the whole journey she had been struggling to restrain her sobs so that her maid should neither hear nor see them Don t mind me mister Green I am only tired so tired she said as she got into the carriage which he had brought He had with him a long formal looking letter addressed to herself But she was too weary to open it that night It was the letter conveying the tidings of the legacy which Morton had made in her favour CHAPTER XIV LORD RUFFORD S MODEL FARM At this time Senator Gotobed was paying a second visit to Rufford Hall In the matter of Goarly and Scrobby he had never given way an inch He was still strongly of opinion that a gentleman s pheasants had no right to eat his neighbour s corn and that if damage were admitted the person committing the injury should not take upon himself to assess the damage He also thought and very often declared his thoughts that Goarly was justified in shooting not only foxes but hounds also when they came upon his property and in moments of excitement had gone so far as to say that not even horses should be held sacred He had however lately been driven to admit that Goarly himself was not all that a man should be and that missus Goarly s goose was an impostor It was the theory the principle for which he combated declaring that the evil condition of the man himself was due to the evil institutions among which he had been reared By degrees evidence had been obtained of Scrobby s guilt in the matter of the red herrings and he was to be tried for the offence of putting down poison Goarly was to be the principal witness against his brother conspirator Lord Rufford instigated by his brother in law and liking the spirit of the man had invited the Senator to stay at the Hall while the case was being tried at the Rufford Quarter Sessions I am afraid the invitation was given in a spirit of triumph over the Senator rather than with genuine hospitality It was thought well that the American should be made to see in public the degradation of the abject creature with whom he had sympathised Perhaps there were some who thought that in this way they would get the Senator s neck under their heels If there were such they were likely to be mistaken as the Senator was not a man prone to submit himself to such treatment He was seated at table with Lady Penwether and Miss Penge when Lord Rufford and his brother in law came into the room after parting with Miss Trefoil in the manner described in the last chapter Lady Penwether had watched their unwelcome visitor as she took her way across the park and had whispered something to Miss Penge Miss Penge understood the matter thoroughly and would not herself have made the slightest allusion to the other young lady Had the Senator not been there the two gentlemen would have been allowed to take their places without a word on the subject But the Senator had a marvellous gift of saying awkward things and would never be reticent He stood for a while at the window in the drawing room before he went across the hall and even took up a pair of field glasses to scrutinise the lady and when they were all present he asked whether that was not Miss Trefoil whom he had seen down by the new fence Lady Penwether without seeming to look about her did look about her for a few seconds to see whether the question might be allowed to die away unanswered She perceived from the Senator s face that he intended to have an answer Yes she said that was Miss Trefoil I am very glad that she is not coming in to disturb us A great blessing said Miss Penge Where is she staying asked the Senator I think she drove over from Rufford said the elder lady Poor young lady She was engaged to marry my friend mister John Morton She must have felt his death very bitterly He was an excellent young man rather opinionated and perhaps too much wedded to the traditions of his own country but nevertheless a painstaking excellent young man I had hoped to welcome her as missus Morton in America He was to have gone to Patagonia said Lord Rufford endeavouring to come to himself after the sufferings of the morning We should have seen him back in Washington Sir Whenever you have anything good in diplomacy you generally send him to us Poor young lady Was she talking about him Not particularly said his lordship She must have remembered that when she was last here he was of the party and it was but a few weeks ago only a little before Christmas He struck me as being cold in his manner as an affianced lover Was not that your idea Lady Penwether I don t think I observed him especially I have reason to believe that he was much attached to her She could be sprightly enough but at times there seemed to come a cold melancholy upon her too It is I fancy so with most of your English ladies Miss Trefoil always gave me the idea of being a good type of the English aristocracy Lady Penwether and Miss Penge drew themselves up very stiffly You admired her I think my Lord Very much indeed said Lord Rufford filling his mouth with pigeon pie as he spoke and not lifting his eyes from his plate Will she be back to dinner Oh dear no said Lady Penwether There was something in her tone which at last startled the Senator into perceiving that Miss Trefoil was not popular at Rufford Hall She only came for a morning call said Lord Rufford Poor young woman She has lost her husband and I am afraid now has lost her friends also I am told that she is not well off and from what I see and hear I fancy that here in England a young lady without a dowry cannot easily replace a lover I suppose too Miss Trefoil is not quite in her first youth If you have done Caroline said Lady Penwether to Miss Penge I think we ll go into the other room That afternoon Sir George asked the Senator to accompany him for a walk Sir George was held to be responsible for the Senator s presence and was told by the ladies that he must do something with him The next day which was Friday would be occupied by the affairs of Scrobby and Goarly and on the Saturday he was to return to town The two started about three with the object of walking round the park and the home farm the Senator intent on his duty of examining the ways of English life to the very bottom I hope I did not say anything amiss about Miss Trefoil he remarked as they passed through a shrubbery gate into the park No I think not I thought your good lady looked as though she did not like the subject I am not sure that Miss Trefoil is very popular with the ladies up there She s a handsome young woman and clever though as I said before given to melancholy and sometimes fastidious When we were all here I thought that Lord Rufford admired her and that poor mister Morton was a little jealous I wasn t at Rufford then Here we get out of the park on to the home farm Rufford does it very well very well indeed Looks after it altogether himself I cannot quite say that He has a land bailiff who lives in the house there With a salary Oh yes Lone hundred twenty a year I think the man has And that house asked the Senator Why the house and garden are worth Lfifty a year I dare say they are Of course it costs money It s near the park and had to be made ornamental And does it pay Well no I should think not In point of fact I know it does not He loses about the value of the ground The Senator asked a great many more questions and then began his lecture A man who goes into trade and loses by it cannot be doing good to himself or to others You say Sir George that it is a model farm but it s a model of ruin If you want to teach a man any other business you don t specially select an example in which the proprietors are spending all their capital without any return And if you would not do this in shoemaking why in farming The neighbours are able to see how work should be done Excuse me Sir George but it seems to me that they are enabled to see how work should not be done If his lordship would stick up over his gate a notice to the effect that everything seen there was to be avoided he might do some service If he would publish his accounts half yearly in the village newspaper There isn t a village newspaper In the Rufford Gazette There is a Rufford Gazette and Rufford isn t much more than a village If he would publish his accounts half yearly in the Rufford Gazette honestly showing how much he had lost by his system how much capital had been misapplied and how much labour wasted he might serve as an example like the pictures of The Idle Apprentice I don t see that he can do any other good unless it be to the estimable gentleman who is allowed to occupy the pretty house I don t think you d see anything like that model farm in our country Sir Your views mister Gotobed are utilitarian rather than picturesque Oh if you say that it is done for the picturesque that is another thing Lord Rufford is a wealthy lord and can afford to be picturesque A green sward I should have thought handsomer as well as less expensive than a ploughed field but that is a matter of taste Only why call a pretty toy a model farm You might mislead the British rustics They had by this time passed through a couple of fields which formed part of the model farm and had come to a stile leading into a large meadow This I take it said the Senator looking about him is beyond the limits of my Lord s plaything This is Shugborough said Sir George and there is John Runce the occupier on his pony He at any rate is a model farmer As he spoke mister Runce slowly trotted up to them touching his hat and mister Gotobed recognized the man who had declined to sit next to him at the hunting breakfast Runce also thought that he knew the gentleman Do you hunt to morrow mister Runce asked Sir George Well Sir George no I think not I b lieve I must go to Rufford and hear that fellow Scrobby get it hot and heavy We seem all to be going that way You think he ll be convicted Sir If there s a juryman left in the country worth his salt he ll be convicted said mister Runce almost enraged at the doubt But that other fellow he s to get off That s what kills me Sir George You re alluding to mister Goarly Sir said the Senator That s about it certainly said Runce still looking very suspiciously at his companion I almost think he is the bigger rogue of the two said the Senator Well said Runce well I don t know as he ain t Six of one and half a dozen of the other That s about it But he was evidently pacified by the opinion Goarly is certainly a rascal all round continued the Senator Runce looked at him to make sure whether he was the man who had uttered such fearful blasphemies at the breakfast table I think we had a little discussion about this before mister Runce I am very glad to see you have changed your principles Sir Not a bit of it I am too old to change my principles mister Runce And much as I admire this country I don t think it s the place in which I should be induced to do so Runce looked at him again with a scowl on his face and with a falling mouth mister Goarly is certainly a blackguard Well I rather think he is But a blackguard may have a good cause Put it in your own case mister Runce If his Lordship s pheasants ate up your wheat They re welcome they re welcome The more the merrier But they don t Pheasants know when they re well off Or if a crowd of horsemen rode over your fences don t you think My fences They d be welcome in my wife s bedroom if the fox took that way My fences It s what I has fences for to be ridden over You didn t exactly hear what I have to say mister Runce And I don t want No offence sir if you be a friend of my Lord s but if his Lordship was to say hisself that Goarly was right I wouldn t listen to him A good cause and he going about at dead o night with his pockets full of p ison Hounds and foxes all one or little childer either for the matter o that if they happened on the herrings I have not said his cause was good mister Runce I ll wish you good evening Sir George said the farmer reining his pony round Good evening to you sir And mister Runce trotted or rather ambled off unable to endure another word An honest man I dare say said the Senator Certainly and not a bad specimen of a British farmer Not a bad specimen of a Briton generally but still perhaps a little unreasonable After that Sir George said as little as he could till he had brought the Senator back to the hall I think it s all over now said Lady Penwether to Miss Penge when the gentlemen had left them alone in the afternoon I m sure I hope so for his sake What a woman to come here by herself in that way I don t think he ever cared for her in the least I can t say that I have troubled myself much about that replied Miss Penge For the sake of the family generally and the property and all that I should be very very sorry to think that he was going to make her Lady Rufford I dare say he has amused himself with her There was very little of that as far as I can learn very little encouragement indeed What we saw here was the worst of it He was hardly with her at all at Mistletoe I hope it will make him more cautious that s all said Miss Penge Miss Penge was now a great heiress having had her lawsuit respecting certain shares in a Welsh coal mine settled since we last saw her As all the world knows she came from one of the oldest Commoner s families in the West of England and is moreover a handsome young woman only twenty seven years of age Lady Penwether thinks that she is the very woman to be mistress of Rufford and I do not know that Miss Penge herself is averse to the idea Lord Rufford has been too lately wounded to rise at the bait quite immediately but his sister knows that her brother is impressionable and that a little patience will go a long way They have however all agreed at the hall that Arabella s name shall not again be mentioned CHAPTER XV SCROBBY S TRIAL Rufford was a good deal moved as to the trial of mister Scrobby mister Scrobby was a man who not long since had held his head up in Rufford and had the reputation of a well to do tradesman Enemies had perhaps doubted his probity but he had gone on and prospered and two or three years before the events which are now chronicled had retired on a competence He had then taken a house with a few acres of land lying between Rufford and Rufford Hall the property of Lord Rufford and had commenced genteel life Many in the neighbourhood had been astonished that such a man should have been accepted as a tenant in such a house and it was generally understood that Lord Rufford himself had been very angry with his agent mister Scrobby did not prosper greatly in his new career He became a guardian of the poor and quarrelled with all the Board He tried to become a municipal counsellor in the borough but failed Then he quarrelled with his landlord insisted on making changes in the grounds which were not authorised by the terms of his holding would not pay his rent and was at last ejected having caused some considerable amount of trouble Then he occupied a portion of his leisure with spreading calumnies as to his Lordship and was generally understood to have made up his mind to be disagreeable As Lord Rufford was a sportsman rather than anything else Scrobby studied how he might best give annoyance in that direction and some time before the Goarly affair had succeeded in creating considerable disturbance When a man will do this pertinaciously and when his selected enemy is wealthy and of high standing he will generally succeed in getting a party round him In Rufford there were not a few who thought that Lord Rufford s pheasants and foxes were a nuisance though probably these persons had never suffered in any way themselves It was a grand thing to fight a lord and so Scrobby had a party When the action against his Lordship was first threatened by Goarly and when it was understood that Scrobby had backed him with money there was a feeling that Scrobby was doing rather a fine thing He had not indeed used his money openly as the Senator had afterwards done but that was not Scrobby s way If Goarly had been ill used any help was legitimate and the party as a party was proud of their man But when it came to pass that poison had been laid down wholesale as the hunting men said in Dillsborough Wood in the close vicinity of Goarly s house then the party hesitated Such strategy as that was disgusting but was there reason to think that Scrobby had been concerned in the matter Scrobby still had an income and ate roast meat or boiled every day for his dinner Was it likely that such a man should deal in herrings and strychnine Nickem had been at work for the last three months backed up by funds which had latterly been provided by the lord s agent and had in truth run the matter down Nickem had found out all about it and in his pride had resigned his stool in mister Masters office But the Scrobby party in Rufford could not bring itself to believe that Nickem was correct That Goarly s hand had actually placed the herrings no man either at Rufford or Dillsborough had doubted Such was now Nickem s story But of what avail would be the evidence of such a man as Goarly against such a man as Scrobby It would be utterly worthless unless corroborated and the Scrobby party was not yet aware how clever Nickem had been Thus all Rufford was interested in the case Lord Rufford Sir George Penwether his Lordship s agent and mister Gotobed had been summoned as witnesses the expenditure of money by the Senator having by this time become notorious and on the morning of the trial they all went into the town in his Lordship s drag The Senator as the guest was on the box seat with his Lordship and as they passed old Runce trotting into Rufford on his nag mister Gotobed began to tell the story of yesterday s meeting complaining of the absurdity of the old farmer s anger Penwether told me about it said the Lord I suppose your tenant is a little crazy By no means I thought he was right in what he said if I understood Penwether He couldn t have been right He turned from me in disgust simply because I tried to explain to him that a rogue has as much right to be defended by the law as an honest man Runce looks upon these men as vermin which ought to be hunted down But they are not vermin They are men and till they have been found guilty they are innocent men If a man had murdered your child would he be innocent in your eyes till he was convicted I hope so but I should be very anxious to bring home the crime against him And should he be found guilty even then he should not be made subject to other punishment than that the law awards mister Runce is angry with me because I do not think that Goarly should be crushed under the heels of all his neighbours Take care my Lord Didn t we come round that corner rather sharp Then Lord Rufford emphatically declared that such men as Scrobby and Goarly should be crushed and the Senator with an inward sigh declared that between landlord and tenant between peer and farmer between legislator and rustic there was in capacity for logical inference no difference whatever The British heart might be all right but the British head was ah hopelessly wooden It would be his duty to say so in his lecture and perhaps some good might be done to so gracious but so stolid a people if only they could be got to listen Scrobby had got down a barrister from London and therefore the case was allowed to drag itself out through the whole day Lord Rufford as a magistrate went on to the bench himself though he explained that he only took his seat there as a spectator Sir George and mister Gotobed were also allowed to sit in the high place though the Senator complained even of this Goarly and Scrobby were not allowed to be there and Lord Rufford in his opinion should also have been debarred from such a privilege A long time was occupied before even a jury could be sworn the barrister earning his money by brow beating the provincial bench and putting various obstacles in the way of the trial As he was used to practice at the assizes of course he was able to domineer This juror would not do nor that The chairman was all wrong in his law The officers of the Court knew nothing about it At first there was quite a triumph for the Scrobbyites and even Nickem himself was frightened But at last the real case was allowed to begin and Goarly was soon in the witness box Goarly did not seem to enjoy the day and was with difficulty got to tell his own story even on his own side But the story when it was told was simple enough He had met mister Scrobby accidentally in Rufford and they two had together discussed the affairs of the young Lord They came to an agreement that the young Lord was a tyrant and ought to be put down and Scrobby showed how it was to be done Scrobby instigated the action about the pheasants and undertook to pay the expenses if Goarly would act in the other little matter But when he found that the Senator s money was forthcoming he had been anything but as good as his word Goarly swore that in hard cash he had never seen more than four shillings of Scrobby s money As to the poison Goarly declared that he knew nothing about it but he certainly had received a parcel of herrings from Scrobby s own hands and in obedience to Scrobby s directions had laid them down in Dillsborough Wood the very morning on which the hounds had come there He owned that he supposed that there might be something in the herrings something that would probably be deleterious to hounds as well as foxes or to children should the herrings happen to fall into children s hands but he assured the Court that he had no knowledge of poison none whatever Then he was made by the other side to give a complete and a somewhat prolonged account of his own life up to the present time this information being of course required by the learned barrister on the other side in listening to which the Senator did become thoroughly ashamed of the Briton whom he had assisted with his generosity But all this would have been nothing had not Nickem secured the old woman who had sold the herrings and also the chemist from whom the strychnine had been purchased as much as three years previously This latter feat was Nickem s great triumph the feeling of the glory of which induced him to throw up his employment in mister Masters office and thus brought him and his family to absolute ruin within a few months in spite of the liberal answers which were made by Lord Rufford to many of his numerous appeals Away in Norrington the poison had been purchased as much as three years ago and yet Nickem had had the luck to find it out When the Scrobbyites heard that Scrobby had gone all the way to Norrington to buy strychnine to kill rats they were Scrobbyites no longer I hope they ll hang un I do hope they ll hang un said mister Runce quite out loud from his crowded seat just behind the attorney s bench The barrister of course struggled hard to earn his money Though he could not save his client he might annoy the other side He insisted therefore on bringing the whole affair of the pheasants before the Court and examined the Senator at great length He asked the Senator whether he had not found himself compelled to sympathise with the wrongs he had witnessed The Senator declared that he had witnessed no wrongs Why then had he interfered Because he had thought that there might be wrong and because he wished to see what power a poor man in this country would have against a rich one He was induced still to think that Goarly had been ill treated about the pheasants but he could not take upon himself to say that he had witnessed any wrong done But he was quite sure that the system on which such things were managed in England was at variance with that even justice which prevailed in his own country Yes by his own country he did mean Mickewa He could tell that learned gentleman in spite of his sneers and in spite of his evident ignorance of geography that nowhere on the earth s surface was justice more purely administered than in the great Western State of Mickewa It was felt by everybody that the Senator had the best of it mister Scrobby was sent into durance for twelve months with hard labour and Goarly was conveyed away in the custody of the police lest he should be torn to pieces by the rough lovers of hunting who were congregated outside When the sentence had reached mister Runce s ears and had been twice explained to him first by one neighbour and then by another his face assumed the very look which it had worn when he carried away his victuals from the Senator s side at Rufford Hall and when he had turned his pony round on his own land on the previous evening The man had killed a fox and might have killed a dozen hounds and was to be locked up only for twelve months He indignantly asked his neighbour what had come of Van Diemen s Land and what was the use of Botany Bay On their way back to Rufford Hall Lord Rufford would have been triumphant had not the Senator checked him It s a bad state of things altogether he said Of course the promiscuous use of strychnine is objectionable Rather said his Lordship But is it odd that an utterly uneducated man one whom his country has left to grow up in the ignorance of a brute should have recourse to any measure however objectionable when the law will absolutely give him no redress against the trespass made by a couple of hundred horsemen Lord Rufford gave it up feeling the Senator to be a man with whom he could not argue CHAPTER XVI AT LAST When once missus Morton had taken her departure for London on the day after her grandson s death nothing further was heard of her at Bragton She locked up everything and took all the keys away as though still hoping against hope that the will might turn out to be other than she expected But when the lawyer came down to read the document he brought the keys back with him and no further tidings reached Dillsborough respecting the old woman She still drew her income as she had done for half a century but never even came to look at the stone which Reginald put up on the walls of Bragton church to perpetuate the memory of his cousin What moans she made she made in silent obscurity and devoted the remainder of her years to putting together money for members of her own family who took no notice of her After the funeral Lady Ushant returned to the house at the request of her nephew who declared his purpose of remaining at Hoppet Hall for the present She expostulated with him and received from him an assurance that he would take up his residence as squire at Bragton as soon as he married a wife should he ever do so In the meantime he could he thought perform his duties from Hoppet Hall as well as on the spot As a residence for a bachelor he preferred he said Hoppet Hall to the park Lady Ushant yielded and returned once again to her old home the house in which she had been born and gave up her lodgings at Cheltenham The word that he said about his possible marriage set her mind at work and induced her to put sundry questions to him Of course you will marry she said Men who have property to leave behind them usually do marry and as I am not wiser than others I probably may do so But I will not admit that it is a matter of course I may escape yet I do hope you will marry I hope it may be before I die so that I may see her And disapprove of her ten to one Certainly I shall not if you tell me that you love her Then I will tell you so to prevent disagreeable results I am quite sure there must be somebody that you like Reginald she said after a pause Are you I don t know that I have shown any very strong preference I am not disposed to praise myself for many things but I really do think that I have been as undemonstrative as most men of my age Still I did hope What did you hope I won t mention any name I don t think it is right I have observed that more harm than good comes of such talking and I have determined always to avoid it But Then there was another pause Remember how old I am Reginald and when it is to be done give me at any rate the pleasure of knowing it Of course he knew to whom she alluded and of course he laughed at her feeble caution But he would not say a word to encourage her to mention the name of Mary Masters He thought that he was sure that were the girl free he would now ask her to be his wife If he loved any one it was her If he had ever known a woman with whom he thought it would be pleasant to share the joy and labours of life it was Mary Masters If he could imagine that any one constant companion would be a joy to him she would be that person But he had been distinctly informed that she was in love with some one and not for worlds would he ask for that which had been given to another And not for worlds would he hazard the chance of a refusal He thought that he could understand the delight that he could thoroughly enjoy the rapture of hearing her whisper with downcast eyes that she could love him He had imagination enough to build castles in the air in which she reigned as princess in which she would lie with her head upon his bosom and tell him that he was her chosen prince But he would hardly know how to bear himself should he ask in vain He believed he could love as well as Lawrence Twentyman but he was sure that he could not continue his quest as that young man had done When Lady Ushant had been a day or two at the house she asked him whether she might invite Mary there as her guest as her perpetual guest I have no objection in life he said but take care that you don t interfere with her happiness Because of her father and sisters suggested the innocent old lady Has she a father has she a mother Or has she a dearer one still than all other said Reginald laughing Perhaps she has Then don t interfere with her happiness in that direction How is she to have a lover come to see her out here Why not I don t see why she shouldn t have a lover here as well as in Dillsborough I don t object to lovers if they are of the proper sort and I am sure Mary wouldn t have anything else Reginald told her she might do as she pleased and made no further inquiry as to Mary s lovers A few days afterwards Mary went with her boxes to Bragton missus Masters repeating her objections but repeating them with but little energy Just at this time a stroke of good fortune befell the Masters family generally which greatly reduced her power over her husband Reginald Morton had spent an hour in the attorney s office and had declared his purpose of restoring mister Masters to his old family position in regard to the Bragton estate When she heard it she felt at once that her dominion was gone She had based everything on the growing inferiority of her husband s position and now he was about to have all his glory back again She had inveighed against gentlemen from the day of her marriage and here he was again to be immersed up to his eyes in the affairs of a gentleman And then she had been so wrong about Goarly and Lord Rufford had been so much better a client And ready money had been so much more plentiful of late owing to poor John Morton s ready handed honesty She had very little to say about it when Mary packed her boxes and was taken in mister Runciman s fly to Bragton Since the old days the old days of all since the days to which Reginald had referred when he asked her to pass over the bridge with him she had never yet walked about the Bragton grounds She had often been to the house visiting Lady Ushant but she had simply gone thither and returned And indeed when the house had been empty the walk from Dillsborough to the bridge and back had been sufficient exercise for herself and her sisters But now she could go whither she listed and bring her memory to all the old spots With the tenacity as to household matters which characterised the ladies of the country some years since Lady Ushant employed all her mornings and those of her young friend in making inventories of everything that was found in the house but her afternoons were her own and she wandered about with a freedom she had never known before At this time Reginald Morton was up in London and had been away nearly a week He had gone intending to be absent for some undefined time so that Lady Ushant and missus Hopkins were free from all interruption It was as yet only the middle of March and the lion had not altogether disappeared but still Mary could get out She did not care much for the wind and she roamed about among the leafless shrubberies thinking probably not of many things meaning always to think of the past but unable to keep her mind from the future the future which would so soon be the present How long would it be before the coming of that stately dame Was he in quest of her now Had he perhaps postponed his demand upon her till fortune had made him rich Of course she had no right to be sorry that he had inherited the property which had been his almost of right but yet had it been otherwise might she not have had some chance But oh if he had said a word to her only a word more than he had spoken already a word that might have sounded like encouragement to others beside herself and then have been obliged to draw back because of the duty which he owed to the property how much worse would that have been She did own to herself that the squire of Bragton should not look for his wife in the house of a Dillsborough attorney As she thought of this a tear ran down her cheek and trickled down on to the wooden rail of the little bridge There s no one to give you an excuse now and you must come and walk round with me said a voice close to her ear Oh mister Morton how you have startled me Is there anything the matter Mary said he looking up into her face Only you have startled me so Has that brought tears into your eyes Well I suppose so she said trying to smile You were so very quiet and I thought you were in London So I was this morning and now I am here But something else has made you unhappy No nothing I wish we could be friends Mary I wish I could know your secret You have a secret No she said boldly Is there nothing What should there be mister Morton Tell me why you were crying I was not crying Just a tear is not crying Sometimes one does get melancholy One can t cry when there is any one to look and so one does it alone I d have been laughing if I knew that you were coming Come round by the kennels You can get over the wall can t you Oh yes And we ll go down the old orchard and get out by the corner of the park fence Then he walked and she followed him hardly keeping close by his side and thinking as she went how foolish she had been not to have avoided the perils and fresh troubles of such a walk When he was helping her over the wall he held her hands for a moment and she was aware of unusual pressure It was the pressure of love or of that pretence of love which young men and perhaps old men sometimes permit themselves to affect In an ordinary way Mary would have thought as little of it as another girl She might feel dislike to the man but the affair would be too light for resentment With this man it was different He certainly was not justified in making the slightest expression of factitious affection He at any rate should have felt himself bound to abstain from any touch of peculiar tenderness She would not say a word She would not even look at him with angry eyes But she twitched both her hands away from him as she sprang to the ground Then there was a passage across the orchard not more than a hundred yards and after that a stile At the stile she insisted on using her own hand for the custody of her dress She would not even touch his outstretched arm You are very independent he said I have to be so I cannot make you out Mary I wonder whether there is still anything rankling in your bosom against me Oh dear no What should rankle with me What indeed unless you resent my regard I am not so rich in friends as to do that mister Morton I don t suppose there can be many people who have the same sort of feeling for you that I have There are not many who have known me so long certainly You have some friend I know he said More than one I hope Some special friend Who is he Mary I don t know what you mean mister Morton She then thought that he was still alluding to Lawrence Twentyman Tell me Mary What am I to tell you Your father says that there is some one Papa Yes your father Then she remembered it all how she had been driven into a half confession to her father She could not say there was nobody She certainly could not say who that some one was She could not be silent for by silence she would be confessing a passion for some other man a passion which certainly had no existence I don t know why papa should talk about me she said and I certainly don t know why you should repeat what he said But there is some one She clenched her fist and hit out at the air with her parasol and knit her brows as she looked up at him with a glance of fire in her eye which he had never seen there before Believe me Mary he said if ever a girl had a sincere friend you have one in me I would not tease you by impertinence in such a matter I will be as faithful to you as the sun Do you love any one Yes she said turning round at him with ferocity and shouting out her answer as she pressed on Who is he Mary What right have you to ask me What right can any one have Even your aunt would not press me as you are doing My aunt could not have the same interest Who is he Mary I will not tell you He paused a few moments and walked on a step or two before he spoke again I would it were I he said What she ejaculated I would it were I he repeated One glance of her eye stole itself round into his face and then her face was turned quickly to the ground Her parasol which had been raised drooped listless from her hand All unconsciously she hastened her steps and became aware that the tears were streaming from her eyes For a moment or two it seemed to her that all was still hopeless If he had no more to say than that certainly she had not a word He had made her no tender of his love He had not told her that in very truth she was his chosen one After all she was not sure that she understood the meaning of those words I would it were I But the tears were coming so quick that she could see nothing of the things around her and she did not dare even to put her hand up to her eyes If he wanted her love if it was possible that he really wished for it why did he not ask for it She felt his footsteps close to hers and she was tempted to walk on quicker even than before Then there came the fingers of a hand round her waist stealing gradually on till she felt the pressure of his body on her shoulders She put her hand up weakly to push back the intruding fingers only to leave it tight in his grasp Then then was the first moment in which she realized the truth After all he did love her Surely he would not hold her there unless he meant her to know that he loved her Mary he said To speak was impossible but she turned round and looked at him with imploring eyes Mary say that you will be my wife CHAPTER XVII MY OWN OWN HUSBAND Yes it had come at last As one may imagine to be the certainty of paradise to the doubting fearful all but despairing soul when it has passed through the gates of death and found in new worlds a reality of assured bliss so was the assurance to her conveyed by that simple request Mary say that you will be my wife It did not seem to her that any answer was necessary Will it be required that the spirit shall assent to its entrance into Elysium Was there room for doubt He would never go back from his word now He would not have spoken the word had he not been quite quite certain And he had loved her all that time when she was so hard to him It must have been so He had loved her this bright one even when he thought that she was to be given to that clay bound rustic lover Perhaps that was the sweetest of it all though in draining the sweet draught she had to accuse herself of hardness blindness and injustice Could it be real Was it true that she had her foot firmly placed in Paradise He was there close to her with his arm still round her and her fingers grasped within his The word wife was still in her ears surely the sweetest word in all the language What protestation of love could have been so eloquent as that question Will you be my wife No true man she thought ever ought to ask the question in any other form But her eyes were still full of tears and as she went she knew not where she was going She had forgotten all her surroundings being only aware that he was with her and that no other eyes were on them Then there was another stile on reaching which he withdrew his arm and stood facing her with his back leaning against it Why do you weep he said and Mary why do you not answer my question If there be anybody else you must tell me now There is nobody else she said almost angrily There never was There never could be And yet there was somebody She pouted her lips at him glancing up into his face for half a second and then again hung her head down Mary do not grudge me my delight No no no But you do No If there can be delight to you in so poor a thing have it all Then you must kiss me dear She gently came to him oh so gently and with her head still hanging creeping towards his shoulder thinking perhaps that the motion should have been his but still obeying him and then leaning against him seemed as though she would stoop with her lips to his hand But this he did not endure Seizing her quickly in his arms he drew her up till her not unwilling face was close to his and there he kept her till she was almost frightened by his violence And now Mary what do you say to my question It has to be answered You know But that will not do I will have it in words I will not be shorn of my delight That it should be a delight to him was the very essence of her heaven Tell me what to say she answered How may I say it best Reginald Morton he began Reginald she repeated it after him but went no farther in naming him Because I love you better than any other being in the world I do Ah but say it Because I love you oh so much better than all the world besides Therefore my own own husband Therefore my own own Then she paused Say the word My own own husband I will be your true wife I will be your own true loving wife Then he kissed her again That he said is our little marriage ceremony under God s sky and no other can be more binding As soon as you in the plentitude of your maiden power will fix a day for the other one and when we can get that over then we will begin our little journey together But Reginald Well dear You haven t said anything Haven t I I thought I had said it all But you haven t said it for yourself You say what you want and I ll repeat it quite as well as you did I can t do that Say it yourself I will be your true husband for the rest of the journey by which I mean it to be understood that I take you into partnership on equal terms but that I am to be allowed to manage the business just as I please Yes that you shall she said quite in earnest Only as you are practical and I am vague I don t doubt that everything will fall into your hands before five years are over and that I shall have to be told whether I can afford to buy a new book and when I am to ask all the gentry to dinner Now you are laughing at me because I shall know so little about anything Come dear let us get over the stile and go on for another field or we shall never get round the park Then she jumped over after him just touching his hand I was not laughing at you at all I don t in the least doubt that in a very little time you will know everything about everything I am so much afraid You needn t be I know you well enough for that But suppose I had taken such a one as that young woman who was here with my poor cousin Oh heavens Perhaps you ought to have done so I thank the Lord that hath delivered me You ought you ought to have chosen some lady of high standing said Mary thinking with ineffable joy of the stately dame who was not to come to Bragton Do you know what I was thinking only the other day about it that you had gone up to London to look for some proper sort of person And how did you mean to receive her I shouldn t have received her at all I should have gone away You can t do it now Can t I What were you thanking the Lord for so heartily For you Were you That is the sweetest thing you have said yet My own my darling my dearest If only I can so live that you may be able to thank the Lord for me in years to come I will not trouble the reader with all that was said at every stile No doubt very much of what has been told was repeated again and again so that the walk round the park was abnormally long At last however they reached the house and as they entered the hall Mary whispered to him Who is to tell your aunt she said Come along he replied striding upstairs to his aunt s bedroom where he knew she would be at this time He opened the door without any notice and having waited till Mary had joined him led her forcibly into the middle of the room Here she is he said my wife elect Oh Reginald We have managed it all and there needn t be any more said about it except to settle the day Mary has been looking about the house and learning her duty already She ll be able to have every bedstead and every chair by heart which is an advantage ladies seldom possess Then Mary rushed forward and was received into the old woman s arms When Reginald left them which he did very soon after the announcement was made Lady Ushant had a great deal to say I have been thinking of it my dear oh for years ever since he came to Hoppet Hall But I am sure the best way is never to say anything If I had interfered there is no knowing how it might have been Then dear Lady Ushant I am so glad you didn t said Mary being tolerably sure at the same time within her own bosom that her loving old friend could have done no harm in that direction I wouldn t say a word though I was always thinking of it But then he is so odd and no one can know what he means sometimes That s what made me think when mister Twentyman was so very pressing That couldn t couldn t have been possible Poor young man But I always told him it was impossible I wonder whether you cared about Reginald all that time In answer to this Mary only hid her face in the old woman s lap Dear me I suppose you did all along But I am sure it was better not to say anything and now what will your papa and mamma say They ll hardly believe it at first I hope they ll be glad Glad Why what do you suppose they would want me to do Dear papa And dear mamma too because she has really been good to me I wonder when it must be Then that question was discussed at great length and Lady Ushant had a great deal of very good advice to bestow She didn t like long engagements and it was very essential for Reginald s welfare that he should settle himself at Bragton as soon as possible Mary s pleas for a long day were not very urgent That evening at Bragton was rather long and rather dull It was almost the first that she had ever passed in company with Reginald and there now seemed to be a necessity of doing something peculiar whereas there was nothing peculiar to be done It was his custom to betake himself to his books after dinner but he could hardly do so with ease in company with the girl who had just promised him to be his wife Lady Ushant too wished to show her extreme joy and made flattering but vain attempts to be ecstatic Mary to tell the truth was longing for solitude feeling that she could not yet realise her happiness Not even when she was in bed could she reduce her mind to order It would have been all but impossible even had he remained the comparatively humble lord of Hoppet Hall but that the squire of Bragton should be her promised husband was a marvel so great that from every short slumber she waked with fear of treacherous dreams A minute s sleep might rob her of her joy and declare to her in the moment of waking that it was all an hallucination It was not that he was dearer to her or that her condition was the happier because of his position and wealth but that the chance of his inheritance had lifted him so infinitely above her She thought of the little room at home which she generally shared with one of her sisters of her all too scanty wardrobe of her daily tasks about the house of her stepmother s late severity and of her father s cares Surely he would not hinder her from being good to them surely he would let the young girls come to her from time to time What an added happiness it would be if he would allow her to pass on to them some sparks of the prosperity which he was bestowing on her And then her thoughts travelled on to poor Larry Would he not be more contented now now when he would be certain that no further frantic efforts could avail him anything Poor Larry Would Reginald permit her to regard him as a friend And would he submit to friendly treatment She could look forward and see him happy with his wife the best loved of their neighbours for who was there in the world better than Larry But she did not know how two men who had both been her lovers would allow themselves to be brought together But oh what peril had been there It was but the other day she had striven so hard to give the lie to her love and to become Larry s wife She shuddered beneath the bedclothes as she thought of the danger she had run One word would have changed all her Paradise into a perpetual wail of tears and waste of desolation When she woke in the morning from her long sleep an effort was wanting to tell her that it was all true Oh if it had slipped from her then if she had waked after such a dream to find herself loving in despair with a sore bosom and angry heart She met him downstairs early in the study having her first request to make to him Might she go in at once after breakfast and tell them all I suppose I ought to go to your father he said Let me go first she pleaded hanging on his arm I would not think that I was not mindful of them from the very beginning So she was driven into Dillsborough in the pony carriage which had been provided for old missus Morton s use and told her own story Papa she said going to the office door Come into the house come at once And then within her father s arms while her stepmother listened she told them of her triumph mister Reginald Morton wants me to be his wife and he is coming here to ask you The Lord in heaven be good to us said missus Masters holding up both her hands Is it true child The squire It is true papa and and And what my love When he comes to you you must say I will be There was not much danger on that score Was it he that you told me of said the attorney To this she only nodded her assent It was Reginald Morton all the time Well Why shouldn t it be he Oh no my dear You are a most fortunate girl most fortunate But somehow I never thought of it that a child of mine should come to live at Bragton and have it one may say partly as her own It is odd after all that has come and gone God bless you my dear and make you happy You are a very fortunate child missus Masters was quite overpowered She had thrown herself on to the old family sofa and was fanning herself with her handkerchief She had been wrong throughout and was now completely humiliated by the family success and yet she was delighted though she did not dare to be triumphant She had so often asked both father and daughter what good gentlemen would do to either of them and now the girl was engaged to marry the richest gentleman in the neighbourhood In any expression of joy she would be driven to confess how wrong she had always been How often had she asked what would come of Ushanting This it was that had come of Ushanting The girl had been made fit to be the companion of such a one as Reginald Morton and had now fallen into the position which was suited to her Of course we shall see nothing of you now she said in a whimpering voice It was not a gracious speech but it was almost justified by disappointments Mamma you know that I shall never separate myself from you and the girls Poor Larry said the woman sobbing Of course it is all for the best but I don t know what he ll do now You must tell him papa said Mary and give him my love and bid him be a man CHAPTER XVIII BID HIM BE A MAN The little phaeton remained in Dillsborough to take Mary back to Bragton As soon as she was gone the attorney went over to the Bush with the purpose of borrowing Runciman s pony so that he might ride over to Chowton Farm and at once execute his daughter s last request In the yard of the inn he saw Runciman himself and was quite unable to keep his good news to himself My girl has just been with me he said and what do you think she tells me That she is going to take poor Larry after all She might do worse mister Masters Poor Larry I am sorry for him I have always liked Larry Twentyman But that is all over now She s not going to have that tweedledum young parson surely Reginald Morton has made her a set offer The squire mister Masters nodded his head three times You don t say so Well mister Masters I don t begrudge it you He might do worse She has taken her pigs well to market at last He is to come to me at four this afternoon Well done Miss Mary I suppose it s been going on ever so long We fathers and mothers said the attorney never really know what the young ones are after Don t mention it just at present Runciman You are such an old friend that I couldn t help telling you Poor Larry I can have the pony Runciman Certainly you can mister Masters Tell him to come in and talk it all over with me If we don t look to it he ll be taking to drink regular At that last meeting at the club when the late squire s will was discussed at which as the reader may perhaps remember a little supper was also discussed in honour of the occasion poor Larry had not only been present but had drunk so pottle deep that the landlord had been obliged to put him to bed at the inn and he had not been at all as he ought to have been after Lord Rufford s dinner Such delinquencies were quite outside the young man s accustomed way of his life It had been one of his recognised virtues that living as he did a good deal among sporting men and with a full command of means he had never drank But now he had twice sinned before the eyes of all Dillsborough and Runciman thought that he knew how it would be with a young man in his own house who got drunk in public to drown his sorrow I wouldn t see Larry go astray and spoil himself with liquor said the good natured publican for more than I should like to name mister Masters promised to take the hint and rode off on his mission The entrance to Chowton Farm and Bragton gate were nearly opposite the latter being perhaps a furlong nearer to Dillsborough The attorney when he got to the gate stopped a moment and looked up the avenue with pardonable pride The great calamity of his life the stunning blow which had almost unmanned him when he was young and from which he had never quite been able to rouse himself had been the loss of the management of the Bragton property His grandfather and his father had been powerful at Bragton and he had been brought up in the hope of walking in their paths Then strangers had come in and he had been dispossessed But how was it with him now It had almost made a young man of him again when Reginald Morton stepping into his office asked him as a favour to resume his old task But what was that in comparison with this later triumph His own child was to be made queen of the place His grandson should she be fortunate enough to be the mother of a son would be the squire himself His visits to the place for the last twenty years had been very rare indeed He had been sent for lately by old missus Morton for a purpose which if carried out would have robbed him of all his good fortune but he could not remember when before that he had even passed through the gateway Now it would all become familiar to him again That pony of Runciman s was pleasant in his paces and he began to calculate whether the innkeeper would part with the animal He stood thus gazing at the place for some minutes till he saw Reginald Morton in the distance turning a corner of the road with Mary at his side He had taken her from the phaeton and had then insisted on her coming out with him before she took off her hat mister Masters as soon as he saw them trotted off to Chowton Farm Finding Larry lounging at the little garden gate mister Masters got off the pony and taking the young man s arm walked off with him towards Dillsborough Wood He told all his news at once almost annihilating poor Larry by the suddenness of the blow Larry mister Reginald Morton has asked my girl to marry him and she has accepted him The new squire said Larry stopping himself on the path and looking as though a gentle wind would suffice to blow him over I suppose it has been that way all along Larry though we have not known it It was mister Morton then that she told me of She did tell you Of course there was no chance for me if he wanted her But why didn t they speak out so that I could have gone away Oh mister Masters It was only yesterday she knew it herself She must have guessed it No she knew nothing till he declared himself And to day this very morning she has bade me come to you and let you know it And she sent you her love Her love said Larry chucking the stick which he held in his hands down to the ground and then stooping to pick it up again Yes her love Those were her words and I am to tell you from her to be a man Did she say that Yes I was to come out to you at once and bring you that as a message from her Be a man I could have been a man right enough if she would have made me one as good a man as Reginald Morton though he is squire of Bragton But of course I couldn t have given her a house like that nor a carriage nor made her one of the county people If it was to go in that way what could I hope for Don t be unjust to her Larry Unjust to her If giving her every blessed thing I had in the world at a moment s notice was unjust I was ready to be unjust any day of the week or any hour of the day What I mean is that her heart was fixed that way before Reginald Morton was squire of Bragton What shall I say in answer to her message You will wish her happiness will you not Wish her happiness Oh heavens He could not explain what was in his mind Wish her happiness yes the happiness of the angels But not him nor yet with him And as there could be no arranging of this he must leave his wishes unsettled And yet there was a certain relief to him in the tidings he had heard There was now no more doubt He need not now remain at Chowton thinking it possible that the girl might even yet change her mind And you will bear in mind that she wishes you to be a man Why did she not make me one But that is all all over You tell her from me that I am not the man to whimper because I am hurt What ought a man to do that I can t do Let her know that you are going about your old pursuits And Larry would you wish her to know how it was with you at the club last Saturday Did she hear of that I am sure she has not heard of it But if that kind of thing becomes a habit of course she will hear of it All Dillsborough would hear of it if that became common At any rate it is not manly to drown it in drink Who says I do that Nothing will drown it I wouldn t speak if I had not known you so long and loved you so well What she means is that you should work I do work And hunt Go out to morrow and show yourself to everybody If I could break my neck I would Don t let every farmer s son in the county say that Lawrence Twentyman was so mastered by a girl that he couldn t ride on horseback when she said him nay Everybody knows it mister Masters Go among them as if nobody knew it I ll warrant that nobody will speak of it I don t think any one of em would dare to do that said Larry brandishing his stick Where is it that the hounds are to morrow Larry Here at the old kennel Go out and let her see that you have taken her advice She is there at the house and she will recognise you in the park Remember that she sends her love to you and bids you be a man And Larry come in and see us sometimes The time will come I don t doubt when you and the squire will be fast friends Never You do not know what time can do I ll just go back now because he is to come to me this afternoon Try and bear up and remember that it is she who bids you be a man The attorney got upon his pony and rode back to Dillsborough Larry who had come back to the yard to see his friend off returned by the road into the fields and went wandering about for a while in Dillsborough Wood Bid him be a man Wasn t he a man Was it disgraceful to him as a man to be broken hearted because a woman would not love him If he were provoked he would fight perhaps better than ever because he would be reckless Would he not be ready to fight Reginald Morton with any weapon which could be thought of for the possession of Mary Masters If she were in danger would he not go down into the deep or through fire to save her Were not his old instincts of honesty and truth as strong in him as ever Did manliness require that his heart should be invulnerable If so he doubted whether he could ever be a man But what if she meant that manliness required him to hide the wound Then there did come upon him a feeling of shame as he remembered how often he had spoken of his love to those who were little better than strangers to him and thought that perhaps such loquacity was opposed to the manliness which she recommended And his conscience smote him as it brought to his recollection the condition of his mind as he woke in Runciman s bed at the Bush on last Sunday morning That at any rate had not been manly How would it be with him if he made up his mind never to speak again to her and certainly not to him and to take care that that should be the only sign left of his suffering He would hunt and be keener than ever he would work upon the land with increased diligence he would give himself not a moment to think of anything She should see and hear what he could do but he would never speak to her again The hounds would be at the old kennels to morrow He would be there The place no doubt was Morton s property but on hunting mornings all the lands of the county and of the next counties if they can be reached are the property of the hunt Yes he would be there and she would see him in his scarlet coat and smartest cravat with his boots and breeches neat as those of Lord Rufford and she should know that he was doing as she bade him But he would never speak to her again As he was returning round the wood whom should he see skulking round the corner of it but Goarly What business have you in here he said feeling half inclined to take the man by the neck and drag him out of the copse I saw you mister Twentyman and I wanted just to have a word with you You are the biggest rascal in all Rufford said Larry I wonder the lads have left you with a whole bone in your skin What have I done worse than any other poor man mister Twentyman When I took them herrings I didn t know there was p ison and if I hadn t took em another would I am going to cut it out of this mister Twentyman May the go along with you said Larry wishing his neighbour a very unpleasant companion And of course I must sell the place Think what it would be to you I shouldn t like it to go into his Lordship s hands It s all through Bean I know but his Lordship has had a down on me ever since he came to the property It s as true as true about my old woman s geese There s forty acres of it What would you say to Lforty an acre The idea of having the two extra fields made Larry s mouth water in spite of all his misfortunes The desire for land among such as Larry Twentyman is almost a disease in England With these two fields he would be able to walk almost round Dillsborough Wood without quitting his own property He had been talking of selling Chowton within the last week or two He had been thinking of selling it at the moment when mister Masters rode up to him And yet now he was almost tempted to a new purchase by this man But the man was too utterly a blackguard was too odious to him If it comes into the market I may bid for it as well as another he said but I wouldn t let myself down to have any dealings with you Then mister Larry you shall never have a sod of it said Goarly dropping himself over the fence on to his own field A few minutes afterwards Larry met Bean and told him that Goarly had been in the wood If I catch him mister Twentyman I ll give him sore bones said Bean I wonder how he ever got back to his own place alive that day Then Bean asked Larry whether he meant to be at the meet to morrow and Larry said that he thought he should Tony s almost afraid to bring them in even yet said Bean but if there s a herring left in this wood I ll eat it myself strychnine and all After that Larry went and looked at his horses and absolutely gave his mare Bicycle a gallop round the big grass field himself Then those who were about the place knew that something had happened and that he was in a way to be cured You ll hunt to morrow won t you Larry said his mother affectionately Who told you Nobody told me but you will Larry won t you May be I will Then as he was leaving the room when he was in the door way so that she should not see his face he told her the news She s going to marry the squire yonder Mary Masters I always hated him from the first moment I saw him What do you expect from a fellow who never gets a top of a horse Then he turned away and was not seen again till long after tea time CHAPTER XIX IS IT TANTI Reginald Morton entertained serious thoughts of cleansing himself from the reproach which Larry cast upon him when describing his character to his mother I think I shall take to hunting he said to Mary But you ll tumble off dear No doubt I shall and I must try to begin in soft places I don t see why I shouldn t do it gradually in a small way I shouldn t ever become a Nimrod like Lord Rufford or your particular friend mister Twentyman He is my particular friend So I perceive I couldn t shine as he shines but I might gradually learn to ride after him at a respectful distance A man at Rome ought to do as the Romans do Why wasn t Hoppet Hall Rome as much as Bragton Well it wasn t While fortune enabled me to be happy at Hoppet Hall That is unkind Reg While fortune oppressed me with celibate misery at Hoppet Hall nobody hated me for not hunting and as I could not very well afford it I was not considered to be entering a protest against the amusement As it is now I find that unless I consent to risk my neck at any rate five or six times every winter I shall be regarded in that light I wouldn t be frightened into doing anything I didn t like said Mary How do you know that I shan t like it The truth is I have had a letter this morning from a benevolent philosopher which has almost settled the question for me He wants me to join a society for the suppression of British sports as being barbarous and antipathetic to the intellectual pursuits of an educated man I would immediately shoot fish hunt and go out ratting if I could hope for the least success I know I should never shoot anything but the dog and the gamekeepers and that I should catch every weed in the river but I think that in the process of seasons I might jump over a hedge Kate will show you the way to do that With Kate and mister Twentyman to help me and a judicious system of liberal tips to Tony Tuppett I could make my way about on a quiet old nag and live respected by my neighbours The fact is I hate with my whole heart the trash of the philanimalist What is a a I didn t quite catch the thing you hate The thing is a small knot of self anxious people who think that they possess among them all the bowels of the world Possess all the what Reginald I said bowels using an ordinary but very ill expressed metaphor The ladies and gentlemen to whom I allude not looking very clearly into the systems of pains and pleasures in accordance with which we have to live put their splay feet down now upon this ordinary operation and now upon that and call upon the world to curse the cruelty of those who will not agree with them A lady whose tippet is made from the skins of twenty animals who have been wired in the snow and then left to die of starvation Oh Reginald That is the way of it I am not now saying whether it is right or wrong The lady with the tippet will justify the wires and the starvation because as she will say she uses the fur An honest blanket would keep her just as warm But the fox who suffers perhaps ten minutes of agony should he not succeed as he usually does in getting away is hunted only for amusement It is true that the one fox gives amusement for hours to perhaps some hundred but it is only for amusement What riles me most is that these would be philosophers do not or will not see that recreation is as necessary to the world as clothes or food and the providing of the one is as legitimate a business as the purveying of the other People must eat and wear clothes And practically they must be amused They ignore the great doctrine of tanti I never heard of it You shall dear some day It is the doctrine by which you should regulate everything you do and every word you utter Now do you and Kate put on your hats and we ll walk to the bridge This preaching of a sermon took place after breakfast at Bragton on the morning of Saturday and the last order had reference to a scheme they had on foot to see the meet at the old kennels On the previous afternoon Reginald Morton had come into Dillsborough and had very quietly settled everything with the attorney Having made up his mind to do the thing he was very quick in the doing of it He hated the idea of secrecy in such an affair and when missus Masters asked him whether he had any objection to have the marriage talked about expressed his willingness that she should employ the town crier to make it public if she thought it expedient Oh mister Morton how very funny you are said the lady Quite in earnest missus Masters he replied Then he kissed the two girls who were to be his sisters and finished the visit by carrying off the younger to spend a day or two with her sister at Bragton I know he said whispering to Mary as he left the front door that I ought not to go out hunting so soon after my poor cousin s death but as he was a cousin once removed I believe I may walk as far as the bridge without giving offence When they were there they saw all the arrivals just as they were seen on the same spot a few months earlier by a very different party Mary and Kate stood on the bridge together while he remained a little behind leaning on the stile She poor girl had felt some shame in showing herself knowing that some who were present would have heard of her engagement and that others would be told of it as soon as she was seen Are you ashamed of what you are going to do he asked Ashamed I don t suppose that there is a girl in England so proud as I am at this minute I don t know that there is anything to be proud of but if you are not ashamed why shouldn t you show yourself Marriage is an honourable state She could only pinch his arm and do as he bade her Glomax in his tandem and Lord Rufford in his drag were rather late First there came one or two hunting men out of the town Runciman doctor Nupper and the hunting saddler Then there arrived Henry Stubbings with a string of horses mounted by little boys ready for his customers and full of wailing to his friend Runciman Here was nearly the end of March and the money he had seen since Christmas was little more as he declared than what he could put into his eye and see none the worse Charge em ten per cent interest said Runciman Then they thinks they can carry on for another year said Stubbings despondingly While this was going on Larry walked his favourite mare Bicycle on to the ground dressed with the utmost care but looking very moody almost fierce as though he did not wish anybody to speak to him Tony Tuppett who had known him since a boy nodded at him affectionately and said how glad he was to see him but even this was displeasing to Larry He did not see the girls on the bridge but took up his place near them He was thinking so much of his own unhappiness and of what he believed others would say of him that he saw almost nothing There he sat on his mare carrying out the purpose to which he had been led by Mary s message but wishing with all his heart that he was back again hidden within his own house at the other side of the wood Mary as soon as she saw him blushed up to her eyes then turning round looked with wistful eyes into the face of the man she was engaged to marry and with rapid step walked across the bridge up to the side of Larry s horse and spoke to him with her sweet low voice Larry she said He turned round to her very quickly showing how much he was startled Then she put up her hand to him and of course he took it Larry I am so glad to see you Did papa give you a message Yes Miss Masters He told me I know it all Say a kind word to me Larry I I I You know very well what s in my mind Though it were to kill me I should wish you well I hope you ll have a good hunt Larry Then she retired back to the bridge and again looked to her lover to know whether he would approve There were so few there and Larry had been so far apart from the others that she was sure no one had heard the few words which had passed between them nor could anyone have observed what she had done unless it were old Nupper or mister Runciman or Tony Tuppett But yet she thought that it perhaps was bold and that he would be angry But he came up to her and placing himself between her and Kate whispered into her ear Bravely done my girl After a little I will try to be as brave but I could never do it as well Larry in the meantime had moved his mare away and before the Master had arrived was walking slowly up his own road to Chowton Farm The Captain was soon there and Lord Rufford with his friends and Harry Stubbings string and Tony were set in motion But before they stirred there was a consultation to which Bean the gamekeeper was called as to the safety of Dillsborough Wood Dillsborough Wood had not been drawn yet since Scrobby s poison had taken effect on the old fox and there were some few who affected to think that there still might be danger Among these was the Master himself who asked Fred Botsey with a sneer whether he thought that such hounds as those were to be picked up at every corner But Bean again offered to eat any herring that might be there poison included and Lord Rufford laughed at the danger It s no use my having foxes Glomax if you won t draw the cover This the Lord said with a touch of anger and the Lord s anger if really roused might be injurious It was therefore decided that the hounds should again be put through the Bragton shrubberies just for compliment to the new squire and that then they should go off to Dillsborough Wood as rapidly as might be Larry walked his beast all the way up home very slowly and getting off her put her into the stable and went into the house Is anything wrong asked the mother Everything is wrong Then he stood with his back to the kitchen fire for nearly half an hour without speaking a word He was trying to force himself to follow out her idea of manliness and telling himself that it was impossible The first tone of her voice the first glance at her face had driven him home Why had she called him Larry again and again so tenderly in that short moment and looked at him with those loving eyes Then he declared to himself without uttering a word that she did not understand anything about it she did not comprehend the fashion of his love when she thought as she did think that a soft word would be compensation He looked round to see if his mother or the servant were there and when he found that the coast was clear he dashed his hands to his eyes and knocked away the tears He threw up both his arms and groaned and then he remembered her message Bid him be a man At that moment he heard the sound of horses and going near the window so as to be hidden from curious eyes as they passed he saw the first whip trot on with the hounds after him and Tony Tuppett among them Then there was a long string of horsemen all moving up to the wood and a carriage or two and after them the stragglers of the field He let them all go by and then he repeated the words again Bid him be a man He took up his hat jammed it on his head and went out into the yard As he crossed to the stables Runciman came up alone Why Larry you ll be late he said Go on mister Runciman I ll follow I ll wait till you are mounted You ll be better for somebody with you You ve got the mare have you You ll show some of them your heels if they get away from here Is she as fast as she was last year do you think Upon my word I don t know said Larry as he dragged himself into the saddle Shake yourself old fellow and don t carry on like that What is she after all but a girl The poor fellow looked at his intending comforter but couldn t speak a word A man shouldn t let hisself be put upon by circumstances so as to be only half hisself Hang it man cheer up and don t let em see you going about like that It ain t what a fellow of your kidney ought to be If they haven t found I m a nigger and by the holy he s away Come along Larry and forget the petticoats for half an hour So saying Runciman broke into a gallop and Larry s mare doing the same he soon passed the innkeeper and was up at the covert side just as Tony Tuppett with half a score of hounds round him was forcing his way through the bushes out of the coverts into the open field There ain t no poison this time mister Twentyman said the huntsman as setting his eye on a gap in the further fence he made his way across the field The fox headed away for a couple of miles towards Impington as was the custom with the Dillsborough foxes and then turning to the left was soon over the country borders into Ufford The pace from the first starting was very good Larry under such provocation as that of course would ride and he did ride Up as far as the country brook many were well up The land was no longer deep and as the field had not been scattered at the starting all the men who usually rode were fairly well placed as they came to the brook but it was acknowledged afterwards that Larry was over it the first Glomax got into it as he always does into brooks and young Runce hurt his horse s shoulder at the opposite bank Lord Rufford s horse balked it to the Lord s disgust but took it afterwards not losing very much ground Tony went in and out the crafty old dog knowing the one bit of hard ground Then they crossed Purbeck field as it is still called which twenty years since was a wide waste of land but is now divided by new fences very grievous to half blown horses Sir John Purefoy got a nasty fall over some stiff timber and here many a half hearted rider turned to the right into the lane Hampton and his Lordship and Battersby with Fred Botsey and Larry took it all as it came but through it all not one of them could give Larry a lead Then there was manoeuvring into a wood and out of it again and that saddest of all sights to the riding man a cloud of horsemen on the road as well placed as though they had ridden the line throughout In getting out of the road Hampton s horse slipped up with him and though he saw it all he was never able again to compete for a place The fox went through the Hampton Wick coverts without hanging a moment just throwing the hounds for two minutes off their scent at the gravel pits The check was very useful to Tony who had got his second horse and came up sputtering begging the field for G s sake to be in short to be anywhere but where they were Then they were off again down the hill to the left through Mappy springs and along the top of Ilveston copse every yard of which is grass till the number began to be select At last in a turnip field three yards from the fence they turned him over and Tony as he jumped off his horse among the hounds acknowledged to himself that Larry might have had his hand first upon the animal had he cared to do so Twentyman I ll give you two hundred for your mare said Lord Rufford Ah my Lord there are two things that would about kill me What are they Larry asked Harry Stubbings To offend his Lordship or to part with the mare You shall do neither said Lord Rufford but upon my word I think she s the fastest thing in this county All of which did not cure poor Larry but it helped to enable him to be a man The fox had been killed close to Norrington and the run was remembered with intense gratification for many a long day after It s that kind of thing that makes hunting beat everything else said Lord Rufford as he went home That day s sport certainly had been tanti and Glomax and the two counties boasted of it for the next three years CHAPTER XX BENEDICT Lady Penwether declared to her husband that she had never seen her brother so much cowed as he had been by Miss Trefoil s visit to Rufford It was not only that he was unable to assert his usual powers immediately after the attack made upon him but that on the following day at Scrobby s trial on the Saturday when he started to the meet and on the Sunday following when he allowed himself to be easily persuaded to go to church he was silent sheepish and evidently afraid of himself It is a great pity that we shouldn t take the ball at the hop she said to Sir George What ball and what hop Get him to settle himself There ought to be an end to this kind of thing now He has got out of this mess but every time it becomes worse and worse and he ll be taken in horribly by some harpy if we don t get him to marry decently I fancy he was very nearly going in this last affair Sir George in this matter did not quite agree with his wife It was in his opinion right to avoid Miss Trefoil but he did not see why his brother in law should be precipitated into matrimony with Miss Penge According to his ideas in such matters a man should be left alone Therefore as was customary with him when he opposed his wife he held his tongue You have been called in three or four times when he has been just on the edge of the cliff I don t know that that is any reason why he should be pushed over There is not a word to be said against Caroline She has a fine fortune of her own and some of the best blood in the kingdom But if your brother does not care for her That s nonsense George As for liking it s all the same to him Rufford is good natured and easily pleased and can like any woman Caroline is very good looking a great deal handsomer than that horrid creature ever was and with manners fit for any position I ve no reason to wish to force a wife on him but of course he ll marry and unless he s guided he ll certainly marry badly Is Miss Penge in love with him asked Sir George in a tone of voice that was intended to be provoking His wife looked at him asking him plainly by her countenance whether he was such a fool as that Was it likely that any untitled young lady of eight and twenty should be wanting in the capacity of being in love with a young lord handsome and possessed of forty thousand a year without encumbrances Sir George though he did not approve was not eager enough in his disapproval to lay any serious embargo on his wife s proceedings The first steps taken were in the direction of the hero s personal comfort He was flattered and petted as his sister knew how to flatter and pet him and Miss Penge in a quiet way assisted Lady Penwether in the operation For a day or two he had not much to say for himself but every word he did say was an oracle His horses were spoken of as demigods and his projected fishing operations for June and July became matters of most intense interest Evil things were said of Arabella Trefoil but in all the evil things said no hint was given that Lord Rufford had behaved badly or had been in danger Lady Penwether not quite knowing the state of his mind thought that there might still be some lurking affection for the young lady Did you ever see anybody look so vulgar and hideous as she did when she marched across the park asked Lady Penwether Thank goodness I did not see her said Miss Penge I never saw her look so handsome as when she came up to me said Lord Rufford But such a thing to do Awful said Miss Penge She is the pluckiest girl I ever came across in my life said Lord Rufford He knew very well what they were at and was already almost inclined to think that they might as well be allowed to have their way Miss Penge was ladylike quiet and good and was like a cool salad in a man s mouth after spiced meat And the money would enable him to buy the Purefoy property which would probably be soon in the market But he felt that he might as well give them a little trouble before he allowed himself to be hooked It certainly was not by any arrangement of his own that he found himself walking alone with Miss Penge that Sunday afternoon in the park nor did it seem to be by hers He thought of that other Sunday at Mistletoe when he had been compelled to wander with Arabella when he met the Duchess and when as he often told himself a little more good nature or a little more courage on her grace s part would have completed the work entirely Certainly had the Duke come to him that night after the journey from Stamford he would have capitulated As he walked along and allowed himself to be talked to by Miss Penge he did tell himself that she would be the better angel of the two She could not hunt with him as Arabella would have done but then a man does not want his wife to gallop across the country after him She might perhaps object to cigars and soda water after eleven o clock but then what assurance had he that Arabella would not have objected still more loudly She had sworn that she would never be opposed to his little pleasures but he knew what such oaths were worth Marriage altogether was a bore but having a name and a large fortune it was incumbent on him to transmit them to an immediate descendant And perhaps it was a worse bore to grow old without having specially bound any other human being to his interests How well I recollect that spot said Miss Penge It was there that Major Caneback took the fence That was not where he fell Oh no I did not see that It would have haunted me for ever had I done so But it was there that I thought he must kill himself That was a terrible time Lord Rufford Terrible to poor Caneback certainly Yes and to all of us Do you remember that fearful ball We were all so unhappy because you suffered so much It was bad And that woman who persecuted you We all knew that you felt it I felt that poor man s death Yes and you felt the other nuisance too I remember that you told me that you would cling on to my legs Eleanor said so and when it was explained to me what clinging on to your legs meant I remember saying that I wished to be understood as being one to help I love your sister so well that anything which would break her heart would make me unhappy You did not care for my own welfare in the matter What ought I say Lord Rufford in answer to that Of course I did care But I knew that it was impossible that you should really set your affections on such a person as Miss Trefoil I told Eleanor that it would come to nothing I was sure of it Why should it have come to nothing as you call it Because you are a gentleman and because she is not a lady I don t know that we women can quite understand how it is that you men amuse yourselves with such persons I didn t amuse myself I never thought you did very much There was something I suppose in her riding something in her audacity something perhaps in her vivacity but through it all I did not think that you were enjoying yourself You may be sure of this Lord Rufford that when a woman is not specially liked by any other woman she ought not to be specially liked by any man I have never heard that Miss Trefoil had a female friend From day to day there were little meetings and conversations of this kind till Lord Rufford found himself accustomed to Miss Penge s solicitude for his welfare In all that passed between them the lady affected a status that was altogether removed from that of making or receiving love There had come to be a peculiar friendship because of Eleanor A week of this kind of thing had not gone by before Miss Penge found herself able to talk of and absolutely to describe this peculiar feeling and could almost say how pleasant was such friendship divested of the burden of all amatory possibilities But through it all Lord Rufford knew that he would have to marry Miss Penge It was not long before he yielded in pure weariness Who has not felt as he stood by a stream into which he knew that it was his fate to plunge the folly of delaying the shock In his present condition he had no ease His sister threatened him with a return of Arabella Miss Penge required from him sensational conversation His brother in law was laughing at him in his sleeve His very hunting friends treated him as though the time were come In all that he did the young lady took an interest which bored him excessively to put an end to which he only saw one certain way He therefore asked her to be Lady Rufford before he got on his drag to go out hunting on the last Saturday in March Rufford she said looking up into his face with her lustrous eyes and speaking with a sweet low silvery voice are you sure of yourself Oh yes Quite sure of yourself Never so sure in my life Then dearest dearest Rufford I will not scruple to say that I also am sure And so the thing was settled very much to his comfort He could hardly have done better had he sought through all England for a bride She will be true to him and never give him cause for a moment s jealousy She will like his title his house and his property She will never spend a shilling more than she ought to do She will look very sharply after him but will not altogether debar him from his accustomed pleasures She will grace his table nurse his children and never for a moment give him cause to be ashamed of her He will think that he loves her and after a lapse of ten or fifteen years will probably really be fond of her From the moment that she is Lady Rufford she will love him as she loves everything that is her own In spite of all his antecedents no one doubted his faith in this engagement no one wished to hurry him very much When the proposition had been made and accepted and when the hero of it had gone off on his drag Miss Penge communicated the tidings to her friend I think he has behaved very wisely said Lady Penwether Well feeling as I do of course I think he has I hope he thinks the same of me I had many doubts about it but I do believe that I can make him a good wife Lady Penwether thought that her friend was hardly sufficiently thankful and strove to tell her so in her own gentle friendly way But Miss Penge held her head up and was very stout and would not acknowledge any cause for gratitude Lady Penwether when she saw how it was to be gave way a little Close friendship with her future sister in law would be very necessary to her comfort and Miss Penge since the law suit was settled had never been given to yielding My dear Rufford said the sister affectionately I congratulate you with all my heart I do indeed I am quite sure that you could not have done better I don t know that I could She is a gem of inestimable price and most warmly attached to you And if this property is to be bought of course the money will be a great thing Money is always comfortable Of course it is and then there is nothing to be desired If I had named the girl that I would have wished you to love it would have been Caroline Penge She need hardly have said this as she had in fact been naming the girl for the last three or four months The news was soon spread about the country and the fashionable world and everybody was pleased except the Trefoil family CHAPTER XXI ARABELLA S SUCCESS When Arabella Trefoil got back to Portugal Street after her visit to Rufford she was ill The effort she had made the unaccustomed labour and the necessity of holding herself aloft before the man who had rejected her were together more than her strength could bear and she was taken up to bed in a fainting condition It was not till the next morning that she was able even to open the letter which contained the news of John Morton s legacy When she had read the letter and realized the contents she took to weeping in a fashion very unlike her usual habits She was still in bed and there she remained for two or three days during which she had time to think of her past life and to think also a little of the future Old missus Green came to her once or twice a day but she was necessarily left to the nursing of her own maid Every evening Mounser Green called and sent up tender enquiries but in all this there was very little to comfort her There she lay with the letter in her hand thinking that the only man who had endeavoured to be of service to her was he whom she had treated with unexampled perfidy Other men had petted her had amused themselves with her and then thrown her over had lied to her and laughed at her till she had been taught to think that a man was a heartless cruel slippery animal made indeed to be caught occasionally but in the catching of which infinite skill was wanted and in which infinite skill might be thrown away But this man had been true to her to the last in spite of her treachery She knew that she was heartless herself and that she belonged to a heartless world but she knew also that there was a world of women who were not heartless Such women had looked down upon her as from a great height but she in return had been able to ridicule them They had chosen their part and she had chosen hers and had thought that she might climb to the glory of wealth and rank while they would have to marry hard working clergymen and briefless barristers She had often been called upon to vindicate to herself the part she had chosen and had always done so by magnifying in her own mind the sin of the men with whom she had to deal At this moment she thought that Lord Rufford had treated her villainously whereas her conduct to him had been only that which the necessity of the case required To Lord Rufford she had simply behaved after the manner of her class heartless of course but only in the way which the custom of the trade justified Each had tried to circumvent the other and she as the weaker had gone to the wall But John Morton had believed in her and loved her Oh how she wished that she had deserted her class and clung to him even though she should now have been his widow The legacy was a burden to her Even she had conscience enough to be sorry for a day or two that he had named her in his will And what would she do with herself for the future Her quarrel with her mother had been very serious each swearing that under no circumstances would she again consent to live with the other The daughter of course knew that the mother would receive her again should she ask to be received But in such case she must go back with shortened pinions and blunted beak Her sojourn with missus Green was to last for one month and at the end of that time she must seek for a home If she put John Morton s legacy out to interest she would now be mistress of a small income but she understood money well enough to know to what obduracy of poverty she would thus be subjected As she looked the matter closer in the face the horrors became more startling and more manifest Who would have her in their houses Where should she find society where the possibility of lovers What would be her life and what her prospects Must she give up for ever the game for which she had lived and own that she had been conquered in the fight and beaten even to death Then she thought over the long list of her past lovers trying to see whether there might be one of the least desirable at whom she might again cast her javelins But there was not one The tender messages from Mounser Green came to her day by day Mounser Green as the nephew of her hostess had been very kind to her but hitherto he had never appeared to her in the light of a possible lover He was a clerk in the Foreign Office waiting for his aunt s money a man whom she had met in society and whom she knew to be well thought of by those above him in wealth and rank but she had never regarded him as prey or as a man whom any girl would want to marry He was one of those of the other sex who would most probably look out for prey who if he married at all would marry an heiress She in her time had been on good terms with many such a one had counted them among her intimate friends had made use of them and been useful to them but she had never dreamed of marrying any one of them They were there in society for altogether a different purpose She had not hesitated to talk to Mounser Green about Lord Rufford and though she had pretended to make a secret of the place to which she was going when he had taken her to the railway she had not at all objected to his understanding her purpose Up to that moment there had certainly been no thought on her part of transferring what she was wont to call her affections to Mounser Green as a suitor But as she lay in bed thinking of her future life tidings were brought to her by missus Green that Mounser had accepted the mission to Patagonia Could it be that her destiny intended her to go out to Patagonia as the wife if not of one minister then of another There would be a career a way of living if not exactly that which she would have chosen Of Patagonia as a place of residence she had already formed ideas In some of those moments in which she had foreseen that Lord Rufford would be lost to her she had told herself that it would be better to reign in Hell than serve in Heaven Among Patagonian women she would probably be the first Among English ladies it did not seem that at present she had prospect of a high place It would be long before Lord Rufford would be forgotten and she had not space enough before her for forgettings which would require time for their accomplishment Mounser Green had declared with energy that Lord Rufford had behaved very badly There are men who feel it to be their mission to come in for the relief of ladies who have been badly treated If Mounser Green wished to be one of them on her behalf and to take her out with him to his very far away employment might not this be the best possible solution of her present difficulties On the evening of the third day after her return she was able to come down stairs and the line of thought which has been suggested for her induced her to undertake some trouble with the white and pink robe or dressing gown in which she had appeared Well my dear you are smart the old lady said Odious in woollen twould a saint provoke Were the last words which poor Narcissa spoke said Arabella who had long since provided herself with this quotation for such occasions I hope I am not exactly dying missus Green but I don t see why I should not object to be frightful as well as the young lady who was I suppose it s all done for Mounser s benefit Partly for you partly for Mounser and a good deal for myself What a very odd name Why did they call him Mounser I used to think it was because he was in the Foreign Office a kind of chaff as being half a Frenchman My mother s maiden name was Mounser and it isn t French at all I don t see why it should not be as good a Christian name as Willoughby or Howard Quite as good and much more distinctive There can t be another Mounser Green in the world And very few other young men like him At my time of life I find it very hard his going away And what will he do in such a place as that all alone and without a wife Why don t you make him take a wife There isn t time now He ll have to start in May Plenty of time Trousseaus are now got up by steam and girls are kept ready to marry at the shortest notice If I were you I should certainly advise him to take out some healthy young woman capable of bearing the inclemencies of the Patagonian climate As for that the climate is delicious said missus Green who certainly was not led by her guest s manner to suspect the nature of her guest s more recent intentions Mounser Green on this afternoon came to Portugal Street before he himself went out to dinner choosing the hour at which his aunt was wont to adorn herself And so you are to be the hero of Patagonia said Arabella as she put out her hand to congratulate him on his appointment I don t know about heroism but it seems that I am to go there said Mounser with much melancholy in his voice I should have thought you were the last man to leave London willingly Well yes I should have said so myself And I do flatter myself I shall be missed But what had I before me here This may lead to something Indeed you will be missed mister Green It s very kind of you to say so Patagonia It is such a long way off Then she began to consider whether he had ever heard of her engagement with the last Minister elect to that country That he should know all about Lord Rufford was a matter of course but what chance could there be for her if he also knew that other affair We were intimately acquainted with mister Morton in Washington and were surprised that he should have accepted it Poor Morton He was a friend of mine We used to call him the Paragon because he never made mistakes I had heard that you and Lady Augusta were a good deal with him in Washington We were indeed You do not know my good news as yet I suppose Your Paragon as you call him has left me five thousand pounds Of course it would be necessary that he should know it some day if this new plan of hers were to be carried out and if the plan should fail his knowing it could do no harm How very nice for you Poor Morton It is well that somebody should behave well when others treat one so badly mister Green Yes he has left me five thousand pounds Then she showed him the lawyer s letter Perhaps as I am so separated at present from all my own people by this affair with Lord Rufford you would not mind seeing the man for me Of course he promised to see the lawyer and to do everything that was necessary The truth is mister Green mister Morton was very warmly attached to me I was a foolish girl and could not return it I thought of it long and was then obliged to tell him that I could not entertain just that sort of feeling for him You cannot think now how bitter is my regret that I should have allowed myself to trust a man so false and treacherous as Lord Rufford and that I should have perhaps added a pang to the deathbed of one so good as mister Morton And so she told her little story not caring very much whether it were believed or not but finding it to be absolutely essential that some story should be told During the next day or two Mounser Green thought a great deal about it That the story was not exactly true he knew very well But it is not to be expected that a girl before her marriage should be exactly true about her old loves That she had been engaged to Lord Rufford and had been cruelly jilted by him he did believe That she had at one time been engaged to the Paragon he was almost sure The fact that the Paragon had left her money was a strong argument that she had not behaved badly to him But there was much that was quite certain The five thousand pounds were quite certain and the money though it could not be called a large fortune for a young lady would pay his debts and send him out a free man to Patagonia And the family honours were certainly true She was the undoubted niece of the Duke of Mayfair and such a connection might in his career be of service to him Lord Mistletoe was a prig but would probably be a member of the Government Mounser Green liked Dukes and loved a Duchess in his heart of hearts If he could only be assured that this niece would not be repudiated he thought that the speculation might answer in spite of any ambiguity in the lady s antecedents Have you heard about Arabella s good fortune young Glossop asked the next morning at the office You forget my boy said Mounser Green that the young lady of whom you speak is a friend of mine Oh lord So I did I beg your pardon old fellow There was no one else in the room at the moment and Glossop in asking the question had in truth forgotten what he had heard of this new intimacy Don t you learn to be ill natured Glossop And remember that there is no form so bad as that of calling young ladies by their Christian names I do know that poor Morton has left Miss Trefoil a sum of money which is at any rate evidence that he thought well of her to the last Of course it is I didn t mean to offend you I wouldn t do it for worlds as you are going away That afternoon when Green s back was turned Glossop gave it as his opinion that something particular would turn up between Mounser and Miss Trefoil an opinion which brought down much ridicule upon him from both Hoffmann and Archibald Currie But before that week was over in the early days of April they were forced to retract their opinion and to do honour to young Glossop s sagacity Mounser Green was engaged to Miss Trefoil and for a day or two the Foreign Office could talk of nothing else A very handsome girl said Lord Drummond to one of his subordinates I met her at Mistletoe As to that affair with Lord Rufford he treated her abominably And when Mounser showed himself at the office which he did boldly immediately after the engagement was made known they all received him with open arms and congratulated him sincerely on his happy fortune He himself was quite contented with what he had done and thought that he was taking out for himself the very wife for Patagonia CHAPTER XXII THE WEDDING No sooner did the new two lovers Mounser Green and Arabella Trefoil understand each other than they set their wits to work to make the best of their natural advantages The latter communicated the fact in a very dry manner to her father and mother Nothing was to be got from them and it was only just necessary that they should know what she intended to do with herself My dear mamma I am to be married some time early in May to mister Mounser Green of the Foreign Office I don t think you know him but I daresay you have heard of him He goes to Patagonia immediately after the wedding and I shall go with him Your affectionate daughter Arabella Trefoil That was all she said and the letter to her father was word for word the same But how to make use of those friends who were more happily circumstanced was matter for frequent counsel between her and mister Green In these days I do not think that she concealed very much from him To tell him all the little details of her adventures with Lord Rufford would have been neither useful nor pleasant but as to the chief facts reticence would have been foolish To the statement that Lord Rufford had absolutely proposed to her she clung fast and really did believe it herself That she had been engaged to John Morton she did not deny but she threw the blame of that matter on her mother and explained to him that she had broken off the engagement down at Bragton because she could not bring herself to regard the man with sufficient personal favour Mounser was satisfied but was very strong in urging her to seek yet once again the favour of her magnificent uncle and her magnificent aunt What good can they do us said Arabella who was almost afraid to make the appeal It would be everything for you to be married from Mistletoe he said People would know then that you were not blamed about Lord Rufford And it might serve me very much in my profession These things do help very much It would cost us nothing and the proper kind of notice would then get into the newspapers If you will write direct to the Duchess I will get at the Duke through Lord Drummond They know where we are going and that we are not likely to want anything else for a long time I don t think the Duchess would have mamma if it were ever so Then we must drop your mother for the time that s all When my aunt hears that you are to be married from the Duke s she will be quite willing that you should remain with her till you go down to Mistletoe Arabella who perhaps knew a little more than her lover could not bring herself to believe that the appeal would be successful but she made it It was a very difficult letter to write as she could not but allude to the rapid transference of her affections I will not conceal from you she said that I have suffered very much from Lord Rufford s heartless conduct My misery has been aggravated by the feeling that you and my uncle will hardly believe him to be so false and will attribute part of the blame to me I had to undergo an agonizing revulsion of feeling during which mister Green s behaviour to me was at first so considerate and then so kind that it has gone far to cure the wound from which I have been suffering He is so well known in reference to foreign affairs that I think my uncle cannot but have heard of him my cousin Mistletoe is certainly acquainted with him and I think that you cannot but approve of the match You know what is the position of my father and my mother and how little able they are to give us any assistance If you would be kind enough to let us be married from Mistletoe you will confer on both of us a very very great favour There was more of it but that was the first of the prayer and most of the words given above came from the dictation of Mounser himself She had pleaded against making the direct request but he had assured her that in the world as at present arranged the best way to get a thing is to ask for it You make yourself at any rate understood he said and you may be sure that people who receive petitions do not feel the hardihood of them so much as they who make them Arabella comforting herself by declaring that the Duchess at any rate could not eat her wrote the letter and sent it The Duchess at first was most serious in her intention to refuse She was indeed made very angry by the request Though it had been agreed at Mistletoe that Lord Rufford had behaved badly the Duchess was thoroughly well aware that Arabella s conduct had been abominable Lord Rufford probably had made an offer but it had been extracted from him by the vilest of manoeuvres The girl had been personally insolent to herself And this rapid change this third engagement within a few weeks was disgusting to her as a woman But unluckily for herself she would not answer the letter till she had consulted her husband As it happened the Duke was in town and while he was there Lord Drummond got hold of him Lord Drummond had spoken very highly of Mounser Green and the Duke who was never dead to the feeling that as the head of the family he should always do what he could for the junior branches had almost made a promise I never take such things upon myself he said but if the Duchess has no objection we will have them down to Mistletoe Of course if you wish it said the Duchess with more acerbity in her tone than the Duke had often heard there Wish it What do you mean by wishing it It will be a great bore Terrible But she is the only one there is and then we shall have done with it Done with it They will be back from Patagonia before you can turn yourself and then of course we must have them here Drummond tells me that mister Green is one of the most useful men they have at the Foreign Office just the man that one ought to give a lift to Of course the Duke had his way The Duchess could not bring herself to write the letter but the Duke wrote to his dear niece saying that they would be very glad to see her and that if she would name the day proposed for the wedding one should be fixed for her visit to Mistletoe You had better tell your mother and your father Mounser said to her What s the use The Duchess hates my mother and my father never goes near the place Nevertheless tell them People care a great deal for appearances She did as she was bid and the result was that Lord Augustus and his wife on the occasion of their daughter s marriage met each other at Mistletoe for the first time for the last dozen years Before the day came round Arabella was quite astonished to find how popular and fashionable her wedding was likely to be and how the world at large approved of what she was doing The newspapers had paragraphs about alliances and noble families and all the relatives sent tribute There was a gold candlestick from the Duke a gilt dish from the Duchess which came however without a word of personal congratulation and a gorgeous set of scent bottles from cousin Mistletoe The Connop Greens were lavish with sapphires the De Brownes with pearls and the Smijths with opal missus Gore sent a huge carbuncle which Arabella strongly suspected to be glass From her paternal parent there came a pair of silver nut crackers and from the maternal a second hand dressing case newly done up Old missus Green gave her a couple of ornamental butter boats and salt cellars innumerable came from distant Greens But there was a diamond ring with a single stone from a friend without a name which she believed to be worth all the rest in money value Should she send it back to Lord Rufford or make a gulp and swallow it How invincible must be the good nature of the man when he could send her such a present after such a rating as she had given him in the park at Rufford Do as you like Mounser Green said when she consulted him She very much wished to keep it But what am I to say and to whom Write a note to the jewellers saying that you have got it She did write to the jeweller saying that she had got the ring from a friend and the ring with the other tribute went to Patagonia He had certainly behaved very badly to her but she was quite sure that he would never tell the story of the ring to any one Perhaps she thought that as she had spared him in the great matter of eight thousand pounds she was entitled to take this smaller contribution It was late in April when she went down to Mistletoe the marriage having been fixed for the third of May After that they were to spend a fortnight in Paris and leave England for Patagonia at the end of the month The only thing which Arabella dreaded was the meeting with the Duchess When that was once over she thought that she could bear with equanimity all that could come after The week before her marriage could not be a pleasant week but then she had been accustomed to endure evil hours Her uncle would be blandly good natured Mistletoe should he be there would make civil speeches to compensate for his indifference when called upon to attack Lord Rufford Other guests would tender to her the caressing observance always shown to a bride But as she got out of the ducal carriage at the front door her heart was uneasy at the coming meeting The Duchess herself almost went to bed when the time came so much did she dread the same thing She was quite alone having felt that she could not bring herself to give the affectionate embrace which the presence of others would require She stood in the middle of the room and then came forward three steps to meet the bride Arabella she said I am very glad that everything has been settled so comfortably for you That is so kind of you aunt said Arabella who was watching the Duchess closely ready to jump into her aunt s arms if required to do so or to stand quite aloof Then the Duchess signified her pleasure that her cheek should be touched and it was touched missus Pepper will show you your room It is the same you had when you were here before Perhaps you know that mister Green comes down to Stamford on the first and that he will dine here on that day and on Sunday That will be very nice He had told me how it was arranged It seems that he knows one of the clergymen in Stamford and will stay at his house Perhaps you will like to go upstairs now That was all there was and that had not been very bad During the entire week the Duchess hardly spoke to her another word and certainly did not speak to her a word in private Arabella now could go where she pleased without any danger of meeting her aunt on her walks When Sunday came nobody asked her to go to church She did go twice Mounser Green accompanying her to the morning service but there was no restraint The Duchess only thought of her as a disagreeable ill conducted incubus who luckily was about to be taken away to Patagonia It had been settled on all sides that the marriage was to be very quiet The bride was of course consulted about her bridesmaids as to whom there was a little difficulty But a distant Trefoil was found willing to act in payment for the unaccustomed invitation to Mistletoe and one Connop Green young lady with one De Browne young lady and one Smijth young lady came on the same terms Arabella herself was surprised at the ease with which it was all done On the Saturday Lady Augustus came and on the Sunday Lord Augustus The parents of course kissed their child but there was very little said in the way either of congratulation or farewell Lord Augustus did have some conversation with Mounser Green but it all turned on the probability of there being whist in Patagonia On the Monday morning they were married and then Arabella was taken off by the happy bridegroom When the ceremony was over it was expected that Lady Augustus should take herself away as quickly as possible not perhaps on that very afternoon but at any rate on the next morning As soon as the carriage was gone she went to her own room and wept bitterly It was all done now Everything was over Though she had quarrelled daily with her daughter for the last twelve years to such an extent lately that no decently civil word ever passed between them still there had been something to interest her There had been something to fear and something to hope The girl had always had some prospect before her more or less brilliant Her life had had its occupation and future triumph was possible Now it was all over The link by which she had been bound to the world was broken The Connop Greens and the Smijths would no longer have her unless it might be on short and special occasions as a great favour She knew that she was an old woman without money without blood and without attraction whom nobody would ever again desire to see She had her things packed up and herself taken off to London almost without a word of farewell to the Duchess telling herself as she went that the world had produced no other people so heartless as the family of the Trefoils I wonder what you will think of Patagonia said Mounser Green as he took his bride away I don t suppose I shall think much As far as I can see one place is always like another But then you will have duties Not very heavy I hope Then he preached her a sermon expressing a hope as he went on that as she was leaving the pleasures of life behind her she would learn to like the work of life I have found the pleasures very hard she said He spoke to her of the companion he hoped to find of the possible children who might be dependent on their mother of the position which she would hold and of the manner in which she should fill it She as she listened to him was almost stunned by the change in the world around her She need never again seem to be gay in order that men might be attracted She made her promises and made them with an intention of keeping them but it may we fear be doubted whether he was justified in expecting that he could get a wife fit for his purpose out of the school in which Arabella Trefoil had been educated The two however will pass out of our sight and we can only hope that he may not be disappointed CHAPTER XXIII THE SENATOR S LECTURE NO I Wednesday April fourteenth was the day at last fixed for the Senator s lecture His little proposal to set England right on all those matters in which she had hitherto gone astray had created a considerable amount of attention The Goarly affair with the subsequent trial of Scrobby had been much talked about and the Senator s doings in reference to it had been made matter of comment in the newspapers Some had praised him for courage benevolence and a steadfast purpose Others had ridiculed his inability to understand manners different from those of his own country He had seen a good deal of society both in London and in the country and had never hesitated to express his opinions with an audacity which some had called insolence When he had trodden with his whole weight hard down on individual corns of course he had given offence as on the memorable occasion of the dinner at the parson s house in Dillsborough But on the whole he had produced for himself a general respect among educated men which was not diminished by the fact that he seemed to count quite as little on that as on the ill will and abuse of others For some days previous to the delivery of the lecture the hoardings in London were crowded with sesquipedalian notices of the entertainment so that Senator Gotobed s great oration on The Irrationality of Englishmen was looked to with considerable interest When an intelligent Japanese travels in Great Britain or an intelligent Briton in Japan he is struck with no wonder at national differences He is on the other hand rather startled to find how like his strange brother is to him in many things Crime is persecuted wickedness is condoned and goodness treated with indifference in both countries Men care more for what they eat than anything else and combine a closely defined idea of meum with a lax perception as to tuum Barring a little difference of complexion and feature the Englishman would make a good Japanese or the Japanese a first class Englishman But when an American comes to us or a Briton goes to the States each speaking the same language using the same cookery governed by the same laws and wearing the same costume the differences which present themselves are so striking that neither can live six months in the country of the other without a holding up of the hands and a torrent of exclamations And in nineteen cases out of twenty the surprise and the ejaculations take the place of censure The intelligence of the American displayed through the nose worries the Englishman The unconscious self assurance of the Englishman not always unaccompanied by a sneer irritates the American They meet as might a lad from Harrow and another from mister Brumby s successful mechanical cramming establishment The Harrow boy cannot answer a question but is sure that he is the proper thing and is ready to face the world on that assurance mister Brumby s paragon is shocked at the other s inaptitude for examination but is at the same time tortured by envy of he knows not what In this spirit we Americans and Englishmen go on writing books about each other sometimes with bitterness enough but generally with good final results But in the meantime there has sprung up a jealousy which makes each inclined to hate the other at first sight Hate is difficult and expensive and between individuals soon gives place to love I cannot bear Americans as a rule though I have been very lucky myself with a few friends Who in England has not heard that form of speech over and over again And what Englishman has travelled in the States without hearing abuse of all English institutions uttered amidst the pauses of a free handed hospitality which has left him nothing to desire mister Senator Gotobed had expressed his mind openly wheresoever he went but being a man of immense energy was not content with such private utterances He could not liberate his soul without doing something in public to convince his cousins that in their general practices of life they were not guided by reason He had no object of making money To give him his due we must own that he had no object of making fame He was impelled by that intense desire to express himself which often amounts to passion with us and sometimes to fury with Americans and he hardly considered much what reception his words might receive It was only when he was told by others that his lecture might give offence which possibly would turn to violence that he made inquiry as to the attendance of the police But though they should tear him to pieces he would say what he had to say It should not be his fault if the absurdities of a people whom he really loved were not exposed to light so that they might be acknowledged and abandoned He had found time to travel to Birmingham to Manchester to Liverpool to Glasgow and to other places and really thought that he had mastered his great subject He had worked very hard but was probably premature in thinking that he knew England thoroughly He had however undoubtedly dipped into a great many matters and could probably have told many Englishmen much that they didn t know about their own affairs He had poked his nose everywhere and had scrupled to ask no question He had seen the miseries of a casual ward the despair of an expiring strike the amenities of a city slum and the stolid apathy of a rural labourer s home He had measured the animal food consumed by the working classes and knew the exact amount of alcohol swallowed by the average Briton He had seen also the luxury of baronial halls the pearl drinking extravagances of commercial palaces the unending labours of our pleasure seekers as with Lord Rufford and the dullness of ordinary country life as experienced by himself at Bragton And now he was going to tell the English people at large what he thought about it all The great room at saint James s Hall had been secured for the occasion and Lord Drummond the Minister of State in foreign affairs had been induced to take the chair In these days our governments are very anxious to be civil to foreigners and there is nothing that a robust Secretary of State will not do for them On the platform there were many members of both Houses of Parliament and almost everybody connected with the Foreign Office Every ticket had been taken for weeks since The front benches were filled with the wives and daughters of those on the platform and back behind into the distant spaces in which seeing was difficult and hearing impossible the crowd was gathered at two s six d a head all of which was going to some great British charity From half past seven to eight Piccadilly and Regent Street were crammed and when the Senator came himself with his chairman he could hardly make his way in at the doors A great treat was expected but there was among the officers of police some who thought that a portion of the audience would not bear quietly the hard things that would be said and that there was an uncanny gathering of roughs about the street who were not prepared to be on their best behaviour when they should be told that old England was being abused Lord Drummond opened the proceedings by telling the audience in a voice clearly audible to the reporters and the first half dozen benches that they had come there to hear what a well informed and distinguished foreigner thought of their country They would not he was sure expect to be flattered Than flattery nothing was more useless or ignoble This gentleman coming from a new country in which tradition was of no avail and on which the customs of former centuries had had no opportunities to engraft themselves had seen many things here which in his eyes could not justify themselves by reason Lord Drummond was a little too prolix for a chairman and at last concluded by expressing his conviction that his countrymen would listen to the distinguished Senator with that courtesy which was due to a foreigner and due also to the great and brotherly nation from which he had come Then the Senator rose and the clapping of hands and kicking of heels was most satisfactory There was at any rate no prejudice at the onset English Ladies and Gentlemen he said I am in the unenviable position of having to say hard things to you for about an hour and a half together if I do not drive you from your seats before my lecture is done And this is the more the pity because I could talk to you for three hours about your country and not say an unpleasant word His Lordship has told you that flattery is not my purpose Neither is praise which would not be flattery Why should I collect three or four thousand people here to tell them of virtues the consciousness of which is the inheritance of each of them You are brave and generous and you are lovely to look at with sweetly polished manners but you know all that quite well enough without my telling you But it strikes me that you do not know how little prone you are to admit the light of reason into either your public or private life and how generally you allow yourselves to be guided by traditions prejudices and customs which should be obsolete If you will consent to listen to what one foreigner thinks though he himself be a man of no account you may perchance gather from his words something of the opinion of bystanders in general and so be able perhaps a little to rectify your gait and your costume and the tones of your voice as we are all apt to do when we come from our private homes out among the eyes of the public This was received very well The Senator spoke with a clear sonorous voice no doubt with a twang but so audibly as to satisfy the room in general I shall not he said dwell much on your form of government Were I to praise a republic I might seem to belittle your throne and the lady who sits on it an offence which would not be endured for a moment by English ears I will take the monarchy as it is simply remarking that its recondite forms are very hard to be understood by foreigners and that they seem to me to be for the most part equally dark to natives I have hardly as yet met two Englishmen who were agreed as to the political power of the sovereign and most of those of whom I have enquired have assured me that the matter is one as to which they have not found it worth their while to make inquiry Here a voice from the end of the hall made some protestation but the nature of the protest did not reach the platform But continued the Senator now rising into energy tho I will not meddle with your form of government I may I hope be allowed to allude to the political agents by which it is conducted You are proud of your Parliament We are said a voice I wonder of which house I do not ask the question that it may be answered because it is advisable at the present moment that there should be only one speaker That labour is unfortunately for me at present in my hands and I am sure you will agree with me that it should not be divided You mean probably that you are proud of your House of Commons and that you are so because it speaks with the voice of the people The voice of the people in order that it may be heard without unjust preponderance on this side or on that requires much manipulation That manipulation has in latter years been effected by your Reform bills of which during the last half century there have in fact been four or five the latter in favour of the ballot having been perhaps the greatest There have been bills for purity of elections very necessary bills for creating constituencies bills for abolishing them bills for dividing them bills for extending the suffrage and bills if I am not mistaken for curtailing it And what has been the result How many men are there in this room who know the respective nature of their votes And is there a single woman who knows the political worth of her husband s vote Passing the other day from the Bank of this great metropolis to its suburb called Brentford journeying as I did the whole way through continuous rows of houses I found myself at first in a very ancient borough returning four members double the usual number not because of its population but because it has always been so Here I was informed that the residents had little or nothing to do with it I was told though I did not quite believe what I heard that there were no residents The voters however at any rate the influential voters never pass a night there and combine their city franchise with franchises elsewhere I then went through two enormous boroughs one so old as to have a great political history of its own and the other so new as to have none It did strike me as odd that there should be a new borough with new voters and new franchises not yet ten years old in the midst of this city of London But when I came to Brentford everything was changed I was not in a town at all though I was surrounded on all sides by houses Everything around me was grim and dirty enough but I am supposed to have reached politically the rustic beauties of the country Those around me who had votes voted for the County of Middlesex On the other side of the invisible border I had just past the poor wretch with three s a day who lived in a grimy lodging or a half built hut but who at any rate possessed the political privilege Now I had suddenly emerged among the aristocrats and quite another state of things prevailed Is that a reasonable manipulation of the votes of the people Does that arrangement give to any man an equal share in his country And yet I fancy that the thing is so little thought of that few among you are aware that in this way the largest class of British labour is excluded from the franchise in a country which boasts of equal representation The chief object of your first Reform Bill was that of realising the very fact of representation Up to that time your members of the House of Commons were in truth deputies of the Lords or of other rich men Lord A or mister B or perhaps Lady C sent whom she pleased to Parliament to represent this or that town or occasionally this or that county That absurdity is supposed to be past and on evils that have been cured no one should dwell But how is it now I have a list in my memory for I would not care to make out so black a catalogue in legible letters of forty members who have been returned to the present House of Commons by the single voices of influential persons What will not forty voices do even in your Parliament And if I can count forty how many more must there be of which I have not heard Then there was a voice calling upon the Senator to name those men and other voices denying the fact I will name no one said the Senator How could I tell what noble friend I might put on a stool of repentance by doing so And he looked round on the gentlemen on the platform behind him But I defy any member of Parliament here present to get up and say that it is not so Then he paused a moment And if it be so is that rational Is that in accordance with the theory of representation as to which you have all been so ardent and which you profess to be so dear to you Is the country not over ridden by the aristocracy when Lord Lambswool not only possesses his own hereditary seat in the House of Lords but also has a seat for his eldest son in the House of Commons Then a voice from the back called out What the deuce is all that to you CHAPTER XXIV THE SENATOR S LECTURE NO II If I see a man hungry in the street said the Senator instigated by the question asked him at the end of the last chapter and give him a bit of bread I don t do it for my own sake but for his Up to this time the Britishers around him on the platform and those in the benches near to him had received what he said with a good grace The allusion to Lord Lambswool had not been pleasant to them but it had not been worse than they had expected But now they were displeased They did not like being told that they were taking a bit of bread from him in their own political destitution They did not like that he an individual should presume that he had bread to offer to them as a nation And yet had they argued it out in their own minds they would have seen that the Senator s metaphor was appropriate His purpose in being there was to give advice and theirs in coming to listen to it But it was unfortunate When I ventured to come before you here I made all this my business continued the Senator Then he paused and glanced round the hall with a defiant look And now about your House of Lords he went on I have not much to say about the House of Lords because if I understand rightly the feeling of this country it is already condemned No such thing Who told you that You know nothing about it These and other words of curt denial came from the distant corners and a slight murmur of disapprobation was heard even from the seats on the platform Then Lord Drummond got up and begged that there might be silence mister Gotobed had come there to tell them his views and as they had come there expressly to listen to him they could not without impropriety interrupt him That such will be the feeling of the country before long continued the Senator I think no one can doubt who has learned how to look to the signs of the times in such matters Is it possible that the theory of an hereditary legislature can be defended with reason For a legislature you want the best and wisest of your people You don t get them in America said a voice which was beginning to be recognised We try at any rate said the Senator Now is it possible that an accident of birth should give you excellence and wisdom What is the result Not a tenth of your hereditary legislators assemble in the beautiful hall that you have built for them And of that tenth the greater half consists of counsellors of state who have been placed there in order that the business of the country may not be brought to a standstill Your hereditary chamber is a fiction supplemented by the element of election the election resting generally in the very bosom of the House of Commons On this subject although he had promised to be short he said much more which was received for the most part in silence But when he ended by telling them that they could have no right to call themselves a free people till every legislator in the country was elected by the votes of the people another murmur was heard through the hall I told you said he waxing more and more energetic as he felt the opposition which he was bound to overcome that what I had to say to you would not be pleasant If you cannot endure to hear me let us break up and go away In that case I must tell my friends at home that the tender ears of a British audience cannot bear rough words from American lips And yet if you think of it we have borne rough words from you and have borne them with good humour Again he paused but as none rose from their seats he went on Proceeding from hereditary legislature I come to hereditary property It is natural that a man should wish to give to his children after his death the property which he has enjoyed during their life But let me ask any man here who has not been born an eldest son himself whether it is natural that he should wish to give it all to one son Would any man think of doing so by the light of his own reason out of his own head as we say Would any man be so unjust to those who are equal in his love were he not constrained by law and by custom more iron handed even than the law The Senator had here made a mistake very common with Americans and a great many voices were on him at once What law There is no law You know nothing about it Go back and learn What cried the Senator coming forward to the extreme verge of the platform and putting down his foot as though there were strength enough in his leg to crush them all Will any one have the hardihood to tell me that property in this country is not affected by primogeniture Go back and learn the law I know the law perhaps better than most of you Do you mean to assert that my Lord Lambswool can leave his land to whom he pleases I tell you that he has no more than a life interest in it and that his son will only have the same Then an eager Briton on the platform got up and whispered to the Senator for a few minutes during which the murmuring was continued My friend reminds me said the Senator that the matter is one of custom rather than law and I am obliged to him But the custom which is damnable and cruel is backed by law which is equally so If I have land I can not only give it all to my eldest son but I can assure the right of primogeniture to his son though he be not yet born No one I think will deny that there must be a special law to enable me to commit an injustice so unnatural as that Hence it comes that you still suffer under an aristocracy almost as dominant and in its essence as irrational as that which created feudalism The gentlemen collected on the platform looked at each other and smiled perhaps failing to catch the exact meaning of the Senator s words A lord here has a power as a lord which he cannot himself fathom and of which he daily makes an unconscious but most deleterious use He is brought up to think it natural that he should be a tyrant The proclivities of his order are generous and as a rule he gives more than he takes But he is as injurious in the one process as in the other Your ordinary Briton in his dealing with a lord expects payment in some shape for every repetition of the absurd title and payment is made The titled aristocrat pays dearer for his horse dearer for his coat dearer for his servant than other people But in return he exacts much which no other person can get Knowing his own magnanimity he expects that his word shall not be questioned If I may be allowed I will tell a little story as to one of the most generous gentlemen I have had the happiness of meeting in this country which will explain my meaning Then without mentioning names he told the story of Lord Rufford Goarly and Scrobby in such a way as partly to redeem himself with his audience He acknowledged how absolutely he had been himself befooled and how he had been done out of his money by misplaced sympathy He made missus Goarly s goose immortal and in imitating the indignation of Runce the farmer and Bean the gamekeeper showed that he was master of considerable humour But he brought it all round at last to his own purpose and ended this episode of his lecture by his view of the absurdity and illegality of British hunting I can talk about it to you he said and you will know whether I am speaking the truth But when I get home among my own people and repeat my lecture there as I shall do with some little additions as to the good things I have found here from which your ears may be spared I shall omit this story as I know it will be impossible to make my countrymen believe that a hundred harum scarum tomboys may ride at their pleasure over every man s land destroying crops and trampling down fences going if their vermin leads them there with reckless violence into the sweet domestic garden of your country residences and that no one can either stop them or punish them An American will believe much about the wonderful ways of his British cousin but no American will be got to believe that till he sees it I find said he that this irrationality as I have ventured to call it runs through all your professions We will take the Church as being the highest at any rate in its objects Then he recapitulated all those arguments against our mode of dispensing church patronage with which the reader is already familiar if he has attended to the Senator s earlier words as given in this chronicle In other lines of business there is even here in England some attempt made to get the man best suited for the work he has to do If any one wants a domestic servant he sets about the work of getting a proper person in a very determined manner indeed But for the care or as you call it the cure of his soul he has to put up with the man who has bought the right to minister to his wants or with him whose father wants a means of living for his younger son the elder being destined to swallow all the family property or with him who has become sick of drinking his wine in an Oxford college or with him again who has pleaded his cause successfully with a bishop s daughter It is not often that the British public is angered by abuse of the Church and this part of the lecture was allowed to pass without strong marks of disapprobation I have been at some trouble he continued to learn the very complex rules by which your army is now regulated and those by which it was regulated a very short time since Unhappily for me I have found it in a state of transition and nothing is so difficult to a stranger s comprehension as a transition state of affairs But this I can see plainly that every improvement which is made is received by those whom it most concerns with a horror which amounts almost to madness So lovely to the ancient British well born feudal instinct is a state of unreason that the very absence of any principle endears to it institutions which no one can attempt to support by argument Had such a thing not existed as the right to purchase military promotion would any satirist have been listened to who had suggested it as a possible outcome of British irrationality Think what it carries with it The man who has proved himself fit to serve his country by serving it in twenty foughten fields who has bled for his country and perhaps preserved his country shall rot in obscurity because he has no money to buy promotion whereas the young dandy who has done no more than glitter along the pavements with his sword and spurs shall have the command of men because he has so many thousand dollars in his pocket Buncombe shouted the inimical voice But is it Buncombe asked the intrepid Senator Will any one who knows what he is talking about say that I am describing a state of things which did not exist yesterday I will acknowledge that this has been rectified tho I see symptoms of relapse A fault that has been mended is a fault no longer But what I speak of now is the disruption of all concord in your army caused by the reform which has forced itself upon you All loyalty has gone all that love of his profession which should be the breath of a soldier s nostrils A fine body of fighting heroes is broken hearted not because injury has been done to them or to any of them but because the system had become peculiarly British by reason of its special absurdity and therefore peculiarly dear Buncombe again said the voice and the word was now repeated by a dozen voices Let any one show me that it is Buncombe If I say what is untrue do with me what you please If I am ignorant set me right and laugh at me But if what I say is true then your interruption is surely a sign of imbecility I say that the change was forced upon you by the feeling of the people but that its very expediency has demoralized the army because the army was irrational And how is it with the navy What am I to believe when I hear so many conflicting statements among yourselves During this last appeal however the noise at the back of the hall had become so violent that the Senator was hardly able to make his voice heard by those immediately around him He himself did not quail for a moment going on with his gestures and setting down his foot as though he were still confident in his purpose of overcoming all opposition He had not much above half done yet There were the lawyers before him and the Civil Service and the railways and the commerce of the country and the labouring classes But Lord Drummond and others near him were becoming terrified thinking that something worse might occur unless an end was put to the proceedings Then a superintendent of police came in and whispered to his Lordship A crowd was collecting itself in Piccadilly and saint James s Street and perhaps the Senator had better be withdrawn The officer did not think that he could safely answer for the consequences if this were carried on for a quarter of an hour longer Then Lord Drummond having meditated for a moment touched the Senator s arm and suggested a withdrawal into a side room for a minute mister Gotobed he said a little feeling has been excited and we had better put an end to this for the present Put an end to it I am afraid we must The police are becoming alarmed Oh of course you know best In our country a man is allowed to express himself unless he utters either blasphemy or calumny But I am in your hands and of course you must do as you please Then he sat down in a corner and wiped his brow Lord Drummond returned to the hall and there endeavoured to explain that the lecture was over for that night The row was so great that it did not matter much what he said but the people soon understood that the American Senator was not to appear before them again It was not much after nine o clock when the Senator reached his hotel Lord Drummond having accompanied him thither in a cab Good night mister Gotobed said his Lordship I cannot tell you how much I respect both your purpose and your courage but I don t know how far it is wise for a man to tell any other man much less a nation of all his faults You English tell us of ours pretty often said the Senator When he found himself alone he thought of it all giving himself no special credit for what he had done acknowledging to himself that he had often chosen his words badly and expressed himself imperfectly but declaring to himself through it all that the want of reason among Britishers was so great that no one ought to treat them as wholly responsible beings CHAPTER XXV THE LAST DAYS OF MARY MASTERS The triumph of Mary Masters was something more than a nine days wonder to the people of Dillsborough They had all known Larry Twentyman s intentions and aspirations and had generally condemned the young lady s obduracy thinking and not being slow to say that she would live to repent her perversity Runciman who had a thoroughly warm hearted friendship for both the attorney and Larry had sometimes been very severe on Mary She wants a touch of hardship he would say to bring her to If Larry would just give her a cold shoulder for six months she d be ready to jump into his arms And doctor Nupper had been heard to remark that she might go farther and fare worse If it were my girl I d let her know all about it Ribbs the butcher had said in the bosom of his own family When it was found that mister Surtees the curate was not to be the fortunate man the matter was more inexplicable than ever Had it then been declared that the owner of Hoppet Hall had proposed to her all these tongues would have been silenced and the refusal even of Larry Twentyman would have been justified But what was to be said and what was to be thought when it was known that she was to be the mistress of Bragton For a day or two the prosperity of the attorney was hardly to be endured by his neighbours When it was first known that the stewardship of the property was to go back into his hands his rise in the world was for a time slightly prejudicial to his popularity but this greater stroke of luck this latter promotion which would place him so much higher in Dillsborough than even his father or his grandfather had ever been was a great trial of friendship missus Masters felt it all very keenly All possibility for reproach against either her husband or her step daughter was of course at an end Even she did not pretend to say that Mary ought to refuse the squire Nor as far as Mary was concerned could she have further recourse to the evils of Ushanting and the peril of social intercourse with ladies and gentlemen It was manifest that Mary was to be a lady with a big house and many servants and no doubt a carriage and horses But still missus Masters was not quite silenced She had daughters of her own and would solace herself by declaring to them to her husband and to her specially intimate friends that of course they would see no more of Mary It wasn t for them to expect to be asked to Bragton and as for herself she would much rather not She knew her own place and what she was born to and wasn t going to let her own children spoil themselves and ruin their chances by dining at seven o clock and being waited upon by servants at every turn Thank God her girls could make their own beds and she hoped they might continue to do so at any rate till they had houses of their own And there seemed to Dillsborough to be some justification for all this in the fact that Mary was now living at Bragton and that she did not apparently intend to return to her father s house At this time Reginald Morton himself was still at Hoppet Hall and had declared that he would remain there till after his marriage Lady Ushant was living at the big house which was henceforth to be her home Mary was her visitor and was to be married from Bragton as though Bragton were her residence rather than the squire s The plan had originated with Reginald and when it had been hinted to him that Mary would in this way seem to slight her father s home he had proposed that all the Masters should come and stay at Bragton previous to the ceremony missus Masters yielded as to Mary s residence saying with mock humility that of course she had no room fit to give a marriage feast to the Squire of Bragton but she was steadfast in saying to her husband who made the proposition to her that she would stay at home Of course she would be present at the wedding but she would not trouble the like of Lady Ushant by any prolonged visiting The wedding was to take place about the beginning of May and all these things were being considered early in April At this time one of the girls was always at Bragton and Mary had done her best but hitherto in vain to induce her step mother to come to her When she heard that there was a doubt as to the accomplishment of the plan for the coming of the whole family she drove herself into Dillsborough in the old phaeton and then pleaded her cause for herself Mamma she said won t you come with the girls and papa on the twenty ninth I think not my dear The girls can go if they like it But it will be more fitting for papa and me to come to the church on the morning Why more fitting mamma Well my dear it will Dear mamma why why Of course my dear I am very glad that you are going to get such a lift My lift is marrying the man I love That of course is all right I have nothing on earth to say against it And I will say that through it all you have behaved as a young woman should I don t think you meant to throw yourself at him Mamma But as it has turned up you have to go one way and me another No But it must be so The Squire of Bragton is the Squire and his wife must act accordingly Of course you ll be visiting at Rufford and Hampton Wick and all the places I know very well who I am and what I came from I m not a bit ashamed of myself but I m not going to stick myself up with my betters Then mamma I shall come and be married from here It s too late for that now my dear No it is not And then a couple of tears began to roll down from her eyes I won t be married without your coming in to see me the night before and being with me in the morning when I dress Haven t I been a good child to you mamma Then the step mother began to cry also Haven t I mamma Yes my dear whimpered the poor woman And won t you be my mamma to the last won t you And she threw her arms round her step mother s neck and kissed her I won t go one way and you another He doesn t wish it It is quite different from that I don t care a straw for Hampton Wick and Rufford but I will never be separated from you and the girls and papa Say you will come mamma I will not let you go till you say you will come Of course she had her own way and missus Masters had to feel with a sore heart that she also must go out Ushanting She knew that in spite of her domestic powers she would be stricken dumb in the drawing room at Bragton and was unhappy Mary had another scheme in which she was less fortunate She took it into her head that Larry Twentyman might possibly be induced to come to her wedding She had heard how he had ridden and gained honour for himself on the day that the hounds killed their fox at Norrington and thought that perhaps her own message to him had induced him so far to return to his old habits And now she longed to ask him for her sake to be happy once again If any girl ever loved the man she was going to marry with all her heart this girl loved Reginald Morton He had been to her when her love was hopeless so completely the master of her heart that she could not realise the possibility of affection for another But yet she was pervaded by a tenderness of feeling in regard to Larry which was love also though love altogether of another kind She thought of him daily His future well being was one of the cares of her life That her husband might be able to call him a friend was among her prayers Had anybody spoken ill of him in her presence she would have resented it hotly Had she been told that another girl had consented to be his wife she would have thought that girl to be happy in her destiny When she heard that he was leading a wretched moping aimless life for her sake her heart was sad within her It was necessary to the completion of her happiness that Larry should recover his tone of mind and be her friend Reg she said leaning on his arm out in the park I want you to do me a favour Watch and chain Don t be an idiot You know I ve got a watch and chain Some girls like two To have the wooden bridge pulled down and a stone one built If any one touched a morsel of that sacred timber he should be banished from Bragton for ever I want you to ask mister Twentyman to come to our wedding Who s to do it Who s to bell the cat You I would sooner fight a Saracen or ride such a horse as killed that poor major Joking apart I don t see how it is to be done Why do you wish it Because I am so fond of him Oh indeed If you re a goose I ll hit you I am fond of him Next to you and my own people and Lady Ushant I like him best in all the world What a pity you couldn t have put him up a little higher I used to think so too only I couldn t If anybody loved you as he did me offered you everything he had in the world thought that you were the best in the world would have given his life for you would not you be grateful I don t know that I need wish to ask such a person to my wedding Yes you would if in that way you could build a bridge to bring him back to happiness And Reg though you used to despise him I never despised him A little I think before you knew him But he is not despicable Not at all my dear He is honest and good and has a real heart of his own I am afraid he has parted with that You know what I mean and if you won t be serious I shall think there is no seriousness in you I want you to tell me how it can be done Then he was serious and tried to explain to her that he could not very well do what she wanted He is your friend you know rather than mine but if you like to write to him you can do so This seemed to her to be very difficult and as she thought more of it almost impossible A written letter remains and may be taken as evidence of so much more than it means But a word sometimes may be spoken which if it be well spoken if assurance of its truth be given by the tone and by the eye of the speaker shall do so much more than any letter and shall yet only remain with the hearer as the remembrance of the scent of a flower remains Nevertheless she did at last write the letter and brought it to her husband Is it necessary that I should see it he asked Not absolutely necessary Then send it without But I should like you to see what I have said You know about things and if it is too much or too little you can tell me Then he read her letter which ran as follows DEAR mister TWENTYMAN Perhaps you have heard that we are to be married on Thursday May sixth I do so wish that you would come It would make me so much happier on that day We shall be very quiet and if you would come to the house at eleven you could go across the park with them all to the church I am to be taken in a carriage because of my finery Then there will be a little breakfast Papa and mamma and Dolly and Kate would be so glad and so would mister Morton But none of them will be half so glad as your old old affectionate friend MARY MASTERS If that don t fetch him said Reginald he is a poorer creature than I take him to be But I may send it Certainly you may send it And so the letter was sent across to Chowton Farm But the letter did not fetch him nor am I prepared to agree with mister Morton that he was a poor creature for not being fetched There are things which the heart of a man should bear without whimpering but which it cannot bear in public with that appearance of stoical indifference which the manliness of a man is supposed to require Were he to go should he be jovial before the wedding party or should he be sober and saturnine Should he appear to have forgotten his love or should he go about lovelorn among the wedding guests It was impossible at any rate impossible as yet that he should fall into that state of almost brotherly regard which it was so natural that she should desire But as he had determined to forgive her he went across that afternoon to the house and was the bearer of his own answer He asked missus Hopkins who came to the door whether she were alone and was then shown into an empty room where he waited for her She came to him as quickly as she could leaving Lady Ushant in the middle of the page she was reading and feeling as she tripped downstairs that the colour was rushing to her face You will come Larry she said No Miss Masters Let me be Mary till I am missus Morton she said trying to smile I was always Mary And then she burst into tears Why why won t you come I should only stalk about like a ghost I couldn t be merry as a man should be at a wedding I don t see how a man is to do such a thing She looked up into his face imploring him not to come for that she felt now to be impossible but imploring him to express in some way forgiveness of the sin she had committed against him But I shall think of you and shall wish you well And after that we shall be friends By and bye if he pleases He will please he does please Of course he saw what I wrote to you And now Larry if I have ever treated you badly say that you pardon me If I had known it he said How could I tell you till he had spoken And yet I knew it myself It has been so oh ever so long What could I do You will say that you will forgive me Yes I will say that And you will not go away from Chowton Oh no They tell me I ought to stay here and I suppose I shall stay I thought I d just come over and say a word I m going away to morrow for a month There is a fellow has got some fishing in Ireland Good bye Good bye Larry And I thought perhaps you d take this now Then he brought out from his pocket a little ruby ring which he had carried often in his pocket to the attorney s house thinking that perhaps then might come the happy hour in which he could get her to accept it But the hour had never come as yet and the ring had remained in the little drawer beneath his looking glass It need hardly be said that she now accepted the gift CHAPTER XXVI CONCLUSION The Senator for Mickewa whose name we have taken for a book which might perhaps have been better called The Chronicle of a Winter at Dillsborough did not stay long in London after the unfortunate close of his lecture He was a man not very pervious to criticism nor afraid of it but he did not like the treatment he had received at saint James s Hall nor the remarks which his lecture produced in the newspapers He was angry because people were unreasonable with him which was surely unreasonable in him who accused Englishmen generally of want of reason One ought to take it as a matter of course that a bull should use his horns and a wolf his teeth The Senator read everything that was said of him and then wrote numerous letters to the different journals which had condemned him Had any one accused him of an untruth Or had his inaccuracies been glaring Had he not always expressed his readiness to acknowledge his own mistake if convicted of ignorance But when he was told that he had persistently trodden upon all the corns of his English cousins he declared that corns were evil things which should be abolished and that with corns such as these there was no mode of abolition so efficacious as treading on them I am sorry that you should have encountered anything so unpleasant Lord Drummond said to him when he went to bid adieu to his friend at the Foreign Office And I am sorry too my Lord for your sake rather than my own A man is in a bad case who cannot endure to hear of his faults Perhaps you take our national sins a little too much for granted I don t think so my Lord If you knew me to be wrong you would not be so sore with me Nevertheless I am under deep obligation for kind hearted hospitality If an American can make up his mind to crack up everything he sees here there is no part of the world in which he can get along better He had already written a long letter home to his friend mister Josiah Scroome and had impartially sent to that gentleman not only his own lecture but also a large collection of the criticisms made on it A few weeks afterwards he took his departure and when we last heard of him was thundering in the Senate against certain practices on the part of his own country which he thought to be unjust to other nations Don Quixote was not more just than the Senator or more philanthropic nor perhaps more apt to wage war against the windmills Having in this our last chapter given the place of honour to the Senator we must now say a parting word as to those countrymen of our own who have figured in our pages Lord Rufford married Miss Penge of course and used the lady s fortune in buying the property of Sir John Purefoy We may probably be safe in saying that the acquisition added very little to his happiness What difference can it make to a man whether he has forty or fifty thousand pounds a year or at any rate to such a man Perhaps Miss Penge herself was an acquisition He did not hunt so often or shoot so much and was seen in church once at least on every Sunday In a very short time his friends perceived that a very great change had come over him He was growing fat and soon disliked the trouble of getting up early to go to a distant meet and before a year or two had passed away it had become an understood thing that in country houses he was not one of the men who went down at night into the smoking room in a short dressing coat and a picturesque cap Miss Penge had done all this He had had his period of pleasure and no doubt the change was desirable but he sometimes thought with regret of the promise Arabella Trefoil had made him that she would never interfere with his gratification At Dillsborough everything during the summer after the Squire s marriage fell back into its usual routine The greatest change made there was in the residence of the attorney who with his family went over to live at Hoppet Hall giving up his old house to a young man from Norrington who had become his partner but keeping the old office for his business missus Masters did I think like the honour and glory of the big house but she would never admit that she did And when she was constrained once or twice in the year to give a dinner to her step daughter s husband and Lady Ushant that I think was really a period of discomfort to her When at Bragton she could at any rate be quiet and Mary s caressing care almost made the place pleasant to her mister Runciman prospers at the Bush though he has entirely lost his best customer Lord Rufford But the U R U is still strong in spite of the philosophers and in the hunting season the boxes of the Bush Inn are full of horses The club goes on without much change mister Masters being very regular in his attendance undeterred by the grandeur of his new household And Larry is always there with increased spirit for he has dined two or three times lately at Hampton Wick having met young Hampton at the Squire s house at Bragton On this point Fred Botsey was for a time very jealous but he found that Larry s popularity was not to be shaken and now is very keen in pushing an intimacy with the owner of Chowton Farm Perhaps the most stirring event in the neighbourhood has been the retirement of Captain Glomax from the post of Master When the season was over he made an application to Lord Rufford respecting certain stable and kennel expenses which that nobleman snubbed very bluntly Thereupon the Captain intimated to the Committee that unless some advances were made he should go The Committee refused and thereupon the captain went not altogether to the dissatisfaction of the farmers with whom an itinerant Master is seldom altogether popular Then for a time there was great gloom in the U R U What hunting man or woman does not know the gloom which comes over a hunting county when one Master goes before another is ready to step in his shoes There had been a hope a still growing hope that Lord Rufford would come forward at any such pinch but since Miss Penge had come to the front that hope had altogether vanished There was a word said at Rufford on the subject but Miss Penge or Lady Rufford as she was then at once put her foot on the project and extinguished it Then when despair was imminent old mister Hampton gave way and young Hampton came forward acknowledged on all sides as the man for the place A Master always does appear at last though for a time it appears that the kingdom must come to an end because no one will consent to sit on the throne Perhaps the most loudly triumphant man in Dillsborough was mister Mainwaring the parson when he heard of the discomfiture of Senator Gotobed He could hardly restrain his joy and confided first to doctor Nupper and then to mister Runciman his opinion that of all the blackguards that had ever put their foot in Dillsborough that vile Yankee was the worst mister Gotobed was no more a Yankee than was the parson himself but of any distinction among the citizens of the United States mister Mainwaring knew very little A word or two more must be said of our dear friend Larry Twentyman for in finishing this little story we must own that he has in truth been our hero He went away on his fishing expedition and when he came back the girl of his heart had become missus Morton Hunting had long been over then but the great hunting difficulty was in course of solution and Larry took his part in the matter When there was a suggestion as to a committee of three than which nothing for hunting purposes can be much worse there was a question whether he should not be one of them This nearly killed both the Botseys The evil thing was prevented by the timely pressure put on old mister Hampton but the excitement did our friend Larry much good Bicycle and the other mare were at once summered with the greatest care and it is generally understood that young Hampton means to depend upon Larry very much in regard to the Rufford side of the country Larry has bought Goarly s two fields Goarly having altogether vanished from those parts and is supposed to have Dillsborough Wood altogether in his charge He is frequently to be seen at Hoppet Hall calling there every Saturday to take down the attorney to the Dillsborough club as was his habit of old but it would perhaps be premature to say that there are very valid grounds for the hopes which missus Masters already entertains in reference to Kate Kate is still too young and childish to justify any prediction in that quarter What further need be said as to Reginald and his happy bride Very little except that in the course of her bridal tour she did gradually find words to give him a true and accurate account of all her own feelings from the time at which he first asked her to walk with him across the bridge over the Dill and look at the old place They had both passed their childish years there but could have but little thought that they were destined then to love and grow old together I was longing longing longing to come she said And why didn t you come How little you know about girls Of course I had to go with the one I I I well with the one I did not love down to the very soles of his feet And then there was the journey with the parrot I rather liked the bird I don t know that you said very much but I think you would have said less if there had been no bird In fact I have been a fool all along You weren t a fool when you took me out through the orchard and caught me when I jumped over the wall Do you remember when you asked me all of a sudden whether I should like to be your wife You weren t a fool then But you knew what was coming Not a bit of it I knew it wasn t coming I had quite made up my mind about that I was as sure of it oh as sure of it as I am that I ve got you now And then it came like a great thunderclap A thunderclap Mary Well yes I wasn t quite sure at first You might have been laughing at me mightn t you Just the kind of joke for me How was I to understand it all in a moment And you made me repeat all those words I believed it then or I shouldn t have said them I knew that must be serious And so she deified him and sat at his feet looking up into his eyes and fooled him for a while into the most perfect happiness that a man ever knows in this world But she was not altogether happy herself till she had got Larry to come to her at the house at Bragton and swear to her that he would be her friend END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG
