XXII IN THE HERMIT S CAVE XXIII LOST IN THE DESERT MAZE XXIV CONCLUSION The Pony Rider Boys in the Alkali CHAPTER I THE DESERT S MYSTIC SPELL If this is the desert then I think I prefer mountains decided Stacy Brown It is not the desert We have not reached it yet This is the Diamond Range replied Tom Parry who was to guide the Pony Rider Boys across the great Nevada Desert We shall soon be there however You ll know the place when you see it Chunky said Ned Rector And feel it too I guess added Tad Butler under his breath We have the desert on each side of us now continued the guide Were you to fire a rifle to the right or left your bullet would fall on the baking alkali of the desert Then if we re so near why not get out in the open instead of floundering through these hills questioned Stacy I m thinking you ll wish you were back in the hills before many days laughed the guide mister Parry has his own reasons for following this trail Master Stacy interposed Professor Zepplin We are entirely in his hands and it is not for us to question the wisdom of his decision The guide nodded Parry was a splendid type of the plainsman of the great West Tall straight clear eyed his bronzed cheeks fairly glistening in the sunlight he would have attracted attention anywhere At present he sat on his pony motionless the broad sombrero tilted upward above his forehead as he peered into the amber haze that hung over the western horizon Yes we shall reach the desert soon enough We are heading for the Newark Valley now and should be there in time to make camp this afternoon providing the weather is satisfactory announced Parry more to himself than to the others Weather weather stammered Professor Zepplin What s the matter with the weather One hundred in the shade Isn t that matter enough grunted Stacy How do you know Chunky You haven t seen any shade to day demanded Ned Rector There isn t a patch of shade as large as a man s hand in this whole country so far as I have been able to observe And still less in the country we are about to enter added the guide Tad Butler however had been observing the guide keenly Though the lad had asked no questions he had caught a note of anxiety in the tone as well as in the apprehensive glances that Parry kept continually casting to the westward The guide catching Tad s inquiring look smiled and nodded You should always keep your eyes on the weather in this country especially when on the alkali he told the boy after the party had started on again Why more there than elsewhere mister Parry Because storms here are frequently attended with no little peril You ll see some of them no doubt before we reach the end of our journey and you will wish you hadn t But there s no sign of storm now protested Tad Perhaps not to you young man Do you see that haze settling down like a fog on the western horizon Yes I ve been looking at it a golden fog The guide smiled grimly I wouldn t call it exactly golden I should call it fiery said the guide Has it any particular meaning May mean most anything Means storm of some kind perhaps rain and maybe wind If it passes we ll drop out of here and make camp on the desert to night That will be fine said Tad We are all crazy for the desert Since we started out on our trips last spring we have experienced almost everything that could happen to us on mountain and plain But not including the desert No You ll find it different very different I suppose you know every foot of it in fact its every mood do you not questioned Tad The guide for the moment lost in thought finally turned to the lad again Moods did you say Well that describes it The desert is as moody as an old hen with a brood of chickens Know the Nevada Desert Sometimes I think I do then again I know I don t But you could not get lost I have smiled the guide I ve been wandering about the alkali for days without being able to find my way back If you are able to read trails and the droop of the scattering sage brush you will have made a long stride toward knowing your way about the desert I don t understand wondered the lad No of course not It s a long story but when we have time I will initiate you into the mysteries of reading the desert signs The west is clearing up That s good the guide exclaimed in a relieved tone Which means that we go on Yes Are we turning off into the desert did you say asked Walter Perkins with sparkling eyes Well not just yet Master Walter We shall have to refill our water bags before leaving the range I take it you boys would not care to be without water No I guess not But where are you going to get it asked Ned About a mile further on there should be a mountain stream There will not be much water in it just now but we shall be able to fill our bags and water the stock I guess Hooray shouted the boys The call of the desert is stronger than ever averred Tad You are not the first ones who have felt that way young man The call of the desert as you put it has lured many a poor victim to his death Water is the all important thing when on a journey of this kind and we shall have to be vigilant that we do not allow ourselves to be without it As the guide had said the stream when they finally came up with it more than two hours later was a mere rivulet Call that a stream sniffed Stacy No it s a freshet replied Ned Rector You might take a swim in it were it not for the danger of drowning How are we going to get any water unless we dip it up with a spoon asked Tad I ll show you smiled the guide dismounting Already the stock had sniffed the presence of water even though there was so little of it The ponies chafed at their bits and snorted while the burros of the pack train tossed their heads in their impatience I used to have a plaything that worked just like the heads of those lazy burros Stacy informed his companions wisely That s about your gait growled Ned You didn t think so when he saved our lives in the Ruby Mountain reminded Tad

none	none	Ned confirmed Walter Don t be ungrateful for small favors I apologize Master Chunky announced Ned removing his sombrero and unbending in a ceremonious bow to the fat boy We will now make a water hole Come along if you wish to know how it is done called the guide Leading the ponies and pack animals down along the slender water course until they had reached a natural pocket the guide halted With a rubber blanket he formed a basin in the depression in the rocks through which the water had been trickling and losing itself far down in the earth Two of the Pony Rider Boys held the blanket in place while it was slowly filling with water Now Master Stacy if you will be good enough to fetch one of your pails we will water the stock first Stacy did so To save time Walter brought another pail so that this could be filled while his companion was giving the water to one of their animals It was a slow process and by the time the six ponies and four burros had drunk their fill something more than an hour had passed By this time the rubber blanket had been thoroughly cleaned by constant rubbing Bring on the canteens and water bags directed Tom Parry We ll have water enough to carry us through a few days of desert life at any rate Load the burros down The animals now having satisfied their thirst were nibbling gingerly at the scant growth of sage brush It was not a tender morsel at any time but from that time on they would be obliged to subsist almost entirely on the bitter stuff Have you boys filled up asked Tom looking about Better drink enough to last you for the rest of the day We shall have to use our water sparingly for a time now Take on a supply while you have the chance How about you Chunky laughed Ned Rector Think I m a camel demanded Stacy with an air of indignation Now will you be good Ned Rector laughed Tad Even the stolid face of the guide relaxed in a broad smile of amusement Then if you are all supplied we had better be on our way If we are going to camp on the alkali to night we shall have to make time between this and sundown It s about three hours high With a whoop and a hurrah the boys swung into their saddles heading joyously for the Newark Valley and the silent mysterious desert that in the dim misty past had been a great inland sea Readers of the preceding volumes of this series will recall how the Pony Rider Boys came to spend their summer vacation on horseback under the guardianship of Walter Perkins tutor Professor Zepplin With a capable mountain guide their first journey was through the wildest part of the Rocky Mountains where they met with a series of rousing adventures and hair breadth escapes experiences calculated to try the stoutest hearts It was here that the young explorers hunted big game here that they discovered a valuable mine that had been the goal of prospectors for many years past All this was outlined in the first volume of the series THE PONY RIDER BOYS IN THE ROCKIES In the second volume THE PONY RIDER BOYS IN TEXAS was narrated how the four lads joined in a cattle drive across the plains of Texas becoming real cowboys Being by this time well hardened physically they were able to do men s work in rounding up the stampeding cattle which led them into many thrilling adventures It will be recalled too how during a visit to the mysterious church of San Miguel the Pony Rider Boys solved the veiled riddle of the plains which marked the end of the most eventful journey of their lives In the third volume THE PONY RIDER BOYS IN MONTANA we find the plucky lads following the old Custer trail over mountain and plain It will be remembered how Tad Butler while chasing a bear that had disturbed their camp overheard a plot to stampede and slaughter the herd of sheep belonging to a rancher whom they knew how the lad managed to escape from the men who sought his life his eventual capture by the Blackfeet Indians his escape and the final solving of the mystery of the old Custer trail during which the boys were in the thick of a battle between cowboys and sheep herders In the volume preceding the present one the Pony Rider Boys were once more in the saddle in search of further adventure In THE PONY RIDER BOYS IN THE OZARKS they met with a series of disasters and exciting experiences which tested their courage almost to the breaking point They were beset by a band of robbers who stole their ponies Nearly all the party one by one was lost in the fastnesses of the Ozark wilderness It will be recalled how the boys during a visit to the Red Star Mine were caught in a wreck far underground how a car of dynamite exploded making them prisoners in a rocky tomb and how after being rescued by a mountain girl they discovered the real secret of the Ruby Mountain narrowly escaping with their lives in doing so No sooner had they brought this eventful trip to a close than they set out to face the perils of the great silent desert of Nevada They were almost upon it now Its spell was upon them and the lads fell silent as they waited anxiously for the first sight of the land which they had journeyed so far to gaze upon They had not long to wait after leaving the water hole where they had replenished their supply The guide at last rode out upon a rocky promontory where he halted waiting for the others of the party to come up with him Where s the desert is that it demanded Ned riding up beside him The guide raised his hand in a sweeping gesture The desert lies before you he answered his eyes traveling meditatively over the miles of waste and mottled landscape A brazen glare lay over the scene while up from the white alkali flats rose a wave of heat that was suffocating Old dried up water sinks lay white and glistening here and there framed by vast areas of sage brush while on beyond in the blue distance lay miles and miles of monotonous billowing hills and mountains Whew gasped Chunky mopping the perspiration from his brow This is somewhat hotter than Chillicothe Missouri I wish I had a cake of ice to put under my hat Beautiful Grand murmured Professor Zepplin Reminds me of a Turkish bath I was in once in saint Louis added Ned Tad Butler was silent He was too profoundly impressed even to speak and even the guide familiar as he was with the scene was silent and thoughtful too He understood full well the perils the pitfalls for the unwary that lay along the pathway of those who sought to traverse that barren waste At last he turned to Professor Zepplin Shall we move he asked The Professor nodded One of you boys get behind the burros and start them along please requested the guide Stacy Brown complied gleefully No more pleasant task could have been assigned to him than that of prodding the lazy pack bearers Forward commanded Tom Parry The boys clucked to their ponies Not an animal moved Surprised the lads brought their spurs against the flanks that they could feel were trembling a little A strange unlooked for thing occurred With whinnies of terror the little animals reared and plunged Before their puzzled riders could control them every pony in the outfit had whirled suddenly and began plunging along on the back trail A chorus of whoa s rose from the Pony Rider Boys Quirt and spur were used freely and firm hands on the bridle reins quickly checked the sudden rush By dint of force and persuasion the boys finally succeeded in forcing their mounts back That is all had done so save Stacy Brown His pony was spinning like a top while Stacy red faced and perspiring was uttering loud angry shouts driving in spur and raining quick short blows on the animal s rump The burros had moved just far enough away to be out of reach of Stacy s plunging animal At last it threw itself violently to the ground Stacy by a remarkably lively jump cleared his falling mount but not a second too soon to save himself from being pinned beneath it He sat down on the animal s head puffing from his exertions After a minute during which the other boys laughed so heartily that their own ponies nearly got the better of them again Stacy rose and began prodding his mount with the end of the quirt urging it to get up again But the pony refused to budge He s hog tied nodded the guide riding up Let him stay there till he gets ready to move No use trying to hurry the beast He s too much scared Scared at what questioned Stacy looking up apprehensively Yes that s what I d like to know agreed Ned I don t see anything that looks like a scare The guide was looking down at the animal pityingly Tad thought What are they so frightened at mister Parry asked the lad My boy they are afraid of the desert replied the guide solemnly CHAPTER II THE FIRST NIGHT IN CAMP The desert the Pony Riders gasped in chorus Yes It is not an uncommon thing They seem to realize instinctively that there is danger off there Even in animals that never have been near the desert you will find the same inborn dread of the alkali flats And I don t know that I blame them any But is my broncho going to lie here all day queried Chunky If that s his idea I might as well give him another argument that will make him change his mind Let him alone He ll be better off if you do not force him When he gets up be gentle but firm with him That s the strangest thing I ever saw said Tad quietly Most remarkable agreed the Professor The faces of the boys were serious They too began to perceive the feeling that had stirred the ponies to resist when turned toward the silent plains that lay spread for mile upon mile before them After a few minutes Stacy s pony scrambled to its feet The lad was in the saddle in a twinkling Now I guess you ll go where I want you to Whoa Quit that b b b b bucking The animal had gone into a series of jolting bucks with back arched and head well down The fat boy held his seat well His face was red and streaked with perspiration which ran down it in tiny rivulets under the violent exercise to which he had just been subjected The boys forgot the serious side of the incident in their enjoyment of their companion s discomfiture Tom Parry gazed upon the scene with more than ordinary curiosity It was the first opportunity he had had of observing a Pony Rider Boy in action At that moment Stacy Brown was most distinctly in action Most of the time there was a broad patch of daylight under him and when he hit the saddle it was with a jolt that seemed as if it must jar his head from his body Put some salt on his tail suggested Ned Rector Y y y you do it gasped Chunky which brought a roar of laughter from the whole party Yes why don t you teased Tad It s the only way you can make good Salting down horse is not my business laughed Ned All at once the pony whirled heading down the mountain side with a disconcerting rush that nearly brought disaster upon its rider With a shout the rest of the boys urged their mounts into a jog trot and followed on down the trail as fast as they dared for the descent was steep and dangerous He ll break his neck cried the Professor After that bucking I m sure Chunky s neck is too well fastened to come off laughed Tad Stacy was out of sight They could hear him yelling at his broncho so they knew he was still in the saddle and right side up The other ponies apparently having forgotten their fear were following the leader willingly now All at once they saw lad and mount burst into view on the plain below He s on the desert shouted Tad Laughing and shouting words of encouragement to the fat boy the Pony Riders hastened to the base of the hill Stacy Brown was still busily engaged trying to subdue his pony though some of the lads shrewdly suspected that their companion was urging the animal on in order to show off his horsemanship In a moment more they too were in difficulties No sooner had their bronchos set foot on the desert than a sudden panic once more possessed them Professor Zepplin s pony whirled on its haunches then began climbing the rocks with the agility of a squirrel The others however had troubles of their own which saved the Professor from being laughed at The animals seemed determined not to be forced to go on and it required severe measures to induce them to take up the desert trail Tom Parry s mount did not exhibit the same fear as did the others Still it gave him more or less trouble appearing to be excited in spite of itself by the actions of its companions At last they succeeded in lining the animals up in an orderly formation Their next move was to get the burros moving along ahead of them The way being open and level there was no necessity for leading the pack animals now These could take care of themselves without danger to the outfit And this is the desert marveled the Professor It is smiled the guide Looks to me more like a landscape of German measles averred Stacy as they moved along through scattering sage brush and open sandy stretches Now that they had reached the plain itself they discovered that it was not one level stretch of land Instead the country was rolling here and there were wide reaches of whitish desert sands and alkali sinks The atmosphere was like an oven Not a breath of air was stirring Already the lads were mopping their brows and fanning their faces with their sombreros while spots of dark shining moisture on the ponies sides bore evidence that they too felt the baking heat I say fellows let s find some shade called Stacy All right go ahead and we ll follow laughed Tad I ll ride up to the top of that knoll and make an observation Tom Parry smiled appreciatively as the lad galloped up the sharp rise of ground where Chunky sat on his pony shading his eyes as he gazed off over the cheerless desert Well how about that shade shouted Ned Stacy turned disconsolately and rode back to his companions There isn t any he said Of course not laughed Ned But I know how to make some added the fat boy Slipping from his pony he cut some sage brush which he fashioned about his head in the shape of a hood so that it gave his perspiring face some protection from the intense glare of the sun Now all you need is a strip of mosquito netting suggested Walter And a little red rocking chair added Ned With a dish of ice cream laughed Tad I guess you will have to be satisfied with a cup of alkali water interjected the Professor dryly You will find the air much cooler shortly the guide advised them The sun is going down now and I think we had better make camp if the Professor has no objections Not in the least In fact I am quite ready to call it a day s work Where do we camp mister Parry asked Tad Right here It is as good a place as any that we shall find There is little choice out here They were now in a broad valley the rolling hills covered with a sparse growth of sage brush rising gradually on each side The boys threw themselves from their ponies gladly stripping the saddles from the animals backs Better stake the animals down for the first two or three nights so they won t take French leave advised the guide How about the burros asked Tad Let them roam They ll stay as long as the ponies are here The pack animals will fill up on sage after which they will come back to camp to sleep All hands began to unpack The tents were pitched in record time cots unfolded and preparations for the night made with a skill that comes from long practice in the open What are we to do for a camp fire asked Walter There is not a single stick of wood about here Burn the sage answered the guide That stuff won t burn retorted Ned Try it They did In an incredibly short time a hot fire was blazing up on which they piled armfuls of the stunted desert growth Now get your food ready and I will cook it said Parry as the flames began to die down When the fire had settled to a bed of hot ashes Tom thrust the bacon directly into the ashes placing the coffee pot near the center around and on top of which he heaped the ashes It was a new method of preparing a meal and the lads watched the process with keen interest I shouldn t think that bacon would be fit to eat However I presume you know what you are doing said the Professor It s the only way sir replied Parry We have to work with the implements that nature has provided Nature must have been in a stingy mood when she made this country laughed Ned I don t agree with you said Tad It is the most beautiful and interesting scene that I have ever looked upon Parry nodded approvingly And as fickle as it is beautiful added the guide The supper will be ready by the time you have the table set boys In spite of the heat the lads realized all at once that their appetites had not suffered Bacon jelly and biscuits which had been warmed over the ashes seemed to them to have reached the proportions of a banquet Stacy helped himself to a large slice of bacon which he proceeded to munch No sooner had he begun however than he made a wry face What s the matter Isn t the bacon all right asked the guide Awful Somebody s trying to poison me Chunky shouted red in the face Must have a brown taste in your mouth laughed Ned What s the trouble began the Professor Good gracious there is something the matter with the stuff Ugh Never tasted such bitter stuff Did you purchase this meat in a reliable place mister Parry The guide smiled good naturedly The bacon is all right sir It s the sage brush taint that you get The what Sage brush The same taste will be in everything you eat out in this country that and the alkali Then I starve announced Stacy firmly laying down his fork and folding his arms Any time you starve it ll be because there is nothing to eat retorted Ned You ll all get used to the taste after you have been out a few days comforted the guide Never shouted Stacy I rather like the peculiar taste smiled Tad Butler Good as a tonic spoke up Walter Thus encouraged Stacy tried it again at first nibbling gingerly at the bacon then attacking it boldly Even the Professor after a time appeared to forget the bitterness of the food passing his plate for more Tom Parry smiled indulgently You ll all like it after a while he nodded I m sure I ll have to take back some sage brush with me to flavor my food after we leave the desert scoffed Ned Supper finished the dishes were cleared away after which the party threw themselves down beside the camp fire in keen enjoyment of the hour The evening was delightfully cool with not a trace of the baking heat of the day Doesn t seem possible that there could be such a change in the temperature in so short a time marveled the Professor It is the mood of the desert answered the guide What time do we start in the morning interrupted Tad approaching them at that moment I was just about to suggest that we break camp at daylight traveling until the sun gets hot We can then pitch a tent or two during the middle of the day and rest for a few hours Why not keep on all day asked the lad It would prove too great a strain both on man and beast At noon we will eat a cold lunch as too much food in this heat is not good for us You will find the temperature rising as you get further south and the hardships increasing in proportion We shall not fall by the wayside laughed the boy No I am convinced of that You lads are as tough as pine knots but you will need all the endurance you have for this trip If we are going to turn out so early I think you boys had better go to bed pretty soon advised the Professor That s why I asked you sir I rather thought mister Parry would wish to make an early start in the morning I ll see to the ponies then I ll go to bed Never mind the ponies I ll look after them answered Parry That boy is a splendid type he continued to the Professor after Tad had walked away from them to notify his companions of the plans for the morrow They all are answered the Professor Yes I have been observing them all day To tell the truth I was rather doubtful about the wisdom of taking a number of boys across the desert It s bad enough for men well hardened to the work I trust your apprehension no longer exists smiled the Professor Not a trace of it left replied Parry with a hearty laugh Young Brown handled that bucking pony splendidly this afternoon He s a good horseman for a boy Master Tad is a better one You ll agree with me if you get an opportunity to see him in any work that s worth while Well good night boys called the Professor as he saw the lads moving toward their tents Good night Professor sleep tight they shouted merrily altogether Good night mister Parry We ll be up with the birds Birds sniffed Stacy A tough old hen couldn t live out on this desert In a short time the camp settled down to sleep The guide with a last look about and a long comprehensive study of the sky sought his own tent where in a few moments he too was sound asleep After a time the moon came up in the light of which the weather beaten tents of the Pony Rider Boys were mere specks on the vast expanse of desert Not a sound disturbed the quiet scene However had any of the occupants of the little tents been awake they might have observed a thin fog like film drifting across the sky from the southwest On and on it came until finally it had blanketed the moon casting a veil over the landscape Other sheets of film arose from out the southwest placing layer after layer over the fast fading moon until finally it was obliterated altogether The desert was working out another of its mysterious phases but none in the camp of the Pony Riders were awake to observe it A dense pall of blackness now hovered over the southwest All at once a squirming streak of lightning wriggled along the horizon like a golden serpent losing itself by a downward plunge into the black abyss beyond the desert The air grew suddenly hot and depressing while a gentle breeze stirred the sage brush on the higher places The ponies moved restlessly in their sleep kicking out a foot now and then as if in protest at some disturbing presence Tad Butler ever on the alert roused himself and stepping out in his pajamas took a survey of the heavens I guess we re going to have a storm he muttered I wonder if I ought to wake mister Parry He thought this afternoon that there was a storm brewing Still there s nothing he can do The tents are staked down as securely as is possible No I guess I ll go back to bed The lad did so and after a few moments of wakefulness dropped off into a sound sleep A few moments later the breeze increased picking up little patches of sand which it hurled into the air scattering the particles over a wide area Far down to the southwest a low roar might have been heard and from the blackness there a funnel shaped cloud detached itself starting slantingly over the desert It appeared to be following a northerly course more or less irregularly and from its direction should pass some miles to the westward of the sleeping camp Whirling diving swooping here and there lifting great patches of sand and hurling them far up into the clouds the funnel swept on Suddenly when about three miles to the southwest of the camp it seemed to pause hesitatingly and then as if all at once having descried the little group of tents started swaying tottering toward them As it moved the disturbing roar continued to increase in volume Tad Butler heard it now He slipped from his tent and stood listening apprehensively I think that means trouble he said to himself The hot oppressive air felt like a blast from an open furnace door It s coming this way he continued The lad bounded to the tent of the guide Slipping inside he laid a hand on Parry s shoulder The guide was up like a flash What is it he demanded sharply It s I Tad Butler I think there is a bad storm coming I hear it snapped Parry springing from his blankets He was out in the open in a twinkling with Tad Butler close upon his heels For a moment the guide stood with head inclined listening intently Bad one isn t it questioned the lad Yes Do you think it is coming this way I can t be sure Wait don t wake them yet he whispered raising a restraining hand Yes here it comes It s a cyclone Quick get them out of their tents Almost before the words were out of his mouth the funnel swooped down into the broad sage sprinkled draw setting its deadly coils over the camp of the Pony Rider Boys CHAPTER III TWISTED BY A TWISTER Turn out bellowed the guide his voice faintly heard above the roar of the storm Run for your lives piped the shrill voice of Tad Butler Flat on the ground every one of you commanded the guide All the warnings had come a few seconds too late Ere the boys had awakened sufficiently to realize what was wanted of them there sounded above the roar a report like that of a cannon The tents were lifted from over the startled Pony Riders and hurled high into the air A cloud of sand swept over the boys like an avalanche burying them suffocating them while the resistless coils of the funnel picked them out of the drift and cast them far from the spot where but a few minutes before they had been sleeping so peacefully Above the roar they heard the shrill voice of Stacy Brown W o o ow he shrieked His voice appeared to be somewhere in the air over their heads Blankets trappings together with all the other belongings of the party shot up into the black funnel and disappeared while the ponies strained at their tethers floundering kicking where they had been hurled on their backs screaming with fright The mad medley continued for only a few seconds though to the unfortunate lads it seemed to have been tumbling them about for hours As suddenly as it had appeared the funnel tore itself from the camp and went roaring off into the hills to the northward Staggering to his feet some distance from where he had been caught the guide rubbed the sand from his eyes and mouth and stood gasping for breath An impressive silence had settled over the scene Hallo the camp he shouted when he had cleared his mouth sufficiently to enable him to do so Hello answered Tad Butler far to the right Are the others with you I don t know One by one the others of the party straggled to their feet choking and coughing As if to mock them the moon suddenly burst forth shedding a brilliant light over the scene which a few moments before had been the center of a whirling devastating cyclone Not a speck of anything save the white glistening sand of the desert remained to mark the spot where the camp of the Pony Rider Boys had stood They gathered shivering in their pajamas looking fearsomely into each others eyes still dazed from the shock and the fright of their experience Wha what was it stammered Walter Perkins A genuine twister laughed the guide Twister questioned the Professor Cyclone you mean Yes It was awful breathed Walter All our things gone too mourned Ned ruefully You should be thankful that you are alive chided the Professor How about the ponies questioned Walter They re over there More scared than hurt I guess But Chunky where s Chunky He isn t here cried Tad suddenly realizing that Stacy Brown was not with them Chunky wondered the others Why I thought he was here a moment ago said Walter in an alarmed tone What can have become of him Probably went up with the twister suggested Ned Yes I heard his voice and it seemed to be right over my head nodded Tad We must look for him The lads set up a shout as they started running about Better look for him that way directed the guide motioning in the direction that the funnel had taken after wrecking their camp The boys spread out calling and searching excitedly over the sand peering into the sage brush and cactus shadows But not a trace of Stacy Brown did they find until they had gone some distance from camp A faint call at last answered their hail Hooray We ve got him shouted Walter Where are you Chunky called Tad hurrying forward Here Are you all right No I m dead The boys could afford to laugh now and they did after calling back to the camp that they had found the missing one Half buried in a sand drift they located him Stacy s head and one foot were protruding above the sand the only parts of his anatomy that were visible above the heap of white sand beneath which he had been buried The Pony Riders could not repress a shout when they came up with young Brown and understood his predicament Get me out of here No you re dead You stay where you are retorted Ned Tad however grasped the foot that was sticking up through the sand and with a mighty tug hauled Chunky right through the heap choking coughing and sputtering angrily to the accompaniment of roars of laughter from his companions Ned grabbed the boy by the collar shaking him until the sand flew like spray Wake up Wake up How did you get here demanded Ned I I don t know I I guess I fell in You fell up this time That s a new trick you ve developed Well it s safer You won t get hurt falling up but look out when you strike the back trail Wha what happened asked the fat boy peevishly Everything laughed Tad We got caught in a cyclone We don t know whether you were rolled along with it or carried here Which was it I guess I flied decided Stacy humorously But I came down so hard that it knocked all the breath out of me Where s the camp The boys laughed Ask the wind replied Ned We don t know Come We d better be getting back Yee I reckon there will be plenty for us to do agreed Tad Can you walk all right Chunky I guess so Why not fly It s easier and quicker Chunky doesn t need a flying machine He s the original human heavier than air machine averred Ned The guide had by this time gathered a heap of sage brush to which he touched a match that they might the better examine their surroundings Anything left called Tad as with his companions he approached the camp I don t see anything but the saddles and the rifles What everything gone demanded Professor Zepplin anxiously It certainly looks that way Where s my pants wailed Chunky All pants have gone up chuckled Ned And so have provisions and everything else so far as I am able to observe added Tad Then then we ve got to cross the desert in our pajamas mourned Walter They looked at each other questioningly then the entire party burst out laughing They were all arrayed in pink night clothes Not a stitch of clothing beyond these pajamas did any of them have We must look about and see if we can find any of the stuff decided Parry his mind turning at once to the practical side of their predicament I hope we find the food at least Yes I m hungry spoke up Stacy No wonder after the shaking up you ve had agreed the Professor Guide where do you think we ll find our belongings You are lucky if you find them at all More than likely they are scattered over the Diamond Range for half a dozen miles May maybe it ll come back and bring our pants suggested Chunky at which there was a loud protest All hands formed in line and with the guide to pilot them started off in their bare feet hoping to find some of their belongings Stacy made the first find He picked up a can of tomatoes Ned Rector rescued a can of pickled pigs feet from the shadow of a sage brush while their guide discovered a sombrero that belonged to Stacy Brown But that was all They traveled nearly to the foot of the mountains yet not a scrap did they discover beyond what they already had picked up No use going any further announced the guide Well this is a fine predicament decided Professor Zepplin Nice mess agreed Ned Rector I want my pants wailed Stacy You ll want more than that Look at the guide if you think you are in difficulties grinned Tad All eyes were turned on Tom Parry Then they uttered a shout that might have been heard far off on the silent desert The guide was clad only in a blue flannel shirt and a sombrero He was in an even worse predicament than the party that he was guiding Minutes passed before the boys could control their merriment sufficiently to permit a discussion of their situation Tom Parry took their joking good naturedly He was too old a campaigner to be greatly disturbed over his own laughable condition Something must be done announced the Professor after the laughter had subsided What do you propose mister Parry Well in the first place like our friend Master Stacy Brown I want a pair of pants I can t very well cross the desert in this rig Once more their laughter drowned the voices of the guide and the Professor Is there no town near here where we can get a fresh outfit I am thankful that I kept my money belt strapped about me We should be in a tight fix had I lost the funds too said the Professor I have been considering what is best to be done replied Parry I see no other way than that we shall have to ride to Eureka That is a railroad terminal and quite a town I am sure we shall be able to get there all we need for our journey It will prove a little more expensive than in a larger city however No question of expense just now answered the Professor Will it be necessary for all of us to go I think it will be best I don t care to leave any of the party behind One never can tell what is going to happen you know So I have observed commented the Professor dryly How far is Eureka from here questioned Tad Between twenty five and thirty miles The town lies to the northwest If it were not for the pack train we could make it quickly but we shall have to move rather slowly on the burros account Then why not start at once suggested Tad Butler The moon is shining brightly and the air is cool That is if you can find the way No trouble about that grinned Parry Your suggestion is a good one We ll start just as soon as I can get ready I don t see anything left here to get ready laughed Ned You will excuse me gentlemen but there is something that I shall have to get ready replied the guide with a peculiar smile What s that demanded the Professor I ve got to take a double reef in my shirt before I can go anywhere except to bed The boys shouted again Tom Parry hurried off beyond the ponies where he was engaged for several minutes When he returned they discovered that he had taken off his shirt First he had cut off the sleeves and by thrusting his feet through the arm holes had made for himself a very substantial pair of trunks This odd outfit he had made fast about his waist with a thong of leather that he had cut from a bridle rein This with the broad brimmed sombrero completed his outfit The sight was too much for the Pony Rider Boys They shouted peal after peal of merriment in which the Professor joined though in a somewhat more dignified manner Tom Parry s mouth was stretched in a grin as he got busy saddling the ponies and urging the sleepy burros to their feet I think we are all ready now the guide called back to the others With many a shout and jest the strange procession started off across the desert under the brightly shining moon the cool evening breezes making their scanty covering none too comfortable The boys devoted the greater part of their attention to the Professor and Tom Parry both of whom were riding as dignifiedly as if they were leading a parade at a Fourth of July celebration Every little while the boys unable to contain themselves longer would burst out into merry peals of laughter Hope it doesn t snow said Stacy Brown wisely No retorted Ned The colors in your pajamas might run That s where the guide has the better of us retorted Tad a little maliciously which brought still another laugh from the boys Say fellows this saddle is getting harder every minute called Chunky who was riding back and forth behind the pack train urging on the burros Stand up in your stirrups now and then suggested Tad What in my bare feet yelled the fat boy Think I want to get pancake feet Chunky s getting aristocratic jeered Ned He s so proud of those high insteps of his that he has to take off his shoes every little while to look at his feet He s afraid they ll cave in some time when he isn t looking Daylight came all too soon and following it the sun burst forth in a blaze of heat Ahead of them across the desert they were able to make out the town of Eureka Say mister Parry aren t you afraid this sunlight will spoil your complexion called Ned The guide grinned good naturedly Never mind he retorted Your turn will come pretty soon young man Ned Rector did not catch the significance of the remark just then but he understood a few hours later CHAPTER IV THE CHARGE OF THE LIGHT BRIGADE You are not going to ride into town in daylight are you demanded Ned in surprise Though they had sighted the town of Eureka early in the morning it was well along in the afternoon before they finally came up with it Desert distances are deceptive and the further they journeyed the less headway did they seem to be making This surprised all save the guide Parry explained to them that the clear air brought distant objects much closer than they really were We are going into town exactly as we are replied the guide in answer to Ned s question Why not Well maybe you are but I m not returned Ned It may improve your complexion young man retorted mister Parry I ll stay out here and hide on the desert while the rest of you go on in said Ned No you don t shouted the lads all at once You go willingly or we carry you They gathered around him threateningly If you want a mix up we re here warned Chunky pushing his pony up beside that of Ned Rector Ned forgetting for the instant that he was in his bare feet let drive a kick at the side of Stacy s pony Ouch roared Ned Jerking the injured toe up to the saddle he grabbed it with both hands rocking back and forth for his foot had struck the pony with such violence that it is a wonder every toe on the foot was not broken Did oo hurt oo little tootsie wootsies cooed Chunky with a grimace Ned Rector forgetting the pain for the instant made a quick grab for his tormentor He just barely reached the sleeve of Chunky s pajamas But his sudden movement caused the fat boy s pony to leap suddenly to one side Ned landed on his head and shoulders in the desert sand feet kicking the air to the accompaniment of yells of derision from his companions With red face and angry eyes the lad scrambled to his feet and started limping to his pony which had sprung to one side where it stood evidently wondering what next was about to happen I ll get even with you Chunky Brown Ned growled as he climbed into his saddle Now now Ned warned the boys Take your medicine like a man Chunky never got mad when you nagged him I ll get even with him I ll Tad rode up beside the angry lad Ned you ll do nothing of the sort said the boy gently You re mad now because your toes hurt When they stop aching your temper will improve at the same time Oh pshaw Stop your preaching Of course it will I m a grouch I take back all I said just now Chunky when these toes get straightened out they re all crooked now I ll come over and hobnob with you I deserve all you can give me You bet you do chorused the lads Stop teasing him commanded Stacy with well feigned indignation Can t you see his toes hurt him The incident was lost sight of in the general laugh that followed The others were beginning to appreciate that Stacy Brown possessed a tongue as sharp as any of them Ned now offered no further protest to entering the village but it was observed that he dropped back behind the others as they reached the outskirts of the town Tom Parry and Professor Zepplin were riding ahead one in pajamas the other clad in trunks which resembled a meal sack a sombrero hat and a sardonic grin of defiance The others trailed along behind Not one of the party glanced to the right or left of him except Stacy Brown who could scarcely contain his bubbling spirits They ll think it s some new kind of a menagerie come to town he confided to Tad who was riding beside him Then I hope they don t shoot the animals laughed Tad By this time they had entered the main street down which they rode at a pace that the burros could follow People passing along the street paused and gazed in unfeigned astonishment at the strange procession which they saw approaching The most conspicuous of them all was Tom Parry He was a sight to behold but not one whit did he care for the amazed stares that greeted his strange outfit Soon the grins of the populace gave place to yells of derision Look at the purty boy with the pink toes there behind shouted one pointing to Ned Rector Ned s face went crimson Now aren t you glad you didn t lose the tootsie wootsies teased Chunky Ned made no reply but it boded ill for any of his tormentors who got within reach of his long arms Already more than a hundred persons had turned to follow the strange outfit This number was being rapidly added to as they proceeded For goodness sake how much further have we to go begged Ned The general store is down at the end of the street the guide informed him I presume you want to get some clothes the first thing I should say so A whoop and a yell sounded far down the street Here s trouble muttered Tad instantly recognizing the cowboy yell A band of them at that instant swung around a corner straightening out in the main street letting go a volley of revolver shots into the air The band had come to town with a shipment of wild horses that had been captured among the desert ranges They had been in Eureka for twenty four hours and were by this time ready for whatever might turn up The horsemen clad in pink pajamas attracted their attention at once Here was fair game Who o o o p e e e The shrill cry sent a shiver to the hearts of the boys It was not a shiver of fear either In a moment more the Pony Rider Boys were the center of a ring of racing ponies as the horse hunters dashed round and round yelling like mad and firing off their revolvers Oh see that purty boy with the pink toes jeered one Give him the tenderfoot dance yelled another He ought to be able to dance the fairy lancers on them pinkies Ned did not dare refuse He slipped from his pony and limping to the center of the ring which the racing ponies had formed about them began to dance as the bullets from the revolvers of the cowboys struck the ground sending up little clouds of dust under his feet Faster and faster barked the guns and faster and faster danced Ned Rector Stacy Brown was almost beside himself with joy Better look out or you ll be doing it next warned Tad Evidently the cowboys had not recognized Tom Parry as yet He might be the next victim Finally Tad rode his pony forward right through the fire of the skylarking cowboys I guess you ve had enough fun with him fellows he warned Let up now A jeering laugh greeted the lad s command Their attention was instantly turned to him Get off that broncho and give us a dance young fellow they shouted Thank you I m not dancing to day smiled Tad Butler Ain t dancing We ll see about that Come off that nag Tad shook his head At that instant a rope squirmed through the air from a moving pony Butler threw himself to one side just in time to avoid it The lad s eyes snapped Guess I ll take a hand in this too he growled The lad unlimbered his rope in a twinkling and let fly at the cowboy who had just sought to rope him With unerring aim Tad s lariat caught the left hind foot of the cowman s broncho Pony and rider went down like a flash Instantly there was a loud uproar The horse hunters yelled with delight at least all of them save the cowboy who had bit the dust and he sprang up bellowing with rage as he made for the grinning Tad Tom Parry decided that it was time for him to take a hand The guide jumped his pony between Tad and the angry cowboy That ll do Bud You stop right where you are Tom commanded But the miserable coyote roped me You tried to rope him first It s Tom Parry shouted the cowmen Hey Tom Them s a fine suit of clothes you ve got on there Where d you get them Call off Bud and I ll tell you grinned Tom He s got no reason to interfere with my boys here Laughing uproariously the cowboys forced their bronchos between Bud and the others cutting him off and bidding him attend to his own business Then the cowmen halted their ponies after closing in about the Pony Rider Boys while Tom Parry related the experiences they had passed through on the previous night Come along We ll take you to a place where you can get all the pants you want shouted the leader of the party after Tom had finished his story The cowboys wheeled their ponies and the procession moved on down the street They had discovered that the Pony Rider Boys were not the band of tenderfeet that they had at first taken them for Arriving at the store the lads lost no time in leaping from their ponies which they tethered at the rail in front and hurried into the store This was a postoffice as well as general trading post Half the town it seemed had gathered outside the building to get a look at the nearly naked strangers who had ridden in a short time before But once inside the store the boys did not propose to exhibit themselves further if it were possible to avoid it An entire new outfit was necessary tents provisions and all and to purchase all these things would occupy the greater part of the rest of the afternoon No sooner had they entered the store and made their wants known than the boys became conscious of the presence of ladies The boys could not see them plainly because it was a dim dingy place at best But all at once Ned felt a cold chill run down his back One of the ladies was speaking to him Isn t this mister Rector asked a pleasant voice I am quite sure I am not mistaken Ordinarily Ned would have been glad to meet an old acquaintance but when a boy is clad only in a pair of pink pajamas his feet bare of covering he is not particularly anxious to see anyone he knows It was so with Ned Rector At first he pretended not to hear A hand was placed lightly on his shoulder Then he turned his face flushing painfully I am missus Colonel McClure from Texas she informed him We had the pleasure of entertaining you and your companions when you were with the cattle drive in our state Ned bowed and mumbled some unintelligible words He failed to note the twinkle in the eyes of missus McClure And this she continued is my niece Miss Courtenay Miss Barbara Parks and Miss Long continued missus McClure mercilessly The young women were blushing furiously as they acknowledged the introduction Ned failed to observe it however His eyes were on his feet and the pink toes which seemed abnormally large at that moment Where are your companions mister Rector I thought they were with you a moment ago Wh ye yes they are here they Ned looked about him blankly No one was in sight Then he discovered the grinning face of Stacy Brown peering at him from behind the postoffice wicket At the first alarm Walter Perkins had sunk down behind a cracker barrel with Tad Butler crouching behind him Over behind the counter was the guide while behind a pile of horse blankets Professor Zepplin lay flat on the floor shrinking himself into as small a space as possible Ned Rector was left to face the enemy alone CHAPTER V STALKING BIG GAME BY MOONLIGHT The tension of the moment was relieved by a merry laugh from missus McClure and her friends in which Ned Rector joined spontaneously The situation was too funny for even his offended dignity to resist The result was an invitation for the entire party to dine with missus McClure and her friends that evening Ned Rector accepted on the spot much to the disgust of his companions who felt a diffidence about meeting the ladies after the exhibition in the store However after they had properly clothed themselves they felt better and the evening passed at the home of missus McClure s friends was one of the most enjoyable they experienced At sunrise next morning the Pony Rider Boys were once more on the desert bubbling over with spirits and anticipation I ve got another invitation for you boys announced Tom Parry after they had halted for the midday rest I hope we ll have some clothes on when it comes off then growled Ned It won t make much difference whether you have or not so far as this invitation is concerned What is the invitation asked Professor Zepplin Bud Thomas and the other cowboys are hunting wild horses for market you know replied the guide Wild horses marveled Walter Yes I didn t know there were any about here said Tad It is estimated that there are all of a hundred thousand wild horses in the different ranges of this state replied the guide You haven t told us yet what the invitation is reminded Stacy You haven t given me a chance laughed Tom Well the invitation is to join in a wild horse hunt Hooray shouted the lads Very interesting agreed the Professor And lively too added the guide The boys took quite a fancy to you young gentlemen after the roping trick and said if you would join in a hunt you d get all the fun that was coming to you Tad grinned at the recollection of their first meeting with the wild horse hunters Whe when do we join them asked Chunky enthusiastically It will be a week or more yet before we reach that part of the desert where the hunts take place that is if we have good luck But if we have any more such experiences as we have just passed through we shall not get there this summer laughed the guide By sunset that day the town of Eureka had disappeared behind the copper colored hills and the Pony Rider Boys were again merely tiny specks on the great Nevada Desert They pitched the new white tents for the first time that night having made camp earlier than usual because they were not accustomed to working with the new outfit No one knew where to find anything which furnished the lads with plenty of amusement Ned and Tom Parry cooked the supper over a sage brush fire They had brought a few cans of milk with them but after sampling it all hands declared their preference for the condensed brand of which they had purchased a liberal supply The fresh milk procured in Eureka was strong with the sage brush taste as was almost everything else in that barren country The ponies refused the sage brush for their evening meal having had a supply of real fodder back in town so they were staked out near a growth of sage that they might browse on during the night should they decide that they were hungry enough Well I wonder what will happen to night said Tad as they finished the evening meal Let us hope that it will be nothing more serious than pleasant dreams smiled Professor Zepplin That means you Chunky nodded Ned You are not to have the nightmare to night remember And you look out for your tootsie wootsies retorted Chunky We shall have to take a long ride to morrow announced the guide Why to morrow asked Ned It is all of twenty miles to the next water hole or where the next water hole should be One cannot depend upon anything in this country Haven t we enough water with us asked the Professor Enough to last us through to morrow that s all We shall have to get water at night so if we have no interruptions during the night we shall make another early start Stacy see to it that you do not lose your trousers this time We don t wish to be disgraced by you again to morrow warned Ned Stacy merely grimaced making no reply He knew that he had not been the one to get the worst of it and so did his companions He was quite satisfied with the punishment that had been meted out to Ned Rector All hands turned in shortly after dark They were tired after the long day s ride in the broiling sun Besides they had not yet made up the sleep they lost two nights before when the twister invaded their camp and wrecked it The boys had been asleep only a short time however before the entire camp was startled by a long thrilling wail All the Pony Riders were wide awake in an instant listening for a repetition of the sound It came a moment later K i i o o o o K i i o o o o K i i o o o k i The boys leaped from their tents The sound plainly come from some wild animal but what they did not know Wha what is it A lion stammered Stacy I I don t know answered Walter Do you Tad I certainly do not It s no lion though There are none here Maybe it s a pack of wolves suggested Ned There must be a lot of them to make such a howling as that D d d d do you thi thi think they re going to attack us stammered Stacy How do we know snorted Ned Neither the Professor nor the guide having made their appearance the boys took for granted that the two men were asleep Such was the case so far as the Professor was concerned but Tom Parry was lying on his bed awake a quiet smile on his face Are you sure it s a wild animal Tad whispered Walter Of course What else could it be Then I ll tell you what let s do What demanded Ned Let s get our rifles and crawl up to the top of that knoll yonder where the sound seems to come from And take a shot at them finished Ned Good idea What do you say Tad I guess there will be no harm in it decided the lad considering the question for a minute They had moved away from the tents so that the sound of their voices should not arouse the sleeping men there Two guns will be enough We re not so liable to hit each other if only two of us have them Who is going to shoot demanded Walter What s the matter with Ned and Chunky That suited all concerned You d better hurry The animals have stopped howling advised Tad Ned and Stacy ran lightly to their tents returning quickly with their rifles Stacy bore the handsome telescope rifle that he had won in a pony race during their exciting trip through the Ozark Mountains Even in the moonlight one could see a long distance with the aid of the telescope on the gun s barrel See the brutes asked Stacy with bated breath No nor hear them either answered Walter I ll tell you what we d better do suggested Tad Yes answered Ned anxiously We ll crawl along in the shadow to the south I think the prowlers are up there on the ridge to the west If they are they ll be watching the camp fire Maybe they have smelled us and run away by this time even if they didn t hear us talking Keep still everybody warned Ned The boys stole along as silently as shadows After moving some ten rods to the south Tad motioned for them to turn west which they did No sooner had they changed their course however than Chunky with a loud Ouch plunged headlong his rifle falling several feet ahead of him With frightful howls he began hugging one foot rocking back and forth in great pain What s the matter snapped Ned Rector My foot My foot What about it I I don t know I Tad grabbed the boy by the collar jerking him clear of the place The first thought that came to him was that Stacy had been bitten by a snake though Tad did not even know whether or not there were snakes on the desert Nice chance we ll have to shoot anything growled Ned in disgust Stop that wailing It hurts it hurts Keep still I ll find out what the trouble is warned Tad dropping down and examining his companion s injured foot Ouch exploded Chunky jerking his foot away If you want me to help you you ll have to be quiet Butler pressed gently on the bottom of the injured foot with the fingers of one hand the other holding Chunky s ankle in a firm grip Humph grunted Tad He s stepped on a cactus bush with his bare foot It s full of prickers Hold still and I ll pick them out Guess there s no use to keep still any longer Those animals probably have run away before this complained Ned K i i o o o o K i i o o o o K i i o o o k i S h h h warned Tad They re there yet Shall I take your rifle Chunky You probably don t feel much like tramping up the hill in your bare feet No exploded the fat boy I guess if there s any shooting to be done Stacy Brown can do it even if he s only got one foot to hop along on Scrambling to his feet Stacy recovered his rifle He had forgotten all about his injured foot now Cautiously the boys crawled up to the top of the rise of ground Sit down everybody directed Tad We ought to be able to see them from here Not a thing save clumps of sage brush met peering eyes of the Pony Rider Boys Lay the barrel of your gun over my shoulder and look through the telescope directed Tad softly Pointing the gun to the southward Stacy rested it on his companion s shoulder placing an eye to the peep hole The lads fairly held their breath for a minute I see him I see him whispered Stacy in an excited tone What is it demanded Ned Where I don t know I guess it s a wolf How many asked Walter crawling up to him See only one Take your time Chunky cautioned Tad in a low voice Draw a careful bead on the fellow and let him have it Over your shoulder Sure You never ll hit him without a rest Once more they held their breath At last Stacy exerted a gentle pressure on the trigger There followed a flash and a roar O u u c h yelled the fat boy The end of the telescope had kicked him violently in the eye as the gun went off CHAPTER VI BAGGED BY LUCKY SHOTS K I I O O O O K I I I O O O There he goes shouted Walter Stacy was picking himself up from the ground where the rifle had kicked him

none	none	Ned Rector had risen to his feet the instant Stacy fired Throwing his rifle to shoulder he fired at an object that he saw bounding down the opposite side of the hill I got him I got him shouted Ned dancing about in his glee Chunky Brown you re no good All you can do with a rifle is to get kicked and fall in Take a lesson from your Uncle Dudley Good shooting boys said a laughing voice behind them They whirled around and found themselves facing Tom Parry who had crept up to see that the boys got into no trouble You here demanded Tad Butler sharply I am that Think I could let you boys go off with a couple of guns to hunt wild animals Not without Tom Parry no indeed I got him mister Parry glowed Ned Did you see me tumble him over The guide nodded good naturedly And Chunky missed him even though he had a rest over Tad Butler s shoulder Chunky can t shoot Yes I can too objected the fat boy We ll see replied the guide I am not sure whether he can shoot or not What do you mean mister Parry asked Walter Chunky shot at the animal and missed it didn t he What kind of an animal was it interjected Ned A coyote I thought it was a wolf muttered Stacy Brown How many of them was there Only one you ninny And I shot him scoffed Ned We ll go down the hill and find the one you got Master Ned decided the guide moving away followed by the rest of the party No sooner had they started than they heard Professor Zepplin down in the camp shouting to know what the shooting meant It s all right Professor called the guide The boys have been shooting up some wild game You ll be surprised when you see what they got Down the hillside sprang the enthusiastic lads Remember you re all barefooted warned the guide You don t want to pick up any more cactus thorns Were you here then demanded Tad glancing up sharply I was with you from the time you left the camp Here he is shouted Ned who had run on ahead of the others in his anxiety to learn the result of his shot And I caught him on the wing too didn t I You certainly did Just lift him He s a whopper went on the lad enthusiastically I d like to see any of the others in this outfit make a shot like that Chance shot mumbled Stacy Hit a bird once myself a mile up in the air but I didn t flap my wings and crow about it I couldn t have done it again Neither could you have hit that that what do you call it Coyote replied the guide but he pronounced it kiute Oh I don t know grumbled Stacy Suppose we go up the hill now and see what Master Stacy shot suggested the guide starting away Shot sniffed Ned Rector Don t you know what he shot Yes we know interrupted Walter He shot thin air that s what he did We shall see we shall see answered the guide enigmatically Though Stacy did not grasp the guide s meaning he did catch a note in the tone that filled him with hope Yet Chunky was unable to see how he could have hit anything in view of the fact that Ned had shot the coyote Tom Parry strode up to the crest of the hill and began looking about peering behind sage bush and greasewood The boys were a little to the north of him all hunting for they knew not what Ned Rector had seated himself by the side of his dead coyote stroking its rough coat proudly A sharp whistle from the guide attracted their attention What is it called Tad Come over here I ve got a surprise for you The boys obeyed on the run Tom Parry stood with a grin on his face pointing a finger to the ground What is it What is it demanded the lads in chorus Why it s a dead animal marveled Walter Then that s what the coyote was doing up here It was after the meat on the dead one announced Ned I knew there must be some good reason for its remaining so near camp all that time Guess again sniffed Stacy who had thrown himself down beside his prize What s that asked Tad who already suspected something of the truth It s my coyote that s what it is Tom Parry nodded He s right He killed the animal the first shot Then then stammered Ned There were two of them Master Stacy killed one and you the other and for your gratification I ll say that they are a very difficult animal to kill One might try a hundred times and never hit one If one knows how to shoot it isn t spoke up Stacy pompously Which you certainly do laughed the guide May we take them back to camp and skin them asked Ned You may take them in of course but I would not advise you to skin the brutes The skins are not worth anything in the first place and in the second we should be unable to keep them all the way across the desert I am afraid You mean they would spoil questioned Ned Yes Then we ll take them down to show to the Professor After that we ll bury them Not necessary at all smiled the guide The buzzards will attend to that part of the work They ll be around in the morning You ll see them But how will the buzzards know asked Walter That I cannot say They do know Instinct I suppose All animals and birds have the instinct necessary for their kind yet it is all a mystery to us Very proudly the lads dragged their trophies to camp where after heaping fresh sage brush on the fire the youngsters stretched the carcasses out full length that Professor Zepplin might see Very fine young men You say they were howling and woke you up Yes didn t you hear them answered Stacy loudly Indeed I did not The first thing I heard was the report of a rifle and then in a few seconds another I couldn t imagine what was going on When I tumbled out and found the camp deserted I was alarmed I feared you boys had gotten into other and more serious trouble You should not take the guns out without either myself or the guide being with you He was with us interrupted Chunky Then that was all right But we didn t know he was with us Professor Tad Butler hastened to explain So we were in the wrong even if he was along However it has turned out all right and we ve bagged two coyotes Wish we could take their pictures Why didn t we think to bring a camera with us I think I can supply that laughed the guide I always carry one with me In the morning I ll take your pictures I got a new camera in Eureka yesterday having lost my old one in the blow out we had the other night The boys gave three cheers and a tiger for Tom Parry CHAPTER VII CHUNKY COMES TO GRIEF Breakfast was cooked in the cool of the early dawn long before the sun had pushed its burning course up above the desert sands Though the boys had but little sleep they tumbled out at the guide s first hail full of joyous enthusiasm for what lay before them that day Stacy Brown emerged from his tent rubbing his eyes The lads uttered a shout when they saw him Look at him yelled Ned Look at Chunky s eye The right eye was surrounded by a black ring the eyelid being of the same dark shade where the end of the telescope on his rifle had kicked him Young man you are a sight to behold smiled the Professor I don t care I got the coyote retorted Stacy with a grin And the gun got him added Walter Judging from your appearance I should say that the butt of your rifle was almost as dangerous as the other end laughed Tad Come and get it called the guide The lads never had to be called twice for meals and they were in their places at the breakfast table with a bound Do you know I m beginning to like the sage brush taste in the food said Walter Stacy made up a face I should think you would be ashamed to sit down to a meal with that countenance of yours Chunky declared Ned I might with some company See here Chunky Brown Do you mean I mean that my face will get over what ails it but yours won t was the fat boy s keen edged retort All of which goes to prove announced Tad wisely that you never can tell by the looks of a toad how far it will jump I guess you d better let Chunky alone after this He s perfectly able to take care of himself Ned Ned subsided and devoted his further attention to his breakfast The meal finished all hands set briskly to work to strike camp In half an hour the burros were loaded ready for the day s journey The boys set off singing I don t see how you can tell where you are going said the Professor There is no sun and you have no compass We are traveling almost due southwest I never use a compass It is not necessary There I knew I had forgotten to get something announced Tad Forgotten what questioned Walter To get a compass You have a watch have you not asked Tom Parry Why yes but that s not a compass Oh yes it is smiled the guide You can get your direction just as well with that as you could with a tested compass Never heard that before muttered Tad Nor I added Ned at once keenly interested I m easy I ll ask how What s the answer questioned Stacy gazing innocently at Tom Parry I am not joking boys Every watch is a compass You can get your direction from it unerringly whenever you can see the sun Indeed marveled the Professor The method is very simple continued Parry All you have to do is to point the hour hand directly at the sun Half way between the hour hand and the figure twelve on the watch dial you will find is due south I ll try it answered Tad There comes the sun now said Ned The boys drew out their watches having halted the ponies and turned facing the rising sun Well did you ever exclaimed the lads in one voice It is indeed the fact marveled the Professor You can depend upon that whenever you have lost your way said Tom Parry It has helped me out on many occasions But what if there isn t any sun what if the sky is clouded questioned Stacy Then you ll have to sit down and wait for it laughed the guide After this brief rest the party continued on its way They had come out on the level plain and before them for several miles stretched the white alkali of the Nevada Desert As the sun rose higher they found the glare of the glistening plain extremely trying to the eyes The guide suggested that they put on their goggles But the boys would have none of them Stacy s right eye was badly swollen yet he refused to cover it though the fine dust of the plain got into it causing it to smart until the tears ran down his cheek Where do the wild horses congregate asked Tad riding up beside the guide Likely to see them anywhere though they do not as a rule go far out on the desert on account of the scarcity of water We may see some in the Little Smoky Valley and the Hot Creek Range when we reach there Is it difficult to catch them Very There is one magnificent white stallion that the horse hunters have been trying to capture for the past five years Why can t they get him Too smart for them He knows what they are up to almost as well as if the hunters had confided their plans to him Twice in the beginning the hunters succeeded in getting him in a trap but he managed to get away from his would be captors I d like to get a chance to take him mused Tad Butler I m afraid you wouldn t have much luck but we ll have a hunt when we get down in the horse country and I promise you that you will see some exciting sport Better than hunting coyotes by moonlight laughed the guide I d like to capture and break a real live wild horse said young Butler his eyes sparkling at the thought It would be a fine prize to take away with me now wouldn t it If you chanced to capture a good one yes The poor stock however has been pretty well taken up so that the horses on the ranges now are splendid specimens Anybody want to run a race interrupted Stacy riding up near the head of the procession Too hot answered Tad Just the kind of a day for a horse race I ll run any of you to see who cooks the supper persisted Stacy Oh go back with the burros I wouldn t eat any supper that you cooked anyway I ll remember that Ned Well if none of you has spunk enough to race with me I ll run a race with myself That a dare questioned Walter Stacy nodded blinking his blackened eye nervously Walter shook out the reins Come on then I suppose you won t be satisfied until you ve gotten into more trouble Where do you want to race to See that patch of ground whiter than the rest off there Yes Well we ll race there and back How far is it from here mister Parry Bout half a mile I should say answered the guide measuring the distance with his eyes Whew I didn t think it was so far marveled Stacy But we ll run it anyway I ll be the starter announced Ned If you break your neck Chunky remember that I am not to blame for it If I break my neck I won t be likely to remember anything so you re safe retorted Stacy The others were too busy discussing wild horse hunting to give heed to the boys plan All ready Yes Go Both lads uttered a sharp yell at the same time giving their spurs a gentle pressure and away they went across the blazing alkali their tough little ponies steaming in the intense heat as they straightened out entering into the spirit of the contest with evident enthusiasm See those boys ride laughed the guide pausing in his argument on the wild horse question I didn t suppose the fat boy could sit in a saddle like that Oh yes he does well You saw him master the bucker the other day in the mountains Yes I remember Whoa Look out there There goes one of them He took too short a turn Walter s down cried Ned Hope he isn t hurt No he s cleared all right That was a mighty quick move the way he slipped out of that saddle It would have broken his leg sure if the pony had fallen on it declared the guide Stacy had pulled up his own mount after making the turn safely Then he rode slowly back Hurt you any Walt he asked Jarred me a little that s all Why don t you go on and win the race Waiting for you announced the fat boy laconically Walter swung into his saddle Come on then Gid ap he cried shaking out the reins The two little animals sprang away like projectiles But Stacy seemed not to be in his best form He came in bobbing up and down several lengths behind Walter You won the race I fell off announced Walter with his usual spirit of fairness I guess not drawled Stacy Now I m going to do some stunts With that the fat boy galloped out over the alkali again riding off fully half a mile ahead of the party where he jogged back and forth for a time then began riding in a circle After a little they saw him toss his hat into the air ahead of him and putting spurs to his pony dart under it giving it a swift blow with his quirt sending it spinning some distance away at the same time uttering a shrill whoop Thinks he s having the time of his life grunted Ned For a boy with a black eye he is particularly cheerful I should say laughed Parry What s he going to do now Pick up his sombrero while at a gallop I guess replied Tad shading his eyes and gazing off across the plain Yes there he goes at it Stacy with a graceful dip from his saddle swooped down on the sombrero scooping it up with a yell of triumph then dashing madly across the desert to the westward All at once they saw his pony stumble There he goes warned the guide He will break his neck Down plunged the broncho his nose scraping the ground his hind feet beating the air wildly Stacy kept right on The pony struck a thin crust on the alkali explained the guide Almost before the words were out of his mouth Stacy Brown hit the desert broadside on Then to the amazed watchers he seemed to disappear before their very eyes He s gone What does it mean cried the boys Where but a few seconds before had been a pony and a boy there now remained only a kicking floundering broncho Tom Parry put spurs to his mount and set off at top speed for the scene of the accident followed by the others of the party strung out in single file CHAPTER VIII NEARLY DROWNED IN AN ALKALI SINK Tad rapidly drew up on the guide What has happened Butler cried as the two now raced along side by side As I said before the pony went through a thin crust Yes but Chunky what happened to him asked Tad He went through when he struck the ground I don t understand it at all You will when you get there Tad was mystified The solution of the mystery was beyond him If he isn t drowned he s in luck snapped Parry Drowned wondered his companion They cleared the intervening space that lay between them and the fat boy s pony in a series of convulsive leaps that the bronchos took under the urgent pressure of the rowels of their riders spurs As they neared the scene Tad espied a hole in the desert and began to understand Stacy also had struck a thin crust and had broken through Yet what had happened to him after that Tad did not know Both would be rescuers leaped from their ponies and ran to the spot With his body submerged his head barely protruding above the water sat Stacy vigorously rubbing his eyes to get the brown alkali water out of them sufficiently to enable him to look about and determine what had happened to him The rest of the party dashed up with loud shouts of alarm hurling a series of rapid fire questions at the guide Parry and Tad grasped Stacy by the arms and hauled him dripping from the alkali sink into which he had plunged They shouted with laughter when they saw that he was not hurt seriously Well of all the blundering idiots began Ned That will do warned the Professor hurrying to Stacy s side Hurt you much lad I I fell in stammered Chunky I should say you did How in the world did it happen The guide explained that frequently these thin crusts were found on the desert covering alkali sinks some being dry others having water in them And of course Chunky had to find one He s the original hoodoo laughed Ned Oh I don t know replied the guide He has done us a real service by falling in How s that questioned Tad Master Stacy has found a water hole just what we need at this particular moment The stock needs water and especially the ponies that have been racing for the last half hour You don t mean that we are to drink that stuff do you demanded Walter Not now We still have some fairly good water in the water bags Later on you may be glad to drink alkali water Run up and down if you feel able You ll dry off in a few minutes suggested Parry turning to Chunky I I don t want to Feels nice and cool after my bath Jump in and take a swim fellows No thank you not in that dirty water objected Ned I ll tell you what boys suggested Tad After the stock has had a drink we ll take off our shoes and put our feet in Guess we can stand that much That s a good idea agreed Walter We ll all take a cold foot bath In the meantime the guide had been busily engaged in breaking the crust around the sink so that the stock might more easily get at the water within it The animals were impatiently pawing and whinnying anxious to get the water They were now willing to drink any kind of water after their half day s journey across the burning alkali You might unpack and get a cold lunch together if you will suggested Parry The boys soon had one of the tents erected over which they stretched the fly that the interior might be cooler Ned opened a can of pickled pigs feet which with some hard rolls were spread out on a folding table under the tent Tad not to be out done dug some lemons from his saddle bag with which he proceeded to make a pail of lemonade It was the first time they had had any such beverage since they began their summer trips Tad had purchased the lemons back in Eureka The lemonade made it lacked only sweetening now Where s the sugar he called Where s the sugar echoed Chunky We don t know answered Ned and Walter in the same breath Get busy and find it then If you don t want this lemonade I ll drink it myself I don t care whether it is sweetened or not That threat was effective The other three boys made a dive for the burros An examination of the first pack failed to reveal the sweetening The same was the case with the next and before they had finished their entire outfit was spread over the ground tents canned goods cooking utensils thrown helter skelter over several rods of ground Here boys boys chided the Professor This will never do We can t afford to use our provisions in that way Soon we ll have nothing Regular rough house Ought to be ashamed of yourselves agreed Stacy surveying the scattered outfit while he secretly slipped two lumps of sugar into his mouth Here cook pick up your kitchen to Ned What you got in your mouth demanded Ned suspiciously He s eating the sugar spoke up Walter Perkins Drop em roared Ned Stacy started to run whereupon the boys fell upon him and the next second he was at the bottom of the heap The boys were rubbing his face in the sand in an effort to make him give up the sugar The Professor took a hand two hands in fact about this time He made short work of the goose pile tossing the boys from the very much ruffled Stacy whom he also jerked to his feet What s all this disturbance about demanded Professor Zepplin First you strew the outfit all over the desert then you get to pummeling each other Chunky s been stealing sugar volunteered Ned Give back that sugar instantly commanded the Professor The fat boy shook his head and grinned Can t he answered And why not Cause they re inside of me Now now now warned Ned You haven t chewed that hard sugar down this quick I know better than that No I swallowed the lumps whole when you fellows jumped on me Nearly choked me to death cause one of em got stuck in my throat Chunky explained Tad in the meantime had been busy gathering up the scattered provisions Get to work young gentlemen Straighten up the camp commanded the Professor Don t we get any lunch begged Stacy You re full of sugar You don t need anything else replied Walter When you have set the outfit to rights we ll all sit down and eat like civilized beings asserted the Professor with emphasis Civilized beings making a meal on pigs feet Huh grumbled Chunky picking up a can of tomatoes then throwing it down again After this he slipped around to the opposite side of the tent Crawling in under the fly he promptly went to sleep the others being so busy that they had not observed his act The next Stacy knew was when he awakened to find himself being hauled out by one leg Here what are you doing Leggo my foot Lunch is ready You ought to thank us instead of finding fault because we woke you up You might have slept right through the meal then you wouldn t have had anything to eat explained Walter Stacy shook his head No danger I wasn t afraid of that Not afraid of that Why not demanded Ned Cause I knew you d haul me out Left my feet sticking out so you would Everybody roared There was no resisting Stacy Brown s droll humor Hopeless averred the Professor shrugging his shoulders He s a wise one differed the guide Another name for laziness nodded Ned What s that disease they have down south asked Walter I heard the Professor and the postmaster talking about it back in Eureka You mean the the hook worm disease grinned the guide That s it That s what Chunky s got When a fellow is too lazy to do anything but eat they say he s got the the The hook finished the guide That s what he ought to get agreed Ned Gentlemen gentlemen corrected the Professor This is not a seemly topic for table discussion But we eat pigs feet suggested Stacy in wide eyed innocence The meal finished amid laughter and jest the party stowed their belongings and after a brief rest pushed on having decided that they would feel the heat less in the saddle At sundown the travelers were still some distance from the water hole for which the guide was making We ll have to go on he said We may have to ride some time after dark Will that be advisable questioned the Professor Not advisable but necessary The stock must have their water you know So the party pushed on The moon came up late in the evening and the guide looking about him discovered that they had borne too far to the east which necessitated their covering some four miles more of alkali than would have been the case had they kept more closely to their course It can t be helped he laughed good naturedly I guess the pigs feet will last you until we make camp How long will that be mister Parry questioned Chunky anxiously All of an hour and a half Stacy humorously took up his belt three holes Got two more holes left to take in he decided after examining the belt critically That s a new way to measure distance and time isn t it laughed the guide How wondered Stacy By the holes in your belt At eleven o clock that night Tom Parry announced that they had arrived at the end of their day s journey
5909_111961_000054_000000	train-clean-360	 Where s the water 
none	none	I don t see any water said Walter After supper we ll look for it I presume want something to eat first don t you questioned the guide Yes shouted the lads in chorus We re nearly starved Bacon and coffee constituted the bill of fare for their late meal which they ate out in the bright moonlight with the crackling camp fire near by This is fine announced Tad with which sentiment all the boys agreed Wish we could do this every night Your supper would be breakfast after a few days replied Parry How s that questioned Ned If you waited for moonlight I mean The moon comes up later every night you know That s so We d get hungry wouldn t we chuckled Stacy You wouldn t get You always are retorted Ned Now I ll show you how I know there is a water hole near here said Parry after they had finished their late meal When I locate it you boys may help me take the stock to it They walked back some twenty rods from where they had pitched the camp Parry meanwhile hunting about as if in search of something that he had dropped Nope No water here decided Stacy You don t know Ah Here is what I am looking for The guide pointed to a heap of stones that rose some twelve inches above the ground On the west side of the heap several stones had been placed in a row thus forming an arm that extended or pointed almost due west Know what that is asked Parry The lads shook their heads That s a water marker When a traveler across the desert finds a sink he indicates it either by a heap of stones which he sticks in the ground or by any other means at his command For instance this pile of stones tells me there is a water hole somewhere near by and the arm points the way to it Where is it then wondered Walter I don t see any signs of water Nor do I We ll follow the direction indicated by the arm and see if we don t come up with a water tank somewhere close by replied Parry With the guide leading the way the others following in single file they trailed away to the westward until finally they came to a slight depression in the ground It should be near here the guide informed them There it is See that dark hole The boys bounded forward dropping on their knees by the opening into which they peered inquiringly Suddenly they uttered a yell and springing up ran back as fast as their legs would carry them As they did so some dark object bounded from the water tank and leaped away into the sage brush Goodness me what was that cried Walter after the boys had pulled up and faced about Come back come back That was only a badger laughed the guide In the water asked Tad who had stood his ground No so much the worse for us There is no water there No need to look The tank is empty Some wandering prospector has emptied it to save his burros and fill his canteen announced the guide What are we going to do then queried Ned Do without it We shall have to give the stock a very little of our fresh supply saving only enough out of it for our own breakfast and a canteen full apiece to take with us on the morrow I think I shall be able to find a river about ten miles below here providing it has not changed its course or gone dry The water here in this country is as fickle as the desert itself What if we should fail to find any breathed Tad Well you know neither man nor beast can travel far on the desert without it But we ll find some to morrow Don t worry soothed the guide though in his innermost heart he was troubled That this water hole should prove to be dry did not promise well for those that were to follow CHAPTER IX THE BOYS DISCOVER A RIVER Where s that river you were talking about demanded the lads when the outfit pulled up at noon next day Don t you see it smiled Parry Not a river answered Ned gazing about him then allowing his glance to rest on the face of the guide to determine if Parry were making sport of them I am not sure myself I know where it should be Whether it s there or not is another matter Fetch the shovels and we ll soon find out Finding a river with shovels muttered Stacy Huh Who ever heard of such a thing But as soon as the boys had returned with the digging implements Parry swung the tools over his shoulder and strode confidently to the left of where they were encamped for the noonday rest The boys followed him full of curiosity Finally the guide threw down the tools and began to run his hands over the hot yellow soil Guess the sun s gone to his head muttered Ned as he squatted down to observe more closely what the guide was doing The other three lads followed his example In a moment they were on all fours hopping about like so many quadrupeds Parry was shaking with laughter as he observed them Bow Bow wow barked Chunky jumping on hands and feet snapping his teeth together suggestively The boys looked at each other and burst out laughing They had discovered all at once what a ridiculous figure they were making Sun gone to your head too Chunky chuckled Ned Oh no I forgot it s dog days he added maliciously Your master had better get a collar and chain for you then Ned laughed Stacy in high good humor with himself The guide s voice put a sudden end to their merriment Here s the river he cried There is plenty of water in it too The boys gathered about him quickly I don t see any river averred Walter There isn t any answered Ned in a low voice I ll show you whether there is or not snapped Parry who had overheard the remark You boys think I have gone crazy don t you You ll find there is something to learn about this old Nevada Desert some things that you never even dreamed of Hand me a shovel please All at once Stacy began pushing his companions roughly aside Here here Fatty What are you trying to do the others demanded beginning to struggle with him to prevent being bowled over I m saving your lives cried the fat boy Saving our lives cried Ned Go shake the alkali out of your eyes Yes you ll fall in and drown In what In the river Don t you see the river right there in front of you queried Stacy his eyes fairly beaming with importance No I don t If there was a river there you d be the first one to fall in and don t you forget that What s this What s this inquired the Professor approaching It s a river answered Stacy solemnly A river Yes sir Don t you hear it roar Wish I had a boat Is it water you are digging for mister Parry asked Professor Zepplin But the guide did not hear the question He was too busy with his mining operations at the moment Come on boys he urged Get busy here At what asked Ned We re with you but we don t know what you want us to do Yes can we help you inquired Tad Of course you can Get those other shovels and dig Where Right here Make the dirt fly as fast as you want to I ll show you something in a minute He did All at once the sand beneath them gave way and the Pony Rider Boys all except Stacy Brown uttered a yell as they sank waist deep into a sink of soft wet sand Parry had felt the sand giving way and with a warning had leaped from the hole The lads had not been quick enough There s no danger Don t be alarmed You ll get wet feet that s all What is it asked the Professor in amazement Water my dear sir Water in plenty It s a branch of the Pancake River These streams run underground for great distances on the desert but they change their course so often that you can t place any dependence on them We re lucky boys Hurrah for the water shouted the lads Keep on digging We haven t got it yet Master Stacy will you run to the camp and bring the folding buckets We ll soon have the hole cleaned so we can dip up some water Sure answered the fat boy thrusting his hands in his trousers pockets and strolling off at a leisurely gait as if there were no necessity for haste That s Chunky s idea of running laughed Ned Rector jerking his head in Stacy s direction The three lads finding there was no danger in their position had made no attempt to clamber from the hole Instead they began digging until the dirt flew so fast that the Professor was obliged to withdraw Somehow most of the dirt seemed to be flying through the air right in his direction Now the water began to rise above the caved in sand It was a dirty yellow in color and the boys clothing suffered as a result But the youngsters did not care Besides they were cooling off At last the hole had been cleared sufficiently to enable them to dip up some water but Stacy not having returned with the pails the Professor was sent to fetch him He found the lad enjoying himself tickling the nose of a drowsy burro Professor Zepplin led Chunky out to the water sink by one ear The lads now quickly dipped up pailful after pailful which they passed to the guide on the bank He ran with them to the stock giving each of the animals a little so that all might share in the first instalment Ponies and burros were wide awake now expressing their pleasure in loud whinnies and blatant brays It s foggy on the river laughed Ned The burros have started up their fog horns When Parry returned he brought with him the drinking cups which he had taken from the saddles Is it fit to drink asked Tad as the cups were passed down to them It s wet So are we retorted Ned But we re dirty Uh That s horrible stuff Strongly alkaline nodded the Professor after sipping gingerly at the brimming cup Parry had passed to him Do you not think we had better wait a little while until it settles Not a second if you re thirsty answered the guide shortly This stream is liable to change its course in the next ten minutes Don t you take any chances with a desert stream Fill the water bags and the canteens as fast as we can that s what we ll do Then if the water holds out there will be time enough to empty out our supply and fill with fresh Hey Chunky Haul those water bags over here called Walter Can t called Stacy He was sitting on the ground pulling off a shoe What s the trouble now snorted Ned Got a cramp No I ve got a sore toe Supposing we duck him suggested Ned We ll save all the water we have warned the guide sharply No nonsense about it either The party was in great good humor now that they had found a water hole and the animals had drunk until their sides were distended like balloons in process of being inflated They ve had enough announced the guide going to the animals and glancing over the herd sharply No more water for the present Then perhaps we might as well be on our way suggested the Professor Parry did not reply He was shading his eyes with one hand gazing intently off over the desert The Professor following the direction in which the guide was looking discovered a cloud of dust rising into the air The cloud was approaching them at a rapid rate CHAPTER X A COWBOY TAKES A HEADER What is that questioned Professor Zepplin sharply That s what I m trying to make out replied the guide Looks like horsemen Yes it is But I can t understand why they can be riding at that killing pace on a hot afternoon such as this About this time the boys attention had been attracted to the yellow cloud by Stacy Brown who notwithstanding his apparent slowness had sharp eyes when there was anything to be seen Somebody s coming he announced between sips What s that demanded Tad springing from the water hole followed closely by Walter and Ned Somebody coming to pay us an afternoon call By the way they re whooping it up they must be in a hurry about something All hands ran to where mister Parry and the Professor were standing The yellow cloud was rolling toward them at a rapid pace and ahead of it the boys discovered half a dozen horsemen who had evidently discovered the white tent that the Pony Rider Boys had erected during their midday stop Know them asked Tad I m not sure but I think it s Bud Stevens and the wild horse outfit Judging from the way they ride they re pretty wild themselves With a series of shrill y e o w s the strangers bore down on the little desert camp From the gray alkali flecked backs of the ponies clouds of steam were rising their sides streaked with dust and sweat Whoop Hooray bellowed the newcomers dashing up to the camp letting go a volley of revolver shots right into the ground in front of the Pony Rider Boys Not a boy flinched How said Tom Parry How roared Bud Stevens the leader throwing himself from the back of his trembling mount Where s the boss asked Parry He s gone down Ralston way Thought so Where you headed San Antone Range after more hoss flesh We ll rope the white stallion this time and don t you forget it Eh kiddie You re the little coyote what roped my pony and plunked me into the street back in Eureka ain t you Half jokingly he swung a vicious blow at Tad with the flat of his hand Had it landed it would have laid the lad flat Tad ducked and came up smiling Wow The kiddie s a regular little bantam We ll have to take a fall out of you Got to give you the desert initiation like they do in the secret societies back in Eureka He sought to close with Tad but the boy eluded him easily That ll do Bud warned the guide stepping between them No rough house here Want some water We ve got a water hole right over there Water Water Call the stuff we get out of the ground here water He he s had his head in soak already piped Stacy noting the perspiration dripping from the cowboy leader s face Parry gave the lad a warning look They re good enough fellows but they are full of pranks when they are not at work No need to stir them up and make them mad Got anything to eat demanded Bud How would you like some coffee sir asked Tad politely Coffee jeered the cowboy Now what d ye think of that fellows Ain t that right hospitable Yes thank you young man I guess that would touch the spot spoke up another of the band Course we ll have some coffee All right Ned will you and Walt fix something for the boys to eat If you will lead your ponies over to the water hole I ll dip up some water for them in the meantime gentlemen Kiddie yer all right bellowed Bud Stevens But I ve got to take a fall out of yer yet Some other time grinned Tad who felt no fear of the hulking cowboy See that nose demanded Bud sticking out his head at Tad Yes what s the matter That s my nose And that s where I barked it when you roped my pony tother day Oh I ve got to take it out of yer hide kiddie Come along We ll water the ponies Chunky help lead those bronchos to the water hole will you The two boys and the noisy plainsmen gathered the tired animals and led them to the hole that had been dug in the desert Stacy sprang in and began dipping out pails of water Bud grabbed the first pailful but instead of offering it to one of the thirsty animals he deliberately emptied the contents over the head of the boy down in the hole Hi there Stop that will you howled Stacy Brown The fat boy was mad all through He scrambled from the hole dragging a slopping pail of water after him while Bud Stevens roared with delight But his mirth was short lived Stacy ran around the hole and straight at the cowboy who had soaked him with the yellow water Up went the pail Splash The contents of it were hurled full in the face of the wild cowboy who at that moment having his mouth wide open got a mouthful of it The battle was on instantly Tad knew it was coming but he did not think it would be directed at him this time though he realized that he would have to protect his companion at any cost Choking and sputtering Bud made a blind lunge at Tad his eyes being so full of muddy water that he could barely make out the slender form of the Pony Rider Boy Tad ducked and dodged hoping that Stevens would tire of pursuing him in a moment The lad might have called to the others over by the camp but he was too proud to do that He would fight his own battles no matter what the odds were against him I ve got to get in muttered the lad He s seeing clearer every minute and the longer I wait the less chance I ll have of getting out with a whole skin I m coming kiddie roared Bud Tad made no reply Stooping as if for a spring Butler launched himself straight at the pillar of brawn and muscle before him Had he hesitated for the briefest part of a second had he permitted those muscular arms to close about him Tad Butler would have gone down to a quick and inglorious defeat But he did not wait The lad s right arm was brought sharply against the neck of his adversary while at the same time his left arm was slipped under the cowboy s right leg The result was that Stevens lurched to the left A quick jerk and Bud was fairly lifted from the ground Tad gave a quick forceful tug Bud Stevens landed on his head in the pool of yellow water his feet beating the air wildly Illustration Bud Stevens Landed on His Head in the Pool of Yellow Water Grab hold of a foot Chunky commanded Tad Quick He ll drown in a minute in there Oh let im drown drawled Stacy blinking to get the sand out of his eyes Get hold I tell you I ll thrash you Stacy Brown if you don t Stacy reluctantly complied Tad in the meantime having grasped the cowboy s foot and began pulling Not that way Chunky Do you want to pull him apart The fat boy was trying to get Bud s right leg out from the opposite side of the water hole The disturbance had by this time attracted the attention of the men over in the camp They started on the run when they saw Bud turned head first into the water hole By the time they reached the scene Tad and Stacy had succeeded in hauling the victim from his perilous position Bud was choking between roars of rage His companions went off into shrieks of laughter when they understood what had happened They rolled on the ground they danced about their fallen companion and then their revolvers began to add their vicious voices to the tumult Tad paid no attention to the uproar He was too busy shaking the water out of his fallen antagonist to whom he was giving first aid to the drowning Bud staggered to his feet gasped for breath while Tad stepped off a few paces so as not to be within reach of those long bony arms should Bud decide to stretch them forth and take him in Guess you got all that was coming to you that time Bud Stevens grinned Tom Parry Served you right You ll let those boys alone after this or you ll have to reckon with me Stevens s face was streaked with wet sand his hair was disheveled and his clothes stuck to him as if they had been pasted on The cowboy s sullen face slowly relaxed into a mirthless grin Say kiddie you put it over me like a cactus plant I owe you two I d cancel the debt if I were in your place laughed the boy Come along and have a drink of coffee It ll warm you up after your swim CHAPTER XI A PIECE OF HUMAN SANDPAPER An appetizing meal had been spread for the visitors But every time the men glanced at their companion they broke out into loud guffaws You re a sight Bud jeered one Next time better take a man of your size said another Guess that s right grinned the vanquished one Ye can t most always tell what a kid s going to do We know what this one did do to you though laughed another Reckon I do myself admitted Stevens Say kiddie you come along with us and try them tricks on the wild hosses we re going to catch Mebby I ll forgit to take it out of you I ll let the white stallion do that Thank you I ll accept that invitation with Professor Zepplin s permission We intended to drop in on your bunch anyway interposed Parry The boss has invited us to join a horse hunt with you Better go along with us now then suggested Stevens We won t have no more rough house leastwise till we get to the San Antone Range eh No replied Parry We have a pack train to drag along Besides you fellows travel too fast for us We ll take our time and join you later The bath and the hot coffee had served to quiet Bud Stevens s bubbling spirits He was by this time a more rational being After they had finished the meal Bud drew Tad Butler aside confidentially Say kiddie I like you he said slapping the lad a violent blow between the shoulders Glad of it laughed Tad But you have a queer way of showing your affection Say can you ride Some admitted Tad As well as you can fight and throw a rope I was not aware that I did either one very well Go away Go away You re a champeen I ve got a spavined ring boned cayuse over in the range that I m going to put you up against when you join us He ll give you all the exercise you want Hey Bud ain t it bout time we were moseying called one of Stevens s companions I reckon Can t be any hotter than tis now When you going to join us Parry We ll be there in a few days But come here I want to talk with you Sure thing If we go on a hunt with you remember there s to be no funny business These boys while they re no tenderfeet are fine fellows and they must be treated well I m responsible for them What I say goes Understand We ll look out for the kids don t you get in a hot stew bout that With a final whoop and a cheer for the members of Tom Parry s party the turbulent cowboys put spurs to their ponies Once more a cloud of dust rose from the desert across which it slowly rolled The boys watched it for half an hour until the cloud had dwindled to a mere speck in the distance Not such a bad lot after all was the Professor s conclusion Rough diamonds smiled the guide Are we going on now mister Parry asked Tad No I think we may as well unpack and make camp here until to morrow morning Then the stock will be fresh and so shall we The stock looks to be in pretty good shape already answered Tad Yes but they will be much better to morrow A day s water and feed will do wonders for them I guess the bunch of horse hunters made quite a hole in our fodder didn t they There was nothing the matter with their appetites that I observed laughed Tad But we ve got enough to last us for some time How long before we shall strike the range where we are to join them Parry glanced off over the desert meditatively If we have no bad luck we ought to make it in three days The cowboys will get there some time to morrow One of them won t answered Tad confidently Why not His pony is wind broken Didn t you hear him breathe when they rode in What with the bunch howling like a pack of coyotes No I didn t hear a horse breathe I did chimed in Stacy Did what queried Ned turning on him sharply Rector had not heard the fat boy approach them Heard the big cowboy breathe He wheezed like a leaky steam engine Tad and the guide burst out laughing Why boy we weren t talking about the cowboy We were speaking of one of the bronchos Tad says he is wind broken Huh grunted Stacy strolling off with hands thrust in his pockets chin on his breast When I m not right I m always wrong he muttered Mostly wrong They did not see the lad again for more than an hour The rest of the party gathered under the tent they had first erected where they now fell to discussing their late visitors next turning to their plans for the morrow Do we follow the same course when we next start asked the Professor Not quite We veer a little more to the west until we string the San Antonio Range When we leave there if you conclude to go on we shall head southward toward Death Valley I understand you are willing to penetrate it a little way Yes if you think it is safe to do so Parry shrugged his shoulders Death Valley is no better than its name If you wish merely to see it I think I can gratify your desire Yes yes we want to see Death Valley chorused the boys Don t be afraid for us I ll try to get some water bags from the horse hunters when we join them for the further south one goes on the desert the more scarce the water becomes The sun was lying low by this time and the advance guard of the evening coolness began crowding back the heat of the day I wonder what has become of Chunky questioned Tad suddenly rising from the ground where he had thrown himself in the shade of the tent The others glanced quickly about them Probably find him asleep behind a bunch of sage somewhere answered Ned lightly Don t trouble yourself about him Perhaps over by the water hole suggested the guide I ll stroll over that way Just then a figure topped the ridge beyond them It was yelling lustily leaping into the air rolling and groveling on the ground alternately There he is Something s happened to him shouted Walter All hands started on a run They could not imagine what had gone wrong with the fat boy As they drew nearer to him they discovered that he had taken off all his clothes His body was as red as if it had been painted The Professor s long legs were covering the alkali at a pace that left the others behind until Tad spurted and headed him Chunky Chunky What s the matter he shouted Stacy yelled more lustily than ever What is it What is it shouted the others in chorus I m burned alive I m cremated Oh w o w Should think you would he What on earth have you got your clothes off for They discovered that something was the matter then for an expression of real pain had taken the place of the complacent look they were wont to see on the face of Stacy Brown He s been boiling himself exclaimed the guide with quick intuition Grasping the fat boy Parry threw him flat on the ground and began rolling him in the sand Stacy yelled more lustily than before Run to my saddlebags Fetch the black bottle you will find there commanded the guide It s oil yes Hurry before his skin all peels off Tad was back with the black bottle in no time Tom Parry spread the oil over the blistered flesh of the fat boy whose yells grew less and less explosive as he felt the soothing effects of the grease on his body Wha what happened stammered Walter I I fell in In where questioned the Professor sharply I don t know It was hot Put your clothes on You ll be all right in a little while Where did you leave them Stacy pointed back on the desert some distance whereat Parry laughingly said he would go in search of the clothing Now if you will be good enough to tell me what all this uproar is about I shall be obliged to you requested the Professor Why the boy found a boiling spring And he fell in added Ned solemnly He did agreed the guide without the suspicion of a smile Is that it Master Stacy Stacy nodded Tell me about it I I was walking along with my hands in my pockets Thinking interjected Ned What d you suppose I was doing Ain t I always thinking when I m not asleep Go on go on urged Ned unsympathetically All at once something slipped I went right through the ground At first I thought I was a pond of ice water it felt so cold Next thing I knew I was burning up But your clothes What did you have them off for urged the Professor I took them off when I thought I was burning up Say fellows that was the hottest ice water I ever took a bath in my life The boys could barely resist their inclination to laugh Why don t you laugh if you want to Never mind me I don t count growled Chunky Parry explained that these boiling springs were not infrequent on the desert They were found generally further north he said This one must have worked its way up through the alkali until only a thin crust covered it and this crust the boy had had the misfortune to step on and break through You wouldn t think there were so many pitfalls under this baked desert would you questioned Ned I look like a piece of human sandpaper don t I muttered Stacy ruefully as he carefully drew on his clothes Every time I sit down I ll remember that hot ice water CHAPTER XII RUNNING DOWN THE TRAIL Thank goodness we re in the foothills sighed Tad when three days later they came to a halt at the base of the San Antonio Range far down on the Nevada Desert Yes it is a relief to see some real rocks once more agreed Walter Chunky look out that you don t step into any more ice water You ll miss the horse hunt if you do No danger of that up here laughed the guide Behind them lay the desert maze to the right and left mountain ranges high plateaux mesas and buttes Giant yucca trees short spreading pinon and spindling cedars clothed the higher peaks of the San Antonio Range Trees too were scattered about in the foothills and though they gave little shade it was a relief to every sense of the Pony Riders to feel the hills and trees about them There with what little shade they could get the lads made camp As yet they had found no water though Parry said there would be springs in plenty further up in the mountains The bags still held enough to last them until the following day so no effort was made to locate fresh water that afternoon Stacy had thrown himself down under one of the yucca trees but the late afternoon sun filtered through the branches making his face look red and heated You don t seem to be getting much shade from that tree laughed the guide Bout as much as I would from a barbed wire fence frowned Stacy What do you know about barbed wire fences demanded Ned Me Know all bout them One night I had a falling out with one when I was taking a short cut across the fields to get home How about the apples Did you get them asked Tad Apples What do you know bout it Were you there too A laugh greeted the fat boy s reply Come come young men Are you going to make camp urged the Professor Didn t know we were going to remain here to night replied Walter Of course we re going to make camp if that s the case It ll be a good time to shake the alkali dust out of our belongings and from ourselves I haven t got any dust piped Stacy I I had a bath a hot bath Are we anywhere near the horse hunters mister Parry inquired Tad as the boys began unpacking the burros some devoting their attention to the kitchen outfit the rest spreading the canvas on the ground preparatory to erecting the tents They are supposed to be further up the range They will be down this way to morrow probably to pick us up They were not certain where they would make their permanent camp Stevens said All depends upon where the wild horses are grazing I don t see any wild horses nor any other wild anything objected Ned The guide dropped the ridge pole that he was about to carry to the place where the cook tent had been laid out ready to be raised Come with me he said taking Ned by the arm and leading him to the left of their camping place Do you see that What Use your eyes If you re going to be a plainsman you ll have to depend on your sense of sight Take the desert for instance It s a desert maze if you are unable to read its signs no maze at all if you do What is it you were going to show Ned asked the rest of the boys who had followed them out See if you can tell Master Tad But Master Tad had already been using his eyes He nodded as he caught the guide s eye There has been a bunch of unshod ponies along here if that is what you mean he said How do you know demanded Stacy I see their tracks there Saw them the minute I got over here Maybe that s the crowd that called at our camp the other day suggested Walter The guide shook his head There was no one on these horses said Tad Right emphasized the guide That s observation young men You will notice by examining these hoofprints carefully that the weight of the animal is thrown more on the toe How do you know that cut in Stacy Because the toe sinks into the soil more than it would if the animals were loaded In the latter event the heels would dig deeper Now if you will follow along a little further I may be able to show you the hoofprints of the leader of the band of wild horses for that is what they are Wild horses marveled the boys Wish we could see them said Tad I ll wager they have seen us already for they surely are in this neighborhood replied Parry But a wild horse is as sharp as an old fox The herd have been down in the foothills and by the hoofprints you will observe that they have returned to the mountain fastness Perhaps they saw us coming suggested Tad More than likely agreed the guide They were in a hurry and moving rapidly there There s the leader s trail Look carefully and you will see where he leaped up to this little butte here Reaching it he turned about and took a quick comprehensive look at the desert And at us added Stacy Yes I think so Come up here You see this little ridge gave him a very good view of the desert maze See if you can tell how many wild horses there were in the bunch suggested Tom Parry Instantly the boys went down on all fours crawling along the trail seeking to read the story that it told Well how many queried the guide after they had finished their inspection Fifty shouted Stacy Forty five answered Ned and Walter at the same time What do you say Master Tad I am afraid I must have missed some then I only make out twenty one old ones and a colt I take it the old mare was with the colt for the prints show that the little animal was hugging the other closely was Tad s decision Very good Very good nodded Parry There were twenty two You didn t get the trailer probably an old mare She traveled along off to the right yonder a little But I should like to know how you made fifty Master Stacy twinkled the guide Counted em answered the fat boy Show me Stacy did so going over the hoofprints carefully pointing to them with his index finger as he did so the guide making mental calculations at the same time And that makes fifty fifty fifty four this time There s more of them than I thought Parry laughed softly I m afraid you d make a poor Indian young man You not only have counted the hoof prints but you have counted the foot marks of yourself and your companions as well Master Tad let me see if you can run the trail up the mountain side a little way It will be good practice I want you boys to be able to follow a trail as keenly as the best of them before you have finished this trip You never know when it s going to be useful when it s going to get you out of serious difficulties even to the extent of saving your lives Tad was off on a trot stooping well over with eyes fixed on the foot marks Tad could hunt jack rabbits without a dog couldn t he questioned Stacy innocently His companions laughed Is that a joke asked Ned If it is I ll cry Your jokes would make a Texas steer weep Tad was picking his way up the rough mountain side now losing the trail then picking it up again The marks left by the wild horses were almost indistinguishable after the animals had reached the rocks but here and there a broken twig told the lad they had passed that way Once he appeared to leave the trail moving sharply to the right where on a shelving ridge he straightened up and looked down into the valley Tom Parry nodded encouragingly Know what you ve found Yes this is where the leader came to make another observation answered Tad That s right He s a plainsman already boys Go on Run the trail up to the top of this first ridge It will not be a bad idea for us to know which way they ve gone If the hunters don t show up by to morrow we can take a little run after the herd on our own hook Tad obeyed gladly Every sense was on the alert The rest of the boys were all impatience to take part in the hunt But the guide said no He feared that if all were to start up the mountain side their enthusiasm might lead them too far from camp resulting in their losing their way He knew how tricky the trail of a band of wild horses was the clever animals leaving no ruse untried that would tend to mix up and lose their pursuers Tad s figure was growing smaller as he ascended higher and higher You don t mean to say that horses climbed up the way he is going questioned Walter incredulously That s the way they went my boy They re regular goats when it comes to mountain climbing They ll go where a man could not oftentimes Tad crept cautiously on now finding little to guide him save his own instinct He finally disappeared behind the rocks and trees of the low lying range The lad was moving almost noiselessly now A sound a short distance beyond him caused him to prick up his ears sharply I believe I am near them he breathed as he glanced about him Why did I not think to bring my rope It was just as well for his own well being that he had not brought along that part of his saddle equipment He was following the trail with the skill of a trained mountaineer An Indian himself could have done it no better Perhaps the guide understood better than did Tad himself why he had started the lad on the trail for a quiet smile hung about the lips of Tom Parry All at once his twinkling eyes lit up with a new expression Look Look gasped Walter Where Where demanded Ned Walter pointed to a pyramid shaped rock far above their heads At first they could scarcely believe their senses There poised in the air feet doubled into a bunch stood a splendid specimen of horse flesh resting it seemed fairly on the sharp point of the rock gazing down into and across the valley The white stallion breathed the lads all in the same breath The magnificent animal was a creamy white Its head was held high nostrils distended as if to catch the scent of those for whom it was looking Beneath the rays of the low lying sun its coat glistened and shone with a luster that no brush or comb could bring to it The lads gazed upon the beautiful statue almost in awe They were standing quite close up under the shadow of the mountain at that moment Why doesn t he run whispered Walter Do you think he sees us asked Ned No Stand perfectly still Why doesn t he All he would have to do would be to look down questioned Stacy He scents us He knows we are somewhere near But if you will observe him closely you will notice that he is looking at the camp He sees the Professor moving about explained Parry Do do you think we could catch him asked Ned eagerly The most skillful men in this part of the country have been trying to do that very thing for the last five years my boy answered the guide in a low tone No you couldn t catch him He s the finest animal to be found in the entire Nevada Desert district Wouldn t mind owning him myself In the meantime Tad had been creeping nearer and nearer He soon discovered that the leader of the band had swerved to the left He concluded to follow to see where the solitary animal had gone to But so quietly did the lad move that the stallion neither heard nor scented him All at once the wonderful sight unfolded before the eyes of Tad Butler He flattened himself on the ground within thirty yards of the splendid animal Suddenly the stallion whirled Tad rose to his feet The two stood facing each other Tad with head thrust forward the stallion with nostrils held high in the air Oh my rope my rope breathed the boy If I had my rope CHAPTER XIII COYOTES JOIN IN THE CHORUS Those down in the foothills saw the animal whirl and face the other way He sees something cried Walter forgetting in his excitement that they were trying to keep quiet Yes he has probably scented Master Tad explained the guide Think he ll try to catch the horse asked Stacy Hope not Those wild horses are bad medicine No of course he has no rope with him But he ll be wise if he keeps out of the way of the beast Tad had no thought of doing either He stood perfectly still gazing in awe and wonder at the handsomest horse he had ever seen The stallion s eyes blazed He uttered a loud snort then rose right up into the air on his hind feet One bound brought him many feet nearer the boy who was observing him It was the only direction in which the stallion could go without plunging into a chasm Whoa commanded Tad sharply The white horse never having been trained failed to understand the word but he halted just the same gazing angrily at the bold boy standing there who it appeared was defying him Uttering another snort this time full of menace the animal leaped straight toward the lad in long graceful bounds Tad threw up his hands to frighten the stallion aside The animal however refused to be swerved from its course He s going to run over me cried the boy as he noted that the horse was rising for another leap Tad ducked just as the beast sprang clear of the ground He felt the rush of air as the gleaming body was lifted over his head the boy at the instant uttering a shrill yell to hasten the stallion s movements The front hoofs caught the rim of the Pony Rider Boy s sombrero snipping it from his head The hind feet came closer They raked Tad s head bowling him completely over rolling him from the knoll on which he had been standing He brought up with a jolt some ten feet further down Tad scrambled to his feet a little dizzy from the blow and the fall Whew That was a close call he muttered feeling his head to learn if it had been injured No the skin isn t broken but I m going to have a beautiful goose egg there he concluded It s swelling already If I d had my rope I could have roped him easily when he rose at me that last time Scrambling up the bank Tad found his hat Then he picked his way to the pyramid shaped rock on which he had first discovered the stallion Poising himself he swung his sombrero to his companions down in the foothills Hurrah he shouted I met the enemy I ve seen the white stallion fellows Is the enemy yours jeered Ned Rector No I rather think I was his laughed Tad turning back and hurrying down the rocks to rejoin his companions He was met by a volley of questions the moment he reached the foothills With his companions gathered about him Tad told them how he had followed the trail finally coming upon the handsome animal while the latter was taking an observation from the pyramid shaped rock It s a wonder he didn t attack you said the guide after the lad had finished his narration Those wild stallions are very savage when aroused I guess he tried to do so all right laughed Tad I knew he was up there somewhere watching us but I did not think for a minute that you would get close enough to him to be in any danger announced Tom Parry with a disapproving shake of his head I could have roped him easily said the lad Lucky for you that you didn t try it It s getting late now I presume the Professor is beginning to think we are not going to finish pitching our camp Come we ll go back and get to work The work went rather slowly however for the lads were too full of the subject of the wild stallion to devote their whole attention to putting their camp to rights for the night Then again they had to go all over the story for the Professor s benefit Do you think we could catch one of these wild ones to take back East with us asked Tad You couldn t catch one yourself but you might be able to buy one for a small sum from the horse hunters the guide informed him How much Depends on the animal Perhaps twenty or twenty five dollars Then I ll do it I could get him home for as much more and he d be worth at least two hundred dollars Perhaps I might take two of them along providing I can get what I want You ought to be a horseman laughed the guide You ve got the horseman s instinct He is a horseman volunteered Stacy There aren t any better Thank you glowed Tad I ll pull you out next time you fall in for that They were very jolly at supper that night They had nothing to trouble them Water was near by and they were soon to participate in the most exciting event in their lives a wild horse hunt Do you think they will be able to find us questioned Walter Who the horses returned Ned I hope they do laughed the guide No Master Walter means Bud Stevens and the gang Find us Why those fellows could trail a cat across the Desert Maze if they happened to take a notion to do so There being plenty of dry stuff about the boys built up a blazing camp fire as soon as night came on Gathering about it they told stories and sang songs I move that Stacy Chunky Brown favor us with a selection suggested Ned He has a very rare voice an underdone voice some might call it Yes Chunky urged Walter You haven t sung for us since we started Me I can t sing Besides it might scare the wild horses protested Stacy I guess there s no doubt about that But we ll take the chances Yes do sing Chunky added Walter It may soften Ned s hard heart Stacy cocked an impish eye at Ned Rector All right I ll sing decided the fat boy clearing his throat Stand up thundered Ned Have some respect for the audience Stacy stood up What are you going to favor us with questioned Tad It s a little thing of my own grinned Stacy Hope you ll like it Oh we ll like it all right chuckled Ned The audience will please refrain from applauding until the performer finishes What s the name of the piece demanded Walter Hasn t been named You can name it if you wish Go ahead go ahead Never mind the name chorused the lads Stacy surveyed the upturned laughing faces of his companions and then launched out in a shrill soprano It s all day long on the alka li Where the coyotes howl and the wells run dry Where the badgers badge in the water holes And the twisters twist the old tent poles Right up from the alka li Yeow shrieked the Pony Rider Boys It s a new poet Hurrah for the poet lariat shouted Ned Rector jumping up and down slapping his thighs in his amusement Go on give us another verse laughed the guide That s real po try that is Is there another verse cried Walter Chunky nodded solemnly Hush He is going to sing some more cautioned Tad Butler holding up his hand for silence Ahem began Stacy Throwing back his head he began again When the wind blows high o er the Desert Maze And sand in your eyes interferes with your gaze Then the Pony Rider Boys they lose their pants Don t dare sit down for fear of the ants That hide in the alka li Stacy sat down blinking solemn as an owl But if he was solemn his companions were quite the opposite The boys formed a ring about him and between their yells of appreciation began dancing around in a circle shouting out in chorus the last two lines of the second verse Don t dare sit down for fear of the ants That hide in the alka li Professor Zepplin and Tom Parry were laughing immoderately but their voices could not be heard above the uproar made by the joyous Pony Riders No such carnival of fun probably ever had disturbed the foothills of the San Antonio range nor extended so far out over the maze of the great Nevada Desert Sing it again Sing it again commanded the boys They hauled the protesting Chunky to his feet stood him on a box of pickled pigs feet compelling him to begin the song all over again It s all day long on the alka li Where the coyotes howl and Ki i i i o o o Ki i i i o o o ki K i i i o o ki A long wailing sound a dismal howl suddenly cut short the joyous ditty What s that Ki i i i o o o Ki i i i o o ki Coyotes laughed the guide There seemed to be hundreds of them From every peak in the range their mournful voices were protesting All at once out in the black maze of the desert another bunch of them began their weird wailing We re surrounded announced the Professor Shall we get the guns asked Walter No they re expressing their indignation at Chunky s song jeered Ned Let em howl I don t care If they don t stop I ll sing some more threatened the fat boy

none	none	 FUN IN THE FOOTHILLS 
5909_111961_000006_000000	train-clean-360	The Professor found difficulty even in driving the lads to their beds that night 
5909_111961_000006_000001	train-clean-360	When they did finally tumble in and pull the blankets over them they were unable to sleep between the howling of the coyotes and their laughter over Stacy Brown s new found talent 
5909_111961_000007_000000	train-clean-360	 They ll go away when the moon comes up called the guide when the boys protested that the beasts kept them awake 
none	none	Why can t we shoot at them asked Stacy It will alarm the wild horses said the guide
5909_111961_000009_000001	train-clean-360	 We don t want to chase them off the range 
none	none	Neither would the horse hunters like it if we were to begin shooting
5909_111961_000010_000000	train-clean-360	 Go to sleep commanded the Professor 
none	none	Then the boys settled down After a time the moon came up but instead of quieting the coyotes it seemed to have urged them on to renewed efforts 
5909_111961_000011_000002	train-clean-360	They grew bolder 
5909_111961_000011_000003	train-clean-360	They approached the camp until a circle of them surrounded it 
5909_111961_000012_000000	train-clean-360	Out of Stacy Brown s tent crept a figure in its night clothes 
5909_111961_000012_000001	train-clean-360	It was none other than Stacy himself 
5909_111961_000012_000002	train-clean-360	In one hand he held a can of condensed milk that he had smuggled from the commissary department that afternoon 
none	none	He wriggled along in the shadow of a slight rise of ground until he had approached quite near the beasts 
5909_111961_000013_000001	train-clean-360	He could see them plainly now and Stacy s eyes looked like two balls 
5909_111961_000014_000000	train-clean-360	The animals would elevate their noses in the air and as if at a prearranged signal all would strike the first note of their mournful wail at identically the same instant 
5909_111961_000015_000000	train-clean-360	Suddenly the figure of the Pony Rider Boy rose up before them right in the middle of one of the unearthly wails 
5909_111961_000016_000000	train-clean-360	 Boo said Stacy explosively at the same time hurling the can of condensed milk full in the face of the coyote nearest to him 
5909_111961_000017_000000	train-clean-360	His aim was true 
5909_111961_000017_000001	train-clean-360	The can landed right between the eyes of the animal The coyote uttered a grunt of surprise hesitated an instant then with tail between his legs bounded away with a howl of fear 
5909_111961_000018_000000	train-clean-360	 Yeow Scat shrieked the fat boy 
5909_111961_000019_000000	train-clean-360	The whole pack turned tail and ran with Stacy after them in full flight headed for the desert 
5909_111961_000020_000000	train-clean-360	Tom Parry aroused by this new note in the midnight medley tumbled out just in time to see Stacy disappearing over the ridge 
5909_111961_000020_000001	train-clean-360	The guide was followed quickly by the other three boys of the party and Professor Zepplin 
5909_111961_000021_000000	train-clean-360	 Hey come back here shouted Parry 
5909_111961_000022_000000	train-clean-360	The fat boy paid no attention to him 
none	none	He was too busy chasing coyotes across the desert at that moment to give heed to anything else
5909_111961_000023_000000	train-clean-360	 Get after him boys 
5909_111961_000023_000001	train-clean-360	If he falls they re liable to pile on him and chew him up before we can get to him commanded the guide 
none	none	Over the ridge bounded the pajama brigade 
5909_111961_000024_000001	train-clean-360	The coyotes frightened beyond their power of reasoning if such a faculty was possessed by them were now no more than so many black streaks lengthening out across the desert 
5909_111961_000025_000000	train-clean-360	The lads set up a whoop as they started on the chase after their companion 
5909_111961_000026_000000	train-clean-360	 Rope him somebody shouted Parry 
5909_111961_000027_000000	train-clean-360	 Haven t any rope answered Tad with a muttered Ouch as his big toe came in contact with the can of condensed milk 
5909_111961_000028_000000	train-clean-360	Laughing and shouting they soon came up with Stacy however because he could not run as fast as the other boys 
5909_111961_000028_000001	train-clean-360	Tad caught up with him first and the two lads went down together 
5909_111961_000028_000002	train-clean-360	In another minute the rest of the party had piled on the heap 
5909_111961_000029_000000	train-clean-360	 Get up shouted Tad 
5909_111961_000029_000001	train-clean-360	 Somebody s standing on my neck 
none	none	Yes and and you ve pushed my face into the desert came the muffled voice of Chunky Brown Laughing and all talking at once the knot was slowly untied Two of them grabbed the fat boy under the arms while a third got between the lad s feet and picked them up much as one would the handles of a wheelbarrow In that manner they triumphantly carried Stacy back to the camp 
5909_111961_000032_000000	train-clean-360	Reaching his tent they threw the fat boy into his bed 
5909_111961_000033_000000	train-clean-360	The tall gaunt figure of the Professor appeared suddenly at the tent entrance 
5909_111961_000033_000001	train-clean-360	Some of the boys darted by him the others crawling out under the sides of the tent all making a lively sprint for their own quarters 
5909_111961_000034_000000	train-clean-360	 Young men the very next one who raises a disturbance in this camp to night is going to get a real old fashioned trouncing 
5909_111961_000034_000001	train-clean-360	Not having any slipper I ll use my shoe 
5909_111961_000034_000002	train-clean-360	Do you hear 
none	none	Not a voice answered him but as he strode away the moon like face of Stacy Brown might have been seen peering out at him Quiet reigned in the camp of the Pony Rider Boys for several hours after that 
5909_111961_000035_000002	train-clean-360	Yet they were destined not to pass the night without a further disturbance though the Professor did not use his shoe to chastise the noisy ones 
5909_111961_000036_000000	train-clean-360	It lacked only a few hours to daylight when the second interruption occurred 
5909_111961_000036_000001	train-clean-360	And when it arrived it was even more startling than had been the fat boy s chase of the cowardly coyotes 
5909_111961_000037_000000	train-clean-360	There was a sudden sound of hoof beats 
none	none	Ki yi Ki yi shrieked a chorus of voices 
5909_111961_000039_000000	train-clean-360	A volley of shots was fired as an accompaniment to the startling yells A moment later and a body of horsemen dashed into camp which they had easily located by the smouldering camp fire 
5909_111961_000040_000000	train-clean-360	The Pony Rider Boys were out of their tents in a twinkling 
5909_111961_000041_000000	train-clean-360	 Wow piped Stacy 
none	none	Bang Bang 
5909_111961_000043_000000	train-clean-360	Two bullets flicked the dirt up into his face 
none	none	Bud Stevens and his companions were in a playful mood again Hey you 
5909_111961_000044_000001	train-clean-360	Better look out where you re shooting to warned Stacy 
none	none	Bud let go another volley
5909_111961_000046_000000	train-clean-360	 The Professor ll take you over his knee and chastise you with his shoe if you don t watch sharp said Stacy 
5909_111961_000047_000000	train-clean-360	 Come out of that 
5909_111961_000047_000001	train-clean-360	Where s the kiddie 
5909_111961_000047_000002	train-clean-360	I want to see my kiddie laughed Bud Stevens 
5909_111961_000048_000000	train-clean-360	By this time with his companions he had dismounted turning the ponies loose to roam where they would 
5909_111961_000048_000001	train-clean-360	The whole camp aroused by the shouting and shooting had turned out after pulling on their trousers and shoes 
5909_111961_000048_000002	train-clean-360	Tom Parry piling fresh fuel on the embers of the camp fire soon had the scene brightly lighted 
5909_111961_000048_000003	train-clean-360	There was no more sleep in camp that night 
5909_111961_000048_000004	train-clean-360	Professor Zepplin accepted the new disturbance with good grace 
5909_111961_000049_000000	train-clean-360	 We re going to eat breakfast with you Bud Stevens informed them 
none	none	That s right 
5909_111961_000050_000001	train-clean-360	What we have is free answered the Professor hospitably 
5909_111961_000051_000000	train-clean-360	 That s what I was telling the bunch nodded Bud 
5909_111961_000051_000001	train-clean-360	 Our chuck wagon ll be along when it gets here 
none	none	We ve got a schooner with six lazy mules toting it down along the edge of the foothills If it ever gets here we ll stock you up with enough fodder to last you the rest of your natural lives
5909_111961_000052_000000	train-clean-360	 A schooner did you say questioned Stacy edging closer to the cowboy 
5909_111961_000059_000000	train-clean-360	 Yep 
5909_111961_000053_000000	train-clean-360	 Yep schooner 
none	none	Where s the water
5909_111961_000055_000000	train-clean-360	 Say moon face didn t you ever hear tell of a prairie schooner 
none	none	Chunky shook his head
5909_111961_000057_000000	train-clean-360	 Well you ve got something coming to you then replied Bud turning to the others again 
none	none	When do you start your horse hunt 
5909_111961_000058_000001	train-clean-360	I presume that s the purpose of your visit here asked the Professor 
none	none	Yep 
5909_111961_000059_000001	train-clean-360	Soon as the wagon gets here with the trappings 
5909_111961_000059_000002	train-clean-360	After breakfast we ll look around a bit 
none	none	Been some of them through here to day I see
5909_111961_000060_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes how did you know that questioned Tad 
none	none	We crossed the trail just at the edge of the camp here when we came in Didn t you see them
5909_111961_000062_000000	train-clean-360	 We saw one of them and the tracks of the rest 
none	none	Yes we we we saw the white horse The Angel demanded Bud interested at once
5909_111961_000065_000000	train-clean-360	 I don t know whether you d call it an angel or not 
5909_111961_000065_000001	train-clean-360	It struck me that it was quite the opposite laughed Tad 
none	none	It was a white stallion and when I got in its way it just bowled me over and rolled me down the hill
5909_111961_000066_000000	train-clean-360	 The white stallion fellows nodded Bud 
5909_111961_000066_000001	train-clean-360	 I told you so 
5909_111961_000066_000002	train-clean-360	Come along kiddie and show me that trail 
5909_111961_000066_000003	train-clean-360	I ll tell you in a minute if he s the one 
5909_111961_000067_000000	train-clean-360	Tad took the horse hunter to the trail that he had followed up the mountain side 
none	none	Bud lighted match after match by the light of which he ran over the confusion of hoofprints 
5909_111961_000067_000002	train-clean-360	Finally he paused over one particular spot and with a frown peered down upon it 
5909_111961_000068_000000	train-clean-360	 That s him 
5909_111961_000068_000001	train-clean-360	That s the Angel he emphasized 
5909_111961_000069_000000	train-clean-360	 Why do you call him that 
none	none	Because of two things answered Bud First place he s white That s the color angels is supposed to be most of em says 
5909_111961_000070_000002	train-clean-360	Then if you ll look at his hoof mark you ll see the frog is shaped like a heart 
5909_111961_000070_000003	train-clean-360	More angel 
5909_111961_000070_000004	train-clean-360	Then again that s three times ain t it he s got a temper like angels ain t supposed to have 
none	none	So I have observed agreed Tad with a laugh And that s why we call him the Angel 
5909_111961_000072_000001	train-clean-360	We ll get the old gentleman this time or break every cinch strap in the outfit 
none	none	There was rejoicing among the horse hunters when they heard that it was indeed the Angel himself whose trail they had come upon He s got the finest bunch of horse flesh with him that you ll find anywhere on the desert averred another Old Angel won t travel with any scarecrows in his band 
5909_111961_000074_000002	train-clean-360	He s proud as a peacock with a new spread of tail feathers 
none	none	S pose you don t know how many there are in the band eh kiddie questioned Bud Twenty one and a colt answered Tad promptly Oho 
5909_111961_000077_000001	train-clean-360	So but Tom Parry told you of course 
5909_111961_000078_000000	train-clean-360	 Tom Parry didn t objected the guide 
5909_111961_000078_000001	train-clean-360	 Master Tad read the trail himself 
5909_111961_000079_000000	train-clean-360	 Shake glowed Bud extending his hand to Tad 
5909_111961_000079_000001	train-clean-360	 You re the right sort for this outfit 
5909_111961_000079_000002	train-clean-360	We ll let you help point the bunch into the corral when we get them going 
none	none	You ll see stars before you get through with that job stars that ain t down on the sky pilot s chart
5909_111961_000080_000000	train-clean-360	 It won t be the first time mister Stevens 
none	none	I ve seen enough of them to make a Fourth of July celebration already 
5909_111961_000081_000000	train-clean-360	Just after breakfast to which the camp had sat down at break of day the horse hunters began their preliminary work 
5909_111961_000081_000001	train-clean-360	Bud directed two of his men to work south two more to ride north while he would take the center of the range 
5909_111961_000082_000000	train-clean-360	 What I want he explained to the boys is to find where the wild horses are waterin these days 
none	none	They ve been around these parts for more than two weeks so we know they ve got a nice cold water hole somewhere What were they doing on the desert asked Walter I thought they had just come across
5909_111961_000084_000000	train-clean-360	 No they were out for a play 
5909_111961_000084_000001	train-clean-360	That shows they had had plenty to eat and drink 
none	none	Professor I think I ll take the kiddie along with me announced Bud much to Tad s surprise and judging from the expression of the lad s face pleasure as well 
5909_111961_000085_000000	train-clean-360	Professor Zepplin glanced at the guide inquiringly 
none	none	Parry nodded his head He ll be all right
5909_111961_000087_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes you may go Tad 
5909_111961_000087_000001	train-clean-360	But be careful 
5909_111961_000087_000002	train-clean-360	Don t let him get into any difficulties mister Stevens 
none	none	He s a venturesome lad Guess he s able to wiggle out of anything he gets into grinned the horse hunter
5909_111961_000088_000001	train-clean-360	 Come along take a hunch on your cinch straps a chunk of grub in your pocket then we re ready to find where the Angel washes his face every morning and night 
5909_111961_000089_000000	train-clean-360	Tad lost no time in getting ready for the trip to trail the wild horses to their lair and in a few moments the horse hunters rode from the camp followed by the envious glances of the Pony Rider Boys 
none	none	Wish I were going along muttered Chunky ruefully as he turned his back on them and gazed off across the desert CHAPTER XV 
6436-111962-0000	train-other-500	BUD PROMISES SOME EXCITEMENT The horse hunter and his young companion
none	none	 laid their course at right angles to the reach of the range 
6436-111962-0001	train-other-500	The trail rose slowly to pass between low buttes leading on under the great spreading Joshua trees that capped the range itself Off to the east and south of them plainly exposed to view
6436-111962-0002	train-other-500	lay the yellow stretch of the Ralston Valley that went on and on until it eventually terminated in Death Valley The dry lake beds in the desert looked with the sun shining on them like great pearls set in the Desert Maze
none	none	 Tad thought they were water but Bud Stevens informed him that they were filled with water only after a heavy thunderstorm or in the early spring You ought to have come down here earlier in the season he told the lad 
6436-111962-0003	train-other-500	It s a pretty bad time to cross the desert now
none	none	 Yes we know that But we are not looking for easy trips laughed the lad 
6436-111962-0004	train-other-500	As they moved slowly along the cowboy horse hunter explained many of the secrets of the trail to his young companion
none	none	 as well as describing horse hunts in which he had taken part in the past But I don t understand why they have come all the way across the desert to get into this range said Tad Why did they not remain on the other side where I understand there is plenty of forage 
6436-111962-0005	train-other-500	It s a peculiar thing kiddie but hosses wild or tame are like human beings in some ways They like to get back home
none	none	 What do you mean 
6436-111962-0006	train-other-500	Wild horses always will go back to the range where they were born Sometimes they run away from the range ahead of a storm sometimes they are captured and taken away But if they ever get the chance back they go to the place where they were born Angel was born in this range
6436-111962-0007	train-other-500	and so were most of the mares and others that have come over with him When a halfbreed Cherokee came into camp and told us the band of horses was seen stretched out on the mesa on the other side I knew they were getting ready to hike across the desert so we prepared to come here
6436-111962-0008	train-other-500	Tad was listening intently All this was new to him and much of it not entirely understandable
none	none	 Did you ever notice how animals act before a big storm asked Bud No I can t say that I have 
6436-111962-0009	train-other-500	Next time you see a lot of horses stretched out on the ground on their sides heads close to the ground all looking as if they were asleep you ll know there s a big storm coming Why do they do that
none	none	 I don t know unless it is to rest themselves thoroughly 
6436-111962-0010	train-other-500	before running away from the storm that they know is coming
none	none	 How do they know a storm is coming unless they can see it marveled the boy Kiddie you ll have to ask the horses 
6436-111962-0011	train-other-500	Bud Stevens don t know nobody knows A fellow with whiskers and wearing spectacles one of of them scientific gents told me once that it was a kind of wireless telegraph that newfangled way of sending ghost messages Said they got it in the air
6436-111962-0012	train-other-500	Mebby they do I don t know They get it Sometimes you ll see the colts running up and down That s another sign of storm That s strange I never heard it before mused the lad
6436-111962-0013	train-other-500	And speaking of colts did you ever know that sometimes a band of horses will take a great fancy to a frisky young colt No Yes They ll follow the colt for days with their eyes big and full of admiration for the awkward critter And they ll fight for him too
6436-111962-0014	train-other-500	But tisn t often necessary cause very few horses will bother a colt Ever see a hoss fight
none	none	 Tad admitted that he had not Ought to see one It s the liveliest scrimmage that you ever set eyes on Beats that one back there on the desert when you plunked me on my head in a water hole Jimminy but you did dump me proper 
6436-111962-0015	train-other-500	grinned the cowboy Hope you don t lay it up against me laughed Tad
none	none	 No Got all over that 
6436-111962-0016	train-other-500	I got what was coming to me coming on the run
none	none	 Say got the trail on your side there They seem to have shuffled over to the northward a bit 
6436-111962-0017	train-other-500	Yes I m riding on their footprints now That s all right then Don t want to let it get away from us
none	none	 Where do you think they are heading mister Stevens 
6436-111962-0018	train-other-500	For the mesas up the range further There s plenty of grazing there and there must be water close by What we want to do to day is to locate them and find out just where they go for their water Then when the schooner gets down to your camp
6436-111962-0019	train-other-500	we ll haul our outfit up in the range and build a corral to drive them into Do you always make a capture Us No Sometimes the leaders of the band are too smart for us They beat us proper Why they re sharper than a Goldfield real estate man
6436-111962-0020	train-other-500	and those fellows would make you believe an alkali desert was a pine forest Look there interrupted Tad pointing What is it kiddie demanded the horse hunter pulling up sharply
none	none	 One of the horses I think it must be the leader seems to have left the trail here and started off at right angles 
6436-111962-0021	train-other-500	Stevens rode over to the other side of Tad and gazed down his forehead wrinkling in a frown Yes that s the Angel Don t know what he s side tracked himself here for
none	none	 He can t see far so it was not an observation that he was about to take 
6436-111962-0022	train-other-500	He s either seen or scented something Hold my pony while I take a look The cowboy dismounted striding rapidly away with gaze fixed on the trail ahead of him A few moments later he returned Find anything asked Tad
6436-111962-0023	train-other-500	The big one scented something or thought he did But where did he go Turned just beyond here and followed along the same way the others were going
none	none	 You ll find his trail joining ours after we get on a piece 
6436-111962-0024	train-other-500	I d like to know what he thought he smelled mused Bud I didn t know horses could scent a person or thing like that What horses
none	none	 Wild horses have got a scent that s keener than a coyote s 
6436-111962-0025	train-other-500	There s the white stallion s trail again exclaimed the lad Bud nodded
none	none	 Told you he d come back 
6436-111962-0026	train-other-500	For the next hour they rode along without anything of incident occurring Tad constantly adding to his store of knowledge regarding mountain and plain The lad was himself a natural plainsman and proved himself an apt pupil All at once
6436-111962-0027	train-other-500	Bud pulled up his pony sharply and studied the ground What is it questioned Tad
none	none	 We ve struck luck for sure Boy I ll show you something that ll make your eyes stick out so you can hang your hat on them 
6436-111962-0028	train-other-500	cried the cowboy exultingly You
none	none	 you mean we have come upon the wild horses asked the lad 
6436-111962-0029	train-other-500	Yes and more Come this way and I ll show you See this trail Tad nodded Well it was made by another band of horses The announcement did not strike Tad as especially significant They headed for the mesas too
6436-111962-0030	train-other-500	Looks that way grinned Bud And they re headed for trouble at the same time
none	none	 There s going to be music in the air pretty soon kiddie 
6436-111962-0031	train-other-500	and you and I want to be on hand to hear the first tune Tad gazed at him questioningly This second bunch of horses is led by a big black stallion known to the hunters as Satan He s up to his name too He s one of the most vicious cayuses on the open range
6436-111962-0032	train-other-500	Don t you see what this trail means The lad confessed that he did not It means that Satan is on the trail of the Angel
none	none	 When Satan and the Angel meet there ll be the worst scrap you ever heard of kiddie 
6436-111962-0033	train-other-500	Will they fight Will they fight scoffed Bud Stevens Guess you never saw two wild stallions mix it up No There s bad blood between Satan and the Angel and there has been for a long time The black stallion has been on the white one s trail for more than a year
none	none	 I don t know what it s all about but I know that if they come up with each other there is going to be trouble 
6436-111962-0034	train-other-500	If they don t look out we ll bag the whole bunch I wish our outfit was here I suppose we ought to hustle back and get ready for the drive
none	none	 but I m going to see Satan and the Angel meet if it s the last thing I ever do 
6436-111962-0035	train-other-500	Come on we ll have to ride fast
none	none	 Putting spurs to their ponies they set off at a fast pace over the uneven rugged trail CHAPTER XVI THE BATTLE OF THE STALLIONS The trail grew hotter as they advanced See Satan s running now The pursuers increased their speed although they could not hope to travel as rapidly as the black stallion and his followers 
6436-111963-0001	train-other-500	The wild horses trot had by this time become leaps as the followers could plainly see from the trail that had been left behind Satan and his band were traveling in single file
none	none	 their whole attention being centered on running down the Angel Do you think Satan scented the others asked Tad when they struck a level piece of ground so that they could relax their vigilance a little 
6436-111963-0002	train-other-500	No doubt of it at all But he didn t know it was just then He only knew it was a horse He knows now that the other bunch is ahead of him How do you know that queried Tad
none	none	 By the trail replied Stevens Don t you see the Angel is going faster They are both on a run now 
6436-111963-0003	train-other-500	Then the Angel must be afraid Is that it Not much He wants to find a better place in which to fight This place is bad medicine for a horse battle They re all heading for the mesas just as I thought first The cowboy was leaning well forward in his saddle
6436-111963-0004	train-other-500	eyes on the trail instead of looking ahead Tad on the contrary was straining his eyes hoping to catch sight of the two bands of fleeing horses but not a sign of them did he see Bud was the first to inform him that they were nearing the object of their chase
none	none	 Satan s going slower He is coming up with the others 
6436-111963-0005	train-other-500	Let up a little and don t talk in a loud tone We don t want to disturb them nor let either of the bands get an idea they are followed They might race off to some other part of the range We want to catch them all later if we can Their ponies were slowed down to a trot
6436-111963-0006	train-other-500	with Bud Stevens leading All at once he held up his hand for a halt Tad pulled up shortly
none	none	 What is it Do you see them he whispered 
6436-111963-0007	train-other-500	Bud shook his head Not yet We re close to them though Jump off and tether your nag We ve got to go on afoot They ll smell our ponies if we ride any further
6436-111963-0008	train-other-500	Moving rapidly the man and the boy led their mounts in among the trees where they made them fast with the stake ropes Then both started on a jog trot along the trail
none	none	 How far do we have to go do you think 
6436-111963-0009	train-other-500	Don t know Hope it s not far or we re liable to miss the show
none	none	 I can run as fast as you can if you want to go faster 
6436-111963-0010	train-other-500	Hark Hear that exclaimed Bud Yes what was it They re lining up for the battle That was a stallion s scream of defiance
none	none	 It is a challenge for battle 
6436-111963-0011	train-other-500	There goes the other one That s the Angel telling Satan to come on and fight Now Satan s answering him It was all just so much noise to Tad Butler The meaning of the harsh sounds conveyed nothing to him but to Bud Stevens they were full of meaning
6436-111963-0012	train-other-500	Careful now We re getting near Both men sped along as fast as their feet would carry them but without making a sound that might have been heard a dozen yards away Hist warned Bud crouching low Grasping his companion by the arm
6436-111963-0013	train-other-500	he crept to the right finally emerging from behind a rise of ground which had shielded their progress Look there he whispered Tad looked Below him lay a broad open mesa its upper end within a stone s throw of where he stood
6436-111963-0014	train-other-500	But that was not what attracted his attention A band of horses of many colors and sizes stood arrayed on each side of the little plain
none	none	 Advanced a few yards from the band on the right was a magnificent black stallion 
6436-111963-0015	train-other-500	pawing the earth and uttering shrill challenges On the other side of the field was the Angel He was not pawing the earth Instead he was standing proudly his curving neck beautifully arched his pink nostrils distended and held high
6436-111963-0016	train-other-500	What a wonderful animal said Tad under his breath And that black I can understand why he is called Satan What are they going to do Fight Don t you understand They re getting ready to settle their old score
6436-111963-0017	train-other-500	and a merry mix up it ll be replied the cowboy in a whisper Yes yes breathed Tad scarcely able to curb his excitement There they go
none	none	 With a wild scream Satan and the Angel bounded into the center of the field 
6436-111963-0018	train-other-500	As they neared it each swerved to his right and dashed by avoiding his opponent Act as if they were afraid of each other said Tad They re not They re trying each other out sparring for an opening as it were
none	none	 You ll see in a minute The fighters returned to the charge They did not flinch this time With a rush they came together rearing in the air jaws wide apart Their fore feet struck out Both stallions broke wheeled and kicked viciously Neither had landed a blow Next time they came at each other walking on their hind feet They were sparring with their fore feet like fighters in the ring their hoofs making such rapid thrusts that the eye could scarcely follow them Satan reached for the head of his antagonist with a quick sweep The white stallion blocked the blow cleverly Illustration They Were Sparring with Their Fore Feet like Fighters in the Ring Yet in doing so he had left an opening Satan took instant advantage of it The black stallion s head shot forward It reminded Tad of a serpent striking at its victim Ah He landed exclaimed the cowboy A fleck of crimson on the creamy neck of the Angel showed where the vicious teeth of the black stallion had reached him Yet no sooner had the wound been inflicted than the Angel whirled It was like a flash of light A white hoof shot out catching the black on the side of the head sending him staggering to his haunches The white animal was upon him with a scream of triumph Just as it seemed that the Angel was about to run him down the black sprang to his feet leaping to one side and as the Angel passed the hind hoofs of Satan were driven into his side The Angel uttered a cry of pain 
6436-111963-0019	train-other-500	it was returned by one of triumph from his antagonist
none	none	 Oh what a pity to see two such magnificent animals seeking to kill each other Do you think one of them will be killed mister Stevens 
6436-111963-0020	train-other-500	They may You can t tell Hope there won t be a knock out cause we want both of those fellows and we ll get them too I tell you we re in luck this trip
none	none	 We ll make a haul that will be worth a few thousand dollars you bet There they go again 
6436-111963-0021	train-other-500	Changing their method of attack the fighters began rushing whirling kicking and so timing their blows that their hind feet met with a crash that might have been heard a long distance away The shiny coat of the black did not show that he had been wounded
none	none	 but the watchers knew he had for they had seen the teeth of the white animal buried in his side at least once 
6436-111963-0022	train-other-500	A vicious charge of Satan s threw the Angel from his feet He struck the hard ground with a mighty snort but was on his feet in an instant returning to the charge mouth open feet pawing the air
6436-111963-0023	train-other-500	The two men could see the eyes of the desperate antagonists fairly blaze while their shrill cries thrilled Tad through and through Never in his life had he gazed upon such a scene two giants of the equine world engaged in mortal combat
6436-111963-0024	train-other-500	It was a scene calculated to make the blood course more rapidly through the veins of the boy who himself possessed so much courage
none	none	 And it did in this case though as a lover of horses his heart was filled with pity for the one who was to lose the battle As yet 
6436-111963-0025	train-other-500	there was no indication as to which this would be They seemed equally matched and thus far honors had been about even Think the black can whip him he asked Don t know kiddie I ll make a bet with you take your choice Thank you I don t bet answered the lad
6436-111963-0026	train-other-500	If I did I couldn t bring myself to lay a wager on those two beautiful creatures that are trying to kill each other Ah There goes the black flat on his back Before Satan could rise the hoofs of the white one had been driven against him with unerring aim
6436-111963-0027	train-other-500	Yet the blow while it must have hurt served to assist Satan to roll over
none	none	 As a matter of fact he was kicked over and thus helped to spring to his feet 
6436-111963-0028	train-other-500	Each animal fastened his teeth in the flanks of the other at the same instant and when they tore themselves apart each was limping On each side of the field
none	none	 the other members of the two bands of horses stood stolidly observing the conflict Neither side made an effort to participate in the battle Here and there a colt would break away and gambol out into the field 
6436-111963-0029	train-other-500	only to be recalled by a sharp whinny from its mother It s queer they do not take a hand marveled Tad No they never do
none	none	 They look to their leader to fight their battles for them When the battle is ended you will notice something else that will interest you 
6436-111963-0030	train-other-500	What You ll see when the time comes Now watch them go at it And they did It appeared as if each of the combatants was determined to put a quick end to the conflict
none	none	 There was no lost time now It was give and take 
6436-111963-0031	train-other-500	Blow after blow resounded from their hoofs Now one of the contestants would stagger and fall only to be up and at his adversary while their lithe supple bodies flashed in the bright sunlight till the watchers eyes were dizzy from following their rapid evolutions
6436-111963-0032	train-other-500	I wish the boys might see this breathed Tad fascinated by the sight in spite of himself So do I grinned Bud Did you ever see a battle of this kind asked the lad Not like this
none	none	 I ve seen stallions fight yes but never such a scrap as this Looks as if they d be fighting all day But they won t 
6436-111963-0033	train-other-500	Why not They seem as strong as when they began They are but they re getting careless They re taking longer chances every round First thing you know one of them will get kicked into the middle of next week Whoop That was a dandy
6436-111963-0034	train-other-500	The Angel had planted both hind hoofs fairly on the side of Satan s head Satan had gone down But when the white stallion made a leap with the intention of springing upon his prostrate victim the black rolled to one side
6436-111963-0035	train-other-500	and in a twinkling had fastened his teeth upon his adversary s leg Only for a brief second did he cling there then throwing himself out of the way sprang to his feet The two animals met with a terrific crash head on
6436-111963-0036	train-other-500	Biting kicking screaming out their wild challenges of defiance the battle waxed hotter faster and more furious The mares in the herds showed signs of uneasiness
6436-111963-0037	train-other-500	They might have been observed tossing their heads and shifting almost nervously on their feet but making no effort to move away or out into the field
none	none	 Are the mares getting excited asked Tad in wonder No They see one of the stallions is going to get his knock out in a minute 
6436-111963-0038	train-other-500	Which one I don t know But how can they tell that if we are unable to see either one of them weakening More ghost telegraphy I guess answered Bud not for an instant removing his gaze from the fascinating scene before him
6436-111963-0039	train-other-500	He too was becoming excited He could scarcely restrain himself All at once despite his caution Bud Stevens uttered a whoop The black s got him No the Angel s got him shouted Tad Butler excitedly
6436-111963-0040	train-other-500	No he hasn t It s the black I tell you See There he s kicked the Angel halfway across the mesa Now it was the Angel s turn to do some kicking He did and with terrific effect Both hind hoofs were planted in the black s abdomen Not once but again and again
6436-111963-0041	train-other-500	Yet the black was not thus easily defeated With the sledge hammer blows raining all over him he struggled to his feet and with a desperate lunge fastened himself upon the neck of his adversary
none	none	 Back and forth struggled the black and the white now like a pair of wrestlers Now who do you think s got him hey laughed Bud Why the black ll eat his head off I said Angel was going to win and I think he is retorted Tad 
6436-111963-0042	train-other-500	The white with a mighty toss of his powerful neck threw Satan off the fore feet of the Angel smiting and knocking Satan down Then followed a series of Gatling gun like reports as the Angel s hind hoofs beat a tattoo on the head of his prostrate victim
6436-111963-0043	train-other-500	The black was conquered
none	none	 Satan had been knocked out by the Angel in the greatest equine battle that human eyes ever had gazed on Aren t you glad I don t bet laughed Tad his eyes flashing with the excitement of it all I d been willing to lose on that fight grunted the cowboy Is he killed do you think asked the lad No he s just dizzy after the wallops he got on the head You ll see him get up in a minute The Angel had backed off a few paces and there he stood head erect waiting as motionless as a statue until the moment when his fallen adversary should rise if at all Slowly the black pulled himself to his feet His head came up He eyed the now calm white stallion half hesitatingly The watchers fairly held their breath for it was a dramatic moment They re going to fight again muttered Tad He s licked He s got enough exclaimed Bud The black turned his back upon the white stallion and with lowered head dejection and humiliation apparent in every line every movement of his body walked slowly back to his own band The Angel followed at a distance almost to the lines of the enemy Then he paused galloped back to the center of the field and throwing up his head uttered a long shrill scream of triumph One by one the mares of Satan s band detached themselves from his ranks and with their colts trotted across the field to join the Angel s band CHAPTER XVII ON A WILD HORSE HUNT A corral constructed partially of brush on its wing ends and of canvas for the corral proper had been erected in one of the wide sage covered draws of the San Antonio range Across the opening of the corral which resembled a pair of great tongs the distance was fully half a mile Bud Stevens had decided to place the trap for the wild horses here in this open space in preference to laying it in the mountains There was more room for operations in the open he said Then again the wild horses as he knew from personal observation were strong and full of fight I guess we ll have to tire them all out before we can hope to get them in the corral he told his men after they had finished their work of preparation The wagon with the horse hunters outfit had driven in late on the night following the battle of the stallions and early next morning the horse hunters accompanied by the Pony Rider Boys and their own party started out to make camp in the mountains where they were to remain while the hunt lasted The battle which Tad and Bud had seen furnished a fruitful topic for discussion and the two were kept busy relating the story of the fight until long after midnight But while watching the battle Bud Stevens had not lost sight of the object of his trip into the mountains He had calculated exactly where the stock had found a mountain spring and it was from that point that the hunters were to start the animals on their trip to the corral The plan of operation was laid out with as much care and attention to details as a general would employ in planning a battle The Pony Rider Boys were to participate in the chase They could scarcely wait for the moment to arrive when they would be given an opportunity to show their horsemanship In the camp in the mountains they were told with great detail just what they were expected to do I think you had better leave Chunky at home warned Ned He ll stampede the whole bunch just as you are ready to drive them into the corral Chunky protested loudly Guess I can stick on a pony as well as you can he retorted I ll vouch for that smiled Tom Parry He ll do decided Bud Now you fellows are all to string out in single file following me until we have circled the herd We should have them pretty well surrounded by noon At that time they ll be at the spring filling up When I m ready to close in I ll fire a shot Each of you will fire in turn so that every one in line may be notified If the critters refuse to drive then we ll have to whip them into a circle and tire them out But first we must get them out on the open no matter which way they go then work them into the draw as fast as we can The horse hunters nodded They understood perfectly what they were expected to do And the boys were to be scattered among the men at intervals instead of traveling together It seemed very simple to them but they were to learn that wild horse hunting was a man s task Are we allowed to rope if we get the chance questioned Tad Not during the run Of course if you see an animal escaping after we have rounded them up and you can do so without losing any of the others rope if you want to I reckon you ll have your hands full if you try it concluded the horse hunter Are you going out Professor smiled the guide No thank you I think I shall remain close to camp and collect geological specimens The boys will get into just as much trouble if I go with them as they would were I to remain at home I suppose there is more or less peril in these wild hunts Yes it s going some laughed Bud But I guess none of them will get very badly knocked out if they obey orders and don t get in the way of a stampede Those wild critters won t stop for nothing A scout came in late with the news that the herd was less than five miles from where the hunters camp was located That makes it all the easier We ll start at daylight said Stevens The plans will work out just right Now you d better all turn in and be ready for the hurry call in the morning Next morning all ate breakfast before the first hot wave trembled over the crest of the mountains across the broad desert There was bustle and excitement in the camp When ponies had been saddled ropes coiled and final preparations made Bud Stevens looked his outfit over carefully nodded his head and mounted You boys don t want to do any shouting after we get out on the trail you understand he said We have to work quietly until we get them surrounded then you may make all the racket you want The more the better The Pony Riders nodded their understanding of the orders and the company of horsemen set out across the mountains They made a wide detour so as not to alarm any of the stragglers who might not have followed the main body of horses to the watering place for their noon drink A careful examination of the trail showed that the Angel and his band as well as Satan and his few faithful followers were well within the circle We ve got the whole bunch inside exulted Bud turning to Tad Now boy do your prettiest We want to bag em all If we do I ll make you a present of any horse in the outfit How about the Angel questioned Tad with a twinkle in his eyes Bud hesitated What Bud Stevens says goes replied the cowboy The one who catches the stallion on these hunts however usually has the right to keep him if he wants to If you want the Angel you ve got to rope and take him after we get them rounded up No I wouldn t do anything like that laughed Tad If I catch the Angel I ll make you a present of him At twelve o clock by the watch they had completed the circle or rather three quarters of a circle about the band of wild horses leaving an opening toward the broad draw where the hidden corral had been located to trap the unsuspecting wild animals Stevens drew his gun and holding it above his head fired two shots The signal was answered almost instantly by two shots some distance to their rear Like the rattle of a skirmish line guns popped in quick succession the sounds growing further and further away as they ran down the long slender line of horsemen to the eastward Close in commanded the leader quietly Ride straight ahead never mind me I shall move further on before I turn Good luck Don t try to get in the way of a stampede You can t stop them if they try it altogether I ll look out smiled Tad Then they separated Tad could not hear a sound save the light footfalls of his own pony The mountain ranges might have been deserted for all the disturbance there was about him He had ridden on some distance when a loud snort suddenly called his attention to the right and ahead of him There stood the Angel facing him angrily Tad was so surprised at the suddenness of the meeting that he pulled his pony up shortly For a moment they stood facing each other then the wild animal with a loud scream of alarm turned and went crashing through the brush From the sound a few seconds later the lad knew that the stallion had gathered his band and that they were sweeping away from him at a lively pace Here s where I must get busy laughed the lad the spirit of the chase suddenly taking strong hold upon him He touched his pony lightly with the spurs drawing in on the reins The little animal leaped away Tad uttering a shrill yell to warn any of the other hunters who might be within reach of his voice that he had started on the trail of the wild band He heard a similar cry far off to his right and knew that Bud Stevens had heard and understood I believe they re coming back said the lad realizing that the sound of galloping was plainer than it had been a few moments before I wonder what I ought to do I m going to try to head them off if they come this way he decided All at once he saw the wild horses first from behind a huge rocky pile Uttering a series of wild yells and whoops swinging his quirt and sombrero above his head the lad rode straight at the herd his pony seeming to enter into the full spirit of the fun To Tad s surprise the leader of the herd deflected to the northward running along a line almost parallel to that which the boy was following Tad pressed in the rowels of his spurs a little harder uttering a chorus of shrill yells They mustn t get through he fairly groaned They shan t get through No not if I ride my head off Suddenly a volley of shots sounded some distance ahead of him followed by a series of yells as if the mountains were alive with savage redskins It was Bud Stevens The wild herd had come upon him just as they were about to turn northward and dive into the fastnesses of the mountains Observing him they turned slightly to the west and continued on their mad course Good boy Bud shrieked Draw up on em Draw up on em Tad did It was a race but a most perilous one To the boy it seemed as if the feet of his pony were off the ground most of the time his run having merged into a series of long curving leaps as it reached from rock to rock Down a steep slope suddenly plunged the herd Tad saw the flying pony of Bud Stevens directly abreast of them The lad apparently feeling no fear brought his quirt down sharply on the flanks of his mount The pony hesitated rose and took a flying leap fully ten feet down the mountain side before its feet braced sharply and thus saved pony and rider from plunging on over Now Tad was yelling at the top of his voice as that seemed the proper thing to do under the circumstances The wild band was heading for the open just as Bud Stevens had planned But the fleeing horses were seeking to get out on the open plain where they might soon outdistance their pursuers Tad and his pony went down that rugged mountain side as if the pony were a mountain goat The boy never had experienced such a thrilling ride and the jolts he got made his head dizzy M m my this is going some he gasped Tad was shouting for pure joy now When his mount landed on all fours among the foothills he was not more than two minutes behind Bud Stevens himself Great Great floated back the voice of the horse hunter who turning in his saddle had observed Tad s leaping flying descent of the mountain Tad admitted to himself that this was riding and he compared it with the day he first rode his own pony up the main street in Chillicothe Missouri That ride at the time seemed a very exciting one Since then he had acquired more skill else he never would have been able to shoot down the rugged mountain at almost express train speed They were now out on the desert prairie Bud was trying to point the leaders in to send them to the southward Now that Tad was on level ground he was able to put on more speed Very slowly indeed his pony straightening out to its full length he drew up on the racing herd Guess I d better not yell any more till I get abreast of them he decided which was good judgment as Bud Stevens said to him afterwards Lay back a little shouted Bud when the boy got too close They re liable to dodge behind me at any second and break through our line Tad slackened his speed at which the wild band drew away from him almost as if he were standing still Then he put spurs to his mount again and drew up abreast of the trailers At the head of the line the horse hunter was fighting with the leaders trying to turn them toward the place where the great corral was hidden Suddenly that which Bud Stevens had feared occurred The white stallion s forefeet plowed the earth Cowboy and pony shot by him and the wily stallion slipped behind them Followed by his band the Angel headed off across the desert in the very direction that the hunters did not want him to go Nail him bellowed Bud Tad needed no further command Already his keen eyes had noted the move Putting spurs to his pony he raced to the white stallion s side leaving Bud far to their rear The Angel sought in every way in its power to shake off the boy who so persistently hung at its side All at once the stallion reached over fastening its teeth in the neck of Tad Butler s pony Tad however had been quick enough to foresee the move and had jerked his little mount to one side Yet he had not done so quickly enough to save the broncho from a slight flesh wound Slackening its speed the Angel then made a vicious lunge at the lad s left leg biting right through the heavy chaps with which his legs were protected The boy swung his quirt bringing it down again and again on the stallion s pink and white nose until the beast unable to stand the punishment longer uttered a snort changing its course more to the southward I ve turned him I ve turned him shouted Tad He had accomplished what the leader of the horse hunters had been unable to do Bud Stevens far to the rear on the desert tossed his sombrero in the air uttering a long far reaching yell of approval CHAPTER XVIII ROPED BY ROUGH RIDERS Tad replied with an exulting yell The band of wild horses was headed toward the corral Yet they refused to enter just when they were upon the point of heading in between the hidden wings Some instinct it seemed warned them to beware The line straightened out and a few minutes later the animals began racing in a circle four miles wide I m afraid my pony never ll be able to stand this grilling But we ll keep going as long as we ve got a leg left to stand on laughed the plucky lad Drop out and let me take a round with them We ve got to tire them out shouted Bud putting spurs to his pony and dashing up beside Tad The lad regretfully pulled his mount down to a walk then rode out on the desert some distance so as to be out of the way when the circle once more came his way Guess it s just as well he muttered The pony couldn t have stood up much longer My those wild animals can travel A heavy coating of gray dust covered both boy and horse except where here and there the gray was furrowed with streaks of perspiration Tad gave his mount the reins and sat idly watching the cloud of dust rolling over the desert showing where Bud Stevens was driving the wild horse band in an effort to tire them so that they might be easily headed into the great corral They soon swept by Tad and on out over white alkali desert once more On the next round Bud motioned to Tad to take up his end of the relay Give it to em Drive em till they can t stand up bellowed Bud But the lad scarcely heard the horse hunter s voice Already he had been swallowed up in the great yellow cloud and was riding hard by the white stallion Discovering that he had another rider beside him the Angel made a desperate effort to run the lad and his pony down that he might break the line and head off to the northwest Tad beat him over the nose with his quirt again and the stallion promptly changed its mind for the pink nose was still tender from the drubbing Tad had given it a short time before The men are lining up for a drive warned Stevens when the herd thundered by him again I ll keep behind you We re going to try to drive them in this time They re weakening fast You want me to hold the leader asked the boy Yes Keep him up Don t give him a second s leeway The rest will follow him don t worry about them Where are the other fellows Over to the east They re hiding until the herd gets close enough then they ll appear raising a big noise That s the time you and I will have our hands full Strikes me our hands have been pretty full answered the lad his face wrinkling into a forced grin Bud Stevens slackened the speed of his pony dropping back and disappearing in the dust cloud After all I guess the other fellows will have the hardest work mused the lad They ve got to stop the rush while all I have to do is to keep on going following that big white stallion I wish I could rope him but I guess he would have the broncho and myself on our backs in no time Tad turned his attention to the work in hand He did not know just where the other horse hunters were secreted but his eyes were fixed on a low lying butte some distance to the eastward He saw no other place from which they could carry out the manoeuvre successfully Tad grew a bit anxious as the wild horses curved more and more to the eastward In a few moments they would be too far to the left to permit of heading them toward the hidden corral I guess they must be going to let us drive them around the circle once more he decided No There they come With a yell followed by a rattling fire of revolver shots a dozen ponies shot from behind the low lying butte The horse hunters hurled their bronchos right against the wall of fleeing animals Volley after volley was fired into the ground right under the very feet of the wild horses Here and there a rider was unseated in a sudden collision in the dust cloud with a charging wild horse They ve turned them bellowed Bud Stevens The Pony Rider Boy now began to realize the truth of this for the Angel came bounding toward him crowding right up against the side of Tad s pony Tad was using foot and quirt yelling like a wild Indian to frighten the big white stallion into keeping to the left So successful were his efforts that the animal did give way a little I ve headed him shouted the lad in wild glee Never had he had such an exciting day as this one was proving itself to be He gave no thought to the danger of the chase And now that he heard and recognized the shouts of his companions he was spurred to even greater efforts than before Why this post of honor had been given to him he did not know But Bud Stevens was not far behind Bud was ready to stop the stampede that he momentarily expected but which did not come Give way a little came the command Tad recognized that he had in his enthusiasm been crowding the white stallion a bit too much He drew off a little not however decreasing his speed Already the band of wild horses had entered the wide spreading wings of the corral but because of the dust that enveloped him Tad was unaware of this He continued at his same terrific pace with the tough little broncho rising and falling under him as he fairly flew over the uneven ground The horse hunters had fallen into a triangle formation with the apex to the rear They were driving the wild horses before them using their guns in what appeared to be a most reckless fashion shouting as if the whole band had gone suddenly mad On down between the brush barriers that were now apparently rising out of the ground sped the frightened band of wild horses The white stallion began to understand that they were trapped Angel whirled suddenly and made a desperate effort to take the back trail Tad and his pony dashing down the slight incline like a projectile hit the stallion broadside The collision was so sudden that the lad had a narrow escape from being hurled over the head of his own pony It was only the convulsive grip of legs to the broncho s side that saved him from a bad spill With quick instinct he brought his quirt down on the broad back of the Angel Smarting under the stinging blow and the surprise of the collision the white stallion whirled about again heading right into the yawning corral The lad was now in the very midst of the crowding fighting animals He was battling every whit as desperately as were they Bud Stevens had fallen back He knew Tad was somewhere ahead in the mix up but he was powerless to get to him at that moment nor could his voice reach the lad It was then that the boy realized where he was I m in the corral he cried discovering that he was hemmed in by the canvas walls of the main enclosure itself And I guess I m in a mix up that will be hard to get out of The wild horses were charging about screaming with anger and fear rearing biting kicking bowling each other over in their desperate efforts to escape On every side they found themselves met by the canvas walls which none thus far had had the courage to assail There s the black stallion there s Satan cried Tad in surprise I didn t know he was here The black s eyes were gleaming with anger His lost courage was slowly returning to him Satan was now ready to give battle to man or beast All at once he dashed straight at the canvas wall rose to it and cleared it in a long curving leap his rear feet ripping the cloth down a short distance as the hoofs caught it The keen eyes of the white stallion were upon him In another instant his glistening body had flashed over the enclosing walls Oh that s too bad groaned Tad At that moment half a dozen horsemen appeared in the enclosure as if by magic they threw themselves across the opening made by the two stallions and thus made an impassable barrier Tad had seem them coming and divined their purpose A daring plan suddenly flashed into his mind With a shrill yell he dug in the rowels of his spurs The broncho understanding what was wanted of him rose to the canvas well clearing it without so much as touching it with his hoofs But while this was going on another scene was being enacted just outside the barrier A few horse hunters had been sent around there to head off just such an attempt at escape as had been made With them was Stacy Brown He was sitting on his pony rope in hand when Satan cleared the wall He saw the dark body of the stallion plunge over Instinctively the fat boy rose in his stirrups His lariat whirled twice over his head then shot out It sped true to the mark catching Satan by the left hind foot just as he was finishing his leap Yeow yelled Chunky The black stallion ploughed the ground with his nose as the boy took a quick hitch of the rope about his saddle pommel That was where Chunky came to grief once more His pony s feet were jerked out from under it by the mighty lurch of Satan when he went down Stacy Brown and his broncho were thrown flat on the ground in a twinkling The lad s right leg was pinned under the pony but the boy with great presence of mind held the rope fast to the pommel Ropes flew from all directions now that the stallion was down In a moment more they had Satan entangled in a maze of them The horse hunters were shouting and yelling in triumph at the fat boy s splendid capture So busily engaged were they in subduing the black that for the moment they lost sight of the fact that the Angel followed by Tad Butler on his broncho had cleared the barrier too Nor did Tad give heed to them With rope unslung he was stretching through the foothills at a breakneck pace on the trail of the Angel There goes the Angel with the kid after him bellowed a cowboy Three men leaped into their saddles and were off like a shot Tad Butler slowly but surely drew up on the racing stallion The pursuers saw him unsling his rope holding the coil easily at his side He s going to cast cried the cowboys in amazement that the slender lad would undertake alone to capture the powerful animal He ll be dragged to death warned one Don t try it kiddie shouted another at the top of his voice A chorus of warning yells were hurled after the intrepid Tad to all of which he gave no heed His eyes were fixed on the flashing body of the white stallion ahead of him every nerve tense for the shock that would come a moment later All at once the pursuers saw Tad s right arm describe the familiar circle in the air Then his lariat squirmed out The Angel running ahead of the boy could not see the rope in time to dodge it The loop of the lariat dropped neatly over his head and suddenly drew taut The proud stallion which for years had defied the skill of the wild horse hunters went down to an inglorious defeat But he was up like a flash Then began a battle between the slender Pony Rider Boy and wild stallion that is talked of among the wild horse hunters of the desert to this day Three times had Tad thrown the Angel before the others caught up with him the lad s arms being well nigh pulled from his body in the terrific lunges of the fighting Angel The ropes of the cowboys reached out for the maddened animal the instant they were within reach Such a shout went up as had probably never been heard on the range before when finally they had the white fighter securely roped down The Pony Rider Boys had distinguished themselves this day Tricing up one of the stallion s forward legs so that he hobbled along like a lame dog the hunters started back to the corral shouting singing and firing their revolvers with Tad Butler proudly sitting his broncho at the head of the procession Not an animal had escaped from the other hunters It had been a magnificent round up CHAPTER XIX WINNING THEIR REWARD The horse hunters had bound the black and left him while they entered the corral to assist in roping the rest of the herd that were dashing wildly about Every time a rope swung above a broad brimmed sombrero and shot out a wild horse came down I fell in but I got him greeted Chunky Brown triumphantly as Tad Butler rode up to him Tad laughed heartily when he saw his companion Stacy Brown proudly sitting on the head of the angry snorting black stallion You did indeed Chunky How did you ever do it Just like any other experienced man would replied the fat boy in an important tone We got them both didn t we Tad Yes And we ll keep em eh Oh no Chunky We couldn t do that These horses belong to the hunters They spend a great deal of money in preparing to capture them It would not be right for us to expect to keep these two We ve been well paid for our labor in the fun we have had Don t you think so Well yes decided Stacy a little ruefully Let s see if we can help them concluded Tad riding up to the edge of the corral Orders he called as soon as he could attract Bud Stevens attention Yes you might ride around to the entrance and come in You can help us rope and hobble the stock if you want to Tad did as directed There was no sport of the range that he took a keener enjoyment in than he did in roping and by this time there were few men who could handle a rope more skillfully than he Ned and Walter were assisting in guarding the narrow entrance to the canvas corral when Tad finally rode through entering the enclosure where the excited animals were charging back and forth and round and round Bud was sitting on his pony in the center of the milling animals directing the operations First the hunters would rope and throw an animal then they would bind up one of the front legs at the elbow after which the horse was released When the animals had staggered about the enclosure a few times trying to throw off the leg binders they were quite willing to stand still and nurse their anger Sail in boy called Bud Tad picked out a little bay that was kicking and squealing dodging every lariat that was thrown at it His first shot missed The lad coiled his rope deliberately I ll see that you don t dodge me this time mister Bay Tad muttered and began slowly following the animal about the ring The instant the bay s head was turned away from him Tad let go the rope and the next second the stubborn animal lay on its side another cowboy having made a successful cast over its kicking hind legs the moment it struck the ground Tad released his rope then started for another cast So he went on from one to another and with as much coolness as if he had been roping wild horses all his life After half an hour s work young Butler saw Bud motioning to him Tad rode up The boy was bare headed having lost his sombrero somewhere in the enclosure and not having thought to look for it even if he had realized its loss Take a rest directed the horseman I m not tired Yes you are but you don t know it First thing you know you ll tumble off your pony with a bad case of heat knock out Your face is as red as a lobster Too bad the stallions got away added Bud who had been so thoroughly occupied in the corral that he had given no heed to what had been taking place outside Lost the stallions questioned Tad elevating his eyebrows Yes Satan and the Angel Why mister Stevens we didn t lose them I know we got them in the corral all right but that isn t getting them They always manage to give us the slip somehow Tad s eyes danced Then you ve got a surprise coming to you mister Stevens Both stallions are lying outside the corral at this minute tied up so tightly that they won t get away again What You re joking No I m not I mean it laughed the lad in high glee Bud bent a steady look upon the boy He saw that Tad was speaking the truth How did it happen kiddie Chunky roped the black by one of its hind feet just as the animal was taking the jump Chunky got a bad fall but he held fast to the black till the others could get their ropes on it Hurray shouted Bud carried away by his enthusiasm But what about the Angel eh Get him too did you say Yes How I jumped the fence after him and ran a race with him out into the foothills where I managed to get my lariat over his head and pulled him down We had quite a scrimmage but I should have lost him if I hadn t had help The boys came to my rescue just in time Huh grunted the cowboy observing his companion with twinkling eyes You ve got anything roped and hobbled that I ever saw That was Bud s only comment at the moment but it carried with it a world of praise causing Tad to blush All the rest of the afternoon was devoted to securing the animals that they had captured Not a horse had escaped Shortly after sunset the task was completed and the horse hunters gave utterance to their feelings in a series of triumphant yells In the meantime three of the men had been sent back to bring over the camp outfit which owing to the fact that it had to follow a round about trail did not get in until some time after dark Ned and Walter had accompanied the men back to camp to assist in packing their own outfit Tad and Stacy remaining to keep watch over the prizes that they had captured Dinner that night though a late one was an occasion of boisterous good fellowship the two happy Pony Rider Boys coming in for much good natured raillery Don t want to join us do you kiddie asked Bud quizzically I d like to of course But it is not possible answered Tad We ll be off in the morning with our stock you know Better come along You ll dry up and blow away down on the desert It s had medicine where you re headed for We re used to taking our medicine laughed Tom Parry You probably have noticed as much in the short time you ve known our bunch You bet I have laughed Bud And you take it in big doses too Allopathic doses interjected the Professor Don t know what they might be answered Bud Sounds as though it might be something hard to swallow though This bit of pleasantry caused a general laugh The fun continued until late in the evening Next morning the camp was astir at an early hour The captured horses were found to be considerably subdued after being roped all night Bud s first work in the morning after breakfast was to take the two stallions in hand They were freed of their bonds and after a battle during which nearly every member of the party had been more or less mauled by the spirited beasts the horse hunters succeeded in saddling and bridling Satan and the Angel Bud Stevens rode them about in turn to the delight of the Pony Rider Boys who had never seen such bucking Let me ride now begged Stacy after Stevens had to some extent subdued Satan The horseman permitted the lad to take to the saddle but no sooner had Chunky done so than Satan hurled him clear over the corral Chunky nothing daunted came back smiling and tried it again this time with entire success Satan did not again succeed in unseating him Tad mastered the Angel without being thrown and amid the cheers of the cowboys who shouted their approval of his horsemanship All was now in readiness for the start of the cowboy band and their great herd of horses Stevens had directed his men to take the two stallions outside the corral and stake them down securely Then the men began driving the rest of the captured stock from the canvas prison At first the animals evinced an inclination to run away But with one leg in a sling this was not an easy task and the horsemen rounded up the bunch with little difficulty Here here cried Tad You re forgetting the stallions mister Stevens You ve left them staked down out back of the corral Have I grinned Bud What did you want me to do with them Take them with you of course answered Tad as yet failing to understand the horse hunter s plan Don t you want them kiddie Want them want them stammered Tad Yes They re yours yours and the fat boy s Oh no no mister Stevens I couldn t think of such a thing Master Tad is right approved the Professor We have not the least claim in the world on those animals We Say Professor who s running this side show demanded Bud Why why of course it s your hunt but All right then seeing as it s my outfit I ve decided that I don t want the stallions Look here We d have lost part of that bunch at least if it hadn t been for your kids Master Tad alone saved the herd from scattering all over the Ralston Desert No sir I m getting off cheaply The stallions belong to the boys and that s all there is to be said S long everybody Come up to Eureka on your way out and if I don t cut the town wide open for you my name ain t Bud Stevens With a wave of his sombrero Bud put spurs to his mount and galloped away to join his companions who had started the herd on its way to Eureka where the animals were to be shipped East Tad and Stacy were too full of surprise to express their feelings CHAPTER XX VISITED BY A HALO The Pony Rider Boys turned again to the Desert Maze A week had elapsed since Bud Stevens and his party had left them One evening after a hard day in the saddle the guide was sitting thoughtfully in his tent when Professor Zepplin entered Sit down asked the guide For a moment only answered the Professor Weather s fine to night Yes even though we have no water to speak of Do you consider our situation at all serious mister Parry Same old story Professor Sage brush and alkali Tanks full one day dry the next There s no accounting for the desert Every time I get out of the Desert Maze as somebody has called it I chalk down a mark on the wall I am beginning to understand that it does hold perils of its own answered Professor Zepplin thoughtfully Traveling over the desert is no picnic that s a fact Got to take it as it comes though If we go dry one day most likely we fill up the next or the day after that Don t pay to get down in the mouth and fret Yes I understand all that But I don t wish to take any great chances on account of the boys The boys Tom Parry laughed Don t you worry about them Those boys would thrive where a coyote would die at sight of his own eternal starvation shadow The Professor shook his head doubtfully Turn em loose on the desert and they d swim ashore somehow Especially young Butler He s quiet he doesn t say much but when he gets busy there s something doing For sheer pluck he s got it over anything I ever saw like a circus tent Well don t lose any sleep worrying about water We ll catch a drop or two of dew out of a cactus plant some of these nights See you in the morning Good night concluded the guide rising and knocking the ashes from his pipe on his boot heel They had been working slowly toward the Death Valley region and water was becoming more and more scarce as they proceeded Indeed the problem of where to find sufficient water for their needs had become a serious one For the last three days all the water holes that the guide had depended upon to replenish their supply had failed them What lay before them none knew When the camp awakened late the next morning the guide was nowhere to be seen His pony likewise had disappeared But they did not trouble themselves over Parry s absence knowing that he had not left them without good reason and with many a sharp joke at each other s expense proceeded to get the breakfast ready They had just sat down to the table when Tom Parry came riding in covered with dust Morning boys Fine day he greeted with his usual inscrutable smile which might indicate either good or bad tidings Prospecting questioned Tad Taking my morning constitutional Going to be hot enough to singe the pin feathers off a bald headed sage hen to day he informed them slipping from his saddle After beating a cloud of alkali dust from his clothes he joined the party at the breakfast table Find any asked Tad eyeing him inquiringly for Tad had an idea as to the object of the guide s early morning ride Nary was the comprehensive reply Have to take a dry shampoo to day I reckon I suppose there is no water in sight yet asked the Professor he not having caught the meaning of the brief dialogue between Tad and Tom Parry No sir Not yet We ll be moving as soon as possible after breakfast Better use sparingly what little water you have left in your canteens You may need it before we strike another water hole he advised As usual however the spirits of the Pony Rider Boys were in no way affected by the shortage of water Time enough to worry when their canteens were dry These days Tad and Stacy were occupying all their spare time in working with the two stallions they had captured The Angel under Tad s kind but determined training was advancing rapidly and already had been taught to do a few simple tricks Stacy on his part was not doing quite so well with Satan The latter like his namesake was inclined to be vicious biting and kicking whenever the evil spirit moved Ahead on all sides of them as the sun rose that morning lay wide stretches of gray dusty soil blotches of alkali alternating with huge patches of scattering sage brush with no living thing in sight Overhead burned the blue of a cloudless sky about them the suffocating atmosphere of the alkali desert It was not a cheerful vista that spread out before the lads The ponies suffering for want of water took up the day s journey with evident reluctance With heads hanging low they dragged themselves along wearily half in protest now and then evincing a sudden desire to turn about and head for the mountains What ails these bronchos grumbled Ned Rector Guess they re afraid of heat prostration replied Chunky Don t blame them I m half baked myself Glad you know what ails you laughed Ned You ought not to feel bad about that seeing it s your natural condition As they plodded on the guide s eyes were roaming over the plain in search of telltale marks that would reveal the presence of that of which they were in most urgent need water The landscape by this time had become a white glare and the blue flannel shirts of the Pony Riders had changed to a dirty gray as if they had been sprinkled with a cloud of fine powder Their hair too was tinged below the rims of their sombreros with the same grayish substance while their faces were streaked where the perspiration had trickled down giving them a most grotesque appearance How do you like it Chunky grinned Ned Oh I ve seen worse in Chillicothe answered the fat boy airily The dust in Main Street is worse because it s dirtier Judging from the appearance of your face at this minute I m obliged to differ with you interjected the Professor his own grim dust stained countenance wrinkling into a half smile Do we take a rest at midday guide Parry shook his head Think we d better keep going Only be worse off if we stop now Hungry any of you Stacy made a wry face and felt of his stomach which action brought a laugh from the others Just then Stacy stiffened then uttered a loud sneeze that shook him to his very foundations causing Satan to jump so suddenly that he nearly unseated his rider Whew Thought my head had blown off Guess we re all getting the grippe he grinned as the others began sneezing Alkali answered Parry You ll like that and the sage brush taste in your mouth more and more as you get to know them better Excuse me objected Ned I prefer talcum powder for mine if I ve got to sneeze myself to death on something What time is it Dinner time answered Stacy promptly I ll take ice cream Dry toast will be more in your line I m thinking suggested Ned Or a sandwich added Walter humorously Hurrah fellows Walt Perkins has cracked a joke at last shouted Ned Yes it was cracked all right muttered Chunky maliciously Put him out Put em both out cried Ned and Tad while Tom Parry s stolid face relaxed into a broad smile It appears to me that you young gentlemen are very humorous to day laughed the Professor It s dry humor Professor retorted Ned Tad unslung his lariat I ll rope the next boy who dares say anything like that again he threatened See even the burros are ashamed They re hanging their heads they re so humiliated I don t blame them Mine s swimming from the heat rejoined the guide Say what s that demanded Chunky pointing ahead of him with a half scared expression on his face I don t see anything answered the other lads Chunky s seeing things suggested Ned The fat boy was pointing to a bright circle of light that hung over the desert some five feet from the ground directly ahead of him The peculiar thing about it appeared to be that the circle of light kept continually moving ahead of him and at times he caught the colors of the rainbow in it Stacy looked intently but the bright light hurt his eyes and he was forced to lower his eyelids a little This made the circle seem brighter than before Now Professor Zepplin had discovered the peculiar thing What is that what does it mean guide asked the scientist That that ring of light asked Parry Yes That is a halo sir A halo chorused the boys Must be Chunky s then suggested Walter I agree with you added Ned But I don t see what right he has to a halo That particular halo is a very common thing in the Desert Maze Tom Parry informed them It is caused by heat refraction or something of the sort Yes yes Oh yes I understand nodded the Professor I recall having heard of something of the kind in hot countries and Is this a hot country asked Stacy innocently No you ninny this is a section of Greenland that s been dropped down here by an earthquake or something laughed Walter You re mistaken It was washed down by the flood corrected Ned All this helped to pass away the hours as well as to make the boys forget their troubles for the time being Perhaps the lads did not fully realize the extent of their predicament Not so the guide however He knew that they must find water soon Not many hours would pass before the stock unable to stand the strain longer would give out leaving the party in a serious plight They would then be without water and without horses to take them to water The wild stallions however were accustomed to going without drink for long periods at a time so that they were doing much better than the rest of the stock Tom Parry reasoned that they would be able to go through that day and part of the next without fresh supply and that no serious consequences would result from it Beyond that he did not attempt to forecast what the result would be Late that afternoon without having informed his charges Parry varied his course turning more to the west of south eventually picking up a copper colored butte that rose out of the desert Reaching it at last Parry dismounted and bidding the others wait for him he climbed up the rocky sides of the miniature mountain quirt in hand They watched him until he had disappeared around the opposite side of the butte When they caught sight of him again Tom had descended to the desert and was approaching them along the base of the mountain Anything encouraging called the Professor Parry shook his head Why can t we all go up there and get a breath of fresh air There must be some breeze on the top of the mountain suggested Ned No I couldn t think of it replied the guide firmly Why not please asked Walter Because you might not come back replied the guide with a grim compression of the lips Later upon being pressed by Tad for his reasons he confided to the lad that there were snakes on the butte He said he did not care to tell that to the boys adding that what they don t know won t hurt them Camp was made at dusk some five miles further on much to the relief of man and beast for it had been the most trying day they had experienced The boys threw off their sombreros shaking the dust from their heads They then removed their clothes giving them a thorough beating After a brisk rub down with dry bath towels the lads announced themselves as ready for supper Our dry spread Ned Rector called it for not a drop of anything did they have to drink They had drained their canteens of what little remained in them It isn t good for one to drink with meals anyway comforted Stacy That s what my uncle s doctor says he explained munching his bacon forcing it down his parched throat Chunky was a philosopher but he was unaware of the fact That is right Not until an hour and a half after meals agreed the Professor I imagine we shall have to wait longer than that this time Never mind we ll pull through somehow We always have encouraged Tad cheerfully We ve gotten out of some pretty tight places and I am sure we ll manage to weather this gale in one way or another Gale Huh I wish we had a gale to weather murmured Walter Providing it was a wet one added Stacy That s so Now wouldn t it be fine to have a rainstorm agreed Ned with enthusiasm We could cuddle in our tents and listen to the raindrops patter on the roof suggested Stacy No we d lie down on our backs outside open our mouths wide Like a nest of young robins laughed Tad Yes Only we d fill our mouths with water instead of Boys boys warned the Professor I fear you are drifting into questionable dinner topics again Why we re talking about water Professor replied Ned in a tone of innocent surprise Surely you do not object to that Not so long as you confine your remarks to the subject of water That seems to be our principal need at the present time Speaking of water began Chunky Hold on is this a story or a joke interrupted Ned I heard of a case like ours once continued the fat boy without heeding the interruption A party of travelers on the desert found themselves without water In the party was a bookkeeper He was from the East Well they were thinking about dying from thirst But they didn t The bookkeeper saved them There was silence in the group for a moment I ll be the goat How did he save them asked Ned He had a fountain pen replied the fat boy sagely Y e o w howled the Pony Rider Boys Put him out Put him out CHAPTER XXI OFF ON A DRY TRAIL We shall have to divide up our forces to day Professor We ll make a desperate effort to find a water hole announced Tom Parry What do you propose doing You mean you re going to let us help you Yes I m glad We ll make a big pull to day Should we fail to find water there is only one thing left for us to do And that Leave the burros to shift for themselves We ll head hack toward the San Antonio Range as fast as the bronchos will carry us I don t know whether they ll be equal to the strain or not If they give out we ll have to walk that s all Impossible exclaimed the Professor aghast Nothing s impossible when you re up against it We ll go through with this see if we don t Just keep your nerve and But the boys protested the Professor Look at them said Parry They re somewhat the worse for wear it s true but they re all right every single one of them Boys come over here The lads hastened to obey his summons What is it mister Parry questioned Tad We ve got to do some real work to day boys and I want you to take a hand We are ready for anything sir spoke up Ned Yes I know that replied Parry then went on This is the situation We are without a drop of water All the water holes that I have been depending upon are dry and there is no certainty that we shall find any that are not in the same condition if we continue on our journey We can go along for another day perhaps so far as we are concerned But the stock won t interposed Tad No I noticed this morning that some of the ponies were pretty gaunt in the flanks Regular scarecrows We ve got to make an organized search for a tank and the sooner we begin the better off we ll be or the worse added the guide under his breath If we fail we ll ride all night taking the back trail We ought to hold out long enough to reach the last water hole we left Though even that may be dried up by the time we get to it Then you want us to spread out as it were and cover all the territory about here questioned Tad That s it You ve caught the idea Professor Zepplin shook his head I don t like the idea The boys will be lost They mustn t that s all replied the guide with a firm setting of the lips I think we can arrange so they will find their way back to camp all right Listen This is my plan Master Tad will ride west due west Master Ned on the other hand will proceed east and I ll go south Each of us will ride as far as he can until noon If by then none of us has found any trace of water we ll all turn about and hurry hack to camp Yes but how do you expect the boys to find their way hack demanded Professor Zepplin I m coming to that To begin with I m going to splice the ridge poles of the tents together making a flagpole of them On this we ll tie a shirt or something planting the pole on the top of that ridge there While the boys will be too far away to see it from where they should be by twelve o clock they can get near enough by using their watches as compasses so they can pick it up Each one will take a rifle with him and in the event of finding water he is to remain there firing off the gun at frequent intervals What ll we be doing here all the time interrupted Walter Starting at twelve o clock you will begin firing a rifle to help guide the boys in Fire a shot every five minutes No chance to get lost at all Do you think so Professor It would seem not Did I not know from past experiences how easy it is for the boys to get into trouble I should not hesitate an instant Anyway we ve got to do it We are at a point where we shall have to take chances We are taking some as it is Now hurry your breakfast I ll fix up the signal pole while you are doing so then we ll be off as soon as you have finished Both Tad and Ned were enthusiastic and anxious to show themselves capable of taking a man s part in the proposed operations If Chunky only had a fountain pen now all this trouble would be unnecessary teased Ned as they were hurrying through their breakfast The fat boy s soulful eyes held an expression of mild protest but he made no reply The meal finished Tad and Ned brought out their rifles which they loaded taking with them a box of cartridges each The guide did the same The flagpole had been planted and from its top fluttered a pair of pink pajamas belonging to the Professor That ought to scare all the coyotes off the desert commented Ned as the party surveyed the result of the guide s work It will serve still another purpose grinned the guide Some traveler may see it In that event he ll head for it thinking it s some one in distress If he does you may be able to get a few drops of water from his canteen providing it s not as empty as our own Oh how dry I am whistled Ned softly There doesn t seem to be much probability of our meeting strangers in this desolate place commented the Professor What time do you think we shall see you back Have you any idea Somewhere about sunset in all probability I d like to go along with Tad said Stacy Why no I think you d better not said the Professor Please I know I shall be able to help him You do not need two boys in camp with you Professor Yes he might as well go along if he wants to decided the guide Very well then But Walter must remain here Use your old ponies Do not take the stallions advised Parry If the stallions were to get away from you while you are off on the desert alone it would leave you and perhaps us as well in pretty bad shape And by the way Professor when you begin firing your signals go to the top of the hill yonder and shoot straight up into the air The sound will carry further than were you to shoot from here You ve no idea how perplexing this Desert Maze is to those not familiar with it and its tricks I m learning fast smiled the Professor Furthermore I am convinced that I shall know all about it if I live long Never answered Parry promptly No man ever lived who knew all about the desert I If we rough riders don t get started pretty soon we ll be back before we get started warned Stacy humorously You re right We are wasting time Now Masters Tad and Ned you understand what you are to do We do answered the boys Follow my directions to the letter If you do you will keep out of trouble If you do not there s no telling what may happen We are to find water That s what we are going out for added Tad Exactly But the instant you hear a gun fired turn about and ride home That will mean either that the time s up or that one or the other of us has found what you are looking for Keep your eyes clear for signs and for crusts of alkali that may have a water tank under them We ll do our duty mister Parry answered Tad I know it Good bye and good luck The three lads swung their hands in parting salute as they left the camp at an easy gallop Tad and Stacy riding side by side Ned Rector moving off alone Ascending the rise of ground where the pajamas were drooping listlessly from the top of the signal pole Tad and Stacy slipped down the opposite side of the hill and disappeared from view The two lads were destined to pass through some exciting experiences before they rejoined their companions I hope we don t get lost said Stacy apprehensively as they glided across the desert We mustn t Yes but what if we do insisted the fat boy It will be because you disobeyed orders Chunky You and I have a task to perform and we re going to do it like men The lives of our companions may depend upon our own efforts yours and mine I can t see the Professor s pajamas insisted Chunky I believe we are lost already Tad Then we ll stay lost answered Tad shortly CHAPTER XXII IN THE HERMIT S CAVE The conviction that they did not know where they were grew upon Stacy as they proceeded Not that Stacy cared particularly whether they were lost or not but it gave him something to talk about Don t talk so much Chunky begged Tad after they had gone on some distance You should keep your eyes out for signs What kind of signs Water signs Come be serious for a little while You can have all the sport you want when we get back I think Chunky that we can both work to better advantage if we separate What you want to get rid of me so soon No no Listen You ride off there to the right say half a mile Keep within sight of me all the time and watch carefully for what we are in search of We shall be able to do twice as effective work in that way I see I guess that would be a good idea Got anything to eat in your pocket Some dry bread I ll divide with you You should have brought something The fat boy well satisfied now rode away to the north munching the dry food that Tad had given him So long as Chunky had plenty to eat nothing else mattered Tad soon espied what appeared to him to be a cloud on the horizon ahead After a time he discovered that it was a range of irregular buttes On some of them he eventually made out what looked like scattering trees Tad increased the speed of his pony as much as he thought the animal would stand If there were trees there surely should be water as well he reasoned After a time he succeeded in attracting the attention of Stacy whom he motioned to him The fat boy put spurs to his mount racing along one side of the triangle heading for the range for which he observed that Tad was riding It was now a test of speed to see which one should get there first Tad having the shorter distance to travel made the mark ahead of his companion though with little to spare You started before I knew what you were up to laughed Stacy I can beat you on an even start Haven t any doubt of it Chunky But let s see what s to be found here It looks promising You hold the horses while I climb up among the rocks There s a man up there exclaimed Stacy What s he doing I wonder if he s a hermit Looks as if he might be I ll find out If some one is living here there s water cried Tad triumphantly leaping from his saddle and tossing the bridle reins to his companion The lad ran lightly up the rocks toward the point where he saw the stranger standing observing them suspiciously As he drew nearer to the figure Tad felt some apprehension The man was thin and gaunt a heavy growth of beard covering his face so completely as to hide everything except the nose and eyes I believe he s crazy muttered the lad when he got near enough to note the strange expression in the fellow s eyes As yet the man had not spoken a word How do you do sir greeted the boy The hermit for such he proved to be grunted an unintelligible reply We are looking for water My friends are camped off yonder a dozen miles or more and our water is all gone Please tell me where I can find some Got money Yes yes I ve got money I will pay you for your trouble if that is what you want Let me have a drink first and take some to my companion then I will do whatever you wish in the way of paying begged the lad The hermit eyed him with a steady disconcerting gaze that gave Tad a creepy feeling up and down his spine You want water Yes yes A moment s hesitation then the hermit grasped Tad by the arm and strode rapidly back among the rocks Pushing aside a growth of tangled vines he stooped to enable him to enter the opening that was revealed dragging Tad in after him Illustration The Hermit Grasped Tad by the Arm See here where are you taking me demanded the lad pulling back instinctively from the dark opening The hermit made no reply but tightening his grip which was of vise like firmness jerked the boy into the center of the chamber Tad observed by the single ray of light that penetrated the place through the mat of vines at the entrance that they were in a cave You want water snapped the hermit Yes I do want water more than anything else in the world at this minute but there is no necessity for dragging me to it I can walk Water in there answered the hermit thrusting Tad into a dark recess No sooner had he done so than the lad heard a heavy wooden door slammed shut and a bar thrown across it from the outside Tad instantly realizing that he was being shut in threw himself against the barrier with all his strength But he might as well have tried to break through the rocks which walled him in on the other three sides He shouted at the top of his voice hoping that Chunky might perchance hear him and come to his rescue Chunky could use the rifle that hung in the holster on Tad s saddle and intimidate the hermit if he understood Tad s predicament At that instant the lad s ears caught the faint trickle of water The sound stirred him to sudden action Where was it he asked himself his hands groping over the rocks about him Here it is he cried exultingly What he had found was a tiny stream that was creeping down the side of the rocks Tad pressed his lips against the cool stones enabling him to lick a few drops of the precious fluid into his parched mouth Never had anything tasted so refreshing to him A h h h h gasped the boy taking a fresh breath preparatory to another draught It s almost worth being made a prisoner for this I ll bet Chunky would wish to be in here if he knew And I almost wish he were As if in answer to his expressed wish the door was suddenly pushed inward a heavy body was hurled in landing in a heap on the rocky floor The door slammed shut and the bar once more fell into place For the moment Tad could not determine what had happened I I fell in moaned a voice from the heap Chunky cried Tad How did you get in here I just dropped in wailed the fat boy Get up Don t be a baby Come here and have a drink of water Water Water fairly shouted Stacy leaping to his feet bumping against a rock in his haste Where Where Here Put your lips against the rock right here There you have it Does it taste good U m m m Now you ve had enough for the moment Tell me how you got here How did you happen to come up questioned Tad The the wild man say Tad he looks like a monkey doesn t he I hadn t thought of it in that light I guess you re right though Chunky Well he went out on the rocks and motioned to me I told him I couldn t leave the ponies He said you wanted me right away and he came down to help me stake the ponies He was awful kind mused Stacy as if talking to himself Go on urged Tad We ve got to think about what s going to become of us That s all He just led me up here Said you were inside getting water Then then he threw me in Think I hurt the floor when I hit it Tad I guess not quite so bad as that laughed the lad I want you to strike a match while I look around the place Stacy did so taking his time about it By the dim light thus made they discovered a little pool of water in a far corner of the chamber where the trickling stream had found it s way With their drinking cups which with their canteens the boys always carried they dipped the pool almost dry filling their canteens with the cool refreshing water after having first fully satisfied their thirst Got anything to eat questioned Stacy his thoughts turning to food Yes and I m going to keep it answered Tad promptly That s mean See here Chunky We are prisoners We don t know when or how we are going to get out I have a few crusts of bread left and I propose to keep them because we may find ourselves starving later on You ll be glad then that I saved the bread What do you think the hermit intends to do Did he say anything that gave you any clue Nope We ll wait a while and if he does not let us out we ll have to find a way for ourselves For a time they made the best of their situation Stacy grumbling now and then Tad bright and cheery though in his heart he felt far from cheerful I m going to try to break the door down announced Tad finally after listening intently I can t hear anything I believe the hermit has gone away and left us Get up here beside me Take hold of my hand and we ll rush it together They did so throwing their combined weight against the door Ouch yelled Stacy Never mind try it again encouraged Tad laughing in spite of himself Once more they hurled themselves on the obstruction It resisted all their efforts Tad lighted a match examining the door carefully The light revealed a heap of blankets in a corner of the chamber where the old hermit slept Must be his bedroom decided Chunky We ve got to try something else announced Tad Got your knife Yes Out with it We re going to whittle Lucky for us that our knives are big and sharp Hold a match while I mark out the spot we re going to try to cut out Tad had sounded the door with his fist until he found the place where the bar on the other side held it He also discovered sockets for an inner bar by which the hermit probably locked himself in at night Then he began cutting You start in here and keep to your side so you don t cut my hands the lad directed The crunching sound of their knives began immediately the work going on more slowly in the darkness than would have been the case had they had light Now and then the lads would pause to listen Not a sound penetrated to their prison Tad thought this very strange unless perhaps the hermit might be lying in wait to fall upon them in case they did succeed in freeing themselves Say Tad Well I ve got an idea Chunky s knife had been silent for a few moments What is it Let s burn down the old door How I ll show you Stacy scraped industriously for a time then lighting a match applied it to the spot on which he had been working The splinters caught fire burned up briskly then went out Stacy repeated the process with a similar result I guess that will help a little decided Tad running his fingers over the spot Just like singeing the pin feathers off an old hen the feathers burn but the hen doesn t grumbled Stacy Whew the smoke s getting thick in here We ve got to stop the burning or we ll suffocate warned Tad Wish I had an ax I d make short work of the old door They then began working with a grim determination Stacy ceasing his joking At last a tiny ray of light showed through the heavy door Hurrah shouted Tad I see daylight Then give me some bread I m hungry Not yet We re not out of our prison laughed Tad Keep cutting It will take all of an hour to make an opening large enough for me to get my hand through I got my finger through cried Stacy triumphantly Ouch he yelled as a club of some sort was brought against the door on the outside with terrific force bruising the end of the lad s finger The hermit is out there waiting for us gasped Tad with sinking heart CHAPTER XXIII LOST IN THE DESERT MAZE A rifle shot sounded from the camp of the Pony Rider Boys At regular intervals shot followed shot It was the warning signal agreed upon to notify the others that water had been found Ned Rector had ridden into camp with the joyful tidings that he had discovered a water tank about three miles to the eastward Immediately Walter sprang for his rifle and running to the top of the little hill began shooting into the air Ned in the meantime not waiting for the return of the others had fetched the water bags from the burros and started off at a rapid pace to bring back water for the stock His canteen he left for Professor Zepplin and Walter It s horrible stuff but it is water breathed the Professor as he swallowed the brown alkali fluid If ever I get a drink of real water again I know I shall be able to appreciate it In the meantime Walter s rifle was booming its warning over the desert maze Two hours later Tom Parry hot dusty and well nigh spent rode into camp with the steam rising from his pony in a thin vaporous cloud Have you found it he called hoarsely Yes Ned s found a water hole the Professor informed him Give me a drink quick The alkali s cutting furrows in my throat he begged Never got such a hold of me before The Professor pressed his canteen to the guide s lips and Parry drank eagerly A few moments later he pulled himself together sharply I m going to take the stock out to the water hole he announced starting the burros off across the desert I ll water the stallions when I return You had better let me attend to that protested the Professor You re in no shape to go out in the sun again That s all right Professor But tell me how I am going to get out of the sun begged Parry with a grim smile The tent Hotter than the sun No I guess I can stand it if those boys are able to By the way have you seen anything of the other two I ll ascertain if Walter has discovered them yet Walter s straining eyes had failed to make out Tad and Stacy however so the Professor bade him continue firing his rifle This was a pleasant occupation for Walter for like his companions next to a pony he loved a gun Ned had returned with the water bags and Parry had finished watering the stock It was now near sunset No signs yet questioned the guide joining Walter on the knoll Not a thing That doesn t seem right Stop your firing and come get some supper We must eat and put ourselves in shape or we ll be good for nothing Did those boys take any food with them I think I saw Tad stowing something in his pockets before he started I m sure I did spoke up Ned Rector There s a lad who knows his business approved Parry moving toward the camp with Walter Why have you discontinued the shooting demanded the Professor in surprise To eat Half an hour s intermission will make little difference If the lads are on their way we ll be able to call them in before it gets dark If not then I shall go out to look for them They re all right I think you need feel no concern over them Must have gone a long way spoke up Ned Yes they undoubtedly followed orders And perhaps exceeded them added the Professor It was a real supper that they sat down to that evening with hot coffee fried bacon and other good things and the party would have been a jolly one had Tad and Stacy been on hand to participate in it Walter hurried through his meal then took his position on the hill once more where he renewed his signaling with the rifle All at once he uttered a shout following it with a quick volley of six shots thus emptying his magazine Do you see them called Parry hastening over to the knoll and joining Walter I think I see a cloud of dust approaching over the desert he made reply Where Walter pointed with his rifle Yes that s the boys I guess Nothing but a broncho could kick up the alkali like that I ll go back and have their supper ready You keep on shooting The light is growing fainter and they won t be able to find their way in otherwise Is it the boys called the Professor as they saw Parry hastening toward them I think so Put the coffee on Master Ned They ll want to boil the alkali out of their systems as soon as they get here That s the time Tad Butler got left chuckled Ned Rector He s always been around when there was any glory coming But when it comes to finding water where there isn t any I guess they can t beat Ned Rector What s that boy shooting so rapidly for asked Parry He s excited about something answered Ned He s dancing around as if he s suddenly gone crazy What s that He s calling and motioning to us Guess he wants you mister Parry What is it called the guide making a megaphone of his hands Unable to make out what it was that Walter was shouting to him Tom Parry deserted the camp fire where he was assisting to get the second supper and hastened to the knoll What s the trouble my lad Come and see I want you to take a look at that pony He s tearing across the desert as if something were chasing him But I can t make out anyone on his back The light is weak and he s throwing a lot of dust Of course there s some one his back and there must be two horses The guide shaded his hands gazing off across the plain What what he stammered Wasn t I right mister Parry That s very strange I don t understand it at all That s what I thought There s only one pony and he s riderless exclaimed Tom Parry I m afraid something has happened It may not be one of our ponies however We ll know in a few minutes The running animal was drawing steadily nearer the camp Those over by the camp fire were busy getting the meal ready for the two missing lads The pony reached the foot of the knoll Observing Parry and Walter there the little animal shied making a wide detour and finally galloping up to the camp Walter and the guide hurried down Hello cried the Professor as he saw the horse dash in What does this mean Why it s Tad s pony exclaimed Ned in amazement Is that Master Tad s mount called the guide as he approached them on the run Yes Do you think there s anything wrong questioned Ned Looks that way Don t let him get away I want to look the critter over Perhaps we may learn something Ned caught the pony without difficulty and led it to the guide Parry went all over the animal even going through the saddlebags The rifle and the rope are missing Everything else seems to be in order he announced Then I ll guarantee that Tad s all right spoke up Ned That s what I think agreed Walter He s taken his gun and rope up into some mountain or other and while he was away the pony got away and started for home Is that your opinion mister Parry questioned the Professor What s the use in offering any opinions I don t know But I m going to find out Let s see We have a new moon to night I ve got about two hours before it goes down I want you all to remain right here in camp until I return Even if it s until to morrow I m going out to look for the boys With that Parry hastily filled his canteen slung one of the bags of water over the back of his pony and springing into the saddle dashed away following the trail that the returning broncho had left CHAPTER XXIV CONCLUSION No use trying to go any further to night Chunky Where ll we stay then Right here I guess answered Tad It s as good a place as we ll find But to understand this we must take up the fortunes of Tad and Stacy whom we left imprisoned in the hermit s cave After waiting for a full hour in the cave following the hermit s blow on the door the lads not having heard anything further of him had renewed their whittling After long and arduous effort they had succeeded in making an opening in the wood sufficiently large to enable Tad to push his hand through Before doing so however he made reasonably sure that the hermit was not standing there with a club ready to bring it down with crushing force Being satisfied on this point Tad thrust a hand through His upturned hand had grasped the bar that held the door in place Pushing upward with all his strength he felt the bar give Stacy with ready resourcefulness began forcing up on Tad s elbow In a moment more they had the satisfaction of hearing the bar clatter to the rocks Yet one end of it had stuck in its socket still holding the barrier in place They tried their former tactics Backing off both lads rushed at the heavy door It gave way with a suddenness that they had not expected The boys tumbled out each landing on his head and shoulders then toppling over to his back There was a lively scramble They were up in a twinkling fully expecting to find the hermit standing over them To their surprise they found themselves entirely alone To their further surprise neither of their ponies was in sight when they stepped out on the rocks Upon examining the hoof prints a few minutes later they discovered that one animal had set off on the back trail while the other had apparently gone in the opposite direction After a brief consultation they decided that they must start back on foot Without a moment s hesitation the lads laying their course by Tad s watch started pluckily toward camp many miles away After a few hours night overtook them They still had the moon however and by its light they trudged along for two more weary hours Then the moon s light left them and Tad decided that it were worse than useless to continue Absolute darkness had settled over the Desert Maze as the boys dropped down footsore and weary after their long tramp in the stifling heat Got anything to eat asked Stacy That I have and a canteen of water besides We have a lot to be thankful for yet Chunky Haven t we I ll tell you after I try the bread answered the fat boy Tad laughed merrily Always a humorist aren t you Except when I fall in somewhere replied Stacy How does the bread go Fine Aren t you glad you didn t eat it up back there in the hermit s cave Oh I dunno If I d eaten it then I wouldn t have to eat it now Oh Chunky you re hopeless I shall have to give you up What do you think has become of those ponies interrupted the fat boy Guess they must have gotten away and gone home at least one of them answered Tad Wrong Why One went one way and the other another didn t he Yes What of that If they d gotten away they d both traveled together One of them was ridden away and I m thinking the hermit was on his back I ll bet he carried my broncho off You mean you think your broncho carried him off laughed Tad I didn t give you credit for so much sense Chunky I guess you are right at that The ponies surely would have left together Seems to be our luck to lose horses Guess my gun has gone too but I picked up the rope back by the mountain Glad I didn t bring my rifle along chuckled Stacy I ll bet I d be throwing good bye kisses after it now if I had I don t understand what that old man meant by making us prisoners unless it was that he wanted a horse to get out of the Desert Maze If that was his reason I don t blame him laughed Tad mister Parry did us a real service when he advised us to leave our stallions back in camp They surely would have been gone by this time and we never could have caught them again Yes I can see Satan legging it for the hills replied Stacy Legging it is his strong point They had finished their slender meal by this time and drunk their fill of water from the canteens As a result they felt better than they had felt at any time during the past three days We have a long hot walk ahead of us to morrow unless they come out to look for us Chunky averred Tad Yes And I love to walk replied Stacy with droll humor Especially when the sun is one hundred and fifty in the shade or where the shade ought to be If ever I come down in this baked country again I m going to bring that sweet apple tree out of uncle s orchard even if I have to drag it all over the desert with me Think we d better make our beds and turn in suggested Tad I guess I ll take a drink of water first then I m ready In a few moments the plucky lads had stretched out on the still hot ground without feeling the least fear They were too self reliant to feel any fear and they had passed so many nights in the open that the mysterious darkness of the outside world held no terrors for them They knew there was nothing to harm them Tad was beginning to doze off when Stacy nudged him in the ribs What is it asked Tad sharply I think the girl forgot to put a fresh pillow case on my pillow to day The pillow feels awful rough Oh go to sleep Dream all the funny things you wish to but don t bother me till daylight From that moment until long past midnight the boys slept soundly neither having moved since he lay down for his night s rest Even when the coyotes began to howl off on the desert the lads merely stirred only half conscious of what the sound meant But when the howls gradually drew nearer Chunky cautiously opened one eye The night was so dark that he could not see anything about him The beasts drew nearer Tad was awake now Keep still don t scare them until I give the word he said in answer to Stacy s poke Emboldened by the quietness the coyotes kept creeping closer and closer their mournful howls increasing in volume every minute All at once Tad reached down for his rope He lay still for a few minutes until satisfied that the animals had not observed his movement Suddenly the great loop shot from his hand A quick violent tug at the other end a wild frightened howl from the cowardly beasts and all but one with tails between their legs fled over the desert I ve got one Chunky yelled Tad Quick Help me here or he ll get away It required all the strength of the two boys to hold the animal that Tad had roped in the dark Gradually they shortened up on the rope Tad standing in front of his companion until he felt the animal dangerously near Then he let out a swift kick By good luck it laid the coyote flat Tad was upon the beast before in its half dazed condition it could rise Together they tied the animal s feet its jaws snapping at them viciously before their task was completed There was no more sleep for the lads that night They feared the coyote would gnaw the rope in two if left alone All during the night the boys were obliged continually to jerk on the line about its neck to keep the beast from doing this very thing Morning came at last Making a harness from a piece of the rope they bound up one of the animal s forefeet just as Bud Stevens had done with wild horses Then they released the hind feet mister Coyote hopped about like a rabbit for a time snarling and snapping to their keen delight They felt no fear of him though mister Coyote had several times expressed a willingness to fight his captors After eating their remaining crumbs of bread the boys decided to move on Tad believing that he knew the direction to follow did not wait for the sun to rise Yet although they were not aware of the fact they already had strayed far from the trail I m afraid the coyote is going to be a drag on us much as I should like to take him along said Tad Stacy begged to keep the animal and Tad decided to try it The next question was how to move it It was finally decided that one boy should lead the coyote while the other prodded it from the rear when the animal lagged At noon they halted to rest draining the last drop from their canteens Then they started on again suffering more and more from the heat as they proceeded About the middle of the afternoon Tad halted gazing helplessly about him Chunky we re lost in the Desert Maze I don t know where I am any more than if I were in the middle of an ocean I m pretty nearly exhausted too So s the coyote comforted Stacy But we ve got to keep on going My watch is missing I must have lost it where we slept last night I can only guess at the direction we ought to take Have you any idea where we are Stacy gazed at the sky meditatively On a rough guess I should say we were on the Nevada Desert Oh come on Come on Still clinging to the angry coyote the lads took up their weary tramp The baking alkali burned their feet almost to the blistering point the burning withering heat made their heads whirl the desert began to perform strange antics while the halo that they had seen a few days before again appeared before them first whirling like a giant pin wheel then oscillating in a way that made them giddy Chunky I can t stand this any longer cried Tad suddenly sinking to the ground I m ashamed of myself to give way like this Stacy moved around to the sunny side of his companion placing his own body where it would shade Tad s head from the sun The fat boy took off his sombrero unheeding the burning rays that were beating down on his own head and began to fan Tad with the hat I don t believe I can go any further Chunky You are still in fairly good shape and you ll be able to make the camp if you go on Leave me and make a try for it You you want me to go on without you Want me to leave you here to Say Tad do you think I m that kind of a coyote I d thrash you for that if you weren t already properly done up You ll feel better when night comes and your head gets cooled off In the morning we ll make another attempt to get out of the Desert Maze You lie still now Thus admonished Tad closed his eyes At last the sun went down and with its passing came a breath of refreshing air They inhaled long and deeply of it After a little Stacy got up Where you going demanded Tad opening his bloodshot eyes Going to tie up my dog then go to bed Five minutes later both were sleeping the sleep that comes from utter exhaustion of mind and body Stacy awakened first his eyes opening on the burning blue above him After a few moments he rolled over on his stomach to gaze at the coyote Instantly something else attracted his attention What he saw was a crossed stick on a standard The whole resembled a cross standing barely six inches above the ground The lad eyed the strange object inquiringly then wriggled over toward it Maybe there s water here I ll see he muttered Stacy began digging industriously with knife and hands After a time the knife struck some hard substance This upon further digging proved to be a bottle The boy pulled his find out quickly There s a piece of paper in it he exclaimed in surprise Guess somebody must have thrown it off a sinking desert schooner Stacy drew the paper from the bottle To the lost on the Desert Maze he read That s me and the coyote Water ten paces to the east Grass Peak fifteen miles to the east Belted Range about eighteen miles west Cross piece on stick points due east and west A Traveler With a sharp glance at his sleeping companion Stacy tramped off ten paces There being no sign of water the lad began stamping about with his heels Suddenly the alkali crust gave way beneath him One leg went through He felt it plunge into water Y e o w howled Stacy Tad Butler scrambled to his feet rubbing his eyes Water Water Water I fell in shrieked the fat boy dancing about joyously I ve found a key to the Desert Maze and I ve unlocked one blind desert alley with my foot The lads drank and drank of the villainous brown fluid Then after having laved their faces and filled the canteens they set out on their journey Grass Peak was the hill from which the Professor s pajamas had been unfurled to the idle desert breeze Twilight was descending when two gaunt eyed hollow cheeked lads each with an arm thrown about the other s waist for support were described staggering across the Desert Maze Behind then at the end of a lariat slouched a disconsolate cowardly coyote A great shout went up from the camp of the Pony Riders They dashed out to meet their exhausted companions Hoisting the two boys to their shoulders they carried them triumphantly to camp Tom Parry the guide had been thrown by his pony stepping through a crust on the alkali and had lain all night on the desert Next day he had staggered back to camp where he found his pony and after a few hours rest had taken up his fruitless search again Stacy s pony in the meantime had come in The boys never knew how the animals got away though from the fact that Tad s rifle was missing it was believed that the hermit had ridden the pony off turning it adrift later But the brave lads had found their way through the Desert Maze to camp having passed through hardships and perils that would have daunted stronger and more experienced desert travelers Next morning the Pony Rider Boys struck their tents and broke camp A few days later they crossed the line into California where after loading their stock and equipment into a large stock car they started for the East Yet though their summer vacation was rapidly drawing to a close the Pony Rider Boys had not seen the end of their thrilling adventures Another exciting trip lay before them one which was destined to linger in memory for many years to come The story of this the end of the Silver Trail will be related in a following volume entitled THE
