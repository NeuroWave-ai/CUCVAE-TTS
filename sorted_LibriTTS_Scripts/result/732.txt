Edward Gibbon esquire With notes by the reverend H H Milman VOLUME TWO Chapter XVI Conduct Towards The Christians From Nero To Constantine Part I The Conduct Of The Roman Government Towards The Christians From The Reign Of Nero To That Of Constantine onea Footnote onea The sixteenth chapter I cannot help considering as a very ingenious and specious but very disgraceful extenuation of the cruelties perpetrated by the Roman magistrates against the Christians It is written in the most contemptibly factious spirit of prejudice against the sufferers it is unworthy of a philosopher and of humanity Let the narrative of Cyprian s death be examined He had to relate the murder of an innocent man of advanced age and in a station deemed venerable by a considerable body of the provincials of Africa put to death because he refused to sacrifice to Jupiter Instead of pointing the indignation of posterity against such an atrocious act of tyranny he dwells with visible art on the small circumstances of decorum and politeness which attended this murder and which he relates with as much parade as if they were the most important particulars of the event doctor Robertson has been the subject of much blame for his real or supposed lenity towards the Spanish murderers and tyrants in America That the sixteenth chapter of mister G did not excite the same or greater disapprobation is a proof of the unphilosophical and indeed fanatical animosity against Christianity which was so prevalent during the latter part of the eighteenth century Mackintosh see Life i p two hundred forty four two hundred forty five If we seriously consider the purity of the Christian religion the sanctity of its moral precepts and the innocent as well as austere lives of the greater number of those who during the first ages embraced the faith of the gospel we should naturally suppose that so benevolent a doctrine would have been received with due reverence even by the unbelieving world that the learned and the polite however they may deride the miracles would have esteemed the virtues of the new sect and that the magistrates instead of persecuting would have protected an order of men who yielded the most passive obedience to the laws though they declined the active cares of war and government If on the other hand we recollect the universal toleration of Polytheism as it was invariably maintained by the faith of the people the incredulity of philosophers and the policy of the Roman senate and emperors we are at a loss to discover what new offence the Christians had committed what new provocation could exasperate the mild indifference of antiquity and what new motives could urge the Roman princes who beheld without concern a thousand forms of religion subsisting in peace under their gentle sway to inflict a severe punishment on any part of their subjects who had chosen for themselves a singular but an inoffensive mode of faith and worship The religious policy of the ancient world seems to have assumed a more stern and intolerant character to oppose the progress of Christianity About fourscore years after the death of Christ his innocent disciples were punished with death by the sentence of a proconsul of the most amiable and philosophic character and according to the laws of an emperor distinguished by the wisdom and justice of his general administration The apologies which were repeatedly addressed to the successors of Trajan are filled with the most pathetic complaints that the Christians who obeyed the dictates and solicited the liberty of conscience were alone among all the subjects of the Roman empire excluded from the common benefits of their auspicious government The deaths of a few eminent martyrs have been recorded with care and from the time that Christianity was invested with the supreme power the governors of the church have been no less diligently employed in displaying the cruelty than in imitating the conduct of their Pagan adversaries To separate if it be possible a few authentic as well as interesting facts from an undigested mass of fiction and error and to relate in a clear and rational manner the causes the extent the duration and the most important circumstances of the persecutions to which the first Christians were exposed is the design of the present chapter oneb Footnote oneb The history of the first age of Christianity is only found in the Acts of the Apostles and in order to speak of the first persecutions experienced by the Christians that book should naturally have been consulted those persecutions then limited to individuals and to a narrow sphere interested only the persecuted and have been related by them alone Gibbon making the persecutions ascend no higher than Nero has entirely omitted those which preceded this epoch and of which saint Luke has preserved the memory The only way to justify this omission was to attack the authenticity of the Acts of the Apostles for if authentic they must necessarily be consulted and quoted Now antiquity has left very few works of which the authenticity is so well established as that of the Acts of the Apostles See Lardner s Cred of Gospel Hist part iii It is therefore without sufficient reason that Gibbon has maintained silence concerning the narrative of saint Luke and this omission is not without importance G The sectaries of a persecuted religion depressed by fear animated with resentment and perhaps heated by enthusiasm are seldom in a proper temper of mind calmly to investigate or candidly to appreciate the motives of their enemies which often escape the impartial and discerning view even of those who are placed at a secure distance from the flames of persecution A reason has been assigned for the conduct of the emperors towards the primitive Christians which may appear the more specious and probable as it is drawn from the acknowledged genius of Polytheism It has already been observed that the religious concord of the world was principally supported by the implicit assent and reverence which the nations of antiquity expressed for their respective traditions and ceremonies It might therefore be expected that they would unite with indignation against any sect or people which should separate itself from the communion of mankind and claiming the exclusive possession of divine knowledge should disdain every form of worship except its own as impious and idolatrous The rights of toleration were held by mutual indulgence they were justly forfeited by a refusal of the accustomed tribute As the payment of this tribute was inflexibly refused by the Jews and by them alone the consideration of the treatment which they experienced from the Roman magistrates will serve to explain how far these speculations are justified by facts and will lead us to discover the true causes of the persecution of Christianity Without repeating what has already been mentioned of the reverence of the Roman princes and governors for the temple of Jerusalem we shall only observe that the destruction of the temple and city was accompanied and followed by every circumstance that could exasperate the minds of the conquerors and authorize religious persecution by the most specious arguments of political justice and the public safety From the reign of Nero to that of Antoninus Pius the Jews discovered a fierce impatience of the dominion of Rome which repeatedly broke out in the most furious massacres and insurrections Humanity is shocked at the recital of the horrid cruelties which they committed in the cities of Egypt of Cyprus and of Cyrene where they dwelt in treacherous friendship with the unsuspecting natives one and we are tempted to applaud the severe retaliation which was exercised by the arms of the legions against a race of fanatics whose dire and credulous superstition seemed to render them the implacable enemies not only of the Roman government but of human kind two The enthusiasm of the Jews was supported by the opinion that it was unlawful for them to pay taxes to an idolatrous master and by the flattering promise which they derived from their ancient oracles that a conquering Messiah would soon arise destined to break their fetters and to invest the favorites of heaven with the empire of the earth It was by announcing himself as their long expected deliverer and by calling on all the descendants of Abraham to assert the hope of Israel that the famous Barchochebas collected a formidable army with which he resisted during two years the power of the emperor Hadrian three Footnote one In Cyrene they massacred two hundred twenty thousand Greeks in Cyprus two hundred forty thousand in Egypt a very great multitude Many of these unhappy victims were sawn asunder according to a precedent to which David had given the sanction of his example The victorious Jews devoured the flesh licked up the blood and twisted the entrails like a girdle round their bodies See Dion Cassius l lxviii p eleven forty five Note Some commentators among them Reimar in his notes on Dion Cassius think that the hatred of the Romans against the Jews has led the historian to exaggerate the cruelties committed by the latter Don Cass lxviii p eleven forty six G Footnote two Without repeating the well known narratives of Josephus we may learn from Dion l lxix p eleven sixty two that in Hadrian s war five hundred eighty thousand Jews were cut off by the sword besides an infinite number which perished by famine by disease and by fire Footnote three For the sect of the Zealots see Basnage Histoire des Juifs l i c seventeen for the characters of the Messiah according to the Rabbis l v c eleven twelve thirteen for the actions of Barchochebas l vii c twelve Hist of Jews iii one hundred fifteen c M Notwithstanding these repeated provocations the resentment of the Roman princes expired after the victory nor were their apprehensions continued beyond the period of war and danger By the general indulgence of polytheism and by the mild temper of Antoninus Pius the Jews were restored to their ancient privileges and once more obtained the permission of circumcising their children with the easy restraint that they should never confer on any foreign proselyte that distinguishing mark of the Hebrew race four The numerous remains of that people though they were still excluded from the precincts of Jerusalem were permitted to form and to maintain considerable establishments both in Italy and in the provinces to acquire the freedom of Rome to enjoy municipal honors and to obtain at the same time an exemption from the burdensome and expensive offices of society The moderation or the contempt of the Romans gave a legal sanction to the form of ecclesiastical police which was instituted by the vanquished sect The patriarch who had fixed his residence at Tiberias was empowered to appoint his subordinate ministers and apostles to exercise a domestic jurisdiction and to receive from his dispersed brethren an annual contribution five New synagogues were frequently erected in the principal cities of the empire and the sabbaths the fasts and the festivals which were either commanded by the Mosaic law or enjoined by the traditions of the Rabbis were celebrated in the most solemn and public manner six Such gentle treatment insensibly assuaged the stern temper of the Jews Awakened from their dream of prophecy and conquest they assumed the behavior of peaceable and industrious subjects Their irreconcilable hatred of mankind instead of flaming out in acts of blood and violence evaporated in less dangerous gratifications They embraced every opportunity of overreaching the idolaters in trade and they pronounced secret and ambiguous imprecations against the haughty kingdom of Edom seven Footnote four It is to Modestinus a Roman lawyer l vi regular that we are indebted for a distinct knowledge of the Edict of Antoninus See Casaubon ad Hist August p twenty seven Footnote five See Basnage Histoire des Juifs l iii c two three The office of Patriarch was suppressed by Theodosius the younger Footnote six We need only mention the Purim or deliverance of the Jews from he rage of Haman which till the reign of Theodosius was celebrated with insolent triumph and riotous intemperance Basnage Hist des Juifs l vi c seventeen l viii c six Footnote seven According to the false Josephus Tsepho the grandson of Esau conducted into Italy the army of Eneas king of Carthage Another colony of Idumaeans flying from the sword of David took refuge in the dominions of Romulus For these or for other reasons of equal weight the name of Edom was applied by the Jews to the Roman empire Note The false Josephus is a romancer of very modern date though some of these legends are probably more ancient It may be worth considering whether many of the stories in the Talmud are not history in a figurative disguise adopted from prudence The Jews might dare to say many things of Rome under the significant appellation of Edom which they feared to utter publicly Later and more ignorant ages took literally and perhaps embellished what was intelligible among the generation to which it was addressed Hist of Jews iii one hundred thirty one The false Josephus has the inauguration of the emperor with the seven electors and apparently the pope assisting at the coronation Pref page xxvi M Since the Jews who rejected with abhorrence the deities adored by their sovereign and by their fellow subjects enjoyed however the free exercise of their unsocial religion there must have existed some other cause which exposed the disciples of Christ to those severities from which the posterity of Abraham was exempt The difference between them is simple and obvious but according to the sentiments of antiquity it was of the highest importance The Jews were a nation the Christians were a sect and if it was natural for every community to respect the sacred institutions of their neighbors it was incumbent on them to persevere in those of their ancestors The voice of oracles the precepts of philosophers and the authority of the laws unanimously enforced this national obligation By their lofty claim of superior sanctity the Jews might provoke the Polytheists to consider them as an odious and impure race By disdaining the intercourse of other nations they might deserve their contempt The laws of Moses might be for the most part frivolous or absurd yet since they had been received during many ages by a large society his followers were justified by the example of mankind and it was universally acknowledged that they had a right to practise what it would have been criminal in them to neglect But this principle which protected the Jewish synagogue afforded not any favor or security to the primitive church By embracing the faith of the gospel the Christians incurred the supposed guilt of an unnatural and unpardonable offence They dissolved the sacred ties of custom and education violated the religious institutions of their country and presumptuously despised whatever their fathers had believed as true or had reverenced as sacred Nor was this apostasy if we may use the expression merely of a partial or local kind since the pious deserter who withdrew himself from the temples of Egypt or Syria would equally disdain to seek an asylum in those of Athens or Carthage Every Christian rejected with contempt the superstitions of his family his city and his province The whole body of Christians unanimously refused to hold any communion with the gods of Rome of the empire and of mankind It was in vain that the oppressed believer asserted the inalienable rights of conscience and private judgment Though his situation might excite the pity his arguments could never reach the understanding either of the philosophic or of the believing part of the Pagan world To their apprehensions it was no less a matter of surprise that any individuals should entertain scruples against complying with the established mode of worship than if they had conceived a sudden abhorrence to the manners the dress or the language of their native country eight eighta Footnote eight From the arguments of Celsus as they are represented and refuted by Origen l v p two hundred forty seven two hundred fifty nine we may clearly discover the distinction that was made between the Jewish people and the Christian sect See in the Dialogue of Minucius Felix c five six a fair and not inelegant description of the popular sentiments with regard to the desertion of the established worship Footnote eighta In all this there is doubtless much truth yet does not the more important difference lie on the surface The Christians made many converts the Jews but few Had the Jewish been equally a proselyting religion would it not have encountered as violent persecution M The surprise of the Pagans was soon succeeded by resentment and the most pious of men were exposed to the unjust but dangerous imputation of impiety Malice and prejudice concurred in representing the Christians as a society of atheists who by the most daring attack on the religious constitution of the empire had merited the severest animadversion of the civil magistrate They had separated themselves they gloried in the confession from every mode of superstition which was received in any part of the globe by the various temper of polytheism but it was not altogether so evident what deity or what form of worship they had substituted to the gods and temples of antiquity The pure and sublime idea which they entertained of the Supreme Being escaped the gross conception of the Pagan multitude who were at a loss to discover a spiritual and solitary God that was neither represented under any corporeal figure or visible symbol nor was adored with the accustomed pomp of libations and festivals of altars and sacrifices nine The sages of Greece and Rome who had elevated their minds to the contemplation of the existence and attributes of the First Cause were induced by reason or by vanity to reserve for themselves and their chosen disciples the privilege of this philosophical devotion ten They were far from admitting the prejudices of mankind as the standard of truth but they considered them as flowing from the original disposition of human nature and they supposed that any popular mode of faith and worship which presumed to disclaim the assistance of the senses would in proportion as it receded from superstition find itself incapable of restraining the wanderings of the fancy and the visions of fanaticism The careless glance which men of wit and learning condescended to cast on the Christian revelation served only to confirm their hasty opinion and to persuade them that the principle which they might have revered of the Divine Unity was defaced by the wild enthusiasm and annihilated by the airy speculations of the new sectaries The author of a celebrated dialogue which has been attributed to Lucian whilst he affects to treat the mysterious subject of the Trinity in a style of ridicule and contempt betrays his own ignorance of the weakness of human reason and of the inscrutable nature of the divine perfections eleven Footnote nine Cur nullas aras habent templa nulla nulla nota simulacra Unde autem vel quis ille aut ubi Deus unicus solitarius desti tutus Minucius Felix c ten The Pagan interlocutor goes on to make a distinction in favor of the Jews who had once a temple altars victims c Footnote ten It is difficult says Plato to attain and dangerous to publish the knowledge of the true God See the Theologie des Philosophes in the Abbe d Olivet s French translation of Tully de Natura Deorum tom i p two hundred seventy five Footnote eleven The author of the Philopatris perpetually treats the Christians as a company of dreaming enthusiasts c and in one place he manifestly alludes to the vision in which saint Paul was transported to the third heaven In another place Triephon who personates a Christian after deriding the gods of Paganism proposes a mysterious oath It might appear less surprising that the founder of Christianity should not only be revered by his disciples as a sage and a prophet but that he should be adored as a God The Polytheists were disposed to adopt every article of faith which seemed to offer any resemblance however distant or imperfect with the popular mythology and the legends of Bacchus of Hercules and of Aesculapius had in some measure prepared their imagination for the appearance of the Son of God under a human form twelve But they were astonished that the Christians should abandon the temples of those ancient heroes who in the infancy of the world had invented arts instituted laws and vanquished the tyrants or monsters who infested the earth in order to choose for the exclusive object of their religious worship an obscure teacher who in a recent age and among a barbarous people had fallen a sacrifice either to the malice of his own countrymen or to the jealousy of the Roman government The Pagan multitude reserving their gratitude for temporal benefits alone rejected the inestimable present of life and immortality which was offered to mankind by Jesus of Nazareth His mild constancy in the midst of cruel and voluntary sufferings his universal benevolence and the sublime simplicity of his actions and character were insufficient in the opinion of those carnal men to compensate for the want of fame of empire and of success and whilst they refused to acknowledge his stupendous triumph over the powers of darkness and of the grave they misrepresented or they insulted the equivocal birth wandering life and ignominious death of the divine Author of Christianity thirteen Footnote twelve According to Justin Martyr Apolog Major c seventy eighty five the daemon who had gained some imperfect knowledge of the prophecies purposely contrived this resemblance which might deter though by different means both the people and the philosophers from embracing the faith of Christ Footnote thirteen In the first and second books of Origen Celsus treats the birth and character of our Savior with the most impious contempt The orator Libanius praises Porphyry and Julian for confuting the folly of a sect which styles a dead man of Palestine God and the Son of God Socrates Hist Ecclesiast iii twenty three The personal guilt which every Christian had contracted in thus preferring his private sentiment to the national religion was aggravated in a very high degree by the number and union of the criminals It is well known and has been already observed that Roman policy viewed with the utmost jealousy and distrust any association among its subjects and that the privileges of private corporations though formed for the most harmless or beneficial purposes were bestowed with a very sparing hand fourteen The religious assemblies of the Christians who had separated themselves from the public worship appeared of a much less innocent nature they were illegal in their principle and in their consequences might become dangerous nor were the emperors conscious that they violated the laws of justice when for the peace of society they prohibited those secret and sometimes nocturnal meetings fifteen The pious disobedience of the Christians made their conduct or perhaps their designs appear in a much more serious and criminal light and the Roman princes who might perhaps have suffered themselves to be disarmed by a ready submission deeming their honor concerned in the execution of their commands sometimes attempted by rigorous punishments to subdue this independent spirit which boldly acknowledged an authority superior to that of the magistrate The extent and duration of this spiritual conspiracy seemed to render it everyday more deserving of his animadversion We have already seen that the active and successful zeal of the Christians had insensibly diffused them through every province and almost every city of the empire The new converts seemed to renounce their family and country that they might connect themselves in an indissoluble band of union with a peculiar society which every where assumed a different character from the rest of mankind Their gloomy and austere aspect their abhorrence of the common business and pleasures of life and their frequent predictions of impending calamities sixteen inspired the Pagans with the apprehension of some danger which would arise from the new sect the more alarming as it was the more obscure Whatever says Pliny may be the principle of their conduct their inflexible obstinacy appeared deserving of punishment seventeen Footnote fourteen The emperor Trajan refused to incorporate a company of one hundred fifty firemen for the use of the city of Nicomedia He disliked all associations See Plin Epist x forty two forty three Footnote fifteen The proconsul Pliny had published a general edict against unlawful meetings The prudence of the Christians suspended their Agapae but it was impossible for them to omit the exercise of public worship Footnote sixteen As the prophecies of the Antichrist approaching conflagration c provoked those Pagans whom they did not convert they were mentioned with caution and reserve and the Montanists were censured for disclosing too freely the dangerous secret See Mosheim four hundred thirteen Footnote seventeen Neque enim dubitabam quodcunque esset quod faterentur such are the words of Pliny pervicacian certe et inflexibilem obstinationem lebere puniri The precautions with which the disciples of Christ performed the offices of religion were at first dictated by fear and necessity but they were continued from choice By imitating the awful secrecy which reigned in the Eleusinian mysteries the Christians had flattered themselves that they should render their sacred institutions more respectable in the eyes of the Pagan world eighteen But the event as it often happens to the operations of subtile policy deceived their wishes and their expectations It was concluded that they only concealed what they would have blushed to disclose Their mistaken prudence afforded an opportunity for malice to invent and for suspicious credulity to believe the horrid tales which described the Christians as the most wicked of human kind who practised in their dark recesses every abomination that a depraved fancy could suggest and who solicited the favor of their unknown God by the sacrifice of every moral virtue There were many who pretended to confess or to relate the ceremonies of this abhorred society It was asserted that a new born infant entirely covered over with flour was presented like some mystic symbol of initiation to the knife of the proselyte who unknowingly inflicted many a secret and mortal wound on the innocent victim of his error that as soon as the cruel deed was perpetrated the sectaries drank up the blood greedily tore asunder the quivering members and pledged themselves to eternal secrecy by a mutual consciousness of guilt It was as confidently affirmed that this inhuman sacrifice was succeeded by a suitable entertainment in which intemperance served as a provocative to brutal lust till at the appointed moment the lights were suddenly extinguished shame was banished nature was forgotten and as accident might direct the darkness of the night was polluted by the incestuous commerce of sisters and brothers of sons and of mothers nineteen Footnote eighteen See Mosheim s Ecclesiastical History vol i p one hundred one and Spanheim Remarques sur les Caesars de Julien p four hundred sixty eight c Footnote nineteen See Justin Martyr Apolog i thirty five ii fourteen Athenagoras in Legation c twenty seven Tertullian Apolog c seven eight nine Minucius Felix c nine ten eighty thirty one The last of these writers relates the accusation in the most elegant and circumstantial manner The answer of Tertullian is the boldest and most vigorous But the perusal of the ancient apologies was sufficient to remove even the slightest suspicion from the mind of a candid adversary The Christians with the intrepid security of innocence appeal from the voice of rumor to the equity of the magistrates They acknowledge that if any proof can be produced of the crimes which calumny has imputed to them they are worthy of the most severe punishment They provoke the punishment and they challenge the proof At the same time they urge with equal truth and propriety that the charge is not less devoid of probability than it is destitute of evidence they ask whether any one can seriously believe that the pure and holy precepts of the gospel which so frequently restrain the use of the most lawful enjoyments should inculcate the practice of the most abominable crimes that a large society should resolve to dishonor itself in the eyes of its own members and that a great number of persons of either sex and every age and character insensible to the fear of death or infamy should consent to violate those principles which nature and education had imprinted most deeply in their minds twenty Nothing it should seem could weaken the force or destroy the effect of so unanswerable a justification unless it were the injudicious conduct of the apologists themselves who betrayed the common cause of religion to gratify their devout hatred to the domestic enemies of the church It was sometimes faintly insinuated and sometimes boldly asserted that the same bloody sacrifices and the same incestuous festivals which were so falsely ascribed to the orthodox believers were in reality celebrated by the Marcionites by the Carpocratians and by several other sects of the Gnostics who notwithstanding they might deviate into the paths of heresy were still actuated by the sentiments of men and still governed by the precepts of Christianity twenty one Accusations of a similar kind were retorted upon the church by the schismatics who had departed from its communion twenty two and it was confessed on all sides that the most scandalous licentiousness of manners prevailed among great numbers of those who affected the name of Christians A Pagan magistrate who possessed neither leisure nor abilities to discern the almost imperceptible line which divides the orthodox faith from heretical pravity might easily have imagined that their mutual animosity had extorted the discovery of their common guilt It was fortunate for the repose or at least for the reputation of the first Christians that the magistrates sometimes proceeded with more temper and moderation than is usually consistent with religious zeal and that they reported as the impartial result of their judicial inquiry that the sectaries who had deserted the established worship appeared to them sincere in their professions and blameless in their manners however they might incur by their absurd and excessive superstition the censure of the laws twenty three Footnote twenty In the persecution of Lyons some Gentile slaves were compelled by the fear of tortures to accuse their Christian master The church of Lyons writing to their brethren of Asia treat the horrid charge with proper indignation and contempt Euseb Hist Eccles v i Footnote twenty one See Justin Martyr Apolog i thirty five Irenaeus adv Haeres i twenty four Clemens Alexandrin Stromat l iii p four hundred thirty eight Euseb iv eight It would be tedious and disgusting to relate all that the succeeding writers have imagined all that Epiphanius has received and all that Tillemont has copied M de Beausobre Hist du Manicheisme l ix c eight nine has exposed with great spirit the disingenuous arts of Augustin and Pope Leo I Footnote twenty two When Tertullian became a Montanist he aspersed the morals of the church which he had so resolutely defended Sed majoris est Agape quia per hanc adolescentes tui cum sororibus dormiunt appendices scilicet gulae lascivia et luxuria De Jejuniis c seventeen The eighty fifth canon of the council of Illiberis provides against the scandals which too often polluted the vigils of the church and disgraced the Christian name in the eyes of unbelievers Footnote twenty three Tertullian Apolog c two expatiates on the fair and honorable testimony of Pliny with much reason and some declamation Chapter XVI Conduct Towards The Christians From Nero To Constantine Part II History which undertakes to record the transactions of the past for the instruction of future ages would ill deserve that honorable office if she condescended to plead the cause of tyrants or to justify the maxims of persecution It must however be acknowledged that the conduct of the emperors who appeared the least favorable to the primitive church is by no means so criminal as that of modern sovereigns who have employed the arm of violence and terror against the religious opinions of any part of their subjects From their reflections or even from their own feelings a Charles V or a Lewis XIV might have acquired a just knowledge of the rights of conscience of the obligation of faith and of the innocence of error But the princes and magistrates of ancient Rome were strangers to those principles which inspired and authorized the inflexible obstinacy of the Christians in the cause of truth nor could they themselves discover in their own breasts any motive which would have prompted them to refuse a legal and as it were a natural submission to the sacred institutions of their country The same reason which contributes to alleviate the guilt must have tended to abate the vigor of their persecutions As they were actuated not by the furious zeal of bigots but by the temperate policy of legislators contempt must often have relaxed and humanity must frequently have suspended the execution of those laws which they enacted against the humble and obscure followers of Christ From the general view of their character and motives we might naturally conclude I That a considerable time elapsed before they considered the new sectaries as an object deserving of the attention of government II That in the conviction of any of their subjects who were accused of so very singular a crime they proceeded with caution and reluctance III That they were moderate in the use of punishments and IV That the afflicted church enjoyed many intervals of peace and tranquility Notwithstanding the careless indifference which the most copious and the most minute of the Pagan writers have shown to the affairs of the Christians twenty four it may still be in our power to confirm each of these probable suppositions by the evidence of authentic facts Footnote twenty four In the various compilation of the Augustan History a part of which was composed under the reign of Constantine there are not six lines which relate to the Christians nor has the diligence of Xiphilin discovered their name in the large history of Dion Cassius Note The greater part of the Augustan History is dedicated to Diocletian This may account for the silence of its authors concerning Christianity The notices that occur are almost all in the lives composed under the reign of Constantine It may fairly be concluded from the language which he had into the mouth of Maecenas that Dion was an enemy to all innovations in religion See Gibbon infra note one hundred five In fact when the silence of Pagan historians is noticed it should be remembered how meagre and mutilated are all the extant histories of the period M one By the wise dispensation of Providence a mysterious veil was cast over the infancy of the church which till the faith of the Christians was matured and their numbers were multiplied served to protect them not only from the malice but even from the knowledge of the Pagan world The slow and gradual abolition of the Mosaic ceremonies afforded a safe and innocent disguise to the more early proselytes of the gospel As they were for the greater part of the race of Abraham they were distinguished by the peculiar mark of circumcision offered up their devotions in the Temple of Jerusalem till its final destruction and received both the Law and the Prophets as the genuine inspirations of the Deity The Gentile converts who by a spiritual adoption had been associated to the hope of Israel were likewise confounded under the garb and appearance of Jews twenty five and as the Polytheists paid less regard to articles of faith than to the external worship the new sect which carefully concealed or faintly announced its future greatness and ambition was permitted to shelter itself under the general toleration which was granted to an ancient and celebrated people in the Roman empire It was not long perhaps before the Jews themselves animated with a fiercer zeal and a more jealous faith perceived the gradual separation of their Nazarene brethren from the doctrine of the synagogue and they would gladly have extinguished the dangerous heresy in the blood of its adherents But the decrees of Heaven had already disarmed their malice and though they might sometimes exert the licentious privilege of sedition they no longer possessed the administration of criminal justice nor did they find it easy to infuse into the calm breast of a Roman magistrate the rancor of their own zeal and prejudice The provincial governors declared themselves ready to listen to any accusation that might affect the public safety but as soon as they were informed that it was a question not of facts but of words a dispute relating only to the interpretation of the Jewish laws and prophecies they deemed it unworthy of the majesty of Rome seriously to discuss the obscure differences which might arise among a barbarous and superstitious people The innocence of the first Christians was protected by ignorance and contempt and the tribunal of the Pagan magistrate often proved their most assured refuge against the fury of the synagogue twenty six If indeed we were disposed to adopt the traditions of a too credulous antiquity we might relate the distant peregrinations the wonderful achievements and the various deaths of the twelve apostles but a more accurate inquiry will induce us to doubt whether any of those persons who had been witnesses to the miracles of Christ were permitted beyond the limits of Palestine to seal with their blood the truth of their testimony twenty seven From the ordinary term of human life it may very naturally be presumed that most of them were deceased before the discontent of the Jews broke out into that furious war which was terminated only by the ruin of Jerusalem During a long period from the death of Christ to that memorable rebellion we cannot discover any traces of Roman intolerance unless they are to be found in the sudden the transient but the cruel persecution which was exercised by Nero against the Christians of the capital thirty five years after the former and only two years before the latter of those great events The character of the philosophic historian to whom we are principally indebted for the knowledge of this singular transaction would alone be sufficient to recommend it to our most attentive consideration Footnote twenty five An obscure passage of Suetonius in Claud c twenty five may seem to offer a proof how strangely the Jews and Christians of Rome were confounded with each other Footnote twenty six See in the xviiith and xxvth chapters of the Acts of the Apostles the behavior of Gallio proconsul of Achaia and of Festus procurator of Judea Footnote twenty seven In the time of Tertullian and Clemens of Alexandria the glory of martyrdom was confined to saint Peter saint Paul and saint James It was gradually bestowed on the rest of the apostles by the more recent Greeks who prudently selected for the theatre of their preaching and sufferings some remote country beyond the limits of the Roman empire See Mosheim p eighty one and Tillemont Memoires Ecclesiastiques tom i part iii In the tenth year of the reign of Nero the capital of the empire was afflicted by a fire which raged beyond the memory or example of former ages twenty eight The monuments of Grecian art and of Roman virtue the trophies of the Punic and Gallic wars the most holy temples and the most splendid palaces were involved in one common destruction Of the fourteen regions or quarters into which Rome was divided four only subsisted entire three were levelled with the ground and the remaining seven which had experienced the fury of the flames displayed a melancholy prospect of ruin and desolation The vigilance of government appears not to have neglected any of the precautions which might alleviate the sense of so dreadful a calamity The Imperial gardens were thrown open to the distressed multitude temporary buildings were erected for their accommodation and a plentiful supply of corn and provisions was distributed at a very moderate price twenty nine The most generous policy seemed to have dictated the edicts which regulated the disposition of the streets and the construction of private houses and as it usually happens in an age of prosperity the conflagration of Rome in the course of a few years produced a new city more regular and more beautiful than the former But all the prudence and humanity affected by Nero on this occasion were insufficient to preserve him from the popular suspicion Every crime might be imputed to the assassin of his wife and mother nor could the prince who prostituted his person and dignity on the theatre be deemed incapable of the most extravagant folly The voice of rumor accused the emperor as the incendiary of his own capital and as the most incredible stories are the best adapted to the genius of an enraged people it was gravely reported and firmly believed that Nero enjoying the calamity which he had occasioned amused himself with singing to his lyre the destruction of ancient Troy thirty To divert a suspicion which the power of despotism was unable to suppress the emperor resolved to substitute in his own place some fictitious criminals With this view continues Tacitus he inflicted the most exquisite tortures on those men who under the vulgar appellation of Christians were already branded with deserved infamy They derived their name and origin from Christ who in the reign of Tiberius had suffered death by the sentence of the procurator Pontius Pilate thirty one For a while this dire superstition was checked but it again burst forth thirty onea and not only spread itself over Judaea the first seat of this mischievous sect but was even introduced into Rome the common asylum which receives and protects whatever is impure whatever is atrocious The confessions of those who were seized discovered a great multitude of their accomplices and they were all convicted not so much for the crime of setting fire to the city as for their hatred of human kind thirty two They died in torments and their torments were imbittered by insult and derision Some were nailed on crosses others sewn up in the skins of wild beasts and exposed to the fury of dogs others again smeared over with combustible materials were used as torches to illuminate the darkness of the night The gardens of Nero were destined for the melancholy spectacle which was accompanied with a horse race and honored with the presence of the emperor who mingled with the populace in the dress and attitude of a charioteer The guilt of the Christians deserved indeed the most exemplary punishment but the public abhorrence was changed into commiseration from the opinion that those unhappy wretches were sacrificed not so much to the public welfare as to the cruelty of a jealous tyrant thirty three Those who survey with a curious eye the revolutions of mankind may observe that the gardens and circus of Nero on the Vatican which were polluted with the blood of the first Christians have been rendered still more famous by the triumph and by the abuse of the persecuted religion On the same spot thirty four a temple which far surpasses the ancient glories of the Capitol has been since erected by the Christian Pontiffs who deriving their claim of universal dominion from an humble fisherman of Galilee have succeeded to the throne of the Caesars

Tertullian adv Judaeos c eight This date which is adopted by Pagi Cardinal Norris and Le Clerc seems at least as probable as the vulgar aera which is placed I know not from what conjectures four years later Footnote thirty onea This single phrase Repressa in praesens exitiabilis superstitio rursus erumpebat proves that the Christians had already attracted the attention of the government and that Nero was not the first to persecute them I am surprised that more stress has not been laid on the confirmation which the Acts of the Apostles derive from these words of Tacitus Repressa in praesens and rursus erumpebat G I have been unwilling to suppress this note but surely the expression of Tacitus refers to the expected extirpation of the religion by the death of its founder Christ M Footnote thirty two Odio humani generis convicti These words may either signify the hatred of mankind towards the Christians or the hatred of the Christians towards mankind I have preferred the latter sense as the most agreeable to the style of Tacitus and to the popular error of which a precept of the gospel see Luke xiv twenty six had been perhaps the innocent occasion My interpretation is justified by the authority of Lipsius of the Italian the French and the English translators of Tacitus of Mosheim p one hundred two of Le Clerc Historia Ecclesiast p four hundred twenty seven of doctor Lardner Testimonies vol i p three hundred forty five and of the Bishop of Gloucester Divine Legation vol iii p thirty eight But as the word convicti does not unite very happily with the rest of the sentence

four hundred eighty seven Donatus de Roma Antiqua l iii p four hundred forty nine But it would be improper to dismiss this account of Nero s persecution till we have made some observations that may serve to remove the difficulties with which it is perplexed and to throw some light on the subsequent history of the church one The most sceptical criticism is obliged to respect the truth of this extraordinary fact and the integrity of this celebrated passage of Tacitus The former is confirmed by the diligent and accurate Suetonius who mentions the punishment which Nero inflicted on the Christians a sect of men who had embraced a new and criminal superstition thirty five The latter may be proved by the consent of the most ancient manuscripts by the inimitable character of the style of Tacitus by his reputation which guarded his text from the interpolations of pious fraud and by the purport of his narration which accused the first Christians of the most atrocious crimes without insinuating that they possessed any miraculous or even magical powers above the rest of mankind thirty six two Notwithstanding it is probable that Tacitus was born some years before the fire of Rome thirty seven he could derive only from reading and conversation the knowledge of an event which happened during his infancy Before he gave himself to the public he calmly waited till his genius had attained its full maturity and he was more than forty years of age when a grateful regard for the memory of the virtuous Agricola extorted from him the most early of those historical compositions which will delight and instruct the most distant posterity After making a trial of his strength in the life of Agricola and the description of Germany he conceived and at length executed a more arduous work the history of Rome in thirty books from the fall of Nero to the accession of Nerva The administration of Nerva introduced an age of justice and propriety which Tacitus had destined for the occupation of his old age thirty eight but when he took a nearer view of his subject judging perhaps that it was a more honorable or a less invidious office to record the vices of past tyrants than to celebrate the virtues of a reigning monarch he chose rather to relate under the form of annals the actions of the four immediate successors of Augustus To collect to dispose and to adorn a series of fourscore years in an immortal work every sentence of which is pregnant with the deepest observations and the most lively images was an undertaking sufficient to exercise the genius of Tacitus himself during the greatest part of his life In the last years of the reign of Trajan whilst the victorious monarch extended the power of Rome beyond its ancient limits the historian was describing in the second and fourth books of his annals the tyranny of Tiberius thirty nine and the emperor Hadrian must have succeeded to the throne before Tacitus in the regular prosecution of his work could relate the fire of the capital and the cruelty of Nero towards the unfortunate Christians At the distance of sixty years it was the duty of the annalist to adopt the narratives of contemporaries but it was natural for the philosopher to indulge himself in the description of the origin the progress and the character of the new sect not so much according to the knowledge or prejudices of the age of Nero as according to those of the time of Hadrian three Tacitus very frequently trusts to the curiosity or reflection of his readers to supply those intermediate circumstances and ideas which in his extreme conciseness he has thought proper to suppress We may therefore presume to imagine some probable cause which could direct the cruelty of Nero against the Christians of Rome whose obscurity as well as innocence should have shielded them from his indignation and even from his notice The Jews who were numerous in the capital and oppressed in their own country were a much fitter object for the suspicions of the emperor and of the people nor did it seem unlikely that a vanquished nation who already discovered their abhorrence of the Roman yoke might have recourse to the most atrocious means of gratifying their implacable revenge But the Jews possessed very powerful advocates in the palace and even in the heart of the tyrant his wife and mistress the beautiful Poppaea and a favorite player of the race of Abraham who had already employed their intercession in behalf of the obnoxious people forty In their room it was necessary to offer some other victims and it might easily be suggested that although the genuine followers of Moses were innocent of the fire of Rome there had arisen among them a new and pernicious sect of Galilaeans which was capable of the most horrid crimes Under the appellation of Galilaeans two distinctions of men were confounded the most opposite to each other in their manners and principles the disciples who had embraced the faith of Jesus of Nazareth forty one and the zealots who had followed the standard of Judas the Gaulonite forty two The former were the friends the latter were the enemies of human kind and the only resemblance between them consisted in the same inflexible constancy which in the defence of their cause rendered them insensible of death and tortures The followers of Judas who impelled their countrymen into rebellion were soon buried under the ruins of Jerusalem whilst those of Jesus known by the more celebrated name of Christians diffused themselves over the Roman empire How natural was it for Tacitus in the time of Hadrian to appropriate to the Christians the guilt and the sufferings forty twoa which he might with far greater truth and justice have attributed to a sect whose odious memory was almost extinguished four Whatever opinion may be entertained of this conjecture for it is no more than a conjecture it is evident that the effect as well as the cause of Nero s persecution was confined to the walls of Rome forty three forty threea that the religious tenets of the Galilaeans or Christians were never made a subject of punishment or even of inquiry and that as the idea of their sufferings was for a long time connected with the idea of cruelty and injustice the moderation of succeeding princes inclined them to spare a sect oppressed by a tyrant whose rage had been usually directed against virtue and innocence Footnote thirty five Sueton in Nerone c sixteen The epithet of malefica which some sagacious commentators have translated magical is considered by the more rational Mosheim as only synonymous to the exitiabilis of Tacitus Footnote thirty six The passage concerning Jesus Christ which was inserted into the text of Josephus between the time of Origen and that of Eusebius may furnish an example of no vulgar forgery The accomplishment of the prophecies the virtues miracles and resurrection of Jesus are distinctly related Josephus acknowledges that he was the Messiah and hesitates whether he should call him a man If any doubt can still remain concerning this celebrated passage the reader may examine the pointed objections of Le Fevre Havercamp Joseph tom ii p two hundred sixty seven two hundred seventy three the labored answers of Daubuz p one hundred eighty seven two hundred thirty two and the masterly reply Bibliotheque Ancienne et Moderne tom vii p two hundred thirty seven two hundred eighty eight of an anonymous critic whom I believe to have been the learned Abbe de Longuerue Note The modern editor of Eusebius Heinichen has adopted and ably supported a notion which had before suggested itself to the editor that this passage is not altogether a forgery but interpolated with many additional clauses Heinichen has endeavored

appropriating to the Christians of Rome the guilt and the sufferings which he might have attributed with far greater truth to the followers of Judas the Gaulonite for the latter never went to Rome Their revolt their attempts their opinions their wars their punishment had no other theatre but Judaea Basn Hist des Juifs t i p four hundred ninety one Moreover the name of Christians had long been

viii five inclines to the opinion of those who extend the persecution to the provinces Mosheim rather leans to that side on this much disputed question c xxxv Neander takes the view of Gibbon which is in general that of the most learned writers There is indeed no evidence which I can discover of its reaching the provinces and the apparent security at least as regards his life with which saint Paul pursued his travels during this period affords at least a strong inference against a rigid and general inquisition against the Christians in other parts of the empire M It is somewhat remarkable that the flames of war consumed almost at the same time the temple of Jerusalem and the Capitol of Rome forty four and it appears no less singular that the tribute which devotion had destined to the former should have been converted by the power of an assaulting victor to restore and adorn the splendor of the latter forty five The emperors levied a general capitation tax on the Jewish people and although the sum assessed on the head of each individual was inconsiderable the use for which it was designed and the severity with which it was exacted were considered as an intolerable grievance forty six Since the officers of the revenue extended their unjust claim to many persons who were strangers to the blood or religion of the Jews it was impossible that the Christians who had so often sheltered themselves under the shade of the synagogue should now escape this rapacious persecution Anxious as they were to avoid the slightest infection of idolatry their conscience forbade them to contribute to the honor of that daemon who had assumed the character of the Capitoline Jupiter As a very numerous though declining party among the Christians still adhered to the law of Moses their efforts to dissemble their Jewish origin were detected by the decisive test of circumcision forty seven nor were the Roman magistrates at leisure to inquire into the difference of their religious tenets Among the Christians who were brought before the tribunal of the emperor or as it seems more probable before that of the procurator of Judaea two persons are said to have appeared distinguished by their extraction which was more truly noble than that of the greatest monarchs These were the grandsons of saint Jude the apostle who himself was the brother of Jesus Christ forty eight Their natural pretensions to the throne of David might perhaps attract the respect of the people and excite the jealousy of the governor but the meanness of their garb and the simplicity of their answers soon convinced him that they were neither desirous nor capable of disturbing the peace of the Roman empire They frankly confessed their royal origin and their near relation to the Messiah but they disclaimed any temporal views and professed that his kingdom which they devoutly expected was purely of a spiritual and angelic nature When they were examined concerning their fortune and occupation they showed their hands hardened with daily labor and declared that they derived their whole subsistence from the cultivation of a farm near the village of Cocaba of the extent of about twenty four English acres forty nine and of the value of nine thousand drachms or three hundred pounds sterling The grandsons of saint Jude were dismissed with compassion and contempt fifty Footnote forty four The Capitol was burnt during the civil war between Vitellius and Vespasian the nineteenth of December A D sixty nine On the tenth of August A D seventy the temple of Jerusalem was destroyed by the hands of the Jews themselves rather than by those of the Romans Footnote forty five The new Capitol was dedicated by Domitian Sueton in Domitian c five Plutarch in Poplicola tom i p two hundred thirty

and it was supposed that the brothers of Jesus were the lawful issue of Joseph and Mary A devout respect for the virginity of the mother of God suggested to the Gnostics and afterwards to the orthodox Greeks the expedient of bestowing a second wife on Joseph The Latins from the time of Jerome improved on that hint asserted the perpetual celibacy of Joseph and justified by many similar examples the new interpretation that Jude as well as Simon and James who were styled the brothers of Jesus Christ were only his first cousins See Tillemont Mem Ecclesiat tom i part iii and Beausobre Hist Critique

taken from Hegesippus But although the obscurity of the house of David might protect them from the suspicions of a tyrant the present greatness of his own family alarmed the pusillanimous temper of Domitian which could only be appeased by the blood of those Romans whom he either feared or hated or esteemed Of the two sons of his uncle Flavius Sabinus fifty one the elder was soon convicted of treasonable intentions and the younger who bore the name of Flavius Clemens was indebted for his safety to his want of courage and ability fifty two The emperor for a long time distinguished so harmless a kinsman by his favor and protection bestowed on him his own niece Domitilla adopted the children of that marriage to the hope of the succession and invested their father with the honors of the consulship Footnote fifty one See the death and character of Sabinus in Tacitus Hist iii seventy four Sabinus was the elder brother and till the accession of Vespasian had been considered as the principal support of the Flavium family Footnote fifty two Flavium Clementem patruelem suum contemptissimoe inertice ex tenuissima suspicione interemit Sueton in Domitian c fifteen But he had scarcely finished the term of his annual magistracy when on a slight pretence he was condemned and executed Domitilla was banished to a desolate island on the coast of Campania fifty three and sentences either of death or of confiscation were pronounced against a great number of who were involved in the same accusation The guilt imputed to their charge was that of Atheism and Jewish manners fifty four a singular association of ideas which cannot with any propriety be applied except to the Christians as they were obscurely and imperfectly viewed by the magistrates and by the writers of that period On the strength of so probable an interpretation and too eagerly admitting the suspicions of a tyrant as an evidence of their honorable crime the church has placed both Clemens and Domitilla among its first martyrs and has branded the cruelty of Domitian with the name of the second persecution But this persecution if it deserves that epithet was of no long duration A few months after the death of Clemens and the banishment of Domitilla Stephen a freedman belonging to the latter who had enjoyed the favor but who had not surely embraced the faith of his mistress fifty foura assassinated the emperor in his palace fifty five The memory of Domitian was condemned by the senate his acts were rescinded his exiles recalled and under the gentle administration of Nerva while the innocent were restored to their rank and fortunes even the most guilty either obtained pardon or escaped punishment fifty six Footnote fifty three The Isle of Pandataria according to Dion Bruttius Praesens apud Euseb iii eighteen banishes her to that of Pontia which was not far distant from the other That difference and a mistake either of Eusebius or of his transcribers have given occasion to suppose two

it is probable that he collected this account was the correspondent of Pliny Epistol vii three we may consider him as a contemporary writer Footnote fifty foura This is an uncandid sarcasm There is

Philostratus in Vit Apollon l viii Footnote fifty six Dion l lxviii p eleven eighteen Plin Epistol iv twenty two II About ten years afterwards under the reign of Trajan the younger Pliny was intrusted by his friend and master with the government of Bithynia and Pontus He soon found himself at a loss to determine by what rule of justice or of law he should direct his conduct in the execution of an office the most repugnant to his humanity Pliny had never assisted at any judicial proceedings against the Christians with whose name alone he seems to be acquainted and he was totally uninformed with regard to the nature of their guilt the method of their conviction and the degree of their punishment In this perplexity he had recourse to his usual expedient of submitting to the wisdom of Trajan an impartial and in some respects a favorable account of the new superstition requesting the emperor that he would condescend to resolve his doubts and to instruct his ignorance fifty seven The life of Pliny had been employed in the acquisition of learning and in the business of the world Since the age of nineteen he had pleaded with distinction in the tribunals of Rome fifty eight filled a place in the senate had been invested with the honors of the consulship and had formed very numerous connections with every order of men both in Italy and in the provinces From his ignorance therefore we may derive some useful information We may assure ourselves that when he accepted the government of Bithynia there were no general laws or decrees of the senate in force against the Christians that neither Trajan nor any of his virtuous predecessors whose edicts were received into the civil and criminal jurisprudence had publicly declared their intentions concerning the new sect and that whatever proceedings had been carried on against the Christians there were none of sufficient weight and authority to establish a precedent for the conduct of a Roman magistrate Footnote fifty seven Plin

Lardner s suspicions see Jewish and Heathen Testimonies vol ii p forty six I am unable to discover any bigotry in his language or proceedings Note Yet the humane Pliny put two female attendants

Towards The Christians From Nero To Constantine Part III The answer of Trajan to which the Christians of the succeeding age have frequently appealed discovers as much regard for justice and humanity as could be reconciled with his mistaken notions of religious policy fifty nine Instead of displaying the implacable zeal of an inquisitor anxious to discover the most minute particles of heresy and exulting in the number of his victims the emperor expresses much more solicitude to protect the security of the innocent than to prevent the escape of the guilty He acknowledged the difficulty of fixing any general plan but he lays down two salutary rules which often afforded relief and support to the distressed Christians Though he directs the magistrates to punish such persons as are legally convicted he prohibits them with a very humane inconsistency from making any inquiries concerning the supposed criminals Nor was the magistrate allowed to proceed on every kind of information Anonymous charges the emperor rejects as too repugnant to the equity of his government and he strictly requires for the conviction of those to whom the guilt of Christianity is imputed the positive evidence of a fair and open accuser It is likewise probable that the persons who assumed so invidiuous an office were obliged to declare the grounds of their suspicions to specify both in respect to time and place the secret assemblies which their Christian adversary had frequented and to disclose a great number of circumstances which were concealed with the most vigilant jealousy from the eye of the profane If they succeeded in their prosecution they were exposed to the resentment of a considerable and active party to the censure of the more liberal portion of mankind and to the ignominy which in every age and country has attended the character of an informer If on the contrary they failed in their proofs they incurred the severe and perhaps capital penalty which according to a law published by the emperor Hadrian was inflicted on those who falsely attributed to their fellow citizens the crime of Christianity The violence of personal or superstitious animosity might sometimes prevail over the most natural apprehensions of disgrace and danger but it cannot surely be imagined that accusations of so unpromising an appearance were either lightly or frequently undertaken by the Pagan subjects of the Roman empire sixty sixtya Footnote fifty nine Plin Epist x ninety eight Tertullian Apolog c five considers this rescript as a relaxation of the ancient penal laws quas Trajanus exparte frustratus est and yet Tertullian in another part of his Apology exposes the inconsistency of prohibiting inquiries and enjoining punishments Footnote sixty Eusebius Hist Ecclesiast l iv c

Edict Imp Antonini Tubing seventeen seventy seven in fourto G Neander doubts its authenticity vol i p one hundred fifty two In my opinion the internal evidence is decisive against it M Footnote sixtya The enactment of this law affords strong presumption that accusations of the crime of Christianity were by no means so uncommon nor received with so much mistrust and caution by the ruling authorities as Gibbon would insinuate M The expedient which was employed to elude the prudence of the laws affords a sufficient proof how effectually they disappointed the mischievous designs of private malice or superstitious zeal In a large and tumultuous assembly the restraints of fear and shame so forcible on the minds of individuals are deprived of the greatest part of their influence The pious Christian as he was desirous to obtain or to escape the glory of martyrdom expected either with impatience or with terror the stated returns of the public games and festivals On those occasions the inhabitants of the great cities of the empire were collected in the circus or the theatre where every circumstance of the place as well as of the ceremony contributed to kindle their devotion and to extinguish their humanity Whilst the numerous spectators crowned with garlands perfumed with incense purified with the blood of victims and surrounded with the altars and statues of their tutelar deities resigned themselves to the enjoyment of pleasures which they considered as an essential part of their religious worship they recollected that the Christians alone abhorred the gods of mankind and by their absence and melancholy on these solemn festivals seemed to insult or to lament the public felicity If the empire had been afflicted by any recent calamity by a plague a famine or an unsuccessful war if the Tyber had or if the Nile had not risen beyond its banks if the earth had shaken or if the temperate order of the seasons had been interrupted the superstitious Pagans were convinced that the crimes and the impiety of the Christians who were spared by the excessive lenity of the government had at length provoked the divine justice It was not among a licentious and exasperated populace that the forms of legal proceedings could be observed it was not in an amphitheatre stained with the blood of wild beasts and gladiators that the voice of compassion could be heard The impatient clamors of the multitude denounced the Christians as the enemies of gods and men doomed them to the severest tortures and venturing to accuse by name some of the most distinguished of the new sectaries required with irresistible vehemence that they should be instantly apprehended and cast to the lions sixty one The provincial governors and magistrates who presided in the public spectacles were usually inclined to gratify the inclinations and to appease the rage of the people by the sacrifice of a few obnoxious victims But the wisdom of the emperors protected the church from the danger of these tumultuous clamors and irregular accusations which they justly censured as repugnant both to the firmness and to the equity of their administration The edicts of Hadrian and of Antoninus Pius expressly declared that the voice of the multitude should never be admitted as legal evidence to convict or to punish those unfortunate persons who had embraced the enthusiasm of the Christians sixty two Footnote sixty one See Tertullian Apolog c forty The acts of the martyrdom of Polycarp exhibit a lively picture of these tumults which were usually fomented by the malice of the Jews Footnote sixty two These regulations are inserted in the above mentioned document of Hadrian and Pius See the apology of Melito apud Euseb l iv twenty six III Punishment was not the inevitable consequence of conviction and the Christians whose guilt was the most clearly proved by the testimony of witnesses or even by their voluntary confession still retained in their own power the alternative of life or death It was not so much the past offence as the actual resistance which excited the indignation of the magistrate He was persuaded that he offered them an easy pardon since if they consented to cast a few grains of incense upon the altar they were dismissed from the tribunal in safety and with applause It was esteemed the duty of a humane judge to endeavor to reclaim rather than to punish those deluded enthusiasts Varying his tone according to the age the sex or the situation of the prisoners he frequently condescended to set before their eyes every circumstance which could render life more pleasing or death more terrible and to solicit nay to entreat them that they would show some compassion to themselves to their families and to their friends sixty three If threats and persuasions proved ineffectual he had often recourse to violence the scourge and the rack were called in to supply the deficiency of argument and every art of cruelty was employed to subdue such inflexible and as it appeared to the Pagans such criminal obstinacy The ancient apologists of Christianity have censured with equal truth and severity the irregular conduct of their persecutors who contrary to every principle of judicial proceeding admitted the use of torture in order to obtain not a confession but a denial of the crime which was the object of their inquiry sixty four The monks of succeeding ages who in their peaceful solitudes entertained themselves with diversifying the deaths and sufferings of the primitive martyrs have frequently invented torments of a much more refined and ingenious nature In particular it has pleased them to suppose that the zeal of the Roman magistrates disdaining every consideration of moral virtue or public decency endeavored to seduce those whom they were unable to vanquish and that by their orders the most brutal violence was offered to those whom they found it impossible to seduce It is related that females who were prepared to despise death were sometimes condemned to a more severe trial sixty foura and called upon to determine whether they set a higher value on their religion or on their chastity The youths to whose licentious embraces they were abandoned received a solemn exhortation from the judge to exert their most strenuous efforts to maintain the honor of Venus against the impious virgin who refused to burn incense on her altars Their violence however was commonly disappointed and the seasonable interposition of some miraculous power preserved the chaste spouses of Christ from the dishonor even of an involuntary defeat We should not indeed neglect to remark that the more ancient as well as authentic memorials of the church are seldom polluted with these extravagant and indecent fictions sixty five Footnote sixty three See the rescript of Trajan and the conduct of Pliny The most authentic acts of the martyrs abound in these exhortations Note Pliny s test was the worship of the gods offerings to the statue of the emperor and blaspheming Christ praeterea maledicerent Christo M Footnote sixty four In particular see Tertullian Apolog c two three and Lactantius Institut Divin v nine Their reasonings are almost the same but we may discover that one of these apologists had been a lawyer and the other a rhetorician Footnote sixty foura The more ancient as well as authentic memorials of the church relate many examples of the fact of these severe trials which there is nothing to contradict Tertullian among others says Nam proxime ad lenonem damnando Christianam potius quam ad leonem confessi estis labem pudicitiae apud nos atrociorem omni poena et omni morte reputari Apol cap ult Eusebius likewise says Other virgins dragged to brothels have lost their life rather than defile their virtue Euseb Hist Ecc viii fourteen G The miraculous interpositions were the offspring of the coarse imaginations of the monks M Footnote sixty five See two instances of this kind of torture in the Acta Sincere Martyrum published by Ruinart p one hundred sixty three hundred ninety nine Jerome in his Legend of Paul the Hermit tells a strange story of a young man who was chained naked on a bed of flowers and assaulted by a beautiful and wanton courtesan He quelled the rising temptation by biting off his tongue The total disregard of truth and probability in the representation of these primitive martyrdoms was occasioned by a very natural mistake The ecclesiastical writers of the fourth or fifth centuries ascribed to the magistrates of Rome the same degree of implacable and unrelenting zeal which filled their own breasts against the heretics or the idolaters of their own times It is not improbable that some of those persons who were raised to the dignities of the empire might have imbibed the prejudices of the populace and that the cruel disposition of others might occasionally be stimulated by motives of avarice or of personal resentment sixty six But it is certain and we may appeal to the grateful confessions of the first Christians that the greatest part of those magistrates who exercised in the provinces the authority of the emperor or of the senate and to whose hands alone the jurisdiction of life and death was intrusted behaved like men of polished manners and liberal education who respected the rules of justice and who were conversant with the precepts of philosophy They frequently declined the odious task of persecution dismissed the charge with contempt or suggested to the accused Christian some legal evasion by which he might elude the severity of the laws sixty seven Whenever they were invested with a discretionary power sixty eight they used it much less for the oppression than for the relief and benefit of the afflicted church They were far from condemning all the Christians who were accused before their tribunal and very far from punishing with death all those who were convicted of an obstinate adherence to the new superstition Contenting themselves for the most part with the milder chastisements of imprisonment exile or slavery in the mines sixty nine they left the unhappy victims of their justice some reason to hope that a prosperous event the accession the marriage or the triumph of an emperor might speedily restore them by a general pardon to their former state The martyrs devoted to immediate execution by the Roman magistrates appear to have been selected from the most opposite extremes They were either bishops and presbyters the persons the most distinguished among the Christians by their rank and influence and whose example might strike terror into the whole sect seventy or else they were the meanest and most abject among them particularly those of the servile condition whose lives were esteemed of little value and whose sufferings were viewed by the ancients with too careless an indifference seventy one The learned Origen who from his experience as well as reading was intimately acquainted with the history of the Christians declares in the most express terms that the number of martyrs was very inconsiderable seventy two His authority would alone be sufficient to annihilate that formidable army of martyrs whose relics drawn for the most part from the catacombs of Rome have replenished so many churches seventy three and whose marvellous achievements have been the subject of so many volumes of Holy Romance seventy four But the general assertion of Origen may be explained and confirmed by the particular testimony of his friend Dionysius who in the immense city of Alexandria and under the rigorous persecution of Decius reckons only ten men and seven women who suffered for the profession of the Christian name seventy five Footnote sixty six The conversion of his wife provoked Claudius Herminianus governor of Cappadocia to treat the Christians with uncommon severity Tertullian ad Scapulam c three Footnote sixty seven Tertullian in his epistle to the governor of Africa mentions several remarkable instances of lenity and forbearance which had happened within his knowledge Footnote sixty eight Neque enim in universum aliquid quod quasi certam formam habeat constitui potest an expression of Trajan which gave a very great latitude to the governors of provinces Note Gibbon altogether forgets that Trajan fully approved of the course pursued by Pliny That course was to order all who persevered in their faith to be led to execution perseverantes duci jussi M Footnote sixty nine In Metalla damnamur in insulas relegamur Tertullian Apolog c twelve The mines of Numidia contained nine bishops with a proportionable number of their clergy and people to whom Cyprian addressed a pious epistle of praise and comfort See Cyprian Epistol seventy six seventy seven Footnote seventy Though we cannot receive with entire confidence either the epistles or the acts of Ignatius they may be found in the twod volume of the Apostolic Fathers yet we may quote that bishop of Antioch as one of these exemplary martyrs He was sent in chains to Rome as a public spectacle and when he arrived at Troas he received the pleasing intelligence that the persecution of Antioch was already at an end Note The acts of Ignatius are generally received as authentic as are seven of his letters Eusebius and saint Jerome mention them there are two editions in one the letters are longer and many passages appear to have been interpolated the other edition is that which contains the real letters of saint Ignatius such at least is the opinion of the wisest and most enlightened critics See Lardner Cred of Gospel Hist Less uber dis Religion v i p five hundred twenty nine Usser Diss de Ign Epist Pearson Vindic Ignatianae It should be remarked that it was under the reign of Trajan that the bishop Ignatius was carried from Antioch to Rome to be exposed to the lions in the amphitheatre the year of J C one hundred seven according to some of one hundred sixteen according to others G

Perpetua two were of a servile and two others of a very mean condition Footnote seventy two Origen advers Celsum l iii p one hundred sixteen His words deserve to be transcribed Note The words that follow should be quoted God not permitting that all his class of men should be exterminated which appears to indicate that Origen thought the number put to death inconsiderable only when compared to the numbers who had survived Besides this he is speaking of the state of the religion under Caracalla Elagabalus Alexander Severus and Philip who had not persecuted the Christians It was during the reign of the latter that Origen wrote his books against Celsus G Footnote seventy three If we recollect that all the Plebeians of Rome were not Christians and that all the Christians were not saints and martyrs we may judge with how much safety religious honors can be ascribed to bones or urns indiscriminately taken from the public burial place After ten centuries of a very free and open trade some suspicions have arisen among the more learned Catholics They now require as a proof of sanctity and martyrdom the letters B M a vial full of red liquor supposed to be blood or the figure of a palm tree But the two former signs are of little weight and with regard to the last it is observed by the critics one That the figure as it is called of a palm is perhaps a cypress and perhaps only a stop the flourish of a comma used in the monumental inscriptions two That the palm was the symbol of victory among the Pagans three That among the Christians it served as the emblem not only of martyrdom but in general of a joyful resurrection See the epistle of P Mabillon on the worship of unknown saints and Muratori sopra le Antichita Italiane Dissertat lviii Footnote seventy four As a specimen of these legends we may be satisfied with ten thousand Christian soldiers crucified in one day either by Trajan or Hadrian on Mount Ararat See Baronius ad Martyrologium Romanum Tille mont Mem Ecclesiast tom ii part ii p four hundred thirty eight and Geddes s Miscellanies vol ii p two hundred three The abbreviation of Mil which may signify either soldiers or thousands is said to have occasioned some extraordinary mistakes Footnote seventy five Dionysius ap Euseb l vi c forty one One of the seventeen was likewise accused of robbery Note Gibbon ought to have said was falsely accused of robbery for so it is in the Greek text This Christian named Nemesion falsely accused of robbery before the centurion was acquitted of a crime altogether foreign to his character but he was led before the governor as guilty of being a Christian and the governor inflicted upon him a double torture Euseb loc cit It must be added that Saint Dionysius only makes particular mention of the principal martyrs this is very doubtful M and that he says in general that the fury of the Pagans against the Christians gave to Alexandria the appearance of a city taken by storm This refers to plunder and ill usage not to actual slaughter M Finally it should be observed that Origen wrote before the persecution of the emperor Decius G During the same period of persecution the zealous the eloquent the ambitious Cyprian governed the church not only of Carthage but even of Africa He possessed every quality which could engage the reverence of the faithful or provoke the suspicions and resentment of the Pagan magistrates His character as well as his station seemed to mark out that holy prelate as the most distinguished object of envy and danger seventy six The experience however of the life of Cyprian is sufficient to prove that our fancy has exaggerated the perilous situation of a Christian bishop and the dangers to which he was exposed were less imminent than those which temporal ambition is always prepared to encounter in the pursuit of honors Four Roman emperors with their families their favorites and their adherents perished by the sword in the space of ten years during which the bishop of Carthage guided by his authority and eloquence the councils of the African church It was only in the third year of his administration that he had reason during a few months to apprehend the severe edicts of Decius the vigilance of the magistrate and the clamors of the multitude who loudly demanded that Cyprian the leader of the Christians should be thrown to the lions Prudence suggested the necessity of a temporary retreat and the voice of prudence was obeyed He withdrew himself into an obscure solitude from whence he could maintain a constant correspondence with the clergy and people of Carthage and concealing himself till the tempest was past he preserved his life without relinquishing either his power or his reputation His extreme caution did not however escape the censure of the more rigid Christians who lamented or the reproaches of his personal enemies who insulted a conduct which they considered as a pusillanimous and criminal desertion of the most sacred duty seventy seven The propriety of reserving himself for the future exigencies of the church the example of several holy bishops seventy eight and the divine admonitions which as he declares himself he frequently received in visions and ecstacies were the reasons alleged in his justification seventy nine But his best apology may be found in the cheerful resolution with which about eight years afterwards he suffered death in the cause of religion The authentic history of his martyrdom has been recorded with unusual candor and impartiality A short abstract therefore of its most important circumstances will convey the clearest information of the spirit and of the forms of the Roman persecutions eighty Footnote seventy six The letters of Cyprian exhibit a very curious and original picture both of the man and of the times See likewise the two lives of Cyprian composed with equal accuracy though with very different views the one by Le Clerc Bibliotheque Universelle tom

Footnote seventy nine See Cyprian Epist sixteen and his life by Pontius Footnote eighty We have an original life of Cyprian by the deacon Pontius the companion of his exile and the spectator of his death and we likewise possess the ancient proconsular acts of his martyrdom These two relations are consistent with each other and with probability and what is somewhat remarkable they are both unsullied by any miraculous circumstances Chapter XVI Conduct Towards The Christians From Nero To Constantine Part IV When Valerian was consul for the third and Gallienus for the fourth time Paternus proconsul of Africa summoned Cyprian to appear in his private council chamber He there acquainted him with the Imperial mandate which he had just received eighty one that those who had abandoned the Roman religion should immediately return to the practice of the ceremonies of their ancestors Cyprian replied without hesitation that he was a Christian and a bishop devoted to the worship of the true and only Deity to whom he offered up his daily supplications for the safety and prosperity of the two emperors his lawful sovereigns With modest confidence he pleaded the privilege of a citizen in refusing to give any answer to some invidious and indeed illegal questions which the proconsul had proposed A sentence of banishment was pronounced as the penalty of Cyprian s disobedience and he was conducted without delay to Curubis a free and maritime city of Zeugitania in a pleasant situation a fertile territory and at the distance of about forty miles from Carthage eighty two The exiled bishop enjoyed the conveniences of life and the consciousness of virtue His reputation was diffused over Africa and Italy an account of his behavior was published for the edification of the Christian world eighty three and his solitude was frequently interrupted by the letters the visits and the congratulations of the faithful On the arrival of a new proconsul in the province the fortune of Cyprian appeared for some time to wear a still more favorable aspect He was recalled from banishment and though not yet permitted to return to Carthage his own gardens in the neighborhood of the capital were assigned for the place of his residence eighty four Footnote eighty one It should seem that these were circular orders sent at the same time to all the governors Dionysius ap Euseb l vii c eleven relates the history of his own banishment from Alexandria almost in the same manner But as he escaped and survived the persecution we must account him either more or less fortunate than Cyprian Footnote eighty two See Plin Hist Natur v three Cellarius Geograph Antiq part iii p ninety six Shaw s Travels p ninety and for the adjacent country which is terminated by Cape Bona or the

promissum est qui regnum et justitiam Dei quaerunt Footnote eighty three See Cyprian Epistol seventy seven edit Fell Footnote eighty four Upon his conversion he had sold those gardens for the benefit of the poor The indulgence of God most probably the liberality of some Christian friend restored them to Cyprian See Pontius c fifteen At length exactly one year eighty five after Cyprian was first apprehended Galerius Maximus proconsul of Africa received the Imperial warrant for the execution of the Christian teachers The bishop of Carthage was sensible that he should be singled out for one of the first victims and the frailty of nature tempted him to withdraw himself by a secret flight from the danger and the honor of martyrdom eighty fivea but soon recovering that fortitude which his character required he returned to his gardens and patiently expected the ministers of death Two officers of rank who were intrusted with that commission placed Cyprian between them in a chariot and as the proconsul was not then at leisure they conducted him not to a prison but to a private house in Carthage which belonged to one of them An elegant supper was provided for the entertainment of the bishop and his Christian friends were permitted for the last time to enjoy his society whilst the streets were filled with a multitude of the faithful anxious and alarmed at the approaching fate of their spiritual father eighty six In the morning he appeared before the tribunal of the proconsul who after informing himself of the name and situation of Cyprian commanded him to offer sacrifice and pressed him to reflect on the consequences of his disobedience The refusal of Cyprian was firm and decisive and the magistrate when he had taken the opinion of his council pronounced with some reluctance the sentence of death It was conceived in the following terms That Thascius Cyprianus should be immediately beheaded as the enemy of the gods of Rome and as the chief and ringleader of a criminal association which he had seduced into an impious resistance against the laws of the most holy emperors Valerian and Gallienus eighty seven The manner of his execution was the mildest and least painful that could be inflicted on a person convicted of any capital offence nor was the use of torture admitted to obtain from the bishop of Carthage either the recantation of his principles or the discovery of his accomplices Footnote eighty five When Cyprian a twelvemonth before was sent into exile he dreamt that he should be put to death the next day The event made it necessary to explain that word as signifying a year Pontius c twelve Footnote eighty fivea This was not as it appears the motive which induced saint Cyprian to conceal himself for a short time he was threatened to be carried to Utica he preferred remaining at Carthage in order to suffer martyrdom in the midst of his flock and in order that his death might conduce to the edification of those whom he had guided during life Such at least is his own explanation of his conduct in one of his letters Cum perlatum ad nos fuisset fratres carissimi frumentarios esse missos qui me Uticam per ducerent consilioque carissimorum persuasum est ut de hortis interim recederemus justa interveniente causa consensi eo quod congruat episcopum in ea civitate in qua Ecclesiae dominicae praeest illie Dominum confiteri et plebem universam praepositi praesentis confessione clarificari Ep eighty three G Footnote eighty six Pontius c fifteen acknowledges that Cyprian with whom he supped passed the night custodia delicata The bishop exercised a last and very proper act of jurisdiction by directing that the younger females who watched in the streets should be removed from the dangers and temptations of a nocturnal crowd Act Preconsularia c two Footnote eighty seven See the original sentence in the Acts c four and in Pontius c seventeen The latter expresses it in a more rhetorical manner As soon as the sentence was proclaimed a general cry of We will die with him arose at once among the listening multitude of Christians who waited before the palace gates The generous effusions of their zeal and their affection were neither serviceable to Cyprian nor dangerous to themselves He was led away under a guard of tribunes and centurions without resistance and without insult to the place of his execution a spacious and level plain near the city which was already filled with great numbers of spectators His faithful presbyters and deacons were permitted to accompany their holy bishop eighty sevena They assisted him in laying aside his upper garment spread linen on the ground to catch the precious relics of his blood and received his orders to bestow five and twenty pieces of gold on the executioner The martyr then covered his face with his hands and at one blow his head was separated from his body His corpse remained during some hours exposed to the curiosity of the Gentiles but in the night it was removed and transported in a triumphal procession and with a splendid illumination to the burial place of the Christians The funeral of Cyprian was publicly celebrated without receiving any interruption from the Roman magistrates and those among the faithful who had performed the last offices to his person and his memory were secure from the danger of inquiry or of punishment It is remarkable that of so great a multitude of bishops in the province of Africa Cyprian was the first who was esteemed worthy to obtain the crown of martyrdom eighty eight Footnote eighty sevena There is nothing in the life of saint Cyprian by Pontius nor in the ancient manuscripts which can make us suppose that the presbyters and deacons in their clerical character and known to be such had the permission to attend their holy bishop Setting aside all religious considerations it is impossible not to be surprised at the kind of complaisance with which the historian here insists in favor of the persecutors on some mitigating circumstances allowed at the death of a man whose only crime was maintaining his own opinions with frankness and courage G Footnote eighty eight Pontius c nineteen M de Tillemont Memoires tom iv part i p four hundred fifty note fifty is not pleased with so positive an exclusion of any former martyr of the episcopal rank Note M de Tillemont as an honest writer explains the difficulties which he felt about the text of Pontius and concludes by distinctly stating that without doubt there is some mistake and that Pontius must have meant only Africa Minor or Carthage for saint Cyprian in his fifty eighth sixty ninth letter addressed to Pupianus speaks expressly of many bishops his colleagues qui proscripti sunt vel apprehensi in carcere et catenis fuerunt aut qui in exilium relegati illustri itinere ed Dominum profecti sunt aut qui quibusdam locis animadversi coeleses coronas de Domini clarificatione sumpserunt G It was in the choice of Cyprian either to die a martyr or to live an apostate but on the choice depended the alternative of honor or infamy Could we suppose that the bishop of Carthage had employed the profession of the Christian faith only as the instrument of his avarice or ambition it was still incumbent on him to support the character he had assumed eighty nine and if he possessed the smallest degree of manly fortitude rather to expose himself to the most cruel tortures than by a single act to exchange the reputation of a whole life for the abhorrence of his Christian brethren and the contempt of the Gentile world But if the zeal of Cyprian was supported by the sincere conviction of the truth of those doctrines which he preached the crown of martyrdom must have appeared to him as an object of desire rather than of terror It is not easy to extract any distinct ideas from the vague though eloquent declamations of the Fathers or to ascertain the degree of immortal glory and happiness which they confidently promised to those who were so fortunate as to shed their blood in the cause of religion ninety They inculcated with becoming diligence that the fire of martyrdom supplied every defect and expiated every sin that while the souls of ordinary Christians were obliged to pass through a slow and painful purification the triumphant sufferers entered into the immediate fruition of eternal bliss where in the society of the patriarchs the apostles and the prophets they reigned with Christ and acted as his assessors in the universal judgment of mankind The assurance of a lasting reputation upon earth a motive so congenial to the vanity of human nature often served to animate the courage of the martyrs The honors which Rome or Athens bestowed on those citizens who had fallen in the cause of their country were cold and unmeaning demonstrations of respect when compared with the ardent gratitude and devotion which the primitive church expressed towards the victorious champions of the faith The annual commemoration of their virtues and sufferings was observed as a sacred ceremony and at length terminated in religious worship Among the Christians who had publicly confessed their religious principles those who as it very frequently happened had been dismissed from the tribunal or the prisons of the Pagan magistrates obtained such honors as were justly due to their imperfect martyrdom and their generous resolution The most pious females courted the permission of imprinting kisses on the fetters which they had worn and on the wounds which they had received Their persons were esteemed holy their decisions were admitted with deference and they too often abused by their spiritual pride and licentious manners the preeminence which their zeal and intrepidity had acquired ninety one Distinctions like these whilst they display the exalted merit betray the inconsiderable number of those who suffered and of those who died for the profession of Christianity Footnote eighty nine Whatever opinion we may entertain of the character or principles of Thomas Becket we must acknowledge that he suffered death with a constancy not unworthy of the primitive martyrs See Lord Lyttleton s History of Henry II vol ii p five hundred ninety two c Footnote ninety See in particular the treatise of Cyprian de Lapsis p eighty seven ninety eight edit Fell The learning of Dodwell Dissertat Cyprianic xii xiii and the ingenuity of Middleton Free Inquiry p one hundred sixty two c have left scarcely any thing to add concerning the merit the honors and the motives of the martyrs Footnote ninety one Cyprian Epistol five six seven twenty two twenty four and de Unitat Ecclesiae The number of pretended martyrs has been very much multiplied by the custom which was introduced of bestowing that honorable name on confessors Note M Guizot denies that the letters of Cyprian to which he refers bear out the statement in the text I cannot scruple to admit the accuracy of Gibbon s quotation To take only the fifth letter we find this passage Doleo enim quando audio quosdam improbe et insolenter discurrere et ad ineptian vel ad discordias vacare Christi membra et jam Christum confessa per concubitus illicitos inquinari nec a diaconis aut presbyteris regi posse sed id agere ut per paucorum pravos et malos mores multorum et bonorum confessorum gloria honesta maculetur Gibbon s misrepresentation lies in the ambiguous expression too often Were the epistles arranged in a different manner in the edition consulted by M Guizot M The sober discretion of the present age will more readily censure than admire but can more easily admire than imitate the fervor of the first Christians who according to the lively expressions of Sulpicius Severus desired martyrdom with more eagerness than his own contemporaries solicited a bishopric ninety two The epistles which Ignatius composed as he was carried in chains through the cities of Asia breathe sentiments the most repugnant to the ordinary feelings of human nature He earnestly beseeches the Romans that when he should be exposed in the amphitheatre they would not by their kind but unseasonable intercession deprive him of the crown of glory and he declares his resolution to provoke and irritate the wild beasts which might be employed as the instruments of his death ninety three Some stories are related of the courage of martyrs who actually performed what Ignatius had intended who exasperated the fury of the lions pressed the executioner to hasten his office cheerfully leaped into the fires which were kindled to consume them and discovered a sensation of joy and pleasure in the midst of the most exquisite tortures Several examples have been preserved of a zeal impatient of those restraints which the emperors had provided for the security of the church The Christians sometimes supplied by their voluntary declaration the want of an accuser rudely disturbed the public service of paganism ninety four and rushing in crowds round the tribunal of the magistrates called upon them to pronounce and to inflict the sentence of the law The behavior of the Christians was too remarkable to escape the notice of the ancient philosophers but they seem to have considered it with much less admiration than astonishment Incapable of conceiving the motives which sometimes transported the fortitude of believers beyond the bounds of prudence or reason they treated such an eagerness to die as the strange result of obstinate despair of stupid insensibility or of superstitious frenzy ninety five Unhappy men exclaimed the proconsul Antoninus to the Christians of Asia unhappy men if you are thus weary of your lives is it so difficult for you to find ropes and precipices ninety six He was extremely cautious as it is observed by a learned and picus historian of punishing men who had found no accusers but themselves the Imperial laws not having made any provision for so unexpected a case condemning therefore a few as a warning to their brethren he dismissed the multitude with indignation and contempt ninety seven Notwithstanding this real or affected disdain the intrepid constancy of the faithful was productive of more salutary effects on those minds which nature or grace had disposed for the easy reception of religious truth On these melancholy occasions there were many among the Gentiles who pitied who admired and who were converted The generous enthusiasm was communicated from the sufferer to the spectators and the blood of martyrs according to a well known observation became the seed of the church Footnote ninety two Certatim gloriosa in certamina ruebatur multique avidius tum martyria gloriosis mortibus quaerebantur quam nunc Episcopatus pravis ambitionibus appetuntur Sulpicius Severus l ii He might have omitted the word nunc Footnote ninety three See Epist ad Roman c four five ap Patres Apostol tom ii p twenty seven It suited the purpose of Bishop Pearson see Vindiciae Ignatianae part ii c nine to justify by a profusion of examples and authorities the sentiments of Ignatius Footnote ninety four The story of Polyeuctes on which Corneille has founded a very beautiful tragedy is one of the most celebrated though not perhaps the most authentic instances of this excessive zeal We should observe that the sixtieth canon of the council of Illiberis refuses the title of martyrs to those who exposed themselves to death by publicly destroying the idols Footnote ninety five See Epictetus l iv c seven though there is some doubt whether he alludes to the Christians Marcus Antoninus de Rebus suis l xi c three Lucian in Peregrin Footnote ninety six Tertullian ad Scapul c five The learned are divided between three persons of the same name who were all proconsuls of Asia I am inclined to ascribe this story to Antoninus Pius who was afterwards emperor and who may have governed Asia under the reign of Trajan Footnote ninety seven Mosheim de Rebus Christ ante Constantin p two hundred thirty five But although devotion had raised and eloquence continued to inflame this fever of the mind it insensibly gave way to the more natural hopes and fears of the human heart to the love of life the apprehension of pain and the horror of dissolution The more prudent rulers of the church found themselves obliged to restrain the indiscreet ardor of their followers and to distrust a constancy which too often abandoned them in the hour of trial ninety eight As the lives of the faithful became less mortified and austere they were every day less ambitious of the honors of martyrdom and the soldiers of Christ instead of distinguishing themselves by voluntary deeds of heroism frequently deserted their post and fled in confusion before the enemy whom it was their duty to resist There were three methods however of escaping the flames of persecution which were not attended with an equal degree of guilt first indeed was generally allowed to be innocent the second was of a doubtful or at least of a venial nature but the third implied a direct and criminal apostasy from the Christian faith Footnote ninety eight See the Epistle of the Church of Smyrna ap Euseb Hist Eccles Liv c fifteen Note The fifteenth chapter of the tenth book of the Eccles History of Eusebius treats principally of the martyrdom of saint Polycarp and mentions some other martyrs A single example of weakness is related it is that of a Phrygian named Quintus who appalled at the sight of the wild beasts and the tortures renounced his faith This example proves little against the mass of Christians and this chapter of Eusebius furnished much stronger evidence of their courage than of their timidity G This Quintus had however rashly and of his own accord appeared before the tribunal and the church of Smyrna condemn his indiscreet ardor coupled as it was with weakness in the hour of trial M I A modern inquisitor would hear with surprise that whenever an information was given to a Roman magistrate of any person within his jurisdiction who had embraced the sect of the Christians the charge was communicated to the party accused and that a convenient time was allowed him to settle his domestic concerns and to prepare an answer to the crime which was imputed to him ninety nine If he entertained any doubt of his own constancy such a delay afforded him the opportunity of preserving his life and honor by flight of withdrawing himself into some obscure retirement or some distant province and of patiently expecting the return of peace and security A measure so consonant to reason was soon authorized by the advice and example of the most holy prelates and seems to have been censured by few except by the Montanists who deviated into heresy by their strict and obstinate adherence to the rigor of ancient discipline one hundred II The provincial governors whose zeal was less prevalent than their avarice had countenanced the practice of selling certificates or libels as they were called which attested that the persons therein mentioned had complied with the laws and sacrificed to the Roman deities By producing these false declarations the opulent and timid Christians were enabled to silence the malice of an informer and to reconcile in some measure their safety with their religion A slight penance atoned for this profane dissimulation one hundred one one hundred onea III In every persecution there were great numbers of unworthy Christians who publicly disowned or renounced the faith which they had professed and who confirmed the sincerity of their abjuration by the legal acts of burning incense or of offering sacrifices Some of these apostates had yielded on the first menace or exhortation of the magistrate whilst the patience of others had been subdued by the length and repetition of tortures The affrighted countenances of some betrayed their inward remorse while others advanced with confidence and alacrity to the altars of the gods one hundred two But the disguise which fear had imposed subsisted no longer than the present danger As soon as the severity of the persecution was abated the doors of the churches were assailed by the returning multitude of penitents who detested their idolatrous submission and who solicited with equal ardor but with various success their readmission into the society of Christians one hundred three one hundred threea Footnote ninety nine In the second apology of Justin there is a particular and very curious instance of this legal delay The same indulgence was granted to accused Christians in the persecution of Decius and Cyprian de Lapsis expressly mentions the Dies negantibus praestitutus Note The examples drawn by the historian from Justin Martyr and Cyprian relate altogether to particular cases and prove nothing as to the general practice adopted towards the accused it is evident on the contrary from the same apology of saint Justin that they hardly ever obtained delay A man named Lucius himself a Christian present at an unjust sentence passed against a Christian by the judge Urbicus asked him why he thus punished a man who was neither adulterer nor robber nor guilty of any other crime but that of avowing himself a Christian Urbicus answered only in these words Thou also hast the appearance of being a Christian Yes without doubt replied Lucius The judge ordered that he should be put to death on the instant A third who came up was condemned to be beaten with rods Here then are three examples where no delay was granted Surely these acts of a single passionate and irritated judge prove the general practice as little as those quoted by Gibbon M There exist a multitude of others such as those of Ptolemy Marcellus c Justin expressly charges the judges with ordering the accused to be executed without hearing the cause The words of saint Cyprian are as particular and simply say that he had appointed a day by which the Christians must have renounced their faith those who had not done it by that time were condemned G This confirms the statement in the text M Footnote one hundred Tertullian considers flight from persecution as an imperfect but very criminal apostasy as an impious attempt to elude the will of God c c He has written a treatise on this subject see p five hundred thirty six five hundred forty four edit Rigalt which is filled with the wildest fanaticism and the most incoherent declamation It is however somewhat remarkable that Tertullian did not suffer martyrdom himself Footnote one hundred one The libellatici who are chiefly known by the writings of Cyprian are described with the utmost precision in the copious commentary of Mosheim p four hundred eighty three four hundred eighty nine Footnote one hundred onea The penance was not so slight for it was exactly the same with that of apostates who had sacrificed to idols it lasted several years See Fleun Hist Ecc v ii p one hundred seventy one G Footnote one hundred two Plin Epist x ninety seven Dionysius Alexandrin ap Euseb l vi c forty one Ad prima statim verba minantis inimici maximus fratrum numerus fidem suam prodidit nec prostratus est persecutionis impetu sed voluntario lapsu seipsum prostravit Cyprian Opera p eighty nine Among these deserters were many priests and even bishops Footnote one hundred three It was on this occasion that Cyprian wrote his treatise De Lapsis and many of his epistles The controversy concerning the treatment of penitent apostates does not occur among the Christians of the preceding century Shall we ascribe this to the superiority of their faith and courage or to our less intimate knowledge of their history Footnote one hundred threea Pliny says that the greater part of the Christians persisted in avowing themselves to be so the reason for his consulting Trajan was the periclitantium numerus Eusebius l vi c forty one does not permit us to doubt that the number of those who renounced their faith was infinitely below the number of those who boldly confessed it The prefect he says and his assessors present at the council were alarmed at seeing the crowd of Christians the judges themselves trembled Lastly saint Cyprian informs us that the greater part of those who had appeared weak brethren in the persecution of Decius signalized their courage in that of Gallius Steterunt fortes et ipso dolore poenitentiae facti ad praelium fortiores Epist lx p one hundred forty two G IV Notwithstanding the general rules established for the conviction and punishment of the Christians the fate of those sectaries in an extensive and arbitrary government must still in a great measure have depended on their own behavior the circumstances of the times and the temper of their supreme as well as subordinate rulers Zeal might sometimes provoke and prudence might sometimes avert or assuage the superstitious fury of the Pagans A variety of motives might dispose the provincial governors either to enforce or to relax the execution of the laws and of these motives the most forcible was their regard not only for the public edicts but for the secret intentions of the emperor a glance from whose eye was sufficient to kindle or to extinguish the flames of persecution As often as any occasional severities were exercised in the different parts of the empire the primitive Christians lamented and perhaps magnified their own sufferings but the celebrated number of ten persecutions has been determined by the ecclesiastical writers of the fifth century who possessed a more distinct view of the prosperous or adverse fortunes of the church from the age of Nero to that of Diocletian The ingenious parallels of the ten plagues of Egypt and of the ten horns of the Apocalypse first suggested this calculation to their minds and in their application of the faith of prophecy to the truth of history they were careful to select those reigns which were indeed the most hostile to the Christian cause one hundred four But these transient persecutions served only to revive the zeal and to restore the discipline of the faithful and the moments of extraordinary rigor were compensated by much longer intervals of peace and security The indifference of some princes and the indulgence of others permitted the Christians to enjoy though not perhaps a legal yet an actual and public toleration of their religion Footnote one hundred four See Mosheim p ninety seven Sulpicius Severus was the first author of this computation though he seemed desirous of reserving the tenth and greatest persecution for the coming of the Antichrist Chapter XVI Conduct Towards The Christians From Nero To Constantine Part V The apology of Tertullian contains two very ancient very singular but at the same time very suspicious instances of Imperial clemency the edicts published by Tiberius and by Marcus Antoninus and designed not only to protect the innocence of the Christians but even to proclaim those stupendous miracles which had attested the truth of their doctrine The first of these examples is attended with some difficulties which might perplex a sceptical mind one hundred five We are required to believe that Pontius Pilate informed the emperor of the unjust sentence of death which he had pronounced against an innocent and as it appeared a divine person and that without acquiring the merit he exposed himself to the danger of martyrdom that Tiberius who avowed his contempt for all religion immediately conceived the design of placing the Jewish Messiah among the gods of Rome that his servile senate ventured to disobey the commands of their master that Tiberius instead of resenting their refusal contented himself with protecting the Christians from the severity of the laws many years before such laws were enacted or before the church had assumed any distinct name or existence and lastly that the memory of this extraordinary transaction was preserved in the most public and authentic records which escaped the knowledge of the historians of Greece and Rome and were only visible to the eyes of an African Christian who composed his apology one hundred and sixty years after the death of Tiberius The edict of Marcus Antoninus is supposed to have been the effect of his devotion and gratitude for the miraculous deliverance which he had obtained in the Marcomannic war The distress of the legions the seasonable tempest of rain and hail of thunder and of lightning and the dismay and defeat of the barbarians have been celebrated by the eloquence of several Pagan writers If there were any Christians in that army it was natural that they should ascribe some merit to the fervent prayers which in the moment of danger they had offered up for their own and the public safety But we are still assured by monuments of brass and marble by the Imperial medals and by the Antonine column that neither the prince nor the people entertained any sense of this signal obligation since they unanimously attribute their deliverance to the providence of Jupiter and to the interposition of Mercury During the whole course of his reign Marcus despised the Christians as a philosopher and punished them as a sovereign one hundred six one hundred sixa Footnote one hundred five The testimony given by Pontius Pilate is first mentioned by Justin The successive improvements which the story acquired as if has passed through the hands of Tertullian Eusebius Epiphanius Chrysostom Orosius Gregory of Tours and the authors of the several editions of the acts of Pilate are very fairly stated by Dom Calmet Dissertat sur l Ecriture tom iii p six hundred fifty one c Footnote one hundred six On this miracle as it is commonly called of the thundering legion see the admirable criticism of mister Moyle in his Works vol ii p eighty one three hundred ninety Footnote one hundred sixa Gibbon with this phrase and that below which admits the injustice of Marcus has dexterously glossed over one of the most remarkable facts in the early Christian history that the reign of the wisest and most humane of the heathen emperors was the most fatal to the Christians Most writers have ascribed the persecutions under Marcus to the latent bigotry of his character Mosheim to the influence of the philosophic party but the fact is admitted by all A late writer mister Waddington Hist of the Church p forty seven has not scrupled to assert that this prince polluted every year of a long reign with innocent blood but the causes as well as the date of the persecutions authorized or permitted by Marcus are equally uncertain Of the Asiatic edict recorded by Melito the date is unknown nor is it quite clear that it was an Imperial edict If it was the act under which Polycarp suffered his martyrdom is placed by Ruinart in the sixth by Mosheim in the ninth year of the reign of Marcus The martyrs of Vienne and Lyons are assigned by Dodwell to the seventh by most writers to the seventeenth In fact the commencement of the persecutions of the Christians appears to synchronize exactly with the period of the breaking out of the Marcomannic war which seems to have alarmed the whole empire and the emperor himself into a paroxysm of returning piety to their gods of which the Christians were the victims See Jul Capit Script Hist August p one hundred eighty one edit sixteen sixty one It is remarkable that Tertullian Apologet c v distinctly asserts that Verus M Aurelius issued no edicts against the Christians and almost positively exempts him from the charge of persecution M This remarkable synchronism which explains the persecutions under M Aurelius is shown at length in Milman s History of Christianity book ii v M eighteen forty five By a singular fatality the hardships which they had endured under the government of a virtuous prince immediately ceased on the accession of a tyrant and as none except themselves had experienced the injustice of Marcus so they alone were protected by the lenity of Commodus The celebrated Marcia the most favored of his concubines and who at length contrived the murder of her Imperial lover entertained a singular affection for the oppressed church and though it was impossible that she could reconcile the practice of vice with the precepts of the gospel she might hope to atone for the frailties of her sex and profession by declaring herself the patroness of the Christians one hundred seven Under the gracious protection of Marcia they passed in safety the thirteen years of a cruel tyranny and when the empire was established in the house of Severus they formed a domestic but more honorable connection with the new court The emperor was persuaded that in a dangerous sickness he had derived some benefit either spiritual or physical from the holy oil with which one of his slaves had anointed him He always treated with peculiar distinction several persons of both sexes who had embraced the new religion The nurse as well as the preceptor of Caracalla were Christians one hundred sevena and if that young prince ever betrayed a sentiment of humanity it was occasioned by an incident which however trifling bore some relation to the cause of Christianity one hundred eight Under the reign of Severus the fury of the populace was checked the rigor of ancient laws was for some time suspended and the provincial governors were satisfied with receiving an annual present from the churches within their jurisdiction as the price or as the reward of their moderation one hundred nine The controversy concerning the precise time of the celebration of Easter armed the bishops of Asia and Italy against each other and was considered as the most important business of this period of leisure and tranquillity one hundred ten Nor was the peace of the church interrupted till the increasing numbers of proselytes seem at length to have attracted the attention and to have alienated the mind of Severus With the design of restraining the progress of Christianity he published an edict which though it was designed to affect only the new converts could not be carried into strict execution without exposing to danger and punishment the most zealous of their teachers and missionaries In this mitigated persecution we may still discover the indulgent spirit of Rome and of Polytheism which so readily admitted every excuse in favor of those who practised the religious ceremonies of their fathers one hundred eleven Footnote one hundred seven Dion Cassius or rather his

enacted soon expired with the authority of that emperor and the Christians after this accidental tempest enjoyed a calm of thirty eight years one hundred twelve Till this period they had usually held their assemblies in private houses and sequestered places They were now permitted to erect and consecrate convenient edifices for the purpose of religious worship one hundred thirteen to purchase lands even at Rome itself for the use of the community and to conduct the elections of their ecclesiastical ministers in so public but at the same time in so exemplary a manner as to deserve the respectful attention of the Gentiles one hundred fourteen This long repose of the church was accompanied with dignity The reigns of those princes who derived their extraction from the Asiatic provinces proved the most favorable to the Christians the eminent persons of the sect instead of being reduced to implore the protection of a slave or concubine were admitted into the palace in the honorable characters of priests and philosophers and their mysterious doctrines which were already diffused among the people insensibly attracted the curiosity of their sovereign When the empress Mammaea passed through Antioch she expressed a desire of conversing with the celebrated Origen the fame of whose piety and learning was spread over the East Origen obeyed so flattering an invitation and though he could not expect to succeed in the conversion of an artful and ambitious woman she listened with pleasure to his eloquent exhortations and honorably dismissed him to his retirement in Palestine one hundred fifteen The sentiments of Mammaea were adopted by her son Alexander and the philosophic devotion of that emperor was marked by a singular but injudicious regard for the Christian religion In his domestic chapel he placed the statues of Abraham of Orpheus of Apollonius and of Christ as an honor justly due to those respectable sages who had instructed mankind in the various modes of addressing their homage to the supreme and universal Deity one hundred sixteen A purer faith as well as worship was openly professed and practised among his household Bishops perhaps for the first time were seen at court and after the death of Alexander when the inhuman Maximin discharged his fury on the favorites and servants of his unfortunate benefactor a great number of Christians of every rank and of both sexes were involved in the promiscuous massacre which on their account has improperly received the name of Persecution one hundred seventeen one hundred seventeena Footnote one

Mosheim p four hundred sixty five seems to refine too much on the domestic religion of Alexander His design of building a public temple to Christ Hist August p one hundred twenty nine and the objection which was suggested either to him or in similar circumstances to Hadrian appear to have no other foundation than an improbable report invented by the Christians and credulously adopted by an historian of the age of Constantine Footnote one hundred seventeen Euseb l vi c twenty eight It may be presumed that the success of the Christians had exasperated the increasing bigotry of the Pagans Dion Cassius who composed his history under the former reign had most probably intended for the use of his master those counsels of persecution which he ascribes to a better age and to and to the favorite of Augustus Concerning this oration of Maecenas or rather of Dion I may refer to my own unbiased opinion vol i c one note twenty five and to the Abbe de la Bleterie Memoires de l Academie tom xxiv p three hundred three tom xxv p four hundred thirty two Note If this be the case Dion Cassius must have known the Christians they must have been the subject of his particular attention since the author supposes that he wished his master to profit by these counsels of persecution How are we to reconcile this necessary consequence with what Gibbon has said of the ignorance of Dion Cassius even of the name of the Christians c xvi n twenty four Gibbon speaks of Dion s silence not of his ignorance M The supposition in this note is supported by no proof it is probable that Dion Cassius has often designated the Christians by the name of Jews See Dion Cassius l lxvii c fourteen lxviii l G On this point I should adopt the view of Gibbon rather than that of M Guizot M Footnote one hundred sevena It is with good reason that this massacre has been called a persecution for it lasted during the whole reign of Maximin as may be seen in Eusebius l vi c twenty eight Rufinus expressly confirms it Tribus annis a Maximino persecutione commota in quibus finem et persecutionis fecit et vitas Hist l vi c nineteen G Notwithstanding the cruel disposition of Maximin the effects of his resentment against the Christians were of a very local and temporary nature and the pious Origen who had been proscribed as a devoted victim was still reserved to convey the truths of the gospel to the ear of monarchs one hundred eighteen He addressed several edifying letters to the emperor Philip to his wife and to his mother and as soon as that prince who was born in the neighborhood of Palestine had usurped the Imperial sceptre the Christians acquired a friend and a protector The public and even partial favor of Philip towards the sectaries of the new religion and his constant reverence for the ministers of the church gave some color to the suspicion which prevailed in his own times that the emperor himself was become a convert to the faith one hundred nineteen and afforded some grounds for a fable which was afterwards invented that he had been purified by confession and penance from the guilt contracted by the murder of his innocent predecessor one hundred twenty The fall of Philip introduced with the change of masters a new system of government so oppressive to the Christians that their former condition ever since the time of Domitian was represented as a state of perfect freedom and security if compared with the rigorous treatment which they experienced under the short reign of Decius one hundred twenty one The virtues of that prince will scarcely allow us to suspect that he was actuated by a mean resentment against the favorites of his predecessor and it is more reasonable to believe that in the prosecution of his general design to restore the purity of Roman manners he was desirous of delivering the empire from what he condemned as a recent and criminal superstition The bishops of the most considerable cities were removed by exile or death the vigilance of the magistrates prevented the clergy of Rome during sixteen months from proceeding to a new election and it was the opinion of the Christians that the emperor would more patiently endure a competitor for the purple than a bishop in the capital one hundred twenty two Were it possible to suppose that the penetration of Decius had discovered pride under the disguise of humility or that he could foresee the temporal dominion which might insensibly arise from the claims of spiritual authority we might be less surprised that he should consider the successors of saint Peter as the most formidable rivals to those of Augustus Footnote one hundred eighteen Orosius l vii c nineteen mentions Origen as the object of Maximin s resentment and Firmilianus a Cappadocian bishop of that age gives a just and confined idea of this persecution apud Cyprian Epist seventy five Footnote one hundred nineteen The mention of those princes who were publicly supposed to be Christians as we find it in an epistle of Dionysius of Alexandria ap Euseb l vii c ten evidently alludes to Philip and his family and forms a contemporary evidence that such a report had prevailed but the Egyptian bishop who lived at an humble distance from the court of Rome expresses himself with a becoming diffidence concerning the truth of the fact The epistles of Origen which were extant in the time of Eusebius see l vi c thirty six would most probably decide this curious rather than important question Footnote one hundred twenty Euseb l vi c thirty four The story as is usual has been embellished by succeeding writers and is confuted with much superfluous learning by Frederick Spanheim Opera Varia tom ii p four hundred c Footnote one hundred twenty one Lactantius de Mortibus Persecutorum c three four After celebrating the felicity and increase of the church under a long succession of good princes he adds Extitit post annos plurimos execrabile animal Decius qui vexaret Ecclesiam Footnote one hundred

Cornelius the fourth of June A D two hundred fifty one Decius had probably left Rome since he was killed before the end of that year The administration of Valerian was distinguished by a levity and inconstancy ill suited to the gravity of the Roman Censor In the first part of his reign he surpassed in clemency those princes who had been suspected of an attachment to the Christian faith In the last three years and a half listening to the insinuations of a minister addicted to the superstitions of Egypt he adopted the maxims and imitated the severity of his predecessor Decius one hundred twenty three The accession of Gallienus which increased the calamities of the empire restored peace to the church and the Christians obtained the free exercise of their religion by an edict addressed to the bishops and conceived in such terms as seemed to acknowledge their office and public character one hundred twenty four The ancient laws without being formally repealed were suffered to sink into oblivion and excepting only some hostile intentions which are attributed to the emperor Aurelian one hundred twenty five the disciples of Christ passed above forty years in a state of prosperity far more dangerous to their virtue than the severest trials of persecution Footnote one hundred twenty three Euseb l vii c ten Mosheim p five hundred forty eight has very clearly shown that the praefect Macrianus and the Egyptian Magus are one and the same person Footnote one hundred twenty four Eusebius l vii c thirteen gives us a Greek version of this Latin edict which seems to have been very concise By another edict he directed that the Coemeteria should be restored to the Christians Footnote one hundred twenty five Euseb l vii c thirty Lactantius de M P c six Hieronym in Chron p one hundred seventy seven Orosius l vii c twenty three Their language is in general so ambiguous and incorrect that we are at a loss to determine how far Aurelian had carried his intentions before he was assassinated Most of the moderns except Dodwell Dissertat Cyprian vi sixty four have seized the occasion of gaining a few extraordinary martyrs Note doctor Lardner has detailed with his usual impartiality all that has come down to us relating to the persecution of Aurelian and concludes by saying Upon more carefully examining the words of Eusebius and observing the accounts of other authors learned men have generally and as I think very judiciously determined that Aurelian not only intended but did actually persecute but his persecution was short he having died soon after the publication of his edicts Heathen Test c xxxvi Basmage positively pronounces the same opinion Non intentatum modo sed executum quoque brevissimo tempore mandatum nobis infixum est in aniasis Basn Ann two hundred seventy five No two and compare Pagi Ann two hundred seventy two Nos four twelve twenty seven G The story of Paul of Samosata who filled the metropolitan see of Antioch while the East was in the hands of Odenathus and Zenobia may serve to illustrate the condition and character of the times The wealth of that prelate was a sufficient evidence of his guilt since it was neither derived from the inheritance of his fathers nor acquired by the arts of honest industry But Paul considered the service of the church as a very lucrative profession one hundred twenty six His ecclesiastical jurisdiction was venal and rapacious he extorted frequent contributions from the most opulent of the faithful and converted to his own use a considerable part of the public revenue By his pride and luxury the Christian religion was rendered odious in the eyes of the Gentiles His council chamber and his throne the splendor with which he appeared in public the suppliant crowd who solicited his attention the multitude of letters and petitions to which he dictated his answers and the perpetual hurry of business in which he was involved were circumstances much better suited to the state of a civil magistrate one hundred twenty seven than to the humility of a primitive bishop When he harangued his people from the pulpit Paul affected the figurative style and the theatrical gestures of an Asiatic sophist while the cathedral resounded with the loudest and most extravagant acclamations in the praise of his divine eloquence Against those who resisted his power or refused to flatter his vanity the prelate of Antioch was arrogant rigid and inexorable but he relaxed the discipline and lavished the treasures of the church on his dependent clergy who were permitted to imitate their master in the gratification of every sensual appetite For Paul indulged himself very freely in the pleasures of the table and he had received into the episcopal palace two young and beautiful women as the constant companions of his leisure moments one hundred twenty eight Footnote one hundred twenty six Paul was better pleased with the title of Ducenarius than with that of bishop The Ducenarius was an Imperial procurator so called from his salary of two hundred Sestertia or sixteen hundredl a year See Salmatius ad Hist August p one hundred twenty four Some critics suppose that the bishop of Antioch had actually obtained such an office from Zenobia while others consider it only as a figurative expression of his pomp and insolence Footnote one hundred twenty seven Simony was not unknown in those times and the clergy some times bought what they intended to sell It appears that the bishopric of Carthage was purchased by a wealthy matron named Lucilla for her servant Majorinus The price was four hundred Folles Monument Antiq ad calcem Optati p two hundred sixty three Every Follis contained one hundred twenty five pieces of silver and the whole sum may be computed at about twenty four hundredl Footnote one hundred twenty eight If we are desirous of extenuating the vices of Paul we must suspect the assembled bishops of the East of publishing the most malicious calumnies in circular epistles addressed to all the churches of the empire ap Euseb l vii c thirty Notwithstanding these scandalous vices if Paul of Samosata had preserved the purity of the orthodox faith his reign over the capital of Syria would have ended only with his life and had a seasonable persecution intervened an effort of courage might perhaps have placed him in the rank of saints and martyrs one hundred twenty eighta Some nice and subtle errors which he imprudently adopted and obstinately maintained concerning the doctrine of the Trinity excited the zeal and indignation of the Eastern churches one hundred twenty nine From Egypt to the Euxine Sea the bishops were in arms and in motion Several councils were held confutations were published excommunications were pronounced ambiguous explanations were by turns accepted and refused treaties were concluded and violated and at length Paul of Samosata was degraded from his episcopal character by the sentence of seventy or eighty bishops who assembled for that purpose at Antioch and who without consulting the rights of the clergy or people appointed a successor by their own authority The manifest irregularity of this proceeding increased the numbers of the discontented faction and as Paul who was no stranger to the arts of courts had insinuated himself into the favor of Zenobia he maintained above four years the possession of the episcopal house and office one hundred twenty ninea The victory of Aurelian changed the face of the East and the two contending parties who applied to each other the epithets of schism and heresy were either commanded or permitted to plead their cause before the tribunal of the conqueror This public and very singular trial affords a convincing proof that the existence the property the privileges and the internal policy of the Christians were acknowledged if not by the laws at least by the magistrates of the empire As a Pagan and as a soldier it could scarcely be expected that Aurelian should enter into the discussion whether the sentiments of Paul or those of his adversaries were most agreeable to the true standard of the orthodox faith His determination however was founded on the general principles of equity and reason He considered the bishops of Italy as the most impartial and respectable judges among the Christians and as soon as he was informed that they had unanimously approved the sentence of the council he acquiesced in their opinion and immediately gave orders that Paul should be compelled to relinquish the temporal possessions belonging to an office of which in the judgment of his brethren he had been regularly deprived But while we applaud the justice we should not overlook the policy of Aurelian who was desirous of restoring and cementing the dependence of the provinces on the capital by every means which could bind the interest or prejudices of any part of his subjects one hundred thirty Footnote one hundred twenty eighta It appears nevertheless that the vices and immoralities of Paul of Samosata had much weight in the sentence pronounced against him by the bishops The object of the letter addressed by the synod to the bishops of Rome and Alexandria was to inform them of the change in the faith of Paul the altercations and discussions to which it had given rise as well as of his morals and the whole of his conduct Euseb Hist Eccl l vii c xxx G Footnote one hundred twenty nine His heresy like those of Noetus and Sabellius in the same century tended to confound the mysterious distinction of the divine persons See Mosheim p seven hundred two c Footnote one hundred twenty ninea Her favorite Zenobia s Paul of Samosata seems to have entertained some views of attempting a union between Judaism and Christianity both parties rejected the unnatural alliance Hist of Jews iii one hundred seventy five and Jost Geschichte der Israeliter iv one hundred sixty seven The protection of the severe Zenobia is the only circumstance which may raise a doubt of the notorious immorality of Paul M Footnote one hundred thirty Euseb Hist Ecclesiast l vii c thirty We are entirely indebted to him for the curious story of Paul of Samosata Amidst the frequent revolutions of the empire the Christians still flourished in peace and prosperity and notwithstanding a celebrated aera of martyrs has been deduced from the accession of Diocletian one hundred thirty one the new system of policy introduced and maintained by the wisdom of that prince continued during more than eighteen years to breathe the mildest and most liberal spirit of religious toleration The mind of Diocletian himself was less adapted indeed to speculative inquiries than to the active labors of war and government His prudence rendered him averse to any great innovation and though his temper was not very susceptible of zeal or enthusiasm he always maintained an habitual regard for the ancient deities of the empire But the leisure of the two empresses of his wife Prisca and of Valeria his daughter permitted them to listen with more attention and respect to the truths of Christianity which in every age has acknowledged its important obligations to female devotion one hundred thirty two The principal eunuchs Lucian one hundred thirty three and Dorotheus Gorgonius and Andrew who attended the person possessed the favor and governed the household of Diocletian protected by their powerful influence the faith which they had embraced Their example was imitated by many of the most considerable officers of the palace who in their respective stations had the care of the Imperial ornaments of the robes of the furniture of the jewels and even of the private treasury and though it might sometimes be incumbent on them to accompany the emperor when he sacrificed in the temple one hundred thirty four they enjoyed with their wives their children and their slaves the free exercise of the Christian religion Diocletian and his colleagues frequently conferred the most important offices on those persons who avowed their abhorrence for the worship of the gods but who had displayed abilities proper for the service of the state The bishops held an honorable rank in their respective provinces and were treated with distinction and respect not only by the people but by the magistrates themselves Almost in every city the ancient churches were found insufficient to contain the increasing multitude of proselytes and in their place more stately and capacious edifices were erected for the public worship of the faithful The corruption of manners and principles so forcibly lamented by Eusebius one hundred thirty five may be considered not only as a consequence but as a proof of the liberty which the Christians enjoyed and abused under the reign of Diocletian Prosperity had relaxed the nerves of discipline Fraud envy and malice prevailed in every congregation The presbyters aspired to the episcopal office which every day became an object more worthy of their ambition The bishops who contended with each other for ecclesiastical preeminence appeared by their conduct to claim a secular and tyrannical power in the church and the lively faith which still distinguished the Christians from the Gentiles was shown much less in their lives than in their controversial writings Footnote one hundred thirty one The Aera of Martyrs which is still in use among the Copts and the Abyssinians must be reckoned from the twenty ninth of August A D two hundred eighty four as the beginning of the Egyptian year was nineteen days earlier than the real accession of

accession of the emperor Diocletian Notwithstanding this seeming security an attentive observer might discern some symptoms that threatened the church with a more violent persecution than any which she had yet endured The zeal and rapid progress of the Christians awakened the Polytheists from their supine indifference in the cause of those deities whom custom and education had taught them to revere The mutual provocations of a religious war which had already continued above two hundred years exasperated the animosity of the contending parties The Pagans were incensed at the rashness of a recent and obscure sect which presumed to accuse their countrymen of error and to devote their ancestors to eternal misery The habits of justifying the popular mythology against the invectives of an implacable enemy produced in their minds some sentiments of faith and reverence for a system which they had been accustomed to consider with the most careless levity The supernatural powers assumed by the church inspired at the same time terror and emulation The followers of the established religion intrenched themselves behind a similar fortification of prodigies invented new modes of sacrifice of expiation and of initiation one hundred thirty six attempted to revive the credit of their expiring oracles one hundred thirty seven and listened with eager credulity to every impostor who flattered their prejudices by a tale of wonders one hundred thirty eight Both parties seemed to acknowledge the truth of those miracles which were claimed by their adversaries and while they were contented with ascribing them to the arts of magic and to the power of daemons they mutually concurred in restoring and establishing the reign of superstition one hundred thirty nine Philosophy her most dangerous enemy was now converted into her most useful ally The groves of the academy the gardens of Epicurus and even the portico of the Stoics were almost deserted as so many different schools of scepticism or impiety one hundred forty and many among the Romans were desirous that the writings of Cicero should be condemned and suppressed by the authority of the senate one hundred forty one The prevailing sect of the new Platonicians judged it prudent to connect themselves with the priests whom perhaps they despised against the Christians whom they had reason to fear These fashionable Philosophers prosecuted the design of extracting allegorical wisdom from the fictions of the Greek poets instituted mysterious rites of devotion for the use of their chosen disciples recommended the worship of the ancient gods as the emblems or ministers of the Supreme Deity and composed against the faith of the gospel many elaborate treatises one hundred forty two which have since been committed to the flames

Codex Justinian l i i l s Chapter XVI Conduct Towards The Christians From Nero To Constantine Part VI Although the policy of Diocletian and the humanity of Constantius inclined them to preserve inviolate the maxims of toleration it was soon discovered that their two associates Maximian and Galerius entertained the most implacable aversion for the name and religion of the Christians The minds of those princes had never been enlightened by science education had never softened their temper They owed their greatness to their swords and in their most elevated fortune they still retained their superstitious prejudices of soldiers and peasants In the general administration of the provinces they obeyed the laws which their benefactor had established but they frequently found occasions of exercising within their camp and palaces a secret persecution one hundred forty four for which the imprudent zeal of the Christians sometimes offered the most specious pretences A sentence of death was executed upon Maximilianus an African youth who had been produced by his own father one hundred forty foura before the magistrate as a sufficient and legal recruit but who obstinately persisted in declaring that his conscience would not permit him to embrace the profession of a soldier one hundred forty five It could scarcely be expected that any government should suffer the action of Marcellus the Centurion to pass with impunity On the day of a public festival that officer threw away his belt his arms and the ensigns of his office and exclaimed with a loud voice that he would obey none but Jesus Christ the eternal King and that he renounced forever the use of carnal weapons and the service of an idolatrous master The soldiers as soon as they recovered from their astonishment secured the person of Marcellus He was examined in the city of Tingi by the president of that part of Mauritania and as he was convicted by his own confession he was condemned and beheaded for the crime of desertion one hundred forty six Examples of such a nature savor much less of religious persecution than of martial or even civil law but they served to alienate the mind of the emperors to justify the severity of Galerius who dismissed a great number of Christian officers from their employments and to authorize the opinion that a sect of enthusiastics which avowed principles so repugnant to the public safety must either remain useless or would soon become dangerous subjects of the empire Footnote one hundred forty four Eusebius l viii c four c seventeen He limits the number of military martyrs by a remarkable expression of which neither his Latin nor French translator have rendered the energy Notwithstanding the authority of Eusebius and the silence of Lactantius Ambrose Sulpicius Orosius c it has been long believed that the Thebaean legion consisting of six thousand Christians suffered martyrdom by the order of Maximian in the valley of the Pennine Alps The story was first published about the middle of the fifth century by Eucherius bishop of Lyons who received it from certain persons who received it from Isaac bishop of Geneva who is said to have received it from Theodore bishop of Octodurum The abbey of saint Maurice still subsists a rich monument of the credulity of Sigismund king of Burgundy See an excellent Dissertation in xxxvith volume of the Bibliotheque Raisonnee p four hundred twenty seven four hundred fifty four Footnote one hundred forty foura M Guizot criticizes Gibbon s account of this incident He supposes that Maximilian was not produced by his father as a recruit but was obliged to appear by the law which compelled the sons of soldiers to serve at twenty one years old Was not this a law of Constantine Neither does this circumstance appear in the acts His father had clearly expected him to serve as he had bought him a new dress for the occasion yet he refused to force the conscience of his son and when Maximilian was condemned to death the father returned home in joy blessing God for having bestowed upon him such a son M Footnote one hundred forty five See the Acta Sincera p two hundred ninety nine The accounts of his martyrdom and that of Marcellus bear every mark of truth and authenticity Footnote one hundred forty six Acta Sincera p three hundred two Note M Guizot here justly observes that it was the necessity of sacrificing to the gods which induced Marcellus to act in this manner M After the success of the Persian war had raised the hopes and the reputation of Galerius he passed a winter with Diocletian in the palace of Nicomedia and the fate of Christianity became the object of their secret consultations one hundred forty seven The experienced emperor was still inclined to pursue measures of lenity and though he readily consented to exclude the Christians from holding any employments in the household or the army he urged in the strongest terms the danger as well as cruelty of shedding the blood of those deluded fanatics Galerius at length extorted one hundred forty sevena from him the permission of summoning a council composed of a few persons the most distinguished in the civil and military departments of the state The important question was agitated in their presence and those ambitious courtiers easily discerned that it was incumbent on them to second by their eloquence the importunate violence of the Caesar It may be presumed that they insisted on every topic which might interest the pride the piety or the fears of their sovereign in the destruction of Christianity Perhaps they represented that the glorious work of the deliverance of the empire was left imperfect as long as an independent people was permitted to subsist and multiply in the heart of the provinces The Christians it might specially be alleged renouncing the gods and the institutions of Rome had constituted a distinct republic which might yet be suppressed before it had acquired any military force but which was already governed by its own laws and magistrates was possessed of a public treasure and was intimately connected in all its parts by the frequent assemblies of the bishops to whose decrees their numerous and opulent congregations yielded an implicit obedience Arguments like these may seem to have determined the reluctant mind of Diocletian to embrace a new system of persecution but though we may suspect it is not in our power to relate the secret intrigues of the palace the private views and resentments the jealousy of women or eunuchs and all those trifling but decisive causes which so often influence the fate of empires and the councils of the wisest monarchs one hundred forty eight Footnote one hundred forty seven De M P c eleven Lactantius or whoever was the author of this little treatise was at that time an inhabitant of Nicomedia but it seems difficult to conceive how he could acquire so accurate a knowledge of what passed in the Imperial cabinet Note Lactantius who was subsequently chosen by Constantine to educate Crispus might easily have learned these details from Constantine himself already of sufficient age to interest himself in the affairs of the government and in a position to obtain the best information G This assumes the doubtful point of the authorship of the Treatise M Footnote one hundred forty sevena This permission was not extorted from Diocletian he took the step of his own accord Lactantius says in truth Nec tamen deflectere potuit Diocletianus praecipitis hominis insaniam placuit ergo amicorum sententiam experiri De Mort Pers c eleven But this measure was in accordance with the artificial character of Diocletian who wished to have the appearance of doing good by his own impulse and evil by the impulse of others Nam erat hujus malitiae cum bonum quid facere decrevisse sine consilio faciebat ut ipse laudaretur Cum autem malum quoniam id reprehendendum sciebat in consilium multos advocabat ut alioram culpao adscriberetur quicquid ipse deliquerat Lact ib Eutropius says likewise Miratus callide fuit sagax praeterea et admodum subtilis ingenio et qui severitatem suam aliena invidia vellet explere Eutrop ix c twenty six G The manner in which the coarse and unfriendly pencil of the author of the Treatise de Mort Pers has drawn the character of Diocletian seems inconsistent with this profound subtilty Many readers will perhaps agree with Gibbon M Footnote one hundred forty eight The only circumstance which we can discover is the devotion and jealousy of the mother of Galerius She is described by Lactantius as Deorum montium cultrix mulier admodum superstitiosa She had a great influence over her son and was offended by the disregard of some of her Christian servants Note This disregard consisted in the Christians fasting and praying instead of participating in the banquets and sacrifices which she celebrated with the Pagans Dapibus sacrificabat poene quotidie ac vicariis suis epulis exhibebat Christiani abstinebant et illa cum gentibus epulante jejuniis hi et oratiomibus insisteban hine concepit odium Lact de Hist Pers c eleven G The pleasure of the emperors was at length signified to the Christians who during the course of this melancholy winter had expected with anxiety the result of so many secret consultations The twenty third of February which coincided with the Roman festival of the Terminalia one hundred forty nine was appointed whether from accident or design to set bounds to the progress of Christianity At the earliest dawn of day the Praetorian praefect one hundred fifty accompanied by several generals tribunes and officers of the revenue repaired to the principal church of Nicomedia which was situated on an eminence in the most populous and beautiful part of the city The doors were instantly broke open they rushed into the sanctuary and as they searched in vain for some visible object of worship they were obliged to content themselves with committing to the flames the volumes of the holy Scripture The ministers of Diocletian were followed by a numerous body of guards and pioneers who marched in order of battle and were provided with all the instruments used in the destruction of fortified cities By their incessant labor a sacred edifice which towered above the Imperial palace and had long excited the indignation and envy of the Gentiles was in a few hours levelled with the ground one hundred fifty one Footnote one hundred forty nine The worship and festival of the god Terminus are elegantly illustrated by M de Boze Mem de l Academie des Inscriptions tom i p fifty Footnote one hundred fifty In our only MS of Lactantius we read profectus but reason and the authority of all the critics allow us instead of that word which destroys the sense of the passage to substitute proefectus Footnote one hundred fifty one Lactantius de M P c twelve gives a very lively picture of the destruction of the church The next day the general edict of persecution was published one hundred fifty two and though Diocletian still averse to the effusion of blood had moderated the fury of Galerius who proposed that every one refusing to offer sacrifice should immediately be burnt alive the penalties inflicted on the obstinacy of the Christians might be deemed sufficiently rigorous and effectual It was enacted that their churches in all the provinces of the empire should be demolished to their foundations and the punishment of death was denounced against all who should presume to hold any secret assemblies for the purpose of religious worship The philosophers who now assumed the unworthy office of directing the blind zeal of persecution had diligently studied the nature and genius of the Christian religion and as they were not ignorant that the speculative doctrines of the faith were supposed to be contained in the writings of the prophets of the evangelists and of the apostles they most probably suggested the order that the bishops and presbyters should deliver all their sacred books into the hands of the magistrates who were commanded under the severest penalties to burn them in a public and solemn manner By the same edict the property of the church was at once confiscated and the several parts of which it might consist were either sold to the highest bidder united to the Imperial domain bestowed on the cities and corporations or granted to the solicitations of rapacious courtiers After taking such effectual measures to abolish the worship and to dissolve the government of the Christians it was thought necessary to subject to the most intolerable hardships the condition of those perverse individuals who should still reject the religion of nature of Rome and of their ancestors Persons of a liberal birth were declared incapable of holding any honors or employments slaves were forever deprived of the hopes of freedom and the whole body of the people were put out of the protection of the law The judges were authorized to hear and to determine every action that was brought against a Christian But the Christians were not permitted to complain of any injury which they themselves had suffered and thus those unfortunate sectaries were exposed to the severity while they were excluded from the benefits of public justice This new species of martyrdom so painful and lingering so obscure and ignominious was perhaps the most proper to weary the constancy of the faithful nor can it be doubted that the passions and interest of mankind were disposed on this occasion to second the designs of the emperors But the policy of a well ordered government must sometimes have interposed in behalf of the oppressed Christians one hundred fifty twoa nor was it possible for the Roman princes entirely to remove the apprehension of punishment or to connive at every act of fraud and violence without exposing their own authority and the rest of their subjects to the most alarming dangers one hundred fifty three Footnote one hundred fifty two Mosheim p nine hundred twenty two nine hundred twenty six from man scattered passages of Lactantius and Eusebius has collected a very just and accurate notion of this edict though he sometimes deviates into conjecture and refinement Footnote one hundred fifty twoa This wants proof The edict of Diocletian was executed in all its right during the rest of his reign Euseb Hist Eccl l viii c thirteen G Footnote one hundred fifty three Many ages afterwards Edward J practised with great success the same mode of persecution against the clergy of England See Hume s History of England vol ii p three hundred last fourto edition This edict was scarcely exhibited to the public view in the most conspicuous place of Nicomedia before it was torn down by the hands of a Christian who expressed at the same time by the bitterest invectives his contempt as well as abhorrence for such impious and tyrannical governors His offence according to the mildest laws amounted to treason and deserved death And if it be true that he was a person of rank and education those circumstances could serve only to aggravate his guilt He was burnt or rather roasted by a slow fire and his executioners zealous to revenge the personal insult which had been offered to the emperors exhausted every refinement of cruelty without being able to subdue his patience or to alter the steady and insulting smile which in his dying agonies he still preserved in his countenance The Christians though they confessed that his conduct had not been strictly conformable to the laws of prudence admired the divine fervor of his zeal and the excessive commendations which they lavished on the memory of their hero and martyr contributed to fix a deep impression of terror and hatred in the mind of Diocletian one hundred fifty four Footnote one hundred fifty four Lactantius only calls him quidam et si non recte magno tamer animo c c twelve Eusebius l viii c five adorns him with secular honora Neither have condescended to mention his name but the Greeks celebrate his memory under that of John See Tillemont Memones Ecclesiastiques tom v part ii p three hundred twenty His fears were soon alarmed by the view of a danger from which he very narrowly escaped Within fifteen days the palace of Nicomedia and even the bed chamber of Diocletian were twice in flames and though both times they were extinguished without any material damage the singular repetition of the fire was justly considered as an evident proof that it had not been the effect of chance or negligence The suspicion naturally fell on the Christians and it was suggested with some degree of probability that those desperate fanatics provoked by their present sufferings and apprehensive of impending calamities had entered into a conspiracy with their faithful brethren the eunuchs of the palace against the lives of two emperors whom they detested as the irreconcilable enemies of the church of God Jealousy and resentment prevailed in every breast but especially in that of Diocletian A great number of persons distinguished either by the offices which they had filled or by the favor which they had enjoyed were thrown into prison Every mode of torture was put in practice and the court as well as city was polluted with many bloody executions one hundred fifty five But as it was found impossible to extort any discovery of this mysterious transaction it seems incumbent on us either to presume the innocence or to admire the resolution of the sufferers A few days afterwards Galerius hastily withdrew himself from Nicomedia declaring that if he delayed his departure from that devoted palace he should fall a sacrifice to the rage of the Christians The ecclesiastical historians from whom alone we derive a partial and imperfect knowledge of this persecution are at a loss how to account for the fears and dangers of the emperors Two of these writers a prince and a rhetorician were eye witnesses of the fire of Nicomedia The one ascribes it to lightning and the divine wrath the other affirms that it was kindled by the malice of Galerius himself one hundred fifty six Footnote one hundred fifty five Lactantius de M P c thirteen fourteen Potentissimi quondam Eunuchi necati per quos Palatium et ipse constabat Eusebius l viii c six mentions the cruel executions of the eunuchs Gorgonius and Dorotheus and of Anthimius bishop of Nicomedia and both those writers describe in a vague but tragical manner the horrid scenes which were acted even in the Imperial presence Footnote one hundred fifty six See Lactantius Eusebius and Constantine ad Coetum Sanctorum c xxv Eusebius confesses his ignorance of the cause of this fire Note As the history of these times affords us no example of any attempts made by the Christians against their persecutors we have no reason not the slightest probability to attribute to them the fire in the palace and the authority of Constantine and Lactantius remains to explain it M de Tillemont has shown how they can be reconciled Hist des Empereurs Vie de Diocletian xix G Had it been done by a Christian it would probably have been a fanatic who would have avowed and gloried in it Tillemont s supposition that the fire was first caused by lightning and fed and increased by the malice of Galerius seems singularly improbable M As the edict against the Christians was designed for a general law of the whole empire and as Diocletian and Galerius though they might not wait for the consent were assured of the concurrence of the Western princes it would appear more consonant to our ideas of policy that the governors of all the provinces should have received secret instructions to publish on one and the same day this declaration of war within their respective departments It was at least to be expected that the convenience of the public highways and established posts would have enabled the emperors to transmit their orders with the utmost despatch from the palace of Nicomedia to the extremities of the Roman world and that they would not have suffered fifty days to elapse before the edict was published in Syria and near four months before it was signified to the cities of Africa one hundred fifty seven This delay may perhaps be imputed to the cautious temper of Diocletian who had yielded a reluctant consent to the measures of persecution and who was desirous of trying the experiment under his more immediate eye before he gave way to the disorders and discontent which it must inevitably occasion in the distant provinces At first indeed the magistrates were restrained from the effusion of blood but the use of every other severity was permitted and even recommended to their zeal nor could the Christians though they cheerfully resigned the ornaments of their churches resolve to interrupt their religious assemblies or to deliver their sacred books to the flames The pious obstinacy of Felix an African bishop appears to have embarrassed the subordinate ministers of the government The curator of his city sent him in chains to the proconsul The proconsul transmitted him to the Praetorian praefect of Italy and Felix who disdained even to give an evasive answer was at length beheaded at Venusia in Lucania a place on which the birth of Horace has conferred fame one hundred fifty eight This precedent and perhaps some Imperial rescript which was issued in consequence of it appeared to authorize the governors of provinces in punishing with death the refusal of the Christians to deliver up their sacred books There were undoubtedly many persons who embraced this opportunity of obtaining the crown of martyrdom but there were likewise too many who purchased an ignominious life by discovering and betraying the holy Scripture into the hands of infidels A great number even of bishops and presbyters acquired by this criminal compliance the opprobrious epithet of Traditors and their offence was productive of much present scandal and of much future discord in the African church one hundred fifty nine Footnote one hundred fifty seven Tillemont Memoires Ecclesiast tom v part i p forty three Footnote one hundred fifty eight See the Acta Sincera of Ruinart p three hundred fifty three those of Felix of Thibara or Tibiur appear much less corrupted than in the other editions which afford a lively specimen of legendary license Footnote one hundred fifty nine See the first book of Optatus of Milevis against the Donatiste Paris seventeen hundred edit Dupin He lived under the reign of Valens The copies as well as the versions of Scripture were already so multiplied in the empire that the most severe inquisition could no longer be attended with any fatal consequences and even the sacrifice of those volumes which in every congregation were preserved for public use required the consent of some treacherous and unworthy Christians But the ruin of the churches was easily effected by the authority of the government and by the labor of the Pagans In some provinces however the magistrates contented themselves with shutting up the places of religious worship In others they more literally complied with the terms of the edict and after taking away the doors the benches and the pulpit which they burnt as it were in a funeral pile they completely demolished the remainder of the edifice one hundred sixty It is perhaps to this melancholy occasion that we should apply a very remarkable story which is related with so many circumstances of variety and improbability that it serves rather to excite than to satisfy our curiosity In a small town in Phrygia of whose names as well as situation we are left ignorant it should seem that the magistrates and the body of the people had embraced the Christian faith and as some resistance might be apprehended to the execution of the edict the governor of the province was supported by a numerous detachment of legionaries On their approach the citizens threw themselves into the church with the resolution either of defending by arms that sacred edifice or of perishing in its ruins They indignantly rejected the notice and permission which was given them to retire till the soldiers provoked by their obstinate refusal set fire to the building on all sides and consumed by this extraordinary kind of martyrdom a great number of Phrygians with their wives and children one hundred sixty one Footnote one hundred sixty The ancient monuments published at the end of Optatus p two hundred sixty one c describe in a very circumstantial manner the proceedings of the governors in the destruction of churches They made a minute inventory of the plate c which they found in them That of the church of Cirta in Numidia is still extant It consisted of two chalices of gold and six of silver six urns one kettle seven lamps all likewise of silver besides a large quantity of brass utensils and wearing apparel Footnote one hundred sixty one Lactantius Institut Divin v eleven confines the calamity to the conventiculum with its congregation Eusebius viii eleven extends it to a whole city and introduces something very like a regular siege His ancient Latin translator Rufinus adds the important circumstance of the permission given to the inhabitants of retiring from thence As Phrygia reached to the confines of Isauria it is possible that the restless temper of those independent barbarians may have contributed to this misfortune Note Universum populum Lact Inst Div v eleven G Some slight disturbances though they were suppressed almost as soon as excited in Syria and the frontiers of Armenia afforded the enemies of the church a very plausible occasion to insinuate that those troubles had been secretly fomented by the intrigues of the bishops who had already forgotten their ostentatious professions of passive and unlimited obedience one hundred sixty two The resentment or the fears of Diocletian at length transported him beyond the bounds of moderation which he had hitherto preserved and he declared in a series of cruel edicts one hundred sixty twoa his intention of abolishing the Christian name By the first of these edicts the governors of the provinces were directed to apprehend all persons of the ecclesiastical order and the prisons destined for the vilest criminals were soon filled with a multitude of bishops presbyters deacons readers and exorcists By a second edict the magistrates were commanded to employ every method of severity which might reclaim them from their odious superstition and oblige them to return to the established worship of the gods This rigorous order was extended by a subsequent edict to the whole body of Christians who were exposed to a violent and general persecution one hundred sixty three Instead of those salutary restraints which had required the direct and solemn testimony of an accuser it became the duty as well as the interest of the Imperial officers to discover to pursue and to torment the most obnoxious among the faithful Heavy penalties were denounced against all who should presume to save a prescribed sectary from the just indignation of the gods and of the emperors Yet notwithstanding the severity of this law the virtuous courage of many of the Pagans in concealing their friends or relations affords an honorable proof that the rage of superstition had not extinguished in their minds the sentiments of nature and humanity one hundred sixty four Footnote one hundred sixty two Eusebius l viii c six M de Valois with some probability thinks that he has discovered the Syrian rebellion in an oration of Libanius and that it was a rash attempt of the tribune Eugenius who with only five hundred men seized Antioch and might perhaps allure the Christians by the promise of religious toleration From Eusebius l ix c eight as well as from Moses of Chorene Hist Armen l ii seventy seven c it may be inferred that Christianity was already introduced into Armenia Footnote one hundred sixty twoa He had already passed them in his first edict It does not appear that resentment or fear had any share in the new persecutions perhaps they originated in superstition and a specious apparent respect for its ministers The oracle of Apollo consulted by Diocletian gave no answer and said that just men hindered it from speaking Constantine who assisted at the ceremony affirms with an oath that when questioned about these men the high priest named the Christians The Emperor eagerly seized on this answer and drew against the innocent a sword destined only to punish the guilty he instantly issued edicts written if I may use the expression with a poniard and ordered the judges to employ all their skill to invent new modes of punishment Euseb Vit Constant l ii c fifty four G Footnote one hundred sixty three See Mosheim p nine hundred thirty eight the text of Eusebius very plainly shows that the governors whose powers were enlarged not restrained by the new laws could punish with death the most obstinate Christians as an example to their brethren Footnote one hundred sixty four Athanasius p eight hundred thirty three ap Tillemont Mem Ecclesiast tom v part i ninety Chapter XVI Conduct Towards The Christians From Nero To Constantine Part VII Diocletian had no sooner published his edicts against the Christians than as if he had been desirous of committing to other hands the work of persecution he divested himself of the Imperial purple The character and situation of his colleagues and successors sometimes urged them to enforce and sometimes inclined them to suspend the execution of these rigorous laws nor can we acquire a just and distinct idea of this important period of ecclesiastical history unless we separately consider the state of Christianity in the different parts of the empire during the space of ten years which elapsed between the first edicts of Diocletian and the final peace of the church The mild and humane temper of Constantius was averse to the oppression of any part of his subjects The principal offices of his palace were exercised by Christians He loved their persons esteemed their fidelity and entertained not any dislike to their religious principles But as long as Constantius remained in the subordinate station of Caesar it was not in his power openly to reject the edicts of Diocletian or to disobey the commands of Maximian His authority contributed however to alleviate the sufferings which he pitied and abhorred He consented with reluctance to the ruin of the churches but he ventured to protect the Christians themselves from the fury of the populace and from the rigor of the laws The provinces of Gaul under which we may probably include those of Britain were indebted for the singular tranquillity which they enjoyed to the gentle interposition of their sovereign one hundred sixty five But Datianus the president or governor of Spain actuated either by zeal or policy chose rather to execute the public edicts of the emperors than to understand the secret intentions of Constantius and it can scarcely be doubted that his provincial administration was stained with the blood of a few martyrs one hundred sixty six The elevation of Constantius to the supreme and independent dignity of Augustus gave a free scope to the exercise of his virtues and the shortness of his reign did not prevent him from establishing a system of toleration of which he left the precept and the example to his son Constantine His fortunate son from the first moment of his accession declaring himself the protector of the church at length deserved the appellation of the first emperor who publicly professed and established the Christian religion The motives of his conversion as they may variously be deduced from benevolence from policy from conviction or from remorse and the progress of the revolution which under his powerful influence and that of his sons rendered Christianity the reigning religion of the Roman empire will form a very interesting and important chapter in the present volume of this history At present it may be sufficient to observe that every victory of Constantine was productive of some relief or benefit to the church Footnote one hundred sixty five Eusebius l viii c thirteen Lactantius de M P c fifteen Dodwell Dissertat Cyprian xi seventy five represents them as inconsistent with each other But the former evidently speaks of Constantius in the station of Caesar and the latter of the same prince in the rank of Augustus Footnote one hundred sixty six Datianus is mentioned in Gruter s Inscriptions as having determined the limits between the territories of Pax Julia and those of Ebora both cities in the southern part of Lusitania If we recollect the neighborhood of those places to Cape saint Vincent we may suspect that the celebrated deacon and martyr of that name had been inaccurately assigned by Prudentius c to Saragossa or Valentia See the pompous history of his sufferings in the Memoires de Tillemont tom v part ii p fifty eight eighty five Some critics are of opinion that the department of Constantius as Caesar did not include Spain which still continued under the immediate jurisdiction of Maximian The provinces of Italy and Africa experienced a short but violent persecution The rigorous edicts of Diocletian were strictly and cheerfully executed by his associate Maximian who had long hated the Christians and who delighted in acts of blood and violence In the autumn of the first year of the persecution the two emperors met at Rome to celebrate their triumph several oppressive laws appear to have issued from their secret consultations and the diligence of the magistrates was animated by the presence of their sovereigns After Diocletian had divested himself of the purple Italy and Africa were administered under the name of Severus and were exposed without defence to the implacable resentment of his master Galerius Among the martyrs of Rome Adauctus deserves the notice of posterity He was of a noble family in Italy and had raised himself through the successive honors of the palace to the important office of treasurer of the private Jemesnes Adauctus is the more remarkable for being the only person of rank and distinction who appears to have suffered death during the whole course of this general persecution one hundred sixty seven Footnote one hundred sixty seven Eusebius l viii c eleven Gruter Inscrip p eleven seventy one No eighteen Rufinus has mistaken the office of Adauctus as well as the place of his martyrdom Note M Guizot suggests the powerful cunuchs of the palace Dorotheus Gorgonius and Andrew admitted by Gibbon himself to have been put to death p sixty six The revolt of Maxentius immediately restored peace to the churches of Italy and Africa and the same tyrant who oppressed every other class of his subjects showed himself just humane and even partial towards the afflicted Christians He depended on their gratitude and affection and very naturally presumed that the injuries which they had suffered and the dangers which they still apprehended from his most inveterate enemy would secure the fidelity of a party already considerable by their numbers and opulence one hundred sixty eight Even the conduct of Maxentius towards the bishops of Rome and Carthage may be considered as the proof of his toleration since it is probable that the most orthodox princes would adopt the same measures with regard to their established clergy Marcellus the former of these prelates had thrown the capital into confusion by the severe penance which he imposed on a great number of Christians who during the late persecution had renounced or dissembled their religion The rage of faction broke out in frequent and violent seditions the blood of the faithful was shed by each other s hands and the exile of Marcellus whose prudence seems to have been less eminent than his zeal was found to be the only measure capable of restoring peace to the distracted church of Rome one hundred sixty nine The behavior of Mensurius bishop of Carthage appears to have been still more reprehensible A deacon of that city had published a libel against the emperor The offender took refuge in the episcopal palace and though it was somewhat early to advance any claims of ecclesiastical immunities the bishop refused to deliver him up to the officers of justice For this treasonable resistance Mensurius was summoned to court and instead of receiving a legal sentence of death or banishment he was permitted after a short examination to return to his diocese one hundred seventy Such was the happy condition of the Christian subjects of Maxentius that whenever they were desirous of procuring for their own use any bodies of martyrs they were obliged to purchase them from the most distant provinces of the East A story is related of Aglae a Roman lady descended from a consular family and possessed of so ample an estate that it required the management of seventy three stewards Among these Boniface was the favorite of his mistress and as Aglae mixed love with devotion it is reported that he was admitted to share her bed Her fortune enabled her to gratify the pious desire of obtaining some sacred relics from the East She intrusted Boniface with a considerable sum of gold and a large quantity of aromatics and her lover attended by twelve horsemen and three covered chariots undertook a remote pilgrimage as far as Tarsus in Cilicia one hundred seventy one Footnote one hundred sixty eight Eusebius l viii c fourteen But as Maxentius was vanquished by Constantine it suited the purpose of Lactantius to place his death among those of the persecutors Note M Guizot directly contradicts this statement of Gibbon and appeals to Eusebius Maxentius who assumed the power in Italy pretended at first to be a Christian to gain the favor of the Roman people he ordered his ministers to cease to persecute the Christians affecting a hypocritical piety in order to appear more mild than his predecessors but his actions soon proved that he was very different from what they had at first hoped The actions of Maxentius were those of a cruel tyrant but not those of a persecutor the Christians like the rest of his subjects suffered from his vices but they were not oppressed as a sect Christian females were exposed to his lusts as well as to the brutal violence of his colleague Maximian but they were not selected as Christians M Footnote one hundred sixty nine The epitaph of Marcellus is to be found in Gruter Inscrip p eleven seventy two No three and it contains all that we know of his history Marcellinus and Marcellus whose names follow in the list of popes are supposed by many critics to be different persons but the learned Abbe de Longuerue was convinced that they were one and the same Veridicus rector lapsis quia crimina flere Praedixit miseris fuit omnibus hostis amarus Hinc furor hinc odium sequitur discordia lites Seditio caedes solvuntur foedera pacis

Boniface which abound in miracles and declamation are published by Ruinart p two hundred eighty three two hundred ninety one both in Greek and Latin from the authority of very ancient manuscripts Note We are ignorant whether Aglae and Boniface were Christians at the time of their unlawful connection See Tillemont Mem Eccles Note on the Persecution of Domitian tom v note eighty two M de Tillemont proves also that the history is doubtful G Sir D Dalrymple Lord Hailes calls the story of Aglae and Boniface as of equal authority with our popular histories of Whittington and Hickathrift Christian Antiquities ii sixty four M The sanguinary temper of Galerius the first and principal author of the persecution was formidable to those Christians whom their misfortunes had placed within the limits of his dominions and it may fairly be presumed that many persons of a middle rank who were not confined by the chains either of wealth or of poverty very frequently deserted their native country and sought a refuge in the milder climate of the West one hundred seventy onea As long as he commanded only the armies and provinces of Illyricum he could with difficulty either find or make a considerable number of martyrs in a warlike country which had entertained the missionaries of the gospel with more coldness and reluctance than any other part of the empire one hundred seventy two But when Galerius had obtained the supreme power and the government of the East he indulged in their fullest extent his zeal and cruelty not only in the provinces of Thrace and Asia which acknowledged his immediate jurisdiction but in those of Syria Palestine and Egypt where Maximin gratified his own inclination by yielding a rigorous obedience to the stern commands of his benefactor one hundred seventy three The frequent disappointments of his ambitious views the experience of six years of persecution and the salutary reflections which a lingering and painful distemper suggested to the mind of Galerius at length convinced him that the most violent efforts of despotism are insufficient to extirpate a whole people or to subdue their religious prejudices Desirous of repairing the mischief that he had occasioned he published in his own name and in those of Licinius and Constantine a general edict which after a pompous recital of the Imperial titles proceeded in the following manner Footnote one hundred seventy onea A little after this Christianity was propagated to the north of the Roman provinces among the tribes of Germany a multitude of Christians forced by the persecutions of the Emperors to take refuge among the Barbarians were received with kindness Euseb de Vit Constant ii fifty three Semler Select cap H E p one hundred fifteen The Goths owed their first knowledge of Christianity to a young girl a prisoner of war she continued in the midst of them her exercises of piety she fasted prayed and praised God day and night When she was asked what good would come of so much painful trouble she answered It is thus that Christ the Son of God is to be honored Sozomen ii c six G Footnote one hundred seventy two During the four first centuries there exist few traces of either bishops or bishoprics in the western Illyricum It has been thought probable that the primate of Milan extended his jurisdiction over Sirmium the capital of that great province See the Geographia Sacra of Charles de saint Paul p sixty eight seventy six with the observations of Lucas Holstenius Footnote one hundred seventy three The viiith book of Eusebius as well as the supplement concerning the martyrs of Palestine principally relate to the persecution of Galerius and Maximin The general lamentations with which Lactantius opens the vth book of his Divine Institutions allude to their cruelty Among the important cares which have occupied our mind for the utility and preservation of the empire it was our intention to correct and reestablish all things according to the ancient laws and public discipline of the Romans We were particularly desirous of reclaiming into the way of reason and nature the deluded Christians who had renounced the religion and ceremonies instituted by their fathers and presumptuously despising the practice of antiquity had invented extravagant laws and opinions according to the dictates of their fancy and had collected a various society from the different provinces of our empire The edicts which we have published to enforce the worship of the gods having exposed many of the Christians to danger and distress many having suffered death and many more who still persist in their impious folly being left destitute of any public exercise of religion we are disposed to extend to those unhappy men the effects of our wonted clemency We permit them therefore freely to profess their private opinions and to assemble in their conventicles without fear or molestation provided always that they preserve a due respect to the established laws and government By another rescript we shall signify our intentions to the judges and magistrates and we hope that our indulgence will engage the Christians to offer up their prayers to the Deity whom they adore for our safety and prosperity for their own and for that of the republic one hundred seventy four It is not usually in the language of edicts and manifestos that we should search for the real character or the secret motives of princes but as these were the words of a dying emperor his situation perhaps may be admitted as a pledge of his sincerity Footnote one hundred seventy four Eusebius l viii c seventeen has given us a Greek version and Lactantius de M P c thirty four the Latin original of this memorable edict Neither of these writers seems to recollect how directly it contradicts whatever they have just affirmed of the remorse and repentance of Galerius Note But Gibbon has answered this by his just observation that it is not in the language of edicts and manifestos that we should search for the secre motives of princes M When Galerius subscribed this edict of toleration he was well assured that Licinius would readily comply with the inclinations of his friend and benefactor and that any measures in favor of the Christians would obtain the approbation of Constantine But the emperor would not venture to insert in the preamble the name of Maximin whose consent was of the greatest importance and who succeeded a few days afterwards to the provinces of Asia In the first six months however of his new reign Maximin affected to adopt the prudent counsels of his predecessor and though he never condescended to secure the tranquillity of the church by a public edict Sabinus his Praetorian praefect addressed a circular letter to all the governors and magistrates of the provinces expatiating on the Imperial clemency acknowledging the invincible obstinacy of the Christians and directing the officers of justice to cease their ineffectual prosecutions and to connive at the secret assemblies of those enthusiasts In consequence of these orders great numbers of Christians were released from prison or delivered from the mines The confessors singing hymns of triumph returned into their own countries and those who had yielded to the violence of the tempest solicited with tears of repentance their readmission into the bosom of the church one hundred seventy five Footnote one hundred seventy five Eusebius l ix c one He inserts the epistle of the praefect But this treacherous calm was of short duration nor could the Christians of the East place any confidence in the character of their sovereign Cruelty and superstition were the ruling passions of the soul of Maximin The former suggested the means the latter pointed out the objects of persecution The emperor was devoted to the worship of the gods to the study of magic and to the belief of oracles The prophets or philosophers whom he revered as the favorites of Heaven were frequently raised to the government of provinces and admitted into his most secret councils They easily convinced him that the Christians had been indebted for their victories to their regular discipline and that the weakness of polytheism had principally flowed from a want of union and subordination among the ministers of religion A system of government was therefore instituted which was evidently copied from the policy of the church In all the great cities of the empire the temples were repaired and beautified by the order of Maximin and the officiating priests of the various deities were subjected to the authority of a superior pontiff destined to oppose the bishop and to promote the cause of paganism These pontiffs acknowledged in their turn the supreme jurisdiction of the metropolitans or high priests of the province who acted as the immediate vicegerents of the emperor himself A white robe was the ensign of their dignity and these new prelates were carefully selected from the most noble and opulent families By the influence of the magistrates and of the sacerdotal order a great number of dutiful addresses were obtained particularly from the cities of Nicomedia Antioch and Tyre which artfully represented the well known intentions of the court as the general sense of the people solicited the emperor to consult the laws of justice rather than the dictates of his clemency expressed their abhorrence of the Christians and humbly prayed that those impious sectaries might at least be excluded from the limits of their respective territories The answer of Maximin to the address which he obtained from the citizens of Tyre is still extant He praises their zeal and devotion in terms of the highest satisfaction descants on the obstinate impiety of the Christians and betrays by the readiness with which he consents to their banishment that he considered himself as receiving rather than as conferring an obligation The priests as well as the magistrates were empowered to enforce the execution of his edicts which were engraved on tables of brass and though it was recommended to them to avoid the effusion of blood the most cruel and ignominious punishments were inflicted on the refractory Christians one hundred seventy six Footnote one hundred seventy six See Eusebius l viii c fourteen l ix c two eight Lactantius de M P c thirty six These writers agree in representing the arts of Maximin but the former relates the execution of several martyrs while the latter expressly affirms occidi servos Dei vetuit Note It is easy to reconcile them it is sufficient to quote the entire text of Lactantius Nam cum clementiam specie tenus profiteretur occidi servos Dei vetuit debilitari jussit Itaque confessoribus effodiebantur oculi amputabantur manus nares vel auriculae desecabantur Haec ille moliens Constantini litteris deterretur Dissimulavit ergo et tamen si quis inciderit mari occulte mergebatur This detail of torments inflicted on the Christians easily reconciles Lactantius and Eusebius Those who died in consequence of their tortures those who were plunged into the sea might well pass for martyrs The mutilation of the words of Lactantius has alone given rise to the apparent contradiction G Eusebius ch vi relates the public martyrdom of the aged bishop of Emesa with two others who were thrown to the wild beasts the beheading of Peter bishop of Alexandria with several others and the death of Lucian presbyter of Antioch who was carried to Numidia and put to death in prison The contradiction is direct and undeniable for although Eusebius may have misplaced the former martyrdoms it may be doubted whether the authority of Maximin extended to Nicomedia till after the death of Galerius The last edict of toleration issued by Maximin and published by Eusebius himself Eccl Hist ix nine confirms the statement of Lactantius M The Asiatic Christians had every thing to dread from the severity of a bigoted monarch who prepared his measures of violence with such deliberate policy But a few months had scarcely elapsed before the edicts published by the two Western emperors obliged Maximin to suspend the prosecution of his designs the civil war which he so rashly undertook against Licinius employed all his attention and the defeat and death of Maximin soon delivered the church from the last and most implacable of her enemies one hundred seventy seven Footnote one hundred seventy seven A few days before his death he published a very ample edict of toleration in which he imputes all the severities which the Christians suffered to the judges and governors who had misunderstood his intentions See the edict of Eusebius l ix c ten In this general view of the persecution which was first authorized by the edicts of Diocletian I have purposely refrained from describing the particular sufferings and deaths of the Christian martyrs It would have been an easy task from the history of Eusebius from the declamations of Lactantius and from the most ancient acts to collect a long series of horrid and disgustful pictures and to fill many pages with racks and scourges with iron hooks and red hot beds and with all the variety of tortures which fire and steel savage beasts and more savage executioners could inflict upon the human body These melancholy scenes might be enlivened by a crowd of visions and miracles destined either to delay the death to celebrate the triumph or to discover the relics of those canonized saints who suffered for the name of Christ But I cannot determine what I ought to transcribe till I am satisfied how much I ought to believe The gravest of the ecclesiastical historians Eusebius himself indirectly confesses that he has related whatever might redound to the glory and that he has suppressed all that could tend to the disgrace of religion one hundred seventy eight Such an acknowledgment will naturally excite a suspicion that a writer who has so openly violated one of the fundamental laws of history has not paid a very strict regard to the observance of the other and the suspicion will derive additional credit from the character of Eusebius one hundred seventy eighta which was less tinctured with credulity and more practised in the arts of courts than that of almost any of his contemporaries On some particular occasions when the magistrates were exasperated by some personal motives of interest or resentment the rules of prudence and perhaps of decency to overturn the altars to pour out imprecations against the emperors or to strike the judge as he sat on his tribunal it may be presumed that every mode of torture which cruelty could invent or constancy could endure was exhausted on those devoted victims one hundred seventy nine Two circumstances however have been unwarily mentioned which insinuate that the general treatment of the Christians who had been apprehended by the officers of justice was less intolerable than it is usually imagined to have been one The confessors who were condemned to work in the mines were permitted by the humanity or the negligence of their keepers to build chapels and freely to profess their religion in the midst of those dreary habitations one hundred eighty two The bishops were obliged to check and to censure the forward zeal of the Christians who voluntarily threw themselves into the hands of the magistrates Some of these were persons oppressed by poverty and debts who blindly sought to terminate a miserable existence by a glorious death Others were allured by the hope that a short confinement would expiate the sins of a whole life and others again were actuated by the less honorable motive of deriving a plentiful subsistence and perhaps a considerable profit from the alms which the charity of the faithful bestowed on the prisoners one hundred eighty one After the church had triumphed over all her enemies the interest as well as vanity of the captives prompted them to magnify the merit of their respective sufferings A convenient distance of time or place gave an ample scope to the progress of fiction and the frequent instances which might be alleged of holy martyrs whose wounds had been instantly healed whose strength had been renewed and whose lost members had miraculously been restored were extremely convenient for the purpose of removing every difficulty and of silencing every objection The most extravagant legends as they conduced to the honor of the church were applauded by the credulous multitude countenanced by the power of the clergy and attested by the suspicious evidence of ecclesiastical history Footnote one hundred seventy eight Such is the fair deduction from two remarkable passages in Eusebius l viii c two and de Martyr Palestin c twelve The prudence of the historian has exposed his own character to censure and suspicion It was well known that he himself had been thrown into prison and it was suggested that he had purchased his deliverance by some dishonorable compliance The reproach was urged in his lifetime and even in his presence at the council of Tyre See Tillemont Memoires Ecclesiastiques tom viii part i p sixty seven Footnote one hundred seventy eighta Historical criticism does not consist in rejecting indiscriminately all the facts which do not agree with a particular system as Gibbon does in this chapter in which except at the last extremity he will not consent to believe a martyrdom Authorities are to be weighed not excluded from examination Now the Pagan historians justify in many places the detail which have been transmitted to us by the historians of the church concerning the tortures endured by the Christians Celsus reproaches the Christians with holding their assemblies in secret on account of the fear inspired by their sufferings for when you are arrested he says you are dragged to punishment and before you are put to death you have to suffer all kinds of tortures Origen cont Cels l i ii vi viii passing Libanius the panegyrist of Julian says while speaking of the Christians Those who followed a corrupt religion were in continual apprehensions they feared lest Julian should invent

Nothing can be more painful than the constant attempt of Gibbon throughout this discussion to find some flaw in the virtue and heroism of the martyrs some extenuation for the cruelty of the persecutors But truth must not be sacrificed even to well grounded moral indignation Though the language of these martyrs is in great part that of calm de fiance of noble firmness yet there are many expressions which betray resentment and contempt Children of Satan worshippers of Devils is their common appellation of the heathen One of them calls the judge another one curses and declares that he will curse the Emperors as pestilential and bloodthirsty tyrants whom God will soon visit in his wrath On the other hand though at first they speak the milder language of persuasion the cold barbarity of the judges and officers might surely have called forth one sentence of abhorrence from Gibbon On the first unsatisfactory answer Break his jaw is the order of the judge They direct and witness the most excruciating tortures the people as M Guizot observers were so much revolted by the cruelty of Maximus that when the martyrs appeared in the amphitheatre fear seized on all hearts and general murmurs against the unjust judge rank through the assembly It is singular at least that Gibbon should have quoted as probably authentic acts so much embellished with miracle as these of Tarachus are particularly towards the end M Note Scarcely were the authorities informed of this than the president of the province a man says Eusebius harsh and cruel banished the confessors some to Cyprus others to different parts of Palestine and ordered them to be tormented by being set to the most painful labors Four of them whom he required to abjure their faith and refused were burnt alive Euseb de Mart

Constantine Part VIII The vague descriptions of exile and imprisonment of pain and torture are so easily exaggerated or softened by the pencil of an artful orator one hundred eighty onea that we are naturally induced to inquire into a fact of a more distinct and stubborn kind the number of persons who suffered death in consequence of the edicts published by Diocletian his associates and his successors The recent legendaries record whole armies and cities which were at once swept away by the undistinguishing rage of persecution The more ancient writers content themselves with pouring out a liberal effusion of loose and tragical invectives without condescending to ascertain the precise number of those persons who were permitted to seal with their blood their belief of the gospel From the history of Eusebius it may however be collected that only nine bishops were punished with death and we are assured by his particular enumeration of the martyrs of Palestine that no more than ninety two Christians were entitled to that honorable appellation one hundred eighty two one hundred eighty twoa As we are unacquainted with the degree of episcopal zeal and courage which prevailed at that time it is not in our power to draw any useful inferences from the former of these facts but the latter may serve to justify a very important and probable conclusion According to the distribution of Roman provinces Palestine may be considered as the sixteenth part of the Eastern empire one hundred eighty three and since there were some governors who from a real or affected clemency had preserved their hands unstained with the blood of the faithful one hundred eighty four it is reasonable to believe that the country which had given birth to Christianity produced at least the sixteenth part of the martyrs who suffered death within the dominions of Galerius and Maximin the whole might consequently amount to about fifteen hundred a number which if it is equally divided between the ten years of the persecution will allow an annual consumption of one hundred and fifty martyrs Allotting the same proportion to the provinces of Italy Africa and perhaps Spain where at the end of two or three years the rigor of the penal laws was either suspended or abolished the multitude of Christians in the Roman empire on whom a capital punishment was inflicted by a judicia sentence will be reduced to somewhat less than two thousand persons Since it cannot be doubted that the Christians were more numerous and their enemies more exasperated in the time of Diocletian than they had ever been in any former persecution this probable and moderate computation may teach us to estimate the number of primitive saints and martyrs who sacrificed their lives for the important purpose of introducing Christianity into the world Footnote one hundred eighty onea Perhaps there never was an instance of an author committing so deliberately the fault which he reprobates so strongly in others What is the dexterous management of the more inartificial historians of Christianity in exaggerating the numbers of the martyrs compared to the unfair address with which Gibbon here quietly dismisses from the account all the horrible and excruciating tortures which fell short of death The reader may refer to the xiith chapter book viii of Eusebius for the description and for the scenes of these tortures M Footnote one hundred eighty two Eusebius de Martyr Palestin c thirteen He closes his narration by assuring us that these were the martyrdoms inflicted in Palestine during the whole course of the persecution The ninth chapter of his viiith book which relates to the province of Thebais in Egypt may seem to contradict our moderate computation but it will only lead us to admire the artful management of the historian Choosing for the scene of the most exquisite cruelty the most remote and sequestered country of the Roman empire he relates that in Thebais from ten to one hundred persons had frequently suffered martyrdom in the same day But when he proceeds to mention his own journey into Egypt his language insensibly becomes more cautious and moderate Instead of a large but definite number he speaks of many Christians and most artfully selects two ambiguous words which may signify either what he had seen or what he had heard either the expectation or the execution of the punishment Having thus provided a secure evasion he commits the equivocal passage to his readers and translators justly conceiving that their piety would induce them to prefer the most favorable sense There was perhaps some malice in the remark of Theodorus Metochita that all who like Eusebius had been conversant with the Egyptians delighted in an obscure and intricate style See Valesius ad loc Footnote one hundred eighty twoa This calculation is made from the martyrs of whom Eusebius speaks by name but he recognizes a much greater number Thus the ninth and tenth chapters of his work are entitled Of Antoninus Zebinus Germanus and other martyrs of Peter the monk of Asclepius the Maroionite and other martyrs Are these vague contents of chapters very good authority M Speaking of those who suffered under Diocletian he says I will only relate the death of one of these from which the reader may divine what befell the rest Hist Eccl viii six This relates only to the martyrs in the royal household M Dodwell had made before Gibbon this calculation and these objections but Ruinart Act Mart Pref p twenty seven et seq has answered him in a peremptory manner Nobis constat Eusebium in

conjectionibus judicet aequus lector Even in the persecutions which Gibbon has represented as much more mild than that of Diocletian the number of martyrs appears much greater than that to which he limits the martyrs of the latter and this number is attested by incontestable monuments I will quote but one example We find among the letters of saint Cyprian one from Lucianus to Celerinus written from the depth of a prison in which Lucianus names seventeen of his brethren dead some in the quarries some in the midst of tortures some of starvation in prison Jussi sumus he proceeds secundum prae ceptum imperatoris fame et siti necari et reclusi sumus in duabus cellis ta ut nos afficerent fame et siti et ignis vapore G Footnote one hundred eighty three When Palestine was divided into three the praefecture of the East contained forty eight provinces As the ancient distinctions of nations were long since abolished the Romans distributed the provinces according to a general proportion of their extent and opulence Footnote one hundred eighty four Ut gloriari possint nullam se innocentium poremisse nam et ipse audivi aloquos gloriantes quia administratio sua in hac paris merit incruenta Lactant Institur Divin v eleven We shall conclude this chapter by a melancholy truth which obtrudes itself on the reluctant mind that even admitting without hesitation or inquiry all that history has recorded or devotion has feigned on the subject of martyrdoms it must still be acknowledged that the Christians in the course of their intestine dissensions have inflicted far greater severities on each other than they had experienced from the zeal of infidels During the ages of ignorance which followed the subversion of the Roman empire in the West the bishops of the Imperial city extended their dominion over the laity as well as clergy of the Latin church The fabric of superstition which they had erected and which might long have defied the feeble efforts of reason was at length assaulted by a crowd of daring fanatics who from the twelfth to the sixteenth century assumed the popular character of reformers The church of Rome defended by violence the empire which she had acquired by fraud a system of peace and benevolence was soon disgraced by proscriptions war massacres and the institution of the holy office And as the reformers were animated by the love of civil as well as of religious freedom the Catholic princes connected their own interest with that of the clergy and enforced by fire and the sword the terrors of spiritual censures In the Netherlands alone more than one hundred thousand of the subjects of Charles V are said to have suffered by the hand of the executioner and this extraordinary number is attested by Grotius one hundred eighty five a man of genius and learning who preserved his moderation amidst the fury of contending sects and who composed the annals of his own age and country at a time when the invention of printing had facilitated the means of intelligence and increased the danger of detection If we are obliged to submit our belief to the authority of Grotius it must be allowed that the number of Protestants who were executed in a single province and a single reign far exceeded that of the primitive martyrs in the space of three centuries and of the Roman empire But if the improbability of the fact itself should prevail over the weight of evidence if Grotius should be convicted of exaggerating the merit and sufferings of the Reformers one hundred eighty six we shall be naturally led to inquire what confidence can be placed in the doubtful and imperfect monuments of ancient credulity what degree of credit can be assigned to a courtly bishop and a passionate declaimer one hundred eighty sixa who under the protection of Constantine enjoyed the exclusive privilege of recording the persecutions inflicted on the Christians by the vanquished rivals or disregarded predecessors of their gracious sovereign Footnote one hundred eighty five Grot Annal de Rebus Belgicis l i p twelve edit fol Footnote one hundred eighty six Fra Paola Istoria del Concilio Tridentino l iii reduces the number of the Belgic martyrs to fifty thousand In learning and moderation Fra Paola was not inferior to Grotius The priority of time gives some advantage to the evidence of the former which he loses on the other hand by the distance of Venice from the Netherlands Footnote one hundred eighty sixa Eusebius and the author of the Treatise de Mortibus Persecutorum It is deeply to be regretted that the history of this period rest so much on the loose and it must be admitted by no means scrupulous authority of Eusebius Ecclesiastical history is a solemn and melancholy lesson that the best even the most sacred cause will eventually the least departure from truth M Chapter XVII Foundation Of Constantinople Part I Foundation Of Constantinople Political System Constantine And His Successors Military Discipline The Palace The Finances The unfortunate Licinius was the last rival who opposed the greatness and the last captive who adorned the triumph of Constantine After a tranquil and prosperous reign the conquerer bequeathed to his family the inheritance of the Roman empire a new capital a new policy and a new religion and the innovations which he established have been embraced and consecrated by succeeding generations The age of the great Constantine and his sons is filled with important events but the historian must be oppressed by their number and variety unless he diligently separates from each other the scenes which are connected only by the order of time He will describe the political institutions that gave strength and stability to the empire before he proceeds to relate the wars and revolutions which hastened its decline He will adopt the division unknown to the ancients of civil and ecclesiastical affairs the victory of the Christians and their intestine discord will supply copious and distinct materials both for edification and for scandal After the defeat and abdication of Licinius his victorious rival proceeded to lay the foundations of a city destined to reign in future times the mistress of the East and to survive the empire and religion of Constantine The motives whether of pride or of policy which first induced Diocletian to withdraw himself from the ancient seat of government had acquired additional weight by the example of his successors and the habits of forty years Rome was insensibly confounded with the dependent kingdoms which had once acknowledged her supremacy and the country of the Caesars was viewed with cold indifference by a martial prince born in the neighborhood of the Danube educated in the courts and armies of Asia and invested with the purple by the legions of Britain The Italians who had received Constantine as their deliverer submissively obeyed the edicts which he sometimes condescended to address to the senate and people of Rome but they were seldom honored with the presence of their new sovereign During the vigor of his age Constantine according to the various exigencies of peace and war moved with slow dignity or with active diligence along the frontiers of his extensive dominions and was always prepared to take the field either against a foreign or a domestic enemy But as he gradually reached the summit of prosperity and the decline of life he began to meditate the design of fixing in a more permanent station the strength as well as majesty of the throne In the choice of an advantageous situation he preferred the confines of Europe and Asia to curb with a powerful arm the barbarians who dwelt between the Danube and the Tanais to watch with an eye of jealousy the conduct of the Persian monarch who indignantly supported the yoke of an ignominious treaty With these views Diocletian had selected and embellished the residence of Nicomedia but the memory of Diocletian was justly abhorred by the protector of the church and Constantine was not insensible to the ambition of founding a city which might perpetuate the glory of his own name During the late operations of the war against Licinius he had sufficient opportunity to contemplate both as a soldier and as a statesman the incomparable position of Byzantium and to observe how strongly it was guarded by nature against a hostile attack whilst it was accessible on every side to the benefits of commercial intercourse Many ages before Constantine one of the most judicious historians of antiquity one had described the advantages of a situation from whence a feeble colony of Greeks derived the command of the sea and the honors of a flourishing and independent republic two Footnote one Polybius l iv p four hundred twenty three edit Casaubon He observes that the peace of the Byzantines was frequently disturbed and the extent of their territory contracted by the inroads of the wild Thracians Footnote two The navigator Byzas who was styled the son of Neptune founded the city six hundred fifty six years before the Christian aera His followers were drawn from Argos and Megara Byzantium was afterwards rebuild and fortified by the Spartan general Pausanias See Scaliger Animadvers ad Euseb p eighty one Ducange Constantinopolis l i part i cap fifteen sixteen With regard to the wars of the Byzantines against Philip the Gauls and the kings of Bithynia we should trust none but the ancient writers who lived before the greatness of the Imperial city had excited a spirit of flattery and fiction If we survey Byzantium in the extent which it acquired with the august name of Constantinople the figure of the Imperial city may be represented under that of an unequal triangle The obtuse point which advances towards the east and the shores of Asia meets and repels the waves of the Thracian Bosphorus The northern side of the city is bounded by the harbor and the southern is washed by the Propontis or Sea of Marmara The basis of the triangle is opposed to the west and terminates the continent of Europe But the admirable form and division of the circumjacent land and water cannot without a more ample explanation be clearly or sufficiently understood The winding channel through which the waters of the Euxine flow with a rapid and incessant course towards the Mediterranean received the appellation of Bosphorus a name not less celebrated in the history than in the fables of antiquity three A crowd of temples and of votive altars profusely scattered along its steep and woody banks attested the unskilfulness the terrors and the devotion of the Grecian navigators who after the example of the Argonauts explored the dangers of the inhospitable Euxine On these banks tradition long preserved the memory of the palace of Phineus infested by the obscene harpies four and of the sylvan reign of Amycus who defied the son of Leda to the combat of the cestus five The straits of the Bosphorus are terminated by the Cyanean rocks which according to the description of the poets had once floated on the face of the waters and were destined by the gods to protect the entrance of the Euxine against the eye of profane curiosity six From the Cyanean rocks to the point and harbor of Byzantium the winding length of the Bosphorus extends about sixteen miles seven and its most ordinary breadth may be computed at about one mile and a half The new castles of Europe and Asia are constructed on either continent upon the foundations of two celebrated temples of Serapis and of Jupiter Urius The old castles a work of the Greek emperors command the narrowest part of the channel in a place where the opposite banks advance within five hundred paces of each other These fortresses were destroyed and strengthened by Mahomet the Second when he meditated the siege of Constantinople eight but the Turkish conqueror was most probably ignorant that near two thousand years before his reign Darius had chosen the same situation to connect the two continents by a bridge of boats nine At a small distance from the old castles we discover the little town of Chrysopolis or Scutari which may almost be considered as the Asiatic suburb of Constantinople The Bosphorus as it begins to open into the Propontis passes between Byzantium and Chalcedon The latter of those cities was built by the Greeks a few years before the former and the blindness of its founders who overlooked the superior advantages of the opposite coast has been stigmatized by a proverbial expression of contempt ten Footnote three

considered as an arm of the Bosphorus obtained in a very remote period the denomination of the Golden Horn The curve which it describes might be compared to the horn of a stag or as it should seem with more propriety to that of an ox eleven The epithet of golden was expressive of the riches which every wind wafted from the most distant countries into the secure and capacious port of Constantinople The River Lycus formed by the conflux of two little streams pours into the harbor a perpetual supply of fresh water which serves to cleanse the bottom and to invite the periodical shoals of fish to seek their retreat in that convenient recess As the vicissitudes of tides are scarcely felt in those seas the constant depth of the harbor allows goods to be landed on the quays without the assistance of boats and it has been observed that in many places the largest vessels may rest their prows against the houses while their sterns are floating in the water twelve From the mouth of the Lycus to that of the harbor this arm of the Bosphorus is more than seven miles in length The entrance is about five hundred yards broad and a strong chain could be occasionally drawn

Bosphorus to the entrance of the Hellespont is about one hundred and twenty miles Those who steer their westward course through the middle of the Propontis may at once descry the high lands of Thrace and Bithynia and never lose sight of the lofty summit of Mount Olympus covered with eternal snows fourteen They leave on the left a deep gulf at the bottom of which Nicomedia was seated the Imperial

the Propontis but contents himself with the vague expression of one day and one night s sail When Sandy s Travels p twenty one talks of one hundred fifty furlongs in length as well as breadth we can only suppose some mistake of the press in the text of that judicious traveller The geographers who with the most skilful accuracy have surveyed the form and extent of the Hellespont assign about sixty miles for the winding course and about three miles for the ordinary breadth of those celebrated straits fifteen But the narrowest part of the channel is found to the northward of the old Turkish castles between the cities of Sestus and Abydus It was here that the adventurous Leander braved the passage of the flood for the possession of his mistress sixteen It was here likewise in a place where the distance between the opposite banks cannot exceed five hundred paces that Xerxes imposed a stupendous bridge of boats for the purpose of transporting into Europe a hundred and seventy myriads of barbarians seventeen A sea contracted within such narrow limits may seem but ill to deserve the singular epithet of broad which Homer as well as Orpheus has frequently bestowed on the Hellespont seventeena But our ideas of greatness are of a relative nature the traveller and especially the poet who sailed along the Hellespont who pursued the windings of the stream and contemplated the rural scenery which appeared on every side to terminate the prospect insensibly lost the remembrance of the sea and his fancy painted those celebrated straits with all the attributes of a mighty river flowing with a swift current in the midst of a woody and inland country and at length through a wide mouth discharging itself into the Aegean or Archipelago eighteen Ancient Troy nineteen seated on a an eminence at the foot of Mount Ida overlooked the mouth of the Hellespont which scarcely received an accession of waters from the tribute of those immortal rivulets the Simois and Scamander The Grecian camp had stretched twelve miles along the shore from the Sigaean to the Rhaetean promontory and the flanks of the army were guarded by the bravest chiefs who fought under the banners of Agamemnon The first of those promontories was occupied by Achilles with his invincible myrmidons and the dauntless Ajax pitched his tents on the other After Ajax had fallen a sacrifice to his disappointed pride and to the ingratitude of the Greeks his sepulchre was erected on the ground where he had defended the navy against the rage of Jove and of Hector and the citizens of the rising town of Rhaeteum celebrated his memory with divine honors twenty Before Constantine gave a just preference to the situation of Byzantium he had conceived the design of erecting the seat of empire on this celebrated spot from whence the Romans derived their fabulous origin The extensive plain which lies below ancient Troy towards the Rhaetean promontory and the tomb of Ajax was first chosen for his new capital and though the undertaking was soon relinquished the stately remains of unfinished walls and towers attracted the notice of all who sailed through the straits of the Hellespont twenty

Zonaras as the intended capital They both suppose with very little probability that the emperor if he had not been prevented by a prodigy would have repeated the mistake of the blind Chalcedonians We are at present qualified to view the advantageous position of Constantinople which appears to have been formed by nature for the centre and capital of a great monarchy Situated in the forty first degree of latitude the Imperial city commanded from her seven hills twenty two the opposite shores of Europe and Asia the climate was healthy and temperate the soil fertile the harbor secure and capacious and the approach on the side of the continent was of small extent and easy defence The Bosphorus and the Hellespont may be considered as the two gates of Constantinople and the prince who possessed those important passages could always shut them against a naval enemy and open them to the fleets of commerce The preservation of the eastern provinces may in some degree be ascribed to the policy of Constantine as the barbarians of the Euxine who in the preceding age had poured their armaments into the heart of the Mediterranean soon desisted from the exercise of piracy and despaired of forcing this insurmountable barrier When the gates of the Hellespont and Bosphorus were shut the capital still enjoyed within their spacious enclosure every production which could supply the wants or gratify the luxury of its numerous inhabitants The sea coasts of Thrace and Bithynia which languish under the weight of Turkish oppression still exhibit a rich prospect of vineyards of gardens and of plentiful harvests and the Propontis has ever been renowned for an inexhaustible store of the most exquisite fish that are taken in their stated seasons without skill and almost without labor twenty three But when the passages of the straits were thrown open for trade they alternately admitted the natural and artificial riches of the north and south of the Euxine and of the Mediterranean Whatever rude commodities were collected in the forests of Germany and Scythia and far as the sources of the Tanais and the Borysthenes whatsoever was manufactured by the skill of Europe or Asia the corn of Egypt and the gems and spices of the farthest India were brought by the varying winds into the port of Constantinople which for many ages attracted the commerce of the ancient world twenty four See

Europa habet in conspectu Asiam Egyptum Africamque a dextra quae tametsi contiguae non sunt maris tamen navigandique commoditate veluti junguntur A sinistra vero Pontus est Euxinus c The prospect of beauty of safety and of wealth united in a single spot was sufficient to justify the choice of Constantine But as some decent mixture of prodigy and fable has in every age been supposed to reflect a becoming majesty on the origin of great cities twenty five the emperor was desirous of ascribing his resolution not so much to the uncertain counsels of human policy as to the infallible and eternal decrees of divine wisdom In one of his laws he has been careful to instruct posterity that in obedience to the commands of God he laid the everlasting foundations of Constantinople twenty six and though he has not condescended to relate in what manner the celestial inspiration was communicated to his mind the defect of his modest silence has been liberally supplied by the ingenuity of succeeding writers who describe the nocturnal vision which appeared to the fancy of Constantine as he slept within the walls of Byzantium The tutelar genius of the city a venerable matron sinking under the weight of years and infirmities was suddenly transformed into a blooming maid whom his own hands adorned with all the symbols of Imperial greatness twenty seven The monarch awoke interpreted the auspicious omen and obeyed without hesitation the will of Heaven The day which gave birth to a city or colony was celebrated by the Romans with such ceremonies as had been ordained by a generous superstition twenty eight and though Constantine might omit some rites which savored too strongly of their Pagan origin yet he was anxious to leave a deep impression of hope and respect on the minds of the spectators On foot with a lance in his hand the emperor himself led the solemn procession and directed the line which was traced as the boundary of the destined capital till the growing circumference was observed with astonishment by the assistants who at length ventured to observe that he had already exceeded the most ample measure of a great city I shall still advance replied Constantine till He the invisible guide who marches before me thinks proper to stop twenty nine Without presuming to investigate the nature or motives of this extraordinary conductor we shall content

seven hundred fifty eight a dissertation of M d Anville on the extent of Constantinople He takes the plan inserted in the Imperium Orientale of Banduri as the most complete but by a series of very nice observations he reduced the extravagant proportion of the scale and instead of nine thousand five hundred determines the circumference of the city as consisting of about seven thousand eight hundred French toises In the actual state of the city the palace and gardens of the Seraglio occupy the eastern promontory the first of the seven hills and cover about one hundred and fifty acres of our own measure The seat of Turkish jealousy and despotism is erected on the foundations of a Grecian republic but it may be supposed that the Byzantines were tempted by the conveniency of the harbor to extend their habitations on that side beyond the modern limits of the Seraglio The new walls of Constantine stretched from the port to the Propontis across the enlarged breadth of the triangle at the distance of fifteen stadia from the ancient fortification and with the city of Byzantium they enclosed five of the seven hills which to the eyes of those who approach Constantinople appear to rise above each other in beautiful order thirty one About a century after the death of the founder the new buildings extending on one side up the harbor and on the other along the Propontis already covered the narrow ridge of the sixth and the broad summit of the seventh hill The necessity of protecting those suburbs from the incessant inroads of the barbarians engaged the younger Theodosius to surround his capital with an adequate and permanent enclosure of walls thirty two From the eastern promontory to the golden gate the extreme length of Constantinople was about three Roman miles thirty three the circumference measured between ten and eleven and the surface might be computed as equal to about two thousand English acres It is impossible to justify the vain and credulous exaggerations of modern travellers who have sometimes stretched the limits of Constantinople over the adjacent villages of the European and even of the Asiatic coast thirty four But the suburbs of Pera and Galata though situate beyond the harbor may deserve to be considered as a part of the city thirty five and this addition may perhaps authorize the measure of a Byzantine historian who assigns sixteen Greek about fourteen Roman miles for the circumference of his native city thirty six Such an extent may not seem unworthy of an Imperial residence Yet Constantinople must yield to Babylon and Thebes thirty seven to ancient Rome to London and even to Paris thirty eight Footnote thirty one Codinus Antiquitat Const p twelve He assigns the church of saint Anthony as the boundary on the side of the harbor It

that these were Greek feet the proportion of which has been ingeniously determined by M d Anville He compares the one hundred eighty feet with seventy eight Hashemite cubits which in different writers are assigned for the heights of saint Sophia Each of these cubits was equal to twenty seven French inches Footnote thirty four The accurate Thevenot l i c fifteen walked in one hour and three quarters round two of the sides of the triangle from the Kiosk of the Seraglio to the seven towers D Anville examines with care and receives with confidence this decisive testimony which gives a circumference of ten or twelve miles The extravagant computation of Tournefort Lettre XI of thirty tour or thirty miles without including Scutari is a strange departure from his usual character Footnote thirty five The sycae or fig trees formed the thirteenth region and were very much embellished by Justinian It has since borne the names of Pera and Galata The etymology of the former is obvious that of the latter is unknown See Ducange Const l i c twenty two and Gyllius de Byzant l iv c ten Footnote thirty six One hundred and eleven stadia which may be translated into modern Greek miles each of seven

Compare D Anville Mem de l Academie tom xxviii p two hundred thirty five with his Description de l Egypte p two hundred one two hundred two Footnote thirty eight If we divide Constantinople and Paris into equal squares of fifty French toises the former contains eight hundred fifty and the latter eleven sixty of those divisions Chapter XVII Foundation Of Constantinople Part II The master of the Roman world who aspired to erect an eternal monument of the glories of his reign could employ in the prosecution of that great work the wealth the labor and all that yet remained of the genius of obedient millions Some estimate may be formed of the expense bestowed with Imperial liberality on the foundation of Constantinople by the allowance of about two millions five hundred thousand pounds for the construction of the walls the porticos and the aqueducts thirty nine The forests that overshadowed the shores of the Euxine and the celebrated quarries of white marble in the little island of Proconnesus supplied an inexhaustible stock of materials ready to be conveyed by the convenience of a short water carriage to the harbor of Byzantium forty A multitude of laborers and artificers urged the conclusion of the work with incessant toil but the impatience of Constantine soon discovered that in the decline of the arts the skill as well as numbers of his architects bore a very unequal proportion to the greatness of his designs The magistrates of the most distant provinces were therefore directed to institute schools to appoint professors and by the hopes of rewards and privileges to engage in the study and practice of architecture a sufficient number of ingenious youths who had received a liberal education forty one The buildings of the new city were executed by such artificers as the reign of Constantine could afford but they were decorated by the hands of the most celebrated masters of the age of Pericles and Alexander To revive the genius of Phidias and Lysippus surpassed indeed the power of a Roman emperor but the immortal productions which they had bequeathed to posterity were exposed without defence to the rapacious vanity of a despot By his commands the cities of Greece and Asia were despoiled of their most valuable ornaments forty two The trophies of memorable wars the objects of religious veneration the most finished statues of the gods and heroes of the sages and poets of ancient times contributed to the splendid triumph of Constantinople and gave occasion to the remark of the historian Cedrenus forty three who observes with some enthusiasm that nothing seemed wanting except the souls of the illustrious men whom these admirable monuments were intended to represent But it is not in the city of Constantine nor in the declining period of an empire when the human mind was depressed by civil and religious slavery that we should seek for the souls of Homer and of Demosthenes Footnote thirty nine Six hundred centenaries or sixty thousand pounds weight of gold This sum is taken from Codinus Antiquit Const p eleven but unless that contemptible author had derived his information from some purer sources he

copied the style of a more fortunate age During the siege of Byzantium the conqueror had pitched his tent on the commanding eminence of the second hill To perpetuate the memory of his success he chose the same advantageous position for the principal Forum forty four which appears to have been of a circular or rather elliptical form The two opposite entrances formed triumphal arches the porticos which enclosed it on every side were filled with statues and the centre of the Forum was occupied by a lofty column of which a mutilated fragment is now degraded by the appellation of the burnt pillar This column was erected on a pedestal of white marble twenty feet high and was composed of ten pieces of porphyry each of which measured about ten feet in height and about thirty three in circumference forty five On the summit of the pillar above one hundred and twenty feet from the ground stood the colossal statue of Apollo It was a bronze had been transported either from Athens or from a town of Phrygia and was supposed to be the work of Phidias The artist had represented the god of day or as it was afterwards interpreted the emperor Constantine himself with a sceptre in his right hand the globe of the world in his left and a crown of rays glittering on his head forty six The Circus or Hippodrome was a stately building about four hundred paces in length and one hundred in breadth forty seven The space between the two metoe or goals were filled with statues and obelisks and we may still remark a very singular fragment of antiquity the bodies of three serpents twisted into one pillar of brass Their triple heads had once supported the golden tripod which after the defeat of Xerxes was consecrated in the temple of Delphi by the victorious Greeks forty eight The beauty of the Hippodrome has been long since defaced by the rude hands of the Turkish conquerors forty eighta but under the similar appellation of Atmeidan it still serves as a place of exercise for their horses From the throne whence the emperor viewed the Circensian games a winding staircase forty nine descended to the palace a magnificent edifice which scarcely yielded to the residence of Rome itself and which together with the dependent courts gardens and porticos covered a considerable extent of ground upon the banks of the Propontis between the Hippodrome and the church of saint Sophia fifty We might likewise celebrate the baths which still retained the name of Zeuxippus after they had been enriched by the munificence of Constantine with lofty columns various marbles and above threescore statues of bronze fifty one But we should deviate from the design of this history if we attempted minutely to describe the different buildings or quarters of the city It may be sufficient to observe that whatever could adorn the dignity of a great capital or contribute to the benefit or pleasure of its numerous inhabitants was contained within the walls of Constantinople A particular description composed about a century after its foundation enumerates a capitol or school of learning a circus two theatres eight public and one hundred and fifty three private baths fifty two porticos

order of Constantine and among these the serpentine pillar of the Hippodrome is particularly mentioned three All the European travellers who have visited Constantinople from Buondelmonte to Pocock

Zeuxippus was an epithet of Jupiter and the baths were a part of old Byzantium The difficulty of assigning their true situation has not been felt by Ducange History seems to connect them with saint

only reckoned seventeen eighty large houses domus but the word must have had a more dignified signification No insulae are mentioned at Constantinople The old capital consisted of forty two streets

empire the remote and the immediate consequences of that memorable event were strangely confounded by the vanity of the Greeks and the credulity of the Latins fifty three It was asserted and believed that all the noble families of Rome the senate and the equestrian order with their innumerable attendants had followed their emperor to the banks of the Propontis that a spurious race of strangers and plebeians was left to possess the solitude of the ancient capital and that the lands of Italy long since converted into gardens were at once deprived of cultivation and inhabitants fifty four In the course of this history such exaggerations will be reduced to their just value yet since the growth of Constantinople cannot be ascribed to the general increase of mankind and of industry it must be admitted that this artificial colony was raised at the expense of the ancient cities of the empire Many opulent senators of Rome and of the eastern provinces were probably invited by Constantine to adopt for their country the fortunate spot which he had chosen for his own residence The invitations of a master are scarcely to be distinguished from commands and the liberality of the emperor obtained a ready and cheerful obedience He bestowed on his favorites the palaces which he had built in the several quarters of the city assigned them lands and pensions for the support of their dignity fifty five and alienated the demesnes of Pontus and Asia to grant hereditary estates by the easy tenure of maintaining a house in the capital fifty six But these encouragements and obligations soon became superfluous and were gradually abolished Wherever the seat of government is fixed a considerable part of the public revenue will be expended by the prince himself by his ministers by the officers of justice and by the domestics of the palace The most wealthy of the provincials will be attracted by the powerful motives of interest and duty of amusement and curiosity A third and more numerous class of inhabitants will insensibly be formed of servants of artificers and of merchants who derive their subsistence from their own labor and from the wants or luxury of the superior ranks In less than a century Constantinople disputed with Rome itself the preeminence of riches and numbers New piles of buildings crowded together with too little regard to health or convenience scarcely allowed the intervals of narrow streets for the perpetual throng of men of horses and of carriages The allotted space of ground was insufficient to contain the increasing people and the additional

to the harvests of Africa which had been purchased with their blood and it was artfully contrived by Augustus that in the enjoyment of plenty the Romans should lose the memory of freedom But the prodigality of Constantine could not be excused by any consideration either of public or private interest and the annual tribute of corn imposed upon Egypt for the benefit of his new capital was applied to feed a lazy and insolent populace at the expense of the husbandmen of an industrious province fifty nine fifty ninea Some other regulations of this emperor are less liable to blame but they

the old and the new capital As Constantine urged the progress of the work with the impatience of a lover the walls the porticos and the principal edifices were completed in a few years or according to another account in a few months sixty four but this extraordinary diligence should excite the less admiration since many of the buildings were finished in so hasty and imperfect a manner that under the succeeding reign they were preserved with difficulty from impending ruin sixty five But while they displayed the vigor and freshness of youth the founder prepared to celebrate the dedication of

the singular picture of a great empire but will tend to illustrate the secret and internal causes of its rapid decay In the pursuit of any remarkable institution we may be frequently led into the more early or the more recent times of the Roman history but the proper limits of this inquiry will be included within a period of about one hundred and thirty years from the accession of Constantine to the publication of the Theodosian code seventy one from which as well as from the Notitia seventy onea of the East and West seventy two we derive the most copious and authentic information of the state of the empire This variety of objects will suspend for some time the course of the narrative but the interruption will be censured only by those readers who are insensible to the importance of laws and manners while they peruse with eager curiosity the transient intrigues of a court or the accidental event of a battle Footnote seventy one The Theodosian code was promulgated A D four hundred

legions c It resembles our court almanacs Red Books with this single difference that our almanacs name the persons in office the Notitia only the offices It is of the time of the emperor Theodosius II that is to say of the fifth century when the empire was divided into the Eastern and Western It is probable that it was not made for the first time and that descriptions of the same kind existed before G Footnote seventy two Pancirolus in his elaborate Commentary assigns to the Notitia a date almost similar to that of the Theodosian Code but his proofs or rather conjectures are extremely feeble I should be rather inclined to place this useful work between the final division of the empire A D three hundred ninety five and the successful invasion of Gaul by the barbarians A D four hundred seven See Histoire des Anciens Peuples de l Europe tom vii p forty Chapter XVII Foundation Of Constantinople Part III The manly pride of the Romans content with substantial power had left to the vanity of the East the forms and ceremonies of ostentatious greatness seventy three But when they lost even the semblance of those virtues which were derived from their ancient freedom the simplicity of Roman manners was insensibly corrupted by the stately affectation of the courts of Asia The distinctions of personal merit and influence so conspicuous in a republic so feeble and obscure under a monarchy were abolished by the despotism of the emperors who substituted in their room a severe subordination of rank and office from the titled slaves who were seated on the steps of the throne to the meanest instruments of arbitrary power This multitude of abject dependants was interested in the support of the actual government from the dread of a revolution which might at once confound their hopes and intercept the reward of their services In this divine hierarchy for such it is frequently styled every rank was marked with the most scrupulous exactness and its dignity was displayed in a variety of trifling and solemn ceremonies which it was a study to learn and a sacrilege to neglect seventy four The purity of the Latin language was debased by adopting in the intercourse of pride and flattery a profusion of epithets which Tully would scarcely have understood and which Augustus would have rejected with indignation The principal officers of the empire were saluted even by the sovereign himself with the deceitful titles of your Sincerity your Gravity your Excellency your Eminence your sublime and wonderful Magnitude your illustrious and magnificent Highness seventy five The codicils or patents of their office were curiously emblazoned with such emblems as were best adapted to explain its nature and high dignity the image or portrait of the reigning emperors a triumphal car the book of mandates placed on a table covered with a rich carpet and illuminated by four tapers the allegorical figures of the provinces which they governed or the appellations and standards of the troops whom they commanded Some of these official ensigns were really exhibited in their hall of audience others preceded their pompous march whenever they appeared in public and every circumstance of their demeanor their dress their ornaments and their train was calculated to inspire a deep reverence for the representatives of supreme majesty By a philosophic observer the system of the Roman government might have been mistaken for a splendid theatre filled with players of every character and degree who repeated the language and imitated the passions of their original model seventy six Footnote seventy three Scilicet externae superbiae sueto non inerat notitia nostri perhaps nostroe apud quos vis Imperii valet inania transmittuntur Tacit Annal xv

duties of the officers in the Imperial court M Footnote seventy six Pancirolus ad Notitiam utriusque Imperii p thirty nine But his explanations are obscure and he does not sufficiently distinguish the painted emblems from the effective ensigns of office All the magistrates of sufficient importance to find a place in the general state of the empire were accurately divided into three classes one The Illustrious two The Spectabiles or Respectable And three the Clarissimi whom we may translate by the word Honorable In the times of Roman simplicity the last mentioned epithet was used only as a vague expression of deference till it became at length the peculiar and appropriated title of all who were members of the senate seventy seven and consequently of all who from that venerable body were selected to govern the provinces The vanity of those who from their rank and office might claim a superior distinction above the rest of the senatorial order was long afterwards indulged with the new appellation of Respectable but the title of Illustrious was always reserved to some eminent personages who were obeyed or reverenced by the two subordinate classes It was communicated only I To the consuls and patricians II To the Praetorian praefects with the praefects of Rome and Constantinople III To the masters general of the cavalry and the infantry and IV To the seven ministers of the palace who exercised their sacred functions about the person of the emperor seventy eight Among those illustrious magistrates who were esteemed coordinate with each other the seniority of appointment gave place to the union of dignities seventy nine By the expedient of honorary codicils the emperors who were fond of multiplying their favors might sometimes gratify the vanity though not the ambition of impatient courtiers eighty Footnote seventy seven In the Pandects which may be referred to the reigns of the Antonines Clarissimus is the ordinary and legal title of a senator Footnote

dignity Footnote seventy nine Cod Theodos l vi tit vi The rules of precedency are ascertained with the most minute accuracy by the emperors and illustrated with equal prolixity by their learned interpreter Footnote eighty Cod Theodos l vi tit xxii I As long as the Roman consuls were the first magistrates of a free state they derived their right to power from the choice of the people As long as the emperors condescended to disguise the servitude which they imposed the consuls were still elected by the real or apparent suffrage of the senate From the reign of Diocletian even these vestiges of liberty were abolished and the successful candidates who were invested with the annual honors of the consulship affected to deplore the humiliating condition of their predecessors The Scipios and the Catos had been reduced to solicit the votes of plebeians to pass through the tedious and expensive forms of a popular election and to expose their dignity to the shame of a public refusal while their own happier fate had reserved them for an age and government in which the rewards of virtue were assigned by the unerring wisdom of a gracious sovereign eighty one In the epistles which the emperor addressed to the two consuls elect it was declared that they were created by his sole authority eighty two Their names and portraits engraved on gilt tables of ivory were dispersed over the empire as presents to the provinces the cities the magistrates the senate and the people eighty three Their solemn inauguration was performed at the place of the Imperial residence and during a period of one hundred and twenty years Rome was constantly deprived of the presence of her ancient magistrates eighty four Footnote eighty one Ausonius in Gratiarum Actione basely expatiates on this unworthy

of one hundred and twenty years during which the emperors were always absent from Rome on the first day of January See the Chronologie de Tillemonte tom iii iv and v On the morning of the first of January the consuls assumed the ensigns of their dignity Their dress was a robe of purple embroidered in silk and gold and sometimes ornamented with costly gems eighty five On this solemn occasion they were attended by the most eminent officers of the state and army in the habit of senators and the useless fasces armed with the once formidable axes were borne before them by the lictors eighty six The procession moved from the palace eighty seven to the Forum or principal square of the city where the consuls ascended their tribunal and seated themselves in the curule chairs which were framed after the fashion of ancient times They immediately exercised an act of jurisdiction by the manumission of a slave who was brought before them for that purpose and the ceremony was intended to represent the celebrated action of the elder Brutus the author of liberty and of the consulship when he admitted among his fellow citizens the faithful Vindex who had revealed the conspiracy of the Tarquins eighty eight The public festival was continued during several days in all the principal cities in Rome from custom in Constantinople from imitation in Carthage Antioch and Alexandria from the love of pleasure and the superfluity of wealth eighty nine In the two capitals of the empire the annual games of the theatre the circus and the amphitheatre ninety cost four thousand pounds of gold about one hundred and sixty thousand pounds sterling and if so heavy an expense surpassed the faculties or the inclinations of the magistrates themselves the sum was supplied from the Imperial treasury ninety one As soon as the consuls had discharged these customary duties they were at liberty to retire into the shade of private life and to enjoy during the remainder of the year the undisturbed contemplation of their own greatness They no longer presided in the national councils they no longer executed the resolutions of peace or war Their abilities unless they were employed in more effective offices were of little moment and their names served only as the legal date of the year in which they had filled the chair of Marius and of Cicero Yet it was still felt and acknowledged in the last period of Roman servitude that this empty name might be compared and even preferred to the possession of substantial power The title of consul was still the most splendid object of ambition the noblest reward of virtue and loyalty The emperors themselves who disdained the faint shadow of the republic were conscious that they acquired an additional splendor and majesty as often as they assumed the annual honors of the consular dignity ninety two Footnote eighty five See Claudian in Cons Prob et Olybrii one hundred seventy eight c and in iv Cons Honorii five hundred eighty

the servile court of Constantius See the Abbe de la Bleterie Memoires de l Academie tom xxiv p two hundred eighty nine who delights to pursue the vestiges of the old constitution and who sometimes finds them in his copious fancy The proudest and most perfect separation which can be found in any age or country between the nobles and the people is perhaps that of the Patricians and the Plebeians as it was established in the first age of the Roman republic Wealth and honors the offices of the state and the ceremonies of religion were almost exclusively possessed by the former who preserving the purity of their blood with the most insulting jealousy ninety three held their clients in a condition of specious vassalage But these distinctions so incompatible with the spirit of a free people were removed after a long struggle by the persevering efforts of the Tribunes The most active and successful of the Plebeians accumulated wealth aspired to honors deserved triumphs contracted alliances and after some generations assumed the pride of ancient nobility ninety four The Patrician families on the other hand whose original number was never recruited till the end of the commonwealth either failed in the ordinary course of nature or were extinguished in so many foreign and domestic wars or through a want of merit or fortune insensibly mingled with the mass of the people ninety five Very few remained who could derive their pure and genuine origin from the infancy of the city or even from that of the republic when Caesar and Augustus Claudius and Vespasian created from the body of the senate a competent number of new Patrician families in the hope of perpetuating an order which was still considered as honorable and sacred ninety six But these artificial supplies in which the reigning house was always included were rapidly swept away by the rage of tyrants by frequent revolutions by the change of manners and by the intermixture of nations ninety seven Little more was left when Constantine ascended the throne than a vague and imperfect tradition that the Patricians had once been the first of the Romans To form a body of nobles whose influence may restrain while it secures the authority of the monarch would have been very inconsistent with the character and policy of Constantine but had he seriously entertained such a design it might have exceeded the measure of his power to ratify by an arbitrary edict an institution which must expect the sanction of time and of opinion He revived indeed the title of Patricians but he revived it as a personal not as an hereditary distinction They yielded only to the transient superiority of the annual consuls but they enjoyed the pre eminence over all the great officers of state with the most familiar access to the person of the prince This honorable rank was bestowed on them for life and as they were usually favorites and ministers who had grown old in the Imperial court the true etymology of the word was perverted by ignorance and flattery and the Patricians of Constantine were reverenced as the adopted Fathers of the emperor and the republic ninety eight Footnote ninety three Intermarriages between the Patricians and Plebeians were prohibited by the laws of the XII Tables and the uniform operations of human nature may attest that the custom survived the law See in Livy iv one six the pride of family urged by the consul and the rights of mankind asserted by the tribune Canuleius Footnote ninety four See the animated picture drawn by Sallust in the Jugurthine war of the pride of the nobles and even of the virtuous Metellus who was unable to brook the idea that the honor of the consulship should be bestowed on the obscure merit of his lieutenant Marius c sixty four Two hundred years before the race of the Metelli themselves were confounded among the Plebeians of Rome and from the etymology of their name of Coecilius there is reason to believe that those haughty nobles derived their origin from a sutler Footnote ninety five In the year of Rome eight hundred very few remained not only of the old Patrician families but even of those which had been created by Caesar and Augustus Tacit Annal xi twenty five The family of Scaurus a branch of the Patrician Aemilii was degraded so low that his father who exercised the trade of a charcoal merchant left him only teu slaves and somewhat less than three hundred pounds sterling Valerius Maximus l iv c four n eleven Aurel Victor in Scauro The family was saved from oblivion by the merit of the son Footnote ninety six Tacit Annal xi twenty five Dion Cassius l iii p six hundred ninety eight The virtues of Agricola who was created a Patrician by the emperor Vespasian reflected honor on that ancient order but his ancestors had not any claim beyond an Equestrian nobility Footnote ninety seven This failure would have been almost impossible if it were true as Casaubon compels Aurelius Victor to affirm ad Sueton in Caesar v twenty four See Hist August p two hundred three and Casaubon Comment p two hundred twenty that Vespasian created at once a thousand Patrician families But this extravagant number is too much even for the whole Senatorial order unless we should include all the Roman knights who were distinguished by the permission of wearing the laticlave Footnote ninety eight Zosimus l ii p one hundred eighteen and Godefroy ad Cod Theodos l vi tit vi II The fortunes of the Praetorian praefects were essentially different from those of the consuls and Patricians The latter saw their ancient greatness evaporate in a vain title The former rising by degrees from the most humble condition were invested with the civil and military administration of the Roman world From the reign of Severus to that of Diocletian the guards and the palace the laws and the finances the armies and the provinces were intrusted to their superintending care and like the Viziers of the East they held with one hand the seal and with the other the standard of the empire The ambition of the praefects always formidable and sometimes fatal to the masters whom they served was supported by the strength of the Praetorian bands but after those haughty troops had been weakened by Diocletian and finally suppressed by Constantine the praefects who survived their fall were reduced without difficulty to the station of useful and obedient ministers When they were no longer responsible for the safety of the emperor s person they resigned the jurisdiction which they had hitherto claimed and exercised over all the departments of the palace They were deprived by Constantine of all military command as soon as they had ceased to lead into the field under their immediate orders the flower of the Roman troops and at length by a singular revolution the captains of the guards were transformed into the civil magistrates of the provinces According to the plan of government instituted by Diocletian the four princes had each their Praetorian praefect and after the monarchy was once more united in the person of Constantine he still continued to create the same number of Four Praefects and intrusted to their care the same provinces which they already administered one The praefect of the East stretched his ample jurisdiction into the three parts of the globe which were subject to the Romans from the cataracts of the Nile to the banks of the Phasis and from the mountains of Thrace to the frontiers of Persia two The important provinces of Pannonia Dacia Macedonia and Greece once acknowledged the authority of the praefect of Illyricum three The power of the praefect of Italy was not confined to the country from whence he derived his title it extended over the additional territory of Rhaetia as far as the banks of the Danube over the dependent islands of the Mediterranean and over that part of the continent of Africa which lies between the confines of Cyrene and those of Tingitania four The praefect of the Gauls comprehended under that plural denomination the kindred provinces of Britain and Spain and his authority was obeyed from the wall of Antoninus to the foot of Mount Atlas ninety nine Footnote ninety nine Zosimus l ii p one hundred nine one hundred ten If we had not fortunately possessed this satisfactory account of the division of the power and provinces of the Praetorian praefects we should frequently have been perplexed amidst the copious details of the Code and the circumstantial minuteness of the Notitia After the Praetorian praefects had been dismissed from all military command the civil functions which they were ordained to exercise over so many subject nations were adequate to the ambition and abilities of the most consummate ministers To their wisdom was committed the supreme administration of justice and of the finances the two objects which in a state of peace comprehend almost all the respective duties of the sovereign and of the people of the former to protect the citizens who are obedient to the laws of the latter to contribute the share of their property which is required for the expenses of the state The coin the highways the posts the granaries the manufactures whatever could interest the public prosperity was moderated by the authority of the Praetorian praefects As the immediate representatives of the Imperial majesty they were empowered to explain to enforce and on some occasions to modify the general edicts by their discretionary proclamations They watched over the conduct of the provincial governors removed the negligent and inflicted punishments on the guilty From all the inferior jurisdictions an appeal in every matter of importance either civil or criminal might be brought before the tribunal of the praefect but his sentence was final and absolute and the emperors themselves refused to admit any complaints against the judgment or the integrity of a magistrate whom they honored with such unbounded confidence one hundred His appointments were suitable to his dignity one hundred one and if avarice was his ruling passion he enjoyed frequent opportunities of collecting a rich harvest of fees of presents and of perquisites Though the emperors no longer dreaded the ambition of their praefects they were attentive to counterbalance the power of this great office by the uncertainty and shortness of its duration one hundred two Footnote one hundred See a law of Constantine himself A praefectis autem praetorio provocare non sinimus Cod Justinian l vii tit lxii leg

to the masters of the horse of the ancient dictators Pandect l i tit xi Footnote one hundred one When Justinian in the exhausted condition of the empire instituted a Praetorian praefect for Africa he allowed him a salary of one hundred pounds of gold Cod Justinian l i tit xxvii leg i Footnote one hundred two For this and the other dignities of the empire it may be sufficient to refer to the ample commentaries of Pancirolus and Godefroy who have diligently collected and accurately digested in their proper order all the legal and historical materials From those authors doctor Howell History of the World vol ii p twenty four seventy seven has deduced a very distinct abridgment of the state of the Roman empire From their superior importance and dignity Rome and Constantinople were alone excepted from the jurisdiction of the Praetorian praefects The immense size of the city and the experience of the tardy ineffectual operation of the laws had furnished the policy of Augustus with a specious pretence for introducing a new magistrate who alone could restrain a servile and turbulent populace by the strong arm of arbitrary power one hundred three Valerius Messalla was appointed the first praefect of Rome that his reputation might countenance so invidious a measure but at the end of a few days that accomplished citizen one hundred four resigned his office declaring with a spirit worthy of the friend of Brutus that he found himself incapable of exercising a power incompatible with public freedom one hundred five As the sense of liberty became less exquisite the advantages of order were more clearly understood and the praefect who seemed to have been designed as a terror only to slaves and vagrants was permitted to extend his civil and criminal jurisdiction over the equestrian and noble families of Rome The praetors annually created as the judges of law and equity could not long dispute the possession of the Forum with a vigorous and permanent magistrate who was usually admitted into the confidence of the prince Their courts were deserted their number which had once fluctuated between twelve and eighteen one hundred six was gradually reduced to two or three and their important functions were confined to the expensive obligation one hundred seven of exhibiting games for the amusement of the people After the office of the Roman consuls had been changed into a vain pageant which was rarely displayed in the capital the praefects assumed their vacant place in the senate and were soon acknowledged as the ordinary presidents of that venerable assembly They received appeals from the distance of one hundred miles and it was allowed as a principle of jurisprudence that all municipal authority was derived from them alone one hundred eight In the discharge of his laborious employment the governor of Rome was assisted by fifteen officers some of whom had been originally his equals or even his superiors The principal departments were relative to the command of a numerous watch established as a safeguard against fires robberies and nocturnal disorders the custody and distribution of the public allowance of corn and provisions the care of the port of the aqueducts of the common sewers and of the navigation and bed of the Tyber the inspection of the markets the theatres and of the private as well as the public works Their vigilance insured the three principal objects of a regular police safety plenty and cleanliness and as a proof of the attention of government to preserve the splendor and ornaments of the capital a particular inspector was appointed for the statues the guardian as it were of that inanimate people which according to the extravagant computation of an old writer was scarcely inferior in number to the living inhabitants of Rome About thirty years after the foundation of Constantinople a similar magistrate was created in that rising metropolis for the same uses and with the same powers A perfect equality was established between the dignity of the two municipal and that of the four Praetorian praefects one hundred nine Footnote one hundred three Tacit Annal vi eleven Euseb in Chron p one hundred fifty five Dion Cassius in the oration of Maecenas l lvii p six hundred seventy five describes the prerogatives of the praefect of the city as they were established in his own time Footnote one hundred four The fame of Messalla has been scarcely equal to his merit In the earliest youth he was recommended by Cicero to the friendship of Brutus He followed the standard of the republic till it was broken in the fields of Philippi he then accepted and deserved the favor of the most moderate of the conquerors and uniformly asserted his freedom and dignity in the court of Augustus The triumph of Messalla was justified by the conquest of Aquitain As an orator he disputed the palm of eloquence with Cicero himself Messalla cultivated every muse and was the patron of every man of genius He spent his evenings in philosophic conversation with Horace assumed his place at table between Delia and Tibullus and amused his leisure by encouraging the poetical talents of young Ovid Footnote one hundred five

Footnote one hundred nine Besides our usual guides we may observe that Felix Cantelorius has written a separate treatise De Praefecto Urbis and that many curious details concerning the police of Rome and Constantinople are contained in the fourteenth book of the Theodosian Code Chapter XVII Foundation Of Constantinople Part IV Those who in the imperial hierarchy were distinguished by the title of Respectable formed an intermediate class between the illustrious praefects and the honorable magistrates of the provinces In this class the proconsuls of Asia Achaia and Africa claimed a preeminence which was yielded to the remembrance of their ancient dignity and the appeal from their tribunal to that of the praefects was almost the only mark of their dependence one hundred ten But the civil government of the empire was distributed into thirteen great Dioceses each of which equalled the just measure of a powerful kingdom The first of these dioceses was subject to the jurisdiction of the count of the east and we may convey some idea of the importance and variety of his functions by observing that six hundred apparitors who would be styled at present either secretaries or clerks or ushers or messengers were employed in his immediate office one hundred eleven The place of Augustal proefect of Egypt was no longer filled by a Roman knight but the name was retained and the extraordinary powers which the situation of the country and the temper of the inhabitants had once made indispensable were still continued to the governor The eleven remaining dioceses of Asiana Pontica and Thrace of Macedonia Dacia and Pannonia or Western Illyricum of Italy and Africa of Gaul Spain and Britain were governed by twelve vicars or vice proefects one hundred twelve whose name sufficiently explains the nature and dependence of their office It may be added that the lieutenant generals of the Roman armies the military counts and dukes who will be hereafter mentioned were allowed the rank and title of Respectable Footnote one hundred ten Eunapius affirms that the proconsul of Asia was independent of the praefect which must however be understood with some allowance the jurisdiction of the vice praefect he most assuredly disclaimed Pancirolus p one hundred sixty one Footnote one hundred eleven The proconsul of Africa had four hundred apparitors and they all received large salaries either from the treasury or the province See Pancirol p twenty six and Cod Justinian l xii tit lvi lvii Footnote one hundred twelve In Italy there was likewise the Vicar of Rome It has been much disputed whether his jurisdiction measured one hundred miles from the city or whether it stretched over the ten thousand provinces of Italy As the spirit of jealousy and ostentation prevailed in the councils of the emperors they proceeded with anxious diligence to divide the substance and to multiply the titles of power The vast countries which the Roman conquerors had united under the same simple form of administration were imperceptibly crumbled into minute fragments till at length the whole empire was distributed into one hundred and sixteen provinces each of which supported an expensive and splendid establishment Of these three were governed by proconsuls thirty seven by consulars five by correctors and seventy one by presidents The appellations of these magistrates were different they ranked in successive order the ensigns of and their situation from accidental circumstances might be more or less agreeable or advantageous But they were all excepting only the pro consuls alike included in the class of honorable persons and they were alike intrusted during the pleasure of the prince and under the authority of the praefects or their deputies with the administration of justice and the finances in their respective districts The ponderous volumes of the Codes and Pandects one hundred thirteen would furnish ample materials for a minute inquiry into the system of provincial government as in the space of six centuries it was approved by the wisdom of the Roman statesmen and lawyers It may be sufficient for the historian to select two singular and salutary provisions intended to restrain the abuse of authority one For the preservation of peace and order the governors of the provinces were armed with the sword of justice They inflicted corporal punishments and they exercised in capital offences the power of life and death But they were not authorized to indulge the condemned criminal with the choice of his own execution or to pronounce a sentence of the mildest and most honorable kind of exile These prerogatives were reserved to the praefects who alone could impose the heavy fine of fifty pounds of gold their vicegerents were confined to the trifling weight of a few ounces one hundred fourteen This distinction which seems to grant the larger while it denies the smaller degree of authority was founded on a very rational motive The smaller degree was infinitely more liable to abuse The passions of a provincial magistrate might frequently provoke him into acts of oppression which affected only the freedom or the fortunes of the subject though from a principle of prudence perhaps of humanity he might still be terrified by the guilt of innocent blood It may likewise be considered that exile considerable fines or the choice of an easy death relate more particularly to the rich and the noble and the persons the most exposed to the avarice or resentment of a provincial magistrate were thus removed from his obscure persecution to the more august and impartial tribunal of the Praetorian praefect two As it was reasonably apprehended that the integrity of the judge might be biased if his interest was concerned or his affections were engaged the strictest regulations were established to exclude any person without the special dispensation of the emperor from the government of the province where he was born one hundred fifteen and to prohibit the governor or his son from contracting marriage with a native or an inhabitant one hundred sixteen or from purchasing slaves lands or houses within the extent of his jurisdiction one hundred seventeen Notwithstanding these rigorous precautions the emperor Constantine after a reign of twenty five years still deplores the venal and oppressive administration of justice and expresses the warmest indignation that the audience of the judge his despatch of business his seasonable delays and his final sentence were publicly sold either by

were taught in all the considerable cities of the east and west but the most famous school was that of Berytus one hundred twenty on the coast of Phoenicia which flourished above three centuries from the time of Alexander Severus the author perhaps of an institution so advantageous to his native country After a regular course of education which lasted five years the students dispersed themselves through the provinces in search of fortune and honors nor could they want an inexhaustible supply of business in a great empire already corrupted by the multiplicity of laws of arts and of vices The court of the Praetorian praefect of the east could alone furnish employment for one hundred and fifty advocates sixty four of whom were distinguished by peculiar privileges and two were annually chosen with a salary of sixty pounds of gold to defend the causes of the treasury The first experiment was made of their judicial talents by appointing them to act occasionally as assessors to the magistrates from thence they were often raised to preside in the tribunals before which they had pleaded They obtained the government of a province and by the aid of merit of reputation or of favor they ascended by successive steps to the illustrious dignities of the state one hundred twenty one In the practice of the bar these men had considered reason as the instrument of dispute they interpreted the laws according to the dictates of private interest and the same pernicious habits might still adhere to their characters in the public administration of the state The honor of a liberal profession has indeed been vindicated by ancient and modern advocates who have filled the most important stations with pure integrity and consummate wisdom but in the decline of Roman jurisprudence the ordinary promotion of lawyers was pregnant with mischief and disgrace The noble art which had once been preserved as the sacred inheritance of the patricians was fallen into the hands of freedmen and plebeians one hundred twenty two who with cunning rather than with skill exercised a sordid and pernicious trade Some of them procured admittance into families for the purpose of fomenting differences of encouraging suits and of preparing a harvest of gain for themselves or their brethren Others recluse in their chambers maintained the dignity of legal professors by furnishing a rich client with subtleties to confound the plainest truths and with arguments to color the most unjustifiable pretensions The splendid and popular class was composed of the advocates who filled the Forum with the sound of their turgid and loquacious rhetoric Careless of fame and of justice they are described for the most part as ignorant and rapacious guides who conducted their clients through a maze of expense of delay and of disappointment from whence after a tedious series of years they were at length dismissed when their patience and fortune were almost exhausted one hundred twenty three

many camels might have been laden with law books Eunapius in Vit Aedesii p seventy two III In the system of policy introduced by Augustus the governors those at least of the Imperial provinces were invested with the full powers of the sovereign himself Ministers of peace and war the distribution of rewards and punishments depended on them alone and they successively appeared on their tribunal in the robes of civil magistracy and in complete armor at the head of the Roman legions one hundred twenty four The influence of the revenue the authority of law and the command of a military force concurred to render their power supreme and absolute and whenever they were tempted to violate their allegiance the loyal province which they involved in their rebellion was scarcely sensible of any change in its political state From the time of Commodus to the reign of Constantine near one hundred governors might be enumerated who with various success erected the standard of revolt and though the innocent were too often sacrificed the guilty might be sometimes prevented by the suspicious cruelty of their master one hundred twenty five To secure his throne and the public tranquillity from these formidable servants Constantine resolved to divide the military from the civil administration and to establish as a permanent and professional distinction a practice which had been adopted only as an occasional expedient The supreme jurisdiction exercised by the Praetorian praefects over the armies of the empire was transferred to the two masters general whom he instituted the one for the cavalry the other for the infantry and though each of these illustrious officers was more peculiarly responsible for the discipline of those troops which were under his immediate inspection they both indifferently commanded in the field the several bodies whether of horse or foot which were united in the same army one hundred twenty six Their number was soon doubled by the division of the east and west and as separate generals of the same rank and title were appointed on the four important frontiers of the Rhine of the Upper and the Lower Danube and of the Euphrates the defence of the Roman empire was at length committed to eight masters general of the cavalry and infantry Under their orders thirty five military commanders were stationed in the provinces three in Britain six in Gaul one in Spain one in Italy five on the Upper and four on the Lower Danube in Asia eight three in Egypt and four in Africa The titles of counts and dukes one hundred twenty seven by which they were properly distinguished have obtained in modern languages so very different a sense that the use of them may occasion some surprise But it should be recollected that the second of those appellations is only a corruption of the Latin word which was indiscriminately applied to any military chief All these provincial generals were therefore dukes but no more than ten among them were dignified with the rank of counts or companions a title of honor or rather of favor which had been recently invented in the court of Constantine A gold belt was the ensign which distinguished the office of the counts and dukes and besides their pay they received a liberal allowance sufficient to maintain one hundred and ninety servants and one hundred and fifty eight horses They were strictly prohibited from interfering in any matter which related to the administration of justice or the revenue but the command which they exercised over the troops of their department was independent of the authority of the magistrates About the same time that Constantine gave a legal sanction to the ecclesiastical order he instituted in the Roman empire the nice balance of the civil and the military powers The emulation and sometimes the discord which reigned between two professions of opposite interests and incompatible manners was productive of beneficial and of pernicious consequences It was seldom to be expected that the general and the civil governor of a province should either conspire for the disturbance or should unite for the service of their country While the one delayed to offer the assistance which the other disdained to solicit the troops very frequently remained without orders or without supplies the public safety was betrayed and the defenceless subjects were left exposed to the fury of the Barbarians The divided administration which had been formed by Constantine relaxed the vigor of the state while it secured the tranquillity of the monarch Footnote one hundred twenty four See a very splendid example in the life of Agricola particularly c twenty twenty one The lieutenant of Britain was intrusted with the same powers which Cicero proconsul of Cilicia had exercised in the name of

stations For the institution rank privileges c of the counts in general see Cod Theod l vi tit xii xx with the commentary of Godefroy The memory of Constantine has been deservedly censured for another innovation which corrupted military discipline and prepared the ruin of the empire The nineteen years which preceded his final victory over Licinius had been a period of license and intestine war The rivals who contended for the possession of the Roman world had withdrawn the greatest part of their forces from the guard of the general frontier and the principal cities which formed the boundary of their respective dominions were filled with soldiers who considered their countrymen as their most implacable enemies After the use of these internal garrisons had ceased with the civil war the conqueror wanted either wisdom or firmness to revive the severe discipline of Diocletian and to suppress a fatal indulgence which habit had endeared and almost confirmed to the military order From the reign of Constantine a popular and even legal distinction was admitted between the Palatines one hundred twenty eight and the Borderers the troops of the court as they were improperly styled and the troops of the frontier The former elevated by the superiority of their pay and privileges were permitted except in the extraordinary emergencies of war to occupy their tranquil stations in the heart of the provinces The most flourishing cities were oppressed by the intolerable weight of quarters The soldiers insensibly forgot the virtues of their profession and contracted only the vices of civil life They were either degraded by the industry of mechanic trades or enervated by the luxury of baths and theatres They soon became careless of their martial exercises curious in their diet and apparel and while they inspired terror to the subjects of the empire they trembled at the hostile approach of the Barbarians one hundred twenty nine The chain of fortifications which Diocletian and his colleagues had extended along the banks of the great rivers was no longer maintained with the same care or defended with the same vigilance The numbers which still remained under the name of the troops of the frontier might be sufficient for the ordinary defence but their spirit was degraded by the humiliating reflection that they who were exposed to the hardships and dangers of a perpetual warfare were rewarded only with about two thirds of the pay and emoluments which were lavished on the troops of the court Even the bands or legions that were raised the nearest to the level of those unworthy favorites were in some measure disgraced by the title of honor which they were allowed to assume It was in vain that Constantine repeated the most dreadful menaces of fire and sword against the Borderers who should dare desert their colors to connive at the inroads of the Barbarians or to participate in the spoil one hundred thirty The mischiefs which flow from injudicious counsels are seldom removed by the application of partial severities and though succeeding princes labored to restore the strength and numbers of the frontier garrisons the empire till the last moment of its dissolution continued to languish under the mortal wound which had been so rashly or so weakly inflicted by the hand of Constantine Footnote one hundred twenty eight Zosimus l ii p one hundred eleven

dividing whatever is united of reducing whatever is eminent of dreading every active power and of expecting that the most feeble will prove the most obedient seems to pervade the institutions of several princes and particularly those of Constantine The martial pride of the legions whose victorious camps had so often been the scene of rebellion was nourished by the memory of their past exploits and the consciousness of their actual strength As long as they maintained their ancient establishment of six thousand men they subsisted under the reign of Diocletian each of them singly a visible and important object in the military history of the Roman empire A few years afterwards these gigantic bodies were shrunk to a very diminutive size and when seven legions with some auxiliaries defended the city of Amida against the Persians the total garrison with the inhabitants of both sexes and the peasants of the deserted country did not exceed the number of twenty thousand persons one hundred thirty one From this fact and from similar examples there is reason to believe that the constitution of the legionary troops to which they partly owed their valor and discipline was dissolved by Constantine and that the bands of Roman infantry which still assumed the same names and the same honors consisted only of one thousand or fifteen hundred men one hundred thirty two The conspiracy of so many separate detachments each of which was awed by the sense of its own weakness could easily be checked and the successors of Constantine might indulge their love of ostentation by issuing their orders to one hundred and thirty two legions inscribed on the muster roll of their numerous armies The remainder of their troops was distributed into several hundred cohorts of infantry and squadrons of cavalry Their arms and titles and ensigns were calculated to inspire terror and to display the variety of nations who marched under the Imperial standard And not a vestige was left of that severe simplicity which in the ages of freedom and victory had distinguished the line of battle of a Roman army from the confused host of an Asiatic monarch one hundred thirty three A more particular enumeration drawn from the Notitia might exercise the diligence of an antiquary but the historian will content himself with observing that the number of permanent stations or garrisons established on the frontiers of the empire amounted to five hundred and eighty three and that under the successors of Constantine the complete force of the military establishment was computed at six hundred and forty five thousand soldiers one hundred thirty four An effort so prodigious surpassed the wants of a more ancient and the faculties of a later period Footnote one hundred thirty one

In the various states of society armies are recruited from very different motives Barbarians are urged by the love of war the citizens of a free republic may be prompted by a principle of duty the subjects or at least the nobles of a monarchy are animated by a sentiment of honor but the timid and luxurious inhabitants of a declining empire must be allured into the service by the hopes of profit or compelled by the dread of punishment The resources of the Roman treasury were exhausted by the increase of pay by the repetition of donatives and by the invention of new emolument and indulgences which in the opinion of the provincial youth might compensate the hardships and dangers of a military life Yet although the stature was lowered one hundred thirty five although slaves least by a tacit connivance were indiscriminately received into the ranks the insurmountable difficulty of procuring a regular and adequate supply of volunteers obliged the emperors to adopt more effectual and coercive methods The lands bestowed on the veterans as the free reward of their valor were henceforward granted under a condition which contain the first rudiments of the feudal tenures that their sons who succeeded to the inheritance should devote themselves to the profession of arms as soon as they attained the age of manhood and their cowardly refusal was punished by the loss of honor of fortune or even of life one hundred thirty six But as the annual growth of the sons of the veterans bore a very small proportion to the demands of the service levies of men were frequently required from the provinces and every proprietor was obliged either to take up arms or to procure a substitute or to purchase his exemption by the payment of a heavy fine The sum of forty two pieces of gold to which it was reduced ascertains the exorbitant price of volunteers and the reluctance with which the government admitted of this alterative one hundred thirty seven Such was the horror for the profession of a soldier which had affected the minds of the degenerate Romans that many of the youth of Italy and the provinces chose to cut off the fingers of their right hand to escape from being pressed into the service and this strange expedient was so commonly practised as to deserve the severe animadversion of the laws one hundred thirty eight and a peculiar name in the Latin language one

Marcellin l xv c twelve Chapter XVII Foundation Of Constantinople Part V The introduction of Barbarians into the Roman armies became every day more universal more necessary and more fatal The most daring of the Scythians of the Goths and of the Germans who delighted in war and who found it more profitable to defend than to ravage the provinces were enrolled not only in the auxiliaries of their respective nations but in the legions themselves and among the most distinguished of the Palatine troops As they freely mingled with the subjects of the empire they gradually learned to despise their manners and to imitate their arts They abjured the implicit reverence which the pride of Rome had exacted from their ignorance while they acquired the knowledge and possession of those advantages by which alone she supported her declining greatness The Barbarian soldiers who displayed any military talents were advanced without exception to the most important commands and the names of the tribunes of the counts and dukes and of the generals themselves betray a foreign origin which they no longer condescended to disguise They were often intrusted with the conduct of a war against their countrymen and though most of them preferred the ties of allegiance to those of blood they did not always avoid the guilt or at least the suspicion of holding a treasonable correspondence with the enemy of inviting his invasion or of sparing his retreat The camps and the palace of the son of Constantine were governed by the powerful faction of the Franks who preserved the strictest connection with each other and with their country and who resented every personal affront as a national indignity one hundred forty When the tyrant Caligula was suspected of an intention to invest a very extraordinary candidate with the consular robes the sacrilegious profanation would have scarcely excited less astonishment if instead of a horse the noblest chieftain of Germany or Britain had been the object of his choice The revolution of three centuries had produced so remarkable a change in the prejudices of the people that with the public approbation Constantine showed his successors the example of bestowing the honors of the consulship on the Barbarians who by their merit and services had deserved to be ranked among the first of the Romans one hundred forty one But as these hardy veterans who had been educated in the ignorance or contempt of the laws were incapable of exercising any civil offices the powers of the human mind were contracted by the irreconcilable separation of talents as well as of professions The accomplished citizens of the Greek and Roman republics whose characters could adapt themselves to the bar the senate the camp or the schools had learned to write

Aurelius Victor seem to confirm the truth of this assertion yet in the thirty two consular Fasti of the reign of Constantine cannot discover the name of a single Barbarian I should therefore interpret the liberality of that prince as relative to the ornaments rather than to the office of the consulship IV Besides the magistrates and generals who at a distance from the court diffused their delegated authority over the provinces and armies the emperor conferred the rank of Illustrious on seven of his more immediate servants to whose fidelity he intrusted his safety or his counsels or his treasures one The private apartments of the palace were governed by a favorite eunuch who in the language of that age was styled the proepositus or praefect of the sacred bed chamber His duty was to attend the emperor in his hours of state or in those of amusement and to perform about his person all those menial services which can only derive their splendor from the influence of royalty Under a prince who deserved to reign the great chamberlain for such we may call him was a useful and humble domestic but an artful domestic who improves every occasion of unguarded confidence will insensibly acquire over a feeble mind that ascendant which harsh wisdom and uncomplying virtue can seldom obtain The degenerate grandsons of Theodosius who were invisible to their subjects and contemptible to their enemies exalted the praefects of their bed chamber above the heads of all the ministers of the palace one hundred forty two and even his deputy the first of the splendid train of slaves who waited in the presence was thought worthy to rank before the respectable proconsuls of Greece or Asia The jurisdiction of the chamberlain was acknowledged by the counts or superintendents who regulated the two important provinces of the magnificence of the wardrobe and of the luxury of the Imperial table one hundred forty three two The principal administration of public affairs was committed to the diligence and abilities of the master of the offices one hundred forty four He was the supreme magistrate of the palace inspected the discipline of the civil and military schools and received appeals from all parts of the empire in the causes which related to that numerous army of privileged persons who as the servants of the court had obtained for themselves and families a right to decline the authority of the ordinary judges The correspondence between the prince and his subjects was managed by the four scrinia or offices of this minister of state The first was appropriated to memorials the second to epistles the third to petitions and the fourth to papers and orders of a miscellaneous kind Each of these was directed by an inferior master of respectable dignity and the whole business was despatched by a hundred and forty eight secretaries chosen for the most part from the profession of the law on account of the variety of abstracts of reports and references which frequently occurred in the exercise of their several functions From a condescension which in former ages would have been esteemed unworthy the Roman majesty a particular secretary was allowed for the Greek language and interpreters were appointed to receive the ambassadors of the Barbarians but the department of foreign affairs which constitutes so essential a part of modern policy seldom diverted the attention of the master of the offices His mind was more seriously engaged by the general direction of the posts and arsenals of the empire There were thirty four cities fifteen in the East and nineteen in the West in which regular companies of workmen were perpetually employed in fabricating defensive armor offensive weapons of all sorts and military engines which were deposited in the arsenals and occasionally delivered for the service of the troops three In the course of nine centuries the office of quaestor had experienced a very singular revolution In the infancy of Rome two inferior magistrates were annually elected by the people to relieve the consuls from the invidious management of the public treasure one hundred forty five a similar assistant was granted to every proconsul and to every praetor who exercised a military or provincial command with the extent of conquest the two quaestors were gradually multiplied to the number of four of eight of twenty and for a short time perhaps of forty one hundred forty six and the noblest citizens ambitiously solicited an office which gave them a seat in the senate and a just hope of obtaining the honors of the republic Whilst Augustus affected to maintain the freedom of election he consented to accept the annual privilege of recommending or rather indeed of nominating a certain proportion of candidates and it was his custom to select one of these distinguished youths to read his orations or epistles in the assemblies of the senate one hundred forty seven The practice of Augustus was imitated by succeeding princes the occasional commission was established as a permanent office and the favored quaestor assuming a new and more illustrious character alone survived the suppression of his ancient and useless colleagues one hundred forty eight As the orations which he composed in the name of the emperor one hundred forty nine acquired the force and at length the form of absolute edicts he was considered as the representative of the legislative power the oracle of the council and the original source of the civil jurisprudence He was sometimes invited to take his seat in the supreme judicature of the Imperial consistory with the Praetorian praefects and the master of the offices and he was frequently requested to resolve the doubts of inferior judges but as he was not oppressed with a variety of subordinate business his leisure and talents were employed to cultivate that dignified style of eloquence which in the corruption of taste and language still preserves the majesty of the Roman laws one hundred fifty In some respects the office of the Imperial quaestor may be compared with that of a modern chancellor but the use of a great seal which seems to have been adopted by the illiterate barbarians was never introduced to attest the public acts of the emperors four The extraordinary title of count of the sacred largesses was bestowed on the treasurer general of the revenue with the intention perhaps of inculcating that every payment flowed from the voluntary bounty of the monarch To conceive the almost infinite detail of the annual and daily expense of the civil and military administration in every part of a great empire would exceed the powers of the most vigorous imagination The actual account employed several hundred persons distributed into eleven different offices which were artfully contrived to examine and control their respective operations The multitude of these agents had a natural tendency to increase and it was more than once thought expedient to dismiss to their native homes the useless supernumeraries who deserting their honest labors had pressed with too much eagerness into the lucrative profession of the finances one hundred fifty one Twenty nine provincial receivers of whom eighteen were honored with the title of count corresponded with the treasurer and he extended his jurisdiction over the mines from whence the precious metals were extracted over the mints in which they were converted into the current coin and over the public treasuries of the most important cities where they were deposited for the service of the state The foreign trade of the empire was regulated by this minister who directed likewise all the linen and woollen manufactures in which the successive operations of spinning weaving and dyeing were executed chiefly by women of a servile condition for the use of the palace and army Twenty six of these institutions are enumerated in the West where the arts had been more recently introduced and a still larger proportion may be allowed for the industrious provinces of the East one hundred fifty two five Besides the public revenue which an absolute monarch might levy and expend according to his pleasure the emperors in the capacity of opulent citizens possessed a very extensive property which was administered by the count or treasurer of the private estate Some part had perhaps been the ancient demesnes of kings and republics some accessions might be derived from the families which were successively invested with the purple but the most considerable portion flowed from the impure source of confiscations and forfeitures The Imperial estates were scattered through the provinces from Mauritania to Britain but the rich and fertile soil of Cappadocia tempted the monarch to acquire in that country his fairest possessions one hundred fifty three and either Constantine or his successors embraced the occasion of justifying avarice by religious zeal They suppressed the rich temple of Comana where the high priest of the goddess of war supported the dignity of a sovereign prince and they applied to their private use the consecrated lands which were inhabited by six thousand subjects or slaves of the deity and her ministers one hundred fifty four But these were not the valuable inhabitants the plains that stretch from the foot of Mount Argaeus to the banks of the Sarus bred a generous race of horses renowned above all others in the ancient world for their majestic shape and incomparable swiftness These sacred animals destined for the service of the palace and the Imperial games were protected by the laws from the profanation of a vulgar master one hundred fifty five The demesnes of Cappadocia were important enough to require the inspection of a count one hundred fifty six officers of an inferior rank were stationed in the other parts of the empire and the deputies of the private as well as those of the public treasurer were maintained in the exercise of their independent functions and encouraged to control the authority of the provincial magistrates one hundred fifty seven six seven The chosen bands of cavalry and infantry which guarded the person of the emperor were under the immediate command of the two counts of the domestics The whole number consisted of three thousand five hundred men divided into seven schools or troops of five hundred each and in the East this honorable service was almost entirely appropriated to the Armenians Whenever on public ceremonies they were drawn up in the courts and porticos of the palace their lofty stature silent order and splendid arms of silver and gold displayed a martial pomp not unworthy of the Roman majesty one hundred fifty eight From the seven schools two companies of horse and foot were selected of the protectors whose advantageous station was the hope and reward of the most deserving soldiers They mounted guard in the interior apartments and were occasionally despatched into the provinces to execute with celerity and vigor the orders of their master one hundred fifty nine The counts of the domestics had succeeded to the office of the Praetorian praefects like the praefects

deceitful and dangerous experiment of the criminal quaestion as it is emphatically styled was admitted rather than approved in the jurisprudence of the Romans They applied this sanguinary mode of examination only to servile bodies whose sufferings were seldom weighed by those haughty republicans in the scale of justice or humanity but they would never consent to violate the sacred person of a citizen till they possessed the clearest evidence of his guilt one hundred sixty two The annals of tyranny from the reign of Tiberius to that of Domitian circumstantially relate the executions of many innocent victims but as long as the faintest remembrance was kept alive of the national freedom and honor the last hours of a Roman were secured from the danger of ignominions torture one hundred sixty three The conduct of the provincial magistrates was not however regulated by the practice of the city or the strict maxims of the civilians They found the use of torture established not only among the slaves of oriental despotism but among the Macedonians who obeyed a limited monarch among the Rhodians who flourished by the liberty of commerce and even among the sage Athenians who had asserted and adorned the dignity of human kind one hundred sixty four The acquiescence of the provincials encouraged their governors to acquire or perhaps to usurp a discretionary power of employing the rack to extort from vagrants or plebeian criminals the confession of their guilt till they insensibly proceeded to confound the distinction of rank and to disregard the privileges of Roman citizens The apprehensions of the subjects urged them to solicit and the interest of the sovereign engaged him to grant a variety of special exemptions which tacitly allowed and even authorized the general use of torture They protected all persons of illustrious or honorable rank bishops and their presbyters professors of the liberal arts soldiers and their families municipal officers and their posterity to the third generation and all children under the age of puberty one hundred sixty five But a fatal maxim was introduced into the new jurisprudence of the empire that in the case of treason which included every offence that the subtlety of lawyers could derive from a hostile intention towards the prince or republic one hundred sixty six all privileges were suspended and all conditions were reduced to the same ignominious level As the safety of the emperor was avowedly preferred to every consideration of justice or humanity the dignity of age and the tenderness of youth were alike

Charisius is the oldest lawyer quoted to justify the universal practice of torture in all cases of treason but this maxim of tyranny which is admitted by Ammianus with the most respectful terror is enforced by several laws of the successors of Constantine See Cod Theod l ix tit xxxv majestatis crimine omnibus aequa est conditio These evils however terrible they may appear were confined to the smaller number of Roman subjects whose dangerous situation was in some degree compensated by the enjoyment of those advantages either of nature or of fortune which exposed them to the jealousy of the monarch The obscure millions of a great empire have much less to dread from the cruelty than from the avarice of their masters and their humble happiness is principally affected by the grievance of excessive taxes which gently pressing on the wealthy descend with accelerated weight on the meaner and more indigent classes of society An ingenious philosopher one hundred sixty eight has calculated the universal measure of the public impositions by the degrees of freedom and servitude and ventures to assert that according to an invariable law of nature it must always increase with the former and diminish in a just proportion to the latter But this reflection which would tend to alleviate the miseries of despotism is contradicted at least by the history of the Roman empire which accuses the same princes of despoiling the senate of its authority and the provinces of their wealth Without abolishing all the various customs and duties on merchandises which are imperceptibly discharged by the apparent choice of the purchaser the policy of Constantine and his successors preferred a simple and direct mode of taxation more congenial to the spirit of an arbitrary government one hundred sixty

some degree of perplexity Chapter XVII Foundation Of Constantinople Part VI The name and use of the indictions one hundred seventy which serve to ascertain the chronology of the middle ages were derived from the regular practice of the Roman tributes one hundred seventy one The emperor subscribed with his own hand and in purple ink the solemn edict or indiction which was fixed up in the principal city of each diocese during two months previous to the first day of September And by a very easy connection of ideas the word indiction was transferred to the measure of tribute which it prescribed and to the annual term which it allowed for the payment This general estimate of the supplies was proportioned to the real and imaginary wants of the state but as often as the expense exceeded the revenue or the revenue fell short of the computation an additional tax under the name of superindiction was imposed on the people and the most valuable attribute of sovereignty was communicated to the Praetorian praefects who on some occasions were permitted to provide for the unforeseen and extraordinary exigencies of the public service The execution of these laws which it would be tedious to pursue in their minute and intricate detail consisted of two distinct operations the resolving the general imposition into its constituent parts which were assessed on the provinces the cities and the individuals of the Roman world and the collecting the separate contributions of the individuals the cities and the provinces till the accumulated sums were poured into the Imperial treasuries But as the account between the monarch and the subject was perpetually open and as the renewal of the demand anticipated the perfect discharge of the preceding obligation the weighty machine of the finances was moved by the same hands round the circle of its yearly revolution Whatever was honorable or important in the administration of the revenue was committed to the wisdom of the praefects and their provincia representatives the lucrative functions were claimed by a crowd of subordinate officers some of whom depended on the treasurer others on the governor of the province and who in the inevitable conflicts of a perplexed jurisdiction had frequent opportunities of disputing with each other the spoils of the people The laborious offices which could be productive only of envy and reproach of expense and danger were imposed on the Decurions who formed the corporations of the cities and whom the severity of the Imperial laws had condemned to sustain the burdens of civil society one hundred seventy two The whole landed property of the empire without excepting the patrimonial estates of the monarch was the object of ordinary taxation and every new purchaser contracted the obligations of the former proprietor An accurate census one hundred seventy three or survey was the only equitable mode of ascertaining the proportion which every citizen should be obliged to contribute for the public service and from the well known period of the indictions there is reason to believe that this difficult and expensive operation was repeated at the regular distance of fifteen years The lands were measured by surveyors who were sent into the provinces their nature whether arable or pasture or vineyards or woods was distinctly reported and an estimate was made of their common value from the average produce of five years The numbers of slaves and of cattle constituted an essential part of the report an oath was administered to the proprietors which bound them to disclose the true state of their affairs and their attempts to prevaricate or elude the intention of the legislator were severely watched and punished as a capital crime which included the double guilt of treason and sacrilege one hundred seventy four A large portion of the tribute was paid in money and of the current coin of the empire gold alone could be legally accepted one hundred seventy five The remainder of the taxes according to the proportions determined by the annual indiction was furnished in a manner still more direct and still more oppressive According to the different nature of lands their real produce in the various articles of wine or oil corn or barley wood or iron was transported by the labor or at the expense of the provincials one hundred seventy fivea to the Imperial magazines from whence they were occasionally distributed for the use of the court of the army and of two capitals Rome and Constantinople The commissioners of the revenue were so frequently obliged to make considerable purchases that they were strictly prohibited from allowing any compensation or from receiving in money the value of those supplies which were exacted in kind In the primitive simplicity of small communities this method may be well adapted to collect the almost voluntary offerings of the people but it is at once susceptible of the utmost latitude and of the utmost strictness which in a corrupt and absolute monarchy must introduce a perpetual contest between the power of oppression and the arts of fraud one hundred seventy six The agriculture of the Roman provinces was insensibly ruined and in the progress of despotism which tends to disappoint its own purpose the emperors were obliged to derive some merit from the forgiveness of debts or the remission of tributes which their subjects were utterly incapable of paying According to the new division of Italy the fertile and happy province of Campania the scene of the early victories and of the delicious retirements of the citizens of Rome extended between the sea and the Apennine from the Tiber to the Silarus Within sixty years after the death of Constantine and on the evidence of an actual survey an exemption was granted in favor of three hundred and thirty thousand English acres of desert and uncultivated land which amounted to one eighth of the whole surface of the province As the footsteps of the Barbarians had not yet been seen in Italy the cause of this amazing desolation which is recorded in the laws can be ascribed only to the administration of the Roman emperors one hundred seventy seven Footnote one hundred seventy The cycle of indictions which may be traced as high as the reign of Constantius or perhaps of his father Constantine is still employed by the Papal court but the commencement of the year has been very reasonably altered to the first of January See l Art de Verifier les Dates p xi and Dictionnaire Raison de la Diplomatique tom ii p twenty five two accurate treatises which come from the workshop of the Benedictines It does not appear that the establishment of the indiction is to be at tributed to Constantine it existed before he had been created Augustus at Rome and the remission granted by him to the city of Autun is the proof He would not have ventured while only Caesar and under the

order of citizens Note The Decurions were charged with assessing according to the census of property prepared by the tabularii the payment due from each proprietor This odious office was authoritatively imposed on the richest citizens of each town they had no salary and all their compensation was to be exempt from certain corporal punishments in case they should have incurred them The Decurionate was the ruin of all the rich Hence they tried every way of avoiding this dangerous honor they concealed themselves they entered into military service but their efforts were unavailing they were seized they were compelled to become Decurions and the dread inspired by this title was termed Impiety G The Decurions were mutually responsible they were obliged to undertake for pieces of

jugerum contained twenty eight thousand eight hundred square Roman feet Either from design or from accident the mode of assessment seemed to unite the substance of a land tax with the forms of a capitation one hundred seventy eight The returns which were sent of every province or district expressed the number of tributary subjects and the amount of the public impositions The latter of these sums was divided by the former and the estimate that such a province contained so many capita or heads of tribute and that each head was rated at such a price was universally received not only in the popular but even in the legal computation The value of a tributary head must have varied according to many accidental or at least fluctuating circumstances but some knowledge has been preserved of a very curious fact the more important since it relates to one of the richest provinces of the Roman empire and which now flourishes as the most splendid of the European kingdoms The rapacious ministers of Constantius had exhausted the wealth of Gaul by exacting twenty five pieces of gold for the annual tribute of every head The humane policy of his successor reduced the capitation to seven pieces one hundred seventy nine A moderate proportion between these opposite extremes of extraordinary oppression and of transient indulgence may therefore be fixed at sixteen pieces of gold or about nine pounds sterling the common standard perhaps of the impositions of Gaul one hundred eighty But this calculation or rather indeed the facts from whence it is deduced cannot fail of suggesting two difficulties to a thinking mind who will be at once surprised by the equality and by the enormity of the capitation An attempt to explain them may perhaps reflect some light on the interesting subject of the finances of the declining empire Footnote one hundred seventy eight Godefroy Cod Theod tom vi p one hundred sixteen argues with weight and learning on the subject of the capitation but while he

Ammian l xvi c five Footnote one hundred eighty In the calculation of any sum of money under Constantine and his successors we need only refer to the excellent discourse of mister Greaves on the Denarius for the proof of the following principles one That the ancient and modern Roman pound containing five thousand two hundred fifty six grains of Troy weight is about one twelfth lighter than the English pound which is composed of five thousand seven hundred sixty of the same grains two That the pound of gold which had once been divided into forty eight aurei was at this time coined into seventy two smaller pieces of the same denomination three That five of these aurei were the legal tender for a pound of silver and that consequently the pound of gold was exchanged for fourteen pounds eight ounces of silver according to the Roman or about thirteen pounds according to the English weight four That the English pound of silver is coined into sixty two shillings From these elements we may compute the Roman pound of gold the usual method of reckoning large sums at forty pounds sterling and we may fix the currency of the aureus at somewhat more than eleven shillings Note See likewise a Dissertation of M Letronne Considerations Generales sur l Evaluation des Monnaies Grecques et Romaines Paris eighteen seventeen M I It is obvious that as long as the immutable constitution of human nature produces and maintains so unequal a division of property the most numerous part of the community would be deprived of their subsistence by the equal assessment of a tax from which the sovereign would derive a very trifling revenue Such indeed might be the theory of the Roman capitation but in the practice this unjust equality was no longer felt as the tribute was collected on the principle of a real not of a personal imposition one hundred eightya Several indigent citizens contributed to compose a single head or share of taxation while the wealthy provincial in proportion to his fortune alone represented several of those imaginary beings In a poetical request addressed to one of the last and most deserving of the Roman princes who reigned in Gaul Sidonius Apollinaris personifies his tribute under the figure of a triple monster the Geryon of the Grecian fables and entreats the new Hercules that he would most graciously be pleased to save his life by cutting off three of his heads one hundred eighty one The fortune of Sidonius far exceeded the customary wealth of a poet but if he had pursued the allusion he might have painted many of the Gallic nobles with the hundred heads of the deadly Hydra spreading over the face of the country and devouring the substance of a hundred families II The difficulty of allowing an annual sum of about nine pounds sterling even for the average of the capitation of Gaul may be rendered more evident by the comparison of the present state of the same country as it is now governed by the absolute monarch of an industrious wealthy and affectionate people The taxes of France cannot be magnified either by fear or by flattery beyond the annual amount of eighteen millions sterling which ought perhaps to be shared among four and twenty millions of inhabitants one hundred eighty two Seven millions of these in the capacity of fathers or brothers or husbands may discharge the obligations of the remaining multitude of women and children yet the equal proportion of each tributary subject will scarcely rise above fifty shillings of our money instead of a proportion almost four times as considerable which was regularly imposed on their Gallic ancestors The reason of this difference may be found not so much in the relative scarcity or plenty of gold and silver as in the different state of society in ancient Gaul and in modern France In a country where personal freedom is the privilege of every subject the whole mass of taxes whether they are levied on property or on consumption may be fairly divided among the whole body of the nation But the far greater part of the lands of ancient Gaul as well as of the other provinces of the Roman world were cultivated by slaves or by peasants whose dependent condition was a less rigid servitude one hundred eighty three In such a state the poor were maintained at the expense of the masters who enjoyed the fruits of their labor and as the rolls of tribute were filled only with the names of those citizens who possessed the means of an honorable or at least of a decent subsistence the comparative smallness of their numbers explains and justifies the high rate of their capitation The truth of this assertion may be illustrated by the following example The Aedui one of the most powerful and civilized tribes or cities of Gaul occupied an extent of territory which now contains about five hundred thousand inhabitants in the two ecclesiastical dioceses of Autun and Nevers one hundred eighty four and with the probable accession of those of Chalons and Macon one hundred eighty five the population would amount to eight hundred thousand souls In the time of Constantine the territory of the Aedui afforded no more than twenty five thousand heads of capitation of whom seven thousand were discharged by that prince from the intolerable weight of tribute one hundred eighty six A just analogy would seem to countenance the opinion of an ingenious historian one hundred eighty seven that the free and tributary citizens did not surpass the number of half a million and if in the ordinary administration of government their annual payments may be computed at about four millions and a half of our money it would appear that although the share of each individual was four times as considerable a fourth part only of the modern taxes of France was levied on the Imperial province of Gaul The exactions of Constantius may be calculated at seven millions sterling which were reduced to two millions by the humanity or the wisdom of Julian Footnote one hundred eightya Two masterly dissertations of M Savigny in the Mem of the Berlin Academy eighteen twenty two and eighteen twenty three have thrown new light on the taxation system of the Empire Gibbon according to M Savigny is mistaken in supposing that there was but one kind of capitation tax there was a land tax and a capitation tax strictly so called The land tax was in its operation a proprietor s or landlord s tax But besides this there was a direct capitation tax on all who were not possessed of landed property This tax dates from the time of the Roman conquests its amount is not clearly known Gradual exemptions released different persons and classes from this tax One edict exempts painters In Syria all under twelve or fourteen or above sixty five were exempted at a later period all under twenty and all unmarried females still later all under twenty five widows and nuns soldiers veterani and clerici whole dioceses that of Thrace and Illyricum Under Galerius and Licinius the plebs urbana became exempt though this perhaps was only an ordinance for the East By degrees however the exemption was extended to all the inhabitants of towns and as it was strictly capitatio plebeia from which all possessors were exempted it fell at length altogether on the coloni and agricultural slaves These were registered in the same cataster capitastrum with the land tax It was paid by the proprietor who raised it again from his coloni and laborers M Footnote one hundred eighty one Geryones nos esse puta monstrumque tributum Hic capita ut vivam tu mihi tolle tria Sidon Apollinar Carm xiii The reputation of

province of French Hainault alone furnishes nine thousand nine hundred six births and we are assured by an actual enumeration of the people annually repeated from the year seventeen seventy three to the year seventeen seventy six that upon an average Hainault contains two hundred fifty seven thousand ninety seven inhabitants By the rules of fair analogy we might infer that the ordinary proportion of annual births to the whole people is about one to twenty six and that the kingdom of France contains twenty four million one hundred fifty one thousand eight hundred sixty eight persons of both sexes and of every age If we content ourselves with the more moderate proportion of one to twenty five the whole population will amount to twenty three million two hundred twenty two thousand nine hundred fifty From the diligent researches of the French Government which are not unworthy of our own imitation we may hope to obtain a still greater degree of certainty on this important subject Note

sharing that species of wealth which is derived from art or labor and which exists in money or in merchandise the emperors imposed a distinct and personal tribute on the trading part of their subjects one hundred eighty eight Some exemptions very strictly confined both in time and place were allowed to the proprietors who disposed of the produce of their own estates Some indulgence was granted to the profession of the liberal arts but every other branch of commercial industry was affected by the severity of the law The honorable merchant of Alexandria who imported the gems and spices of India for the use of the western world the usurer who derived from the interest of money a silent and ignominious profit the ingenious manufacturer the diligent mechanic and even the most obscure retailer of a sequestered village were obliged to admit the officers of the revenue into the partnership of their gain and the sovereign of the Roman empire who tolerated the profession consented to share the infamous salary of public prostitutes one hundred eighty eighta As this general tax upon industry was collected every fourth year it was styled the Lustral Contribution and the historian Zosimus one hundred eighty nine laments that the approach of the fatal period was announced by the tears and terrors of the citizens who were often compelled by the impending scourge to embrace the most abhorred and unnatural methods of procuring the sum at which their property had been assessed The testimony of Zosimus cannot indeed be justified from the charge of passion and prejudice but from the nature of this tribute it seems reasonable to conclude that it was arbitrary in the distribution and extremely rigorous in the mode of collecting The secret wealth of commerce and the precarious profits of art or labor are susceptible only of a discretionary valuation which is seldom disadvantageous to the interest of the treasury and as the person of the trader supplies the want of a visible and permanent security the payment of the imposition which in the case of a land tax may be obtained by the seizure of property can rarely be extorted by any other means than those of corporal punishments The cruel treatment of the insolvent debtors of the state is attested and was perhaps mitigated by a very humane edict of Constantine who disclaiming the use of racks and of scourges allots a spacious and airy

pomp of his triumph by their voluntary gifts of crowns of gold which after the ceremony were consecrated in the temple of Jupiter to remain a lasting monument of his glory to future ages The progress of zeal and flattery soon multiplied the number and increased the size of these popular donations and the triumph of Caesar was enriched with two thousand eight hundred and twenty two massy crowns whose weight amounted to twenty thousand four hundred and fourteen pounds of gold This treasure was immediately melted down by the prudent dictator who was satisfied that it would be more serviceable to his soldiers than to the gods his example was imitated by his successors and the custom was introduced of exchanging these splendid ornaments for the more acceptable present of the current gold coin of the empire one hundred ninety one The spontaneous offering was at length exacted as the debt of duty and instead of being confined to the occasion of a triumph it was supposed to be granted by the several cities and provinces of the monarchy as often as the emperor condescended to announce his accession his consulship the birth of a son the creation of a Caesar a victory over the Barbarians or any other real or imaginary event which graced the annals of his reign The peculiar free gift of the senate of Rome was fixed by custom at sixteen hundred pounds of gold or about sixty four thousand pounds sterling The oppressed subjects celebrated their own felicity that their sovereign should graciously consent to accept this feeble but voluntary testimony of their loyalty and gratitude one hundred ninety two Footnote one hundred ninety one See Lipsius de Magnitud Romana l ii c nine The Tarragonese Spain presented the emperor Claudius with a crown of gold of seven and Gaul

were supposed to be exempt from the Aurum Coronarium but the Auri Oblatio which was required at their hands was precisely of the same nature A people elated by pride or soured by discontent are seldom qualified to form a just estimate of their actual situation The subjects of Constantine were incapable of discerning the decline of genius and manly virtue which so far degraded them below the dignity of their ancestors but they could feel and lament the rage of tyranny the relaxation of discipline and the increase of taxes The impartial historian who acknowledges the justice of their complaints will observe some favorable circumstances which tended to alleviate the misery of their condition The threatening tempest of Barbarians which so soon subverted the foundations of Roman greatness was still repelled or suspended on the frontiers The arts of luxury and literature were cultivated and the elegant pleasures of society were enjoyed by the inhabitants of a considerable portion of the globe The forms the pomp and the expense of the civil administration contributed to restrain the irregular license of the soldiers and although the laws were violated by power or perverted by subtlety the sage principles of the Roman jurisprudence preserved a sense of order and equity unknown to the despotic governments of the East The rights of mankind might derive some protection from religion and philosophy and the name of freedom which could no longer alarm might sometimes admonish the successors of Augustus that they did not reign over a nation of Slaves or Barbarians one hundred ninety

that of a Parthian monarch Virtue was necessary for the one birth might suffice for the other Chapter XVIII Character Of Constantine And His Sons Part I Character Of Constantine Gothic War Death Of Constantine Division Of The Empire Among His Three Sons Persian War Tragic Deaths Of Constantine The Younger And Constans Usurpation Of Magnentius Civil War Victory Of Constantius The character of the prince who removed the seat of empire and introduced such important changes into the civil and religious constitution of his country has fixed the attention and divided the opinions of mankind By the grateful zeal of the Christians the deliverer of the church has been decorated with every attribute of a hero and even of a saint while the discontent of the vanquished party has compared Constantine to the most abhorred of those tyrants who by their vice and weakness dishonored the Imperial purple The same passions have in some degree been perpetuated to succeeding generations and the character of Constantine is considered even in the present age as an object either of satire or of panegyric By the impartial union of those defects which are confessed by his warmest admirers and of those virtues which are acknowledged by his most implacable enemies we might hope to delineate a just portrait of that extraordinary man which the truth and candor of history should adopt without a blush one But it would soon appear that the vain attempt to blend such discordant colors and to reconcile such inconsistent qualities must produce a figure monstrous rather than human unless it is viewed in its proper and distinct lights by a careful separation of the different periods of the reign of Constantine Footnote one On ne se trompera point sur Constantin en croyant tout le mal ru en dit Eusebe et tout le bien qu en dit Zosime Fleury Hist Ecclesiastique tom iii p two hundred thirty three Eusebius and Zosimus form indeed the two extremes of flattery and invective The intermediate shades are expressed by those writers whose character or situation variously tempered the influence of their religious zeal The person as well as the mind of Constantine had been enriched by nature with her choices endowments His stature was lofty his countenance majestic his deportment graceful his strength and activity were displayed in every manly exercise and from his earliest youth to a very advanced season of life he preserved the vigor of his constitution by a strict adherence to the domestic virtues of chastity and temperance He delighted in the social intercourse of familiar conversation and though he might sometimes indulge his disposition to raillery with less reserve than was required by the severe dignity of his station the courtesy and liberality of his manners gained the hearts of all who approached him The sincerity of his friendship has been suspected yet he showed on some occasions that he was not incapable of a warm and lasting attachment The disadvantage of an illiterate education had not prevented him from forming a just estimate of the value of learning and the arts and sciences derived some encouragement from the munificent protection of Constantine In the despatch of business his diligence was indefatigable and the active powers of his mind were almost continually exercised in reading writing or meditating in giving audiences to ambassadors and in examining the complaints of his subjects Even those who censured the propriety of his measures were compelled to acknowledge that he possessed magnanimity to conceive and patience to execute the most arduous designs without being checked either by the prejudices of education or by the clamors of the multitude In the field he infused his own intrepid spirit into the troops whom he conducted with the talents of a consummate general and to his abilities rather than to his fortune we may ascribe the signal victories which he obtained over the foreign and domestic foes of the republic He loved glory as the reward perhaps as the motive of his labors The boundless ambition which from the moment of his accepting the purple at York appears as the ruling passion of his soul may be justified by the dangers of his own situation by the character of his rivals by the consciousness of superior merit and by the prospect that his success would enable him to restore peace and order to the distracted empire In his civil wars against Maxentius and Licinius he had engaged on his side the inclinations of the people who compared the undissembled vices of those tyrants with the spirit of wisdom and justice which seemed to direct the general tenor of the administration of Constantine two Footnote two The virtues of Constantine are collected for the most part from Eutropius and the younger Victor two sincere pagans who wrote after the extinction of his family Even Zosimus and the Emperor Julian acknowledge his personal courage and military achievements Had Constantine fallen on the banks of the Tyber or even in the plains of Hadrianople such is the character which with a few exceptions he might have transmitted to posterity But the conclusion of his reign according to the moderate and indeed tender sentence of a writer of the same age degraded him from the rank which he had acquired among the most deserving of the Roman princes three In the life of Augustus we behold the tyrant of the republic converted almost by imperceptible degrees into the father of his country and of human kind In that of Constantine we may contemplate a hero who had so long inspired his subjects with love and his enemies with terror degenerating into a cruel and dissolute monarch corrupted by his fortune or raised by conquest above the necessity of dissimulation The general peace which he maintained during the last fourteen years of his reign was a period of apparent splendor rather than of real prosperity and the old age of Constantine was disgraced by the opposite yet reconcilable vices of rapaciousness and prodigality The accumulated treasures found in the palaces of Maxentius and Licinius were lavishly consumed the various innovations introduced by the conqueror were attended with an increasing expense the cost of his buildings his court and his festivals required an immediate and plentiful supply and the oppression of the people was the only fund which could support the magnificence of the sovereign four His unworthy favorites enriched by the boundless liberality of their master usurped with impunity the privilege of rapine and corruption five A secret but universal decay was felt in every part of the public administration and the emperor himself though he still retained the obedience gradually lost the esteem of his subjects The dress and manners which towards the decline of life he chose to affect served only to degrade him in the eyes of mankind The Asiatic pomp which had been adopted by the pride of Diocletian assumed an air of softness and effeminacy in the person of Constantine He is represented with false hair of various colors laboriously arranged by the skilful artists to the times a diadem of a new and more expensive fashion a profusion of gems and pearls of collars and bracelets and a variegated flowing robe of silk most curiously embroidered with flowers of gold In such apparel scarcely to be excused by the youth and folly of Elagabalus we are at a loss to discover the wisdom of an aged monarch and the simplicity of a Roman veteran six A mind thus relaxed by prosperity and indulgence was incapable of rising to that magnanimity which disdains suspicion and dares to forgive The deaths of Maximian and Licinius may perhaps be justified by the maxims of policy as they are taught in the schools of tyrants but an impartial narrative of the executions or rather murders which sullied the declining age of Constantine will suggest to our most candid thoughts the idea of a prince who could sacrifice without reluctance the laws of justice and the feelings of nature to the dictates either of his passions or of his interest Footnote three See Eutropius x six In primo Imperii tempore optimis principibus ultimo mediis comparandus From the ancient Greek version of Poeanius edit Havercamp p six hundred ninety seven I am inclined to suspect that Eutropius had originally written vix mediis and that the offensive monosyllable was dropped by the wilful inadvertency of transcribers Aurelius Victor expresses the general opinion by a vulgar and indeed obscure proverb Trachala decem annis praestantissimds

fifty nine Eusebius Orat c five alleges that Constantine dressed for the public not for himself Were this admitted the vainest coxcomb could never want an excuse The same fortune which so invariably followed the standard of Constantine seemed to secure the hopes and comforts of his domestic life Those among his predecessors who had enjoyed the longest and most prosperous reigns Augustus Trajan and Diocletian had been disappointed of posterity and the frequent revolutions had never allowed sufficient time for any Imperial family to grow up and multiply under the shade of the purple But the royalty of the Flavian line which had been first ennobled by the Gothic Claudius descended through several generations and Constantine himself derived from his royal father the hereditary honors which he transmitted to his children The emperor had been twice married Minervina the obscure but lawful object of his youthful attachment seven had left him only one son who was called Crispus By Fausta the daughter of Maximian he had three daughters and three sons known by the kindred names of Constantine Constantius and Constans The unambitious brothers of the great Constantine Julius Constantius Dalmatius and Hannibalianus eight were permitted to enjoy the most honorable rank and the most affluent fortune that could be consistent with a private station The youngest of the three lived without a name and died without posterity His two elder brothers obtained in marriage the daughters of wealthy senators and propagated new branches of the Imperial race Gallus and Julian afterwards became the most illustrious of the children of Julius Constantius the Patrician The two sons of Dalmatius who had been decorated with the vain title of Censor were named Dalmatius and Hannibalianus The two sisters of the great Constantine Anastasia and Eutropia were bestowed on Optatus and Nepotianus two senators of noble birth and of consular dignity His third sister Constantia was distinguished by her preeminence of greatness and of misery She remained the widow of the vanquished Licinius and it was by her entreaties that an innocent boy the offspring of their marriage preserved for some time his life the title of Caesar and a precarious hope of the succession Besides the females and the allies of the Flavian house ten or twelve males to whom the language of modern courts would apply the title of princes of the blood seemed according to the order of their birth to be destined either to inherit or to support the throne of Constantine But in less than thirty years this numerous and increasing family was reduced to the persons of Constantius and Julian who alone had survived a series of crimes and calamities such as the tragic poets have deplored in the devoted lines of Pelops and of Cadmus Footnote seven Zosimus and Zonaras agree in representing Minervina as the concubine of Constantine but Ducange has very gallantly rescued her character by producing a decisive passage from one of the panegyrics Ab ipso fine pueritiae te matrimonii legibus dedisti Footnote eight Ducange Familiae Byzantinae p forty four bestows on him after Zosimus the name of Constantine a name somewhat unlikely as it was already occupied by the elder brother That of Hannibalianus is mentioned in the Paschal Chronicle and is approved by Tillemont Hist des Empereurs tom iv p five hundred twenty seven Crispus the eldest son of Constantine and the presumptive heir of the empire is represented by impartial historians as an amiable and accomplished youth The care of his education or at least of his studies was intrusted to Lactantius the most eloquent of the Christians a preceptor admirably qualified to form the taste and the excite the virtues of his illustrious disciple nine At the age of seventeen Crispus was invested with the title of Caesar and the administration of the Gallic provinces where the inroads of the Germans gave him an early occasion of signalizing his military prowess In the civil war which broke out soon afterwards the father and son divided their powers and this history has already celebrated the valor as well as conduct displayed by the latter in forcing the straits of the Hellespont so obstinately defended by the superior fleet of Lacinius This naval victory contributed to determine the event of the war and the names of Constantine and of Crispus were united in the joyful acclamations of their eastern subjects who loudly proclaimed that the world had been subdued and was now governed by an emperor endowed with every virtue and by his illustrious son a prince beloved of Heaven and the lively image of his father s perfections The public favor which seldom accompanies old age diffused its lustre over the youth of Crispus He deserved the esteem and he engaged the affections of the court the army and the people The experienced merit of a reigning monarch is acknowledged by his subjects with reluctance and frequently denied with partial and discontented murmurs while from the opening virtues of his successor they fondly conceive the most unbounded hopes of private as well as public felicity ten Footnote nine Jerom in Chron The poverty of Lactantius may be applied either to the praise of the disinterested philosopher or to the shame of the unfeeling patron See Tillemont Mem Ecclesiast tom vi part one p three hundred forty five Dupin Bibliotheque Ecclesiast tom i p two hundred five Lardner s Credibility of the Gospel History part ii vol vii p sixty six Footnote ten Euseb Hist Ecclesiast l x c nine Eutropius x six styles him egregium virum and Julian Orat i very plainly alludes to the exploits of Crispus in the civil war See Spanheim Comment p ninety two This dangerous popularity soon excited the attention of Constantine who both as a father and as a king was impatient of an equal Instead of attempting to secure the allegiance of his son by the generous ties of confidence and gratitude he resolved to prevent the mischiefs which might be apprehended from dissatisfied ambition Crispus soon had reason to complain that while his infant brother Constantius was sent with the title of Caesar to reign over his peculiar department of the Gallic provinces eleven he a prince of mature years who had performed such recent and signal services instead of being raised to the superior rank of Augustus was confined almost a prisoner to his father s court and exposed without power or defence to every calumny which the malice of his enemies could suggest Under such painful circumstances the royal youth might not always be able to compose his behavior or suppress his discontent and we may be assured that he was encompassed by a train of indiscreet or perfidious followers who assiduously studied to inflame and who were perhaps instructed to betray the unguarded warmth of his resentment An edict of Constantine published about this time manifestly indicates his real or affected suspicions that a secret conspiracy had been formed against his person and government By all the allurements of honors and rewards he invites informers of every degree to accuse without exception his magistrates or ministers his friends or his most intimate favorites protesting with a solemn asseveration that he himself will listen to the charge that he himself will revenge his injuries and concluding with a prayer which discovers some apprehension of danger that the providence of the Supreme Being may still continue to protect the safety of the emperor and of the empire twelve Footnote eleven Compare Idatius and the Paschal Chronicle with Ammianus l xiv c five The year in which Constantius was created Caesar seems to be more accurately fixed by the two chronologists but the historian who lived in his court could not be ignorant of the day of the anniversary For the appointment of the new Caesar to the provinces of Gaul see Julian Orat i p twelve Godefroy Chronol Legum p twenty six and Blondel de Primaute de l Eglise p eleven eighty three Footnote twelve Cod Theod l ix tit iv Godefroy suspected the secret motives of this law Comment tom iii p nine The informers who complied with so liberal an invitation were sufficiently versed in the arts of courts to select the friends and adherents of Crispus as the guilty persons nor is there any reason to distrust the veracity of the emperor who had promised an ample measure of revenge and punishment The policy of Constantine maintained however the same appearances of regard and confidence towards a son whom he began to consider as his most irreconcilable enemy Medals were struck with the customary vows for the long and auspicious reign of the young Caesar thirteen and as the people who were not admitted into the secrets of the palace still loved his virtues and respected his dignity a poet who solicits his recall from exile adores with equal devotion the majesty of the father and that of the son fourteen The time was now arrived for celebrating the august ceremony of the twentieth year of the reign of Constantine and the emperor for that purpose removed his court from Nicomedia to Rome where the most splendid preparations had been made for his reception Every eye and every tongue affected to express their sense of the general happiness and the veil of ceremony and dissimulation was drawn for a while over the darkest designs of revenge and murder fifteen In the midst of the festival the unfortunate Crispus was apprehended by order of the emperor who laid aside the tenderness of a father without assuming the equity of a judge The examination was short and private sixteen and as it was thought decent to conceal the fate of the young prince from the eyes of the Roman people he was sent under a strong guard to Pola in Istria where soon afterwards he was put to death either by the hand of the executioner or by the more gentle operations of poison seventeen The Caesar Licinius a youth of amiable manners was involved in the ruin of Crispus eighteen and the stern jealousy of Constantine was unmoved by the prayers and tears of his favorite sister pleading for the life of a son whose rank was his only crime and whose loss she did not long survive The story of these unhappy princes the nature and evidence of their guilt the forms of their trial and the circumstances of their death were buried in mysterious obscurity and the courtly bishop who has celebrated in an elaborate work the virtues and piety of his hero observes a prudent silence on the subject of these tragic events nineteen Such haughty contempt for the opinion of mankind whilst it imprints an indelible stain on the memory of Constantine must remind us of the very different behavior of one of the greatest monarchs of the present age The Czar Peter in the full possession of despotic power submitted to the judgment of Russia of Europe and of posterity the reasons which had compelled him to subscribe the condemnation of a criminal or at least of a degenerate son twenty Footnote thirteen Ducange Fam Byzant p twenty eight Tillemont tom iv p six hundred ten Footnote fourteen His name was Porphyrius Optatianus The date of his panegyric written

Footnote eighteen Sororis filium commodae indolis juvenem Eutropius x six May I not be permitted to conjecture that Crispus had married Helena the daughter of the emperor Licinius and that on the happy delivery of the princess in the year three hundred twenty two a general pardon was granted by Constantine See Ducange Fam Byzant p forty seven and the law l ix tit xxxvii of the Theodosian code which has so much embarrassed the interpreters Godefroy tom iii p two hundred sixty seven Note This conjecture is very doubtful The obscurity of the law quoted from the Theodosian code scarcely allows any inference and there is extant but one meda which can be attributed to a Helena wife of Crispus Footnote nineteen See the life of Constantine particularly l ii c nineteen twenty Two hundred and fifty years afterwards Evagrius l iii c forty one deduced from the silence of Eusebius a vain argument against the reality of the fact Footnote twenty Histoire de Pierre le Grand par Voltaire part ii c ten The innocence of Crispus was so universally acknowledged that the modern Greeks who adore the memory of their founder are reduced to palliate the guilt of a parricide which the common feelings of human nature forbade them to justify They pretend that as soon as the afflicted father discovered the falsehood of the accusation by which his credulity had been so fatally misled he published to the world his repentance and remorse that he mourned forty days during which he abstained from the use of the bath and all the ordinary comforts of life and that for the lasting instruction of posterity he erected a golden statue of Crispus with this memorable inscription To my son whom I unjustly condemned twenty one A tale so moral and so interesting would deserve to be supported by less exceptionable authority but if we consult the more ancient and authentic writers they will inform us that the repentance of Constantine was manifested only in acts of blood and revenge and that he atoned for the murder of an innocent son by the execution perhaps of a guilty wife They ascribe the misfortunes of Crispus to the arts of his step mother Fausta whose implacable hatred or whose disappointed love renewed in the palace of Constantine the ancient tragedy of Hippolitus and of Phaedra twenty two Like the daughter of Minos the daughter of Maximian accused her son in law of an incestuous attempt on the chastity of his father s wife and easily obtained from the jealousy of the emperor a sentence of death against a young prince whom she considered with reason as the most formidable rival of her own children But Helena the aged mother of Constantine lamented and revenged the untimely fate of her grandson Crispus nor was it long before a real or pretended discovery was made that Fausta herself entertained a criminal connection with a slave belonging to the Imperial stables twenty three Her condemnation and punishment were the instant consequences of the charge and the adulteress was suffocated by the steam of a bath which for that purpose had been heated to an extraordinary degree twenty four By some it will perhaps be thought that the remembrance of a conjugal union of twenty years and the honor of their common offspring the destined heirs of the throne might have softened the obdurate heart of Constantine and persuaded him to suffer his wife however guilty she might appear to expiate her offences in a solitary prison But it seems a superfluous labor to weigh the propriety unless we could ascertain the truth of this singular event which is attended with some circumstances of doubt and perplexity Those who have attacked and those who have defended the character of Constantine have alike disregarded two very remarkable passages of two orations pronounced under the succeeding reign The former celebrates the virtues the beauty and the fortune of the empress Fausta the daughter wife sister and mother of so many princes twenty five The latter asserts in explicit terms that the mother of the younger Constantine who was slain three years after his father s death survived to weep over the fate of her son twenty six Notwithstanding the positive testimony of several writers of the Pagan as well as of the Christian religion there may still remain some reason to believe or at least to suspect that Fausta escaped the blind and suspicious cruelty of her husband twenty sixa The deaths of a son and a nephew with the execution of a great number of respectable and perhaps innocent friends twenty seven who were involved in their fall may be sufficient however to justify the discontent of the Roman people and to explain the satirical verses affixed to the palace gate comparing the splendid and bloody reigns of Constantine and Nero twenty eight Footnote twenty one In order to prove that the statue was erected by Constantine and afterwards concealed by the malice of the Arians Codinus very readily creates p thirty four two witnesses Hippolitus and the younger Herodotus to whose imaginary histories he appeals with unblushing confidence Footnote twenty two Zosimus l ii p one hundred three may be considered as our original The ingenuity of the moderns assisted by a few hints from the ancients has illustrated and improved his obscure and imperfect narrative Footnote twenty three Philostorgius l ii c four Zosimus l ii p one hundred four one hundred sixteen imputes to Constantine the death of two wives of the innocent Fausta and of an adulteress who was the mother of his three successors According to Jerom three or four years elapsed between the death of Crispus and that of Fausta The elder Victor is prudently silent Footnote twenty four If Fausta was put to death it is reasonable to believe that the private apartments of the palace were the scene of her execution The orator Chrysostom indulges his fancy by exposing the naked desert mountain to be devoured by wild beasts Footnote twenty five Julian Orat i He seems to call her the mother of Crispus She might assume that title by adoption At least she was not considered as his mortal enemy Julian compares the fortune of Fausta with that of Parysatis the Persian queen A Roman would have more naturally recollected the second Agrippina Et moi qui sur le trone ai suivi mes ancetres Moi fille femme soeur et mere de vos maitres Footnote twenty six Monod in

obscure libeller or a disappointed patriot but to Ablavius prime minister and favorite of the emperor We may now perceive that the imprecations of the Roman people were dictated by humanity as well as by superstition Zosim l ii p one hundred five Chapter XVIII Character Of Constantine And His Sons Part II By the death of Crispus the inheritance of the empire seemed to devolve on the three sons of Fausta who have been already mentioned under the names of Constantine of Constantius and of Constans These young princes were successively invested with the title of Caesar and the dates of their promotion may be referred to the tenth the twentieth and the thirtieth years of the reign of their father twenty nine This conduct though it tended to multiply the future masters of the Roman world might be excused by the partiality of paternal affection but it is not so easy to understand the motives of the emperor when he endangered the safety both of his family and of his people by the unnecessary elevation of his two nephews Dalmatius and Hannibalianus The former was raised by the title of Caesar to an equality with his cousins In favor of the latter Constantine invented the new and singular appellation of Nobilissimus thirty to which he annexed the flattering distinction of a robe of purple and gold But of the whole series of Roman princes in any age of the empire Hannibalianus alone was distinguished by the title of King a name which the subjects of Tiberius would have detested as the profane and cruel insult of capricious tyranny The use of such a title even as it appears under the reign of Constantine is a strange and unconnected fact which can scarcely be admitted on the joint authority of Imperial medals and contemporary writers thirty one thirty onea

the elder Victor the Chronicle of Jerom and the doubtful traditions of Theophanes and Cedrenus Among the different branches of the human race the Sarmatians form a very remarkable shade as they seem to unite the manners of the Asiatic barbarians with the figure and complexion of the ancient inhabitants of Europe According to the various accidents of peace and war of alliance or conquest the Sarmatians were sometimes confined to the banks of the Tanais and they sometimes spread themselves over the immense plains which lie between the Vistula and the Volga thirty six The care of their numerous flocks and herds the pursuit of game and the exercises of war or rather of rapine directed the vagrant motions of the Sarmatians The movable camps or cities the ordinary residence of their wives and children consisted only of large wagons drawn by oxen and covered in the form of tents The military strength of the nation was composed of cavalry and the custom of their warriors to lead in their hand one or two spare horses enabled them to advance and to retreat with a rapid diligence which surprised the security and eluded the pursuit of a distant enemy thirty seven Their poverty of iron prompted their rude industry to invent a sort of cuirass which was capable of resisting a sword or javelin though it was formed only of horses hoofs cut into thin and polished slices carefully laid over each other in the manner of scales or feathers and strongly sewed upon an under garment of coarse linen thirty eight The offensive arms of the Sarmatians were short daggers long lances and a weighty bow with a quiver of arrows They were reduced to the necessity of employing fish bones for the points of their weapons but the custom of dipping them in a venomous liquor that poisoned the wounds which they inflicted is alone sufficient to prove the most savage manners since a people impressed with a sense of humanity would have abhorred so cruel a practice and a nation skilled in the arts of war would have disdained so impotent a resource thirty nine Whenever these Barbarians issued from their deserts in quest of prey their shaggy beards uncombed locks the furs with which they were covered from head to foot and their fierce countenances which seemed to express the innate cruelty of their minds inspired the more civilized provincials of Rome with horror and dismay Footnote

appears to have been drawn from the viper and a mixture of human blood The use of poisoned arms which has been spread over both worlds never preserved a savage tribe from the arms of a disciplined enemy The tender Ovid after a youth spent in the enjoyment of fame and luxury was condemned to a hopeless exile on the frozen banks of the Danube where he was exposed almost without defence to the fury of these monsters of the desert with whose stern spirits he feared that his gentle shade might hereafter be confounded In his pathetic but sometimes unmanly lamentations forty he describes in the most lively colors the dress and manners the arms and inroads of the Getae and Sarmatians who were associated for the purposes of destruction and from the accounts of history there is some reason to believe that these Sarmatians were the Jazygae one of the most numerous and warlike tribes of the nation The allurements of plenty engaged them to seek a permanent establishment on the frontiers of the empire Soon after the reign of Augustus they obliged the Dacians who subsisted by fishing on the banks of the River Teyss or Tibiscus to retire into the hilly country and to abandon to the victorious Sarmatians the fertile plains of the Upper Hungary which are bounded by the course of the Danube and the semicircular enclosure of the Carpathian Mountains forty one In this advantageous position they watched or suspended the moment of attack as they were provoked by injuries or appeased by presents they gradually acquired the skill of using more dangerous weapons and although the Sarmatians did not illustrate their name by any memorable exploits they occasionally assisted their eastern and western neighbors the Goths and the Germans with a formidable body of cavalry They lived under the irregular aristocracy of their chieftains forty two but after they had received into their bosom the fugitive Vandals who yielded to the pressure of the Gothic power they seem to have chosen a king from that nation and from the illustrious race of the Astingi who had formerly dwelt on the hores of the northern ocean forty three Footnote forty The nine books of Poetical Epistles which Ovid composed during the seven first years of his melancholy exile possess beside the merit of elegance a double value They exhibit a picture of the human mind under very singular circumstances and they

Goth Jornandes with the Greek and Latin historians of Constantine It may be observed that Isidore who lived in Spain under the dominion of the Goths gives them for enemies not the Vandals but the Sarmatians See his Chronicle in Grotius p seven hundred nine Note I have already noticed the confusion which must necessarily arise in history when names purely geographical as this of Sarmatia are taken for historical names belonging to a single nation We perceive it here it has forced Gibbon to suppose without any reason but the necessity of extricating himself from his perplexity that the Sarmatians had taken a king from among the Vandals a supposition entirely contrary to the usages of Barbarians Dacia at this period was occupied not by Sarmatians who have never formed a distinct race but by Vandals whom the ancients have often confounded under the general term Sarmatians See Gatterer s Welt Geschiehte p four hundred sixty four G This motive of enmity must have inflamed the subjects of contention which perpetually arise on the confines of warlike and independent nations The Vandal princes were stimulated by fear and revenge the Gothic kings aspired to extend their dominion from the Euxine to the frontiers of Germany and the waters of the Maros a small river which falls into the Teyss were stained with the blood of the contending Barbarians After some experience of the superior strength and numbers of their adversaries the Sarmatians implored the protection of the Roman monarch who beheld with pleasure the discord of the nations but who was justly alarmed by the progress of the Gothic arms As soon as Constantine had declared himself in favor of the weaker party the haughty Araric king of the Goths instead of expecting the attack of the legions boldly passed the Danube and spread terror and devastation through the province of Maesia 
1607_134636_000020_000000	train-clean-360	To oppose the inroad of this destroying host the aged emperor took the field in person but on this occasion either his conduct or his fortune betrayed the glory which he had acquired in so many foreign and domestic wars

safety by a precipitate and ignominious retreat forty threea The event of a second and more successful action retrieved the honor of the Roman name and the powers of art and discipline prevailed after an obstinate contest over the efforts of irregular valor The broken army of the Goths abandoned the field of battle the wasted province and the passage of the Danube and although the eldest of the sons of Constantine was permitted to supply the place of his father the merit of the victory which diffused universal joy was ascribed to the auspicious counsels of the emperor himself Footnote forty threea Gibbon states that Constantine was defeated by the Goths in a first battle No ancient author mentions such an event It is no doubt a mistake in Gibbon saint Martin note to Le Beau i three hundred twenty four M He contributed at least to improve this advantage by his negotiations with the free and warlike people of Chersonesus forty four whose capital situate on the western coast of the Tauric or Crimaean peninsula still retained some vestiges of a Grecian colony and was governed by a perpetual magistrate assisted by a council of senators emphatically styled the Fathers of the City The Chersonites were animated against the Goths by the memory of the wars which in the preceding century they had maintained with unequal forces against the invaders of their country They were connected with the Romans by the mutual benefits of commerce as they were supplied from the provinces of Asia with corn and manufactures which they purchased with their only productions salt wax and hides Obedient to the requisition of Constantine they prepared under the conduct of their magistrate Diogenes a considerable army of which the principal strength consisted in cross bows and military chariots The speedy march and intrepid attack of the Chersonites by diverting the attention of the Goths assisted the operations of the Imperial generals The Goths vanquished on every side were driven into the mountains where in the course of a severe campaign above a hundred thousand were computed to have perished by cold and hunger Peace was at length granted to their humble supplications the eldest son of Araric was accepted as the most valuable hostage and Constantine endeavored to convince their chiefs by a liberal distribution of honors and rewards how far the friendship of the Romans was preferable to their enmity In the expressions of his gratitude towards the faithful Chersonites the emperor was still more magnificent The pride of the nation was gratified by the splendid and almost royal decorations bestowed on their magistrate and his successors A perpetual exemption from all duties was stipulated for their vessels which traded to the ports of the Black Sea A regular subsidy was promised of iron corn oil and of every supply which could be useful either in peace or war But it was thought that the Sarmatians were sufficiently rewarded by their deliverance from impending ruin and the emperor perhaps with too strict an economy deducted some part of the expenses of the war from the customary gratifications which were allowed to that turbulent nation Footnote forty four I may stand in need of some apology for having used without scruple the authority of Constantine Porphyrogenitus in all that relates to the wars and negotiations of the Chersonites I am aware that he was a Greek of the tenth century and that his accounts of ancient history are frequently confused and fabulous But on this occasion his narrative is for the most part consistent and probable nor is there much difficulty in conceiving that an emperor might have access to some secret archives which had escaped the diligence of meaner historians For the situation and history of Chersone see Peyssonel des Peuples barbares qui ont habite les Bords du Danube c xvi eighty four ninety Gibbon has confounded the inhabitants of the city of Cherson the ancient Chersonesus with the people of the Chersonesus Taurica If he had read with more attention the chapter of Constantius Porphyrogenitus from which this narrative is derived he would have seen that the author clearly distinguishes the republic of Cherson from the rest of the Tauric Peninsula then possessed by the kings of the Cimmerian Bosphorus and that the city of Cherson alone furnished succors to the Romans The English historian is also mistaken in saying that the Stephanephoros of the Chersonites was a perpetual magistrate since it is easy to discover from the great number of Stephanephoroi mentioned by Constantine Porphyrogenitus that they were annual magistrates like almost all those which governed the Grecian republics saint Martin note to Le Beau i three hundred twenty six M Exasperated by this apparent neglect the Sarmatians soon forgot with the levity of barbarians the services which they had so lately received and the dangers which still threatened their safety Their inroads on the territory of the empire provoked the indignation of Constantine to leave them to their fate and he no longer opposed the ambition of Geberic a renowned warrior who had recently ascended the Gothic throne Wisumar the Vandal king whilst alone and unassisted he defended his dominions with undaunted courage was vanquished and slain in a decisive battle which swept away the flower of the Sarmatian youth forty foura The remainder of the nation embraced the desperate expedient of arming their slaves a hardy race of hunters and herdsmen by whose tumultuary aid they revenged their defeat and expelled the invader from their confines But they soon discovered that they had exchanged a foreign for a domestic enemy more dangerous and more implacable Enraged by their former servitude elated by their present glory the slaves under the name of Limigantes claimed and usurped the possession of the country which they had saved Their masters unable to withstand the ungoverned fury of the populace preferred the hardships of exile to the tyranny of their servants Some of the fugitive Sarmatians solicited a less ignominious dependence under the hostile standard of the Goths A more numerous band retired beyond the Carpathian Mountains among the Quadi their German allies and were easily admitted to share a superfluous waste of uncultivated land But the far greater part of the distressed nation turned their eyes towards the fruitful provinces of Rome Imploring the protection and forgiveness of the emperor they solemnly promised as subjects in peace and as soldiers in war the most inviolable fidelity to the empire which should graciously receive them into its bosom According to the maxims adopted by Probus and his successors the offers of this barbarian colony were eagerly accepted and a competent portion of lands in the provinces of Pannonia Thrace Macedonia and Italy were immediately assigned for the habitation and subsistence of three hundred thousand Sarmatians forty five forty fivea Footnote forty foura Gibbon supposes that this war took place because Constantine had deducted a part of the customary gratifications granted by his predecessors to the Sarmatians Nothing of this kind appears in the authors We see on the contrary that after his victory and to punish the Sarmatia is for the ravages they had committed he withheld the sums which it had been the custom to bestow saint Martin note to Le Beau i three hundred twenty seven M Footnote forty five The Gothic and Sarmatian wars are related in so broken and imperfect a manner that I have been obliged to compare

remote countries of India congratulated the peace and prosperity of his government forty six If he reckoned among the favors of fortune the death of his eldest son of his nephew and perhaps of his wife he enjoyed an uninterrupted flow of private as well as public felicity till the thirtieth year of his reign a period which none of his predecessors since Augustus had been permitted to celebrate Constantine survived that solemn festival about ten months and at the mature age of sixty four after a short illness he ended his memorable life at the palace of Aquyrion in the suburbs of Nicomedia whither he had retired for the benefit of the air and with the hope of recruiting his exhausted strength by the use of the warm baths The excessive demonstrations of grief or at least of mourning surpassed whatever had been practised on any former occasion Notwithstanding the claims of the senate and people of ancient Rome the corpse of the deceased emperor according to his last request was transported to the city which was destined to preserve the name and memory of its founder The body of Constantine adorned with the vain symbols of greatness the purple and diadem was deposited on a golden bed in one of the apartments of the palace which for that purpose had been splendidly furnished and illuminated The forms of the court were strictly maintained Every day at the appointed hours the principal officers of the state the army and the household approaching the person of their sovereign with bended knees and a composed countenance offered their respectful homage as seriously as if he had been still alive From motives of policy this theatrical representation was for some time continued nor could flattery neglect the opportunity of remarking that Constantine alone by the peculiar indulgence of Heaven had reigned after his death forty seven Footnote forty six Eusebius in Vit Const l iv c fifty remarks three circumstances relative to these Indians one They came from the shores of the eastern ocean a description which might be applied to the coast of China or Coromandel two They presented shining gems and unknown animals three They protested their kings had erected statues to represent the supreme majesty of Constantine Footnote forty seven Funus relatum in urbem sui nominis quod sane P R aegerrime tulit Aurelius Victor Constantine prepared for himself a stately tomb in the church of the Holy Apostles Euseb l iv c sixty The best and indeed almost the only account of the sickness death and funeral of Constantine is contained in the fourth book of his Life by Eusebius But this reign could subsist only in empty pageantry and it was soon discovered that the will of the most absolute monarch is seldom obeyed when his subjects have no longer anything to hope from his favor or to dread from his resentment The same ministers and generals who bowed with such referential awe before the inanimate corpse of their deceased sovereign were engaged in secret consultations to exclude his two nephews Dalmatius and Hannibalianus from the share which he had assigned them in the succession of the empire We are too imperfectly acquainted with the court of Constantine to form any judgment of the real motives which influenced the leaders of the conspiracy unless we should suppose that they were actuated by a spirit of jealousy and revenge against the praefect Ablavius a proud favorite who had long directed the counsels and abused the confidence of the late emperor The arguments by which they solicited the concurrence of the soldiers and people are of a more obvious nature and they might with decency as well as truth insist on the superior rank of the children of Constantine the danger of multiplying the number of sovereigns and the impending mischiefs which threatened the republic from the discord of so many rival princes who were not connected by the tender sympathy of fraternal affection The intrigue was conducted with zeal and secrecy till a loud and unanimous declaration was procured from the troops that they would suffer none except the sons of their lamented monarch to reign over the Roman empire forty eight The younger Dalmatius who was united with his collateral relations by the ties of friendship and interest is allowed to have inherited a considerable share of the abilities of the great Constantine but on this occasion he does not appear to have concerted any measure for supporting by arms the just claims which himself and his royal brother derived from the liberality of their uncle Astonished and overwhelmed by the tide of popular fury they seem to have remained without the power of flight or of resistance in the hands of their implacable enemies Their fate was suspended till the arrival of Constantius the second and perhaps the most favored of the sons of Constantine Footnote forty eight Eusebius l iv c six terminates his narrative by this loyal declaration of the troops and avoids all the invidious circumstances of the subsequent massacre Footnote forty nine The character of Dalmatius is advantageously though concisely drawn by Eutropius x nine Dalmatius Ceasar prosperrima indole neque patrou absimilis haud multo post oppressus est factione militari As both Jerom and the Alexandrian Chronicle mention the third year of the Ceasar which did not commence till the eighteenth or twenty fourth of September A D three hundred thirty seven it is certain that these military factions continued above four months Chapter XVIII Character Of Constantine And His Sons Part III The voice of the dying emperor had recommended the care of his funeral to the piety of Constantius and that prince by the vicinity of his eastern station could easily prevent the diligence of his brothers who resided in their distant government of Italy and Gaul As soon as he had taken possession of the palace of Constantinople his first care was to remove the apprehensions of his kinsmen by a solemn oath which he pledged for their security His next employment was to find some specious pretence which might release his conscience from the obligation of an imprudent promise The arts of fraud were made subservient to the designs of cruelty and a manifest forgery was attested by a person of the most sacred character From the hands of the Bishop of Nicomedia Constantius received a fatal scroll affirmed to be the genuine testament of his father in which the emperor expressed his suspicions that he had been poisoned by his brothers and conjured his sons to revenge his death and to consult their own safety by the punishment of the guilty fifty Whatever reasons might have been alleged by these unfortunate princes to defend their life and honor against so incredible an accusation they were silenced by the furious clamors of the soldiers who declared themselves at once their enemies their judges and their executioners The spirit and even the forms of legal proceedings were repeatedly violated in a promiscuous massacre which involved the two uncles of Constantius seven of his cousins of whom Dalmatius and Hannibalianus were the most illustrious the Patrician Optatus who had married a sister of the late emperor and the Praefect Ablavius whose power and riches had inspired him with some hopes of obtaining the purple If it were necessary to aggravate the horrors of this bloody scene we might add that Constantius himself had espoused the daughter of his uncle Julius and that he had bestowed his sister in marriage on his cousin Hannibalianus These alliances which the policy of Constantine regardless of the public prejudice fifty one had formed between the several branches of the Imperial house served only to convince mankind that these princes were as cold to the endearments of conjugal affection as they were insensible to the ties of consanguinity and the moving entreaties of youth and innocence Of so numerous a family Gallus and Julian alone the two youngest children of Julius Constantius were saved from the hands of the assassins till their rage satiated with slaughter had in some measure subsided The emperor Constantius who in the absence of his brothers was the most obnoxious to guilt and reproach discovered on some future occasions a faint and transient remorse for those cruelties which the perfidious counsels of his ministers and the irresistible violence of the troops had extorted from his unexperienced youth fifty two Footnote fifty I have related this singular anecdote on the authority of Philostorgius l ii c sixteen But if such a pretext was ever used by Constantius and his adherents it was laid aside with contempt as soon as it served their immediate purpose Athanasius tom i p eight hundred fifty six mention the oath which Constantius had taken for the security of his kinsmen The authority of Philostorgius is so suspicious as not to be sufficient to establish this fact which Gibbon has inserted in his history as certain while in the note he appears to doubt it G Footnote fifty one Conjugia sobrinarum diu ignorata tempore addito percrebuisse Tacit Annal xii six and Lipsius ad loc The repeal of the ancient law and the practice of five hundred years were

the same accusation But the three abbreviators Eutropius and the Victors use very qualifying expressions sinente potius quam jubente incertum quo suasore vi militum The massacre of the Flavian race was succeeded by a new division of the provinces which was ratified in a personal interview of the three brothers Constantine the eldest of the Caesars obtained with a certain preeminence of rank the possession of the new capital which bore his own name and that of his father Thrace and the countries of the East were allotted for the patrimony of Constantius and Constans was acknowledged as the lawful sovereign of Italy Africa and the Western Illyricum The armies submitted to their hereditary right and they condescended after some delay to accept from the Roman senate the title of Augustus When they first assumed the reins of government the eldest of these princes was twenty one the second twenty and the third only seventeen years of age fifty three Footnote fifty three Euseb in Vit Constantin l iv c sixty nine Zosimus l ii p one hundred seventeen Idat in Chron See two notes of Tillemont Hist des Empereurs tom iv p ten eighty six ten ninety one The reign of the eldest brother at Constantinople is noticed only in the Alexandrian Chronicle While the martial nations of Europe followed the standards of his brothers Constantius at the head of the effeminate troops of Asia was left to sustain the weight of the Persian war At the decease of Constantine the throne of the East was filled by Sapor son of Hormouz or Hormisdas and grandson of Narses who after the victory of Galerius had humbly confessed the superiority of the Roman power Although Sapor was in the thirtieth year of his long reign he was still in the vigor of youth as the date of his accession by a very strange fatality had preceded that of his birth The wife of Hormouz remained pregnant at the time of her husband s death and the uncertainty of the sex as well as of the event excited the ambitious hopes of the princes of the house of Sassan The apprehensions of civil war were at length removed by the positive assurance of the Magi that the widow of Hormouz had conceived and would safely produce a son Obedient to the voice of superstition the Persians prepared without delay the ceremony of his coronation A royal bed on which the queen lay in state was exhibited in the midst of the palace the diadem was placed on the spot which might be supposed to conceal the future heir of Artaxerxes and the prostrate satraps adored the majesty of their invisible and insensible sovereign fifty four If any credit can be given to this marvellous tale which seems however to be countenanced by the manners of the people and by the extraordinary duration of his reign we must admire not only the fortune but the genius of Sapor In the soft sequestered education of a Persian harem the royal youth could discover the importance of exercising the vigor of his mind and body and by his personal merit deserved a throne on which he had been seated while he was yet unconscious of the duties and temptations of absolute power His minority was exposed to the almost inevitable calamities of domestic discord his capital was surprised and plundered by Thair a powerful king of Yemen or Arabia and the majesty of the royal family was degraded by the captivity of a princess the sister of the deceased king But as soon as Sapor attained the age of manhood the presumptuous Thair his nation and his country fell beneath the first effort of the young warrior who used his victory with so judicious a mixture of rigor and clemency that he obtained from the fears and gratitude of the Arabs the title of Dhoulacnaf or protector of the nation fifty five fifty fivea Footnote fifty four Agathias who lived in the sixth century is the author of this story l iv p one hundred thirty five edit Louvre He derived his information from some extracts of the Persian Chronicles obtained and translated by the interpreter

captives to be pierced and then dislocated by a string passed through them Eastern authors are agreed with respect to the origin of this title Malcolm i eighty four Gibbon took his derivation from D Herbelot who gives both the latter on the authority of the Leb Tarikh M The ambition of the Persian to whom his enemies ascribe the virtues of a soldier and a statesman was animated by the desire of revenging the disgrace of his fathers and of wresting from the hands of the Romans the five provinces beyond the Tigris The military fame of Constantine and the real or apparent strength of his government suspended the attack and while the hostile conduct of Sapor provoked the resentment his artful negotiations amused the patience of the Imperial court The death of Constantine was the signal of war fifty six and the actual condition of the Syrian and Armenian frontier seemed to encourage the Persians by the prospect of a rich spoil and an easy conquest The example of the massacres of the palace diffused a spirit of licentiousness and sedition among the troops of the East who were no longer restrained by their habits of obedience to a veteran commander By the prudence of Constantius who from the interview with his brothers in Pannonia immediately hastened to the banks of the Euphrates the legions were gradually restored to a sense of duty and discipline but the season of anarchy had permitted Sapor to form the siege of Nisibis and to occupy several of the mo saint important fortresses of Mesopotamia fifty seven In Armenia the renowned Tiridates had long enjoyed the peace and glory which he deserved by his valor and fidelity to the cause of Rome fifty sevena The firm alliance which he maintained with Constantine was productive of spiritual as well as of temporal benefits by the conversion of Tiridates the character of a saint was applied to that of a hero the Christian faith was preached and established from the Euphrates to the shores of the Caspian and Armenia was attached to the empire by the double ties of policy and religion But as many of the Armenian nobles still refused to abandon the plurality of their gods and of their wives the public tranquillity was disturbed by a discontented faction which insulted the feeble age of their sovereign and impatiently expected the hour of his death He died at length after a reign of fifty six years and the fortune of the Armenian monarchy expired with Tiridates His lawful heir was driven into exile the Christian priests were either murdered or expelled from their churches the barbarous tribes of Albania were solicited to descend from their mountains and two of the most powerful governors usurping the ensigns or the powers of royalty implored the assistance of Sapor and opened the gates of their cities to the Persian garrisons The Christian party under the guidance of the Archbishop of Artaxata the immediate successor of saint Gregory the Illuminator had recourse to the piety of Constantius After the troubles had continued about three years Antiochus one of the officers of the household executed with success the Imperial commission of restoring Chosroes fifty sevenb the son of Tiridates to the throne of his fathers of distributing honors and rewards among the faithful servants of the house of Arsaces and of proclaiming a general amnesty which was accepted by the greater part of the rebellious satraps But the Romans derived more honor than advantage from this revolution Chosroes was a prince of a puny stature and a pusillanimous spirit Unequal to the fatigues of war averse to the society of mankind he withdrew from his capital to a retired palace which he built on the banks of the River Eleutherus and in the centre of a shady grove where he consumed his vacant hours in the rural sports of hunting and hawking To secure this inglorious ease he submitted to the conditions of peace which Sapor condescended to impose the payment of an annual tribute and the restitution of the fertile province of Atropatene which the courage of Tiridates and the victorious arms of Galerius had annexed to the Armenian monarchy fifty eight fifty eighta Footnote fifty six Sextus Rufus c

historian then translated into Latin Gibbon has not perceived all the chronological difficulties which occur in the narrative of that writer He has not thought of all the critical discussions which

than they are in the original This judgment applies to all which the English historian has derived from the Armenian author I have made the History of Moses a subject of particular attention and it is with confidence that I offer the results which I insert here and which will appear in the course of my notes In order to form a judgment of the difference which exists between me and Gibbon I will content myself with remarking that throughout he has committed an anachronism of thirty years from whence it follows that he assigns to the reign of Constantius many events which took place during that of Constantine He could not therefore discern the true connection which exists between the Roman history and that of Armenia or form a correct notion of the reasons which induced Constantine at the close of his life to make war upon the Persians or of the motives which detained Constantius so long in the East he does not even mention them saint Martin note on Le Beau i four hundred six I have inserted M saint Martin s observations but I must add that the chronology which he proposes is not generally received by Armenian scholars not I believe by Professor Neumann M During the long period of the reign of Constantius the provinces of the East were afflicted by the calamities of the Persian war fifty eightc The irregular incursions of the light troops alternately spread terror and devastation beyond the Tigris and beyond the Euphrates from the gates of Ctesiphon to those of Antioch and this active service was performed by the Arabs of the desert who were divided in their interest and affections some of their independent chiefs being enlisted in the party of Sapor whilst others had engaged their doubtful fidelity to the emperor fifty nine The more grave and important operations of the war were conducted with equal vigor and the armies of Rome and Persia encountered each other in nine bloody fields in two of which Constantius himself commanded in person sixty The event of the day was most commonly adverse to the Romans but in the battle of Singara their imprudent valor had almost achieved a signal and decisive victory The stationary troops of Singara sixtya retired on the approach of Sapor who passed the Tigris over three bridges and occupied near the village of Hilleh an advantageous camp which by the labor of his numerous pioneers he surrounded in one day with a deep ditch and a lofty rampart His formidable host when it was drawn out in order of battle covered the banks of the river the adjacent heights and the whole extent of a plain of above twelve miles which separated the two armies Both were alike impatient to engage but the Barbarians after a slight resistance fled in disorder unable to resist or desirous to weary the strength of the heavy legions who fainting with heat and thirst pursued them across the plain and cut in pieces a line of cavalry clothed in complete armor which had been posted before the gates of the camp to protect their retreat Constantius who was hurried along in the pursuit attempted without effect to restrain the ardor of his troops by representing to them the dangers of the approaching night and the certainty of completing their success with the return of day As they depended much more on their own valor than on the experience or the abilities of their chief they silenced by their clamors his timid remonstrances and rushing with fury to the charge filled up the ditch broke down the rampart and dispersed themselves through the tents to recruit their exhausted strength and to enjoy the rich harvest of their labors But the prudent Sapor had watched the moment of victory His army of which the greater part securely posted on the heights had been spectators of the action advanced in silence and under the shadow of the night and his Persian archers guided by the illumination of the camp poured a shower of arrows on a disarmed and licentious crowd The sincerity of history sixty one declares that the Romans were vanquished with a dreadful slaughter and that the flying remnant of the legions was exposed to the most intolerable hardships Even the tenderness of panegyric confessing that the glory of the emperor was sullied by the disobedience of his soldiers chooses to draw a veil over the circumstances of this melancholy retreat Yet one of those venal orators so jealous of the fame of Constantius relates with amazing coolness an act of such incredible cruelty as in the judgment of posterity must imprint a far deeper stain on the honor of the Imperial name The son of Sapor the heir of his crown had been made a captive in the Persian camp The unhappy youth who might have excited the compassion of the most savage enemy was scourged tortured and publicly executed by the inhuman Romans sixty two Footnote fifty eightc It was during this war that a bold flatterer whose name is unknown published the Itineraries of Alexander and Trajan in order to direct the victorious Constantius in the footsteps of those great conquerors of the East The former of these has been published for the first time by M Angelo Mai Milan eighteen seventeen reprinted at Frankfort eighteen eighteen It adds so little to our knowledge of Alexander s campaigns that it only excites our regret that it is not the Itinerary of Trajan of whose eastern victories we have no distinct record M Footnote fifty nine Ammianus xiv four gives a lively description of the wandering and predatory life of the Saracens who stretched from the confines of Assyria to the cataracts of the Nile It appears from the adventures of Malchus which Jerom has related in so entertaining a manner that the high road between Beraea and Edessa was infested by these robbers See Hieronym tom i p two hundred fifty six

prosperum praelium fuit nisi quod apud Singaram c This honest account is confirmed by the hints of Ammianus Rufus and Jerom The two first orations of Julian and the third oration of Libanius exhibit a more flattering picture but the recantation of both those orators after the death of Constantius while it restores us to the possession of the truth degrades their own character and that of the

his valor and conduct he could not hope to succeed in the execution of his designs while the fortified towns of Mesopotamia and above all the strong and ancient city of Nisibis remained in the possession of the Romans In the space of twelve years Nisibis which since the time of Lucullus had been deservedly esteemed the bulwark of the East sustained three memorable sieges against the power of Sapor and the disappointed monarch after urging his attacks above sixty eighty and a hundred days was thrice repulsed with loss and ignominy sixty three This large and populous city was situate about two days journey from the Tigris in the midst of a pleasant and fertile plain at the foot of Mount Masius A treble enclosure of brick walls was defended by a deep ditch sixty four and the intrepid resistance of Count Lucilianus and his garrison was seconded by the desperate courage of the people The citizens of Nisibis were animated by the exhortations of their bishop sixty five inured to arms by the presence of danger and convinced of the intentions of Sapor to plant a Persian colony in their room and to lead them away into distant and barbarous captivity The event of the two former sieges elated their confidence and exasperated the haughty spirit of the Great King who advanced a third time towards Nisibis at the head of the united forces of Persia and India The ordinary machines invented to batter or undermine the walls were rendered ineffectual by the superior skill of the Romans and many days had vainly elapsed when Sapor embraced a resolution worthy of an eastern monarch who believed that the elements themselves were subject to his power At the stated season of the melting of the snows in Armenia the River Mygdonius which divides the plain and the city of Nisibis forms like the Nile sixty six an inundation over the adjacent country By the labor of the Persians the course of the river was stopped below the town and the waters were confined on every side by solid mounds of earth On this artificial lake a fleet of armed vessels filled with soldiers and with engines which discharged stones of five hundred pounds weight advanced in order of battle and engaged almost upon a level the troops which defended the ramparts sixty sixa The irresistible force of the waters was alternately fatal to the contending parties till at length a portion of the walls unable to sustain the accumulated pressure gave way at once and exposed an ample breach of one hundred and fifty feet The Persians were instantly driven to the assault and the fate of Nisibis depended on the event of the day The heavy armed cavalry who led the van of a deep column were embarrassed in the mud and great numbers were drowned in the unseen holes which had been filled by the rushing waters The elephants made furious by their wounds increased the disorder and trampled down thousands of the Persian archers The Great King who from an exalted throne beheld the misfortunes of his arms sounded with reluctant indignation the signal of the retreat and suspended for some hours the prosecution of the attack But the vigilant citizens improved the opportunity of the night and the return of day discovered a new wall of six feet in height rising every moment to fill up the interval of the breach Notwithstanding the disappointment of his hopes and the loss of more than twenty thousand men Sapor still pressed the reduction of Nisibis with an obstinate firmness which could have yielded only to the necessity of defending the eastern provinces of Persia against a formidable invasion of the Massagetae sixty seven Alarmed by this intelligence he hastily relinquished the siege and marched with rapid diligence from the banks of the Tigris to those of the Oxus The danger and difficulties of the Scythian war engaged him soon afterwards to conclude or at least to observe a truce with the Roman emperor which was equally grateful to both princes as Constantius himself after the death of his two brothers was involved by the revolutions of the West in a civil contest which required and seemed to exceed the most vigorous exertion of his undivided strength Footnote sixty three See Julian

understand this parallel of a trifling rivulet with a mighty river There are many circumstances obscure and almost unintelligible in the description of these stupendous water works Footnote sixty sixa Macdonald Kinnier observes on these floating batteries As the elevation of place is considerably above the level of the country in its immediate vicinity and the Mygdonius is a very insignificant stream it is difficult to imagine how this work could have been accomplished even with the wonderful resources which the king must have had at his disposal Geographical Memoir p two hundred sixty two M Footnote sixty seven We are obliged to Zonaras tom ii l xiii p eleven for this invasion of the Massagetae which is perfectly consistent with the general series of events to which we are darkly led by the broken history of Ammianus After the partition of the empire three years had scarcely elapsed before the sons of Constantine seemed impatient to convince mankind that they were incapable of contenting themselves with the dominions which they were unqualified to govern The eldest of those princes soon complained that he was defrauded of his just proportion of the spoils of their murdered kinsmen and though he might yield to the superior guilt and merit of Constantius he exacted from Constans the cession of the African provinces as an equivalent for the rich countries of Macedonia and Greece which his brother had acquired by the death of Dalmatius The want of sincerity which Constantine experienced in a tedious and fruitless negotiation exasperated the fierceness of his temper and he eagerly listened to those favorites who suggested to him that his honor as well as his interest was concerned in the prosecution of the quarrel At the head of a tumultuary band suited for rapine rather than for conquest he suddenly broke onto the dominions of Constans by the way of the Julian Alps and the country round Aquileia felt the first effects of his resentment The measures of Constans who then resided in Dacia were directed with more prudence and ability On the news of his brother s invasion he detached a select and disciplined body of his Illyrian troops proposing to follow them in person with the remainder of his forces But the conduct of his lieutenants soon terminated the unnatural contest By the artful appearances of flight Constantine was betrayed into an ambuscade which had been concealed in a wood where the rash youth with a few attendants was surprised surrounded and slain His body after it had been found in the obscure stream of the Alsa obtained the honors of an Imperial sepulchre but his provinces transferred their allegiance to the conqueror who refusing to admit his elder brother Constantius to any share in these new acquisitions maintained the undisputed possession of more than two thirds of the Roman empire sixty eight Footnote sixty eight The causes and the events of this civil war are related with much perplexity and contradiction I have chiefly followed Zonaras and the younger Victor The monody ad Calcem Eutrop edit Havercamp pronounced on the death of Constantine might have been very instructive but prudence and false taste engaged the orator to involve himself in vague declamation Chapter XVIII Character Of Constantine And His Sons Part IV The fate of Constans himself was delayed about ten years longer and the revenge of his brother s death was reserved for the more ignoble hand of a domestic traitor The pernicious tendency of the system introduced by Constantine was displayed in the feeble administration of his sons who by their vices and weakness soon lost the esteem and affections of their people The pride assumed by Constans from the unmerited success of his arms was rendered more contemptible by his want of abilities and application His fond partiality towards some German captives distinguished only by the charms of youth was an object of scandal to the people sixty nine and Magnentius an ambitious soldier who was himself of Barbarian extraction was encouraged by the public discontent to assert the honor of the Roman name seventy The chosen bands of Jovians and Herculians who acknowledged Magnentius as their leader maintained the most respectable and important station in the Imperial camp The friendship of Marcellinus count of the sacred largesses supplied with a liberal hand the means of seduction The soldiers were convinced by the most specious arguments that the republic summoned them to break the bonds of hereditary servitude and by the choice of an active and vigilant prince to reward the same virtues which had raised the ancestors of the degenerate Constans from a private condition to the throne of the world As soon as the conspiracy was ripe for execution Marcellinus under the pretence of celebrating his son s birthday gave a splendid entertainment to the illustrious and honorable persons of the court of Gaul which then resided in the city of Autun The intemperance of the feast was artfully protracted till a very late hour of the night and the unsuspecting guests were tempted to indulge themselves in a dangerous and guilty freedom of conversation On a sudden the doors were thrown open and Magnentius who had retired for a few moments returned into the apartment invested with the diadem and purple The conspirators instantly saluted him with the titles of Augustus and Emperor The surprise the terror the intoxication the ambitious hopes and the mutual ignorance of the rest of the assembly prompted them to join their voices to the general acclamation The guards hastened to take the oath of fidelity the gates of the town were shut and before the dawn of day Magnentius became master of the troops and treasure of the palace and city of Autun By his secrecy and diligence he entertained some hopes of surprising the person of Constans who was pursuing in the adjacent forest his favorite amusement of hunting or perhaps some pleasures of a more private and criminal nature The rapid progress of fame allowed him however an instant for flight though the desertion of his soldiers and subjects deprived him of the power of resistance Before he could reach a seaport in Spain where he intended to embark he was overtaken near Helena seventy one at the foot of the Pyrenees by a party of light cavalry whose chief regardless of the sanctity of a temple executed his commission by the murder of the son of Constantine seventy two Footnote sixty nine Quarum gentium obsides pretio quaesitos pueros venustiore quod cultius habuerat libidine hujusmodi arsisse pro certo habet Had not the depraved taste of Constans been publicly avowed the elder Victor who held a considerable office in his brother s reign would not have asserted it in such positive terms Footnote seventy Julian Orat i and ii Zosim l ii p one hundred thirty four Victor in Epitome There is reason to believe that Magnentius was born in one of those Barbarian colonies which Constantius Chlorus had established in Gaul see this History vol i p four hundred fourteen His behavior may remind us of the patriot earl of Leicester the famous Simon de Montfort who could persuade the good people of England that he a Frenchman by birth had taken arms to deliver them from foreign favorites Footnote seventy one This ancient city had once flourished under the name of Illiberis Pomponius Mela ii five The munificence of Constantine gave it new splendor and his mother s name Helena it is still called Elne became the seat of a bishop who long afterwards transferred his residence to Perpignan the capital of modern Rousillon See D Anville Notice de l Ancienne Gaule p three hundred eighty Longuerue Description de la France p two hundred twenty three and the Marca Hispanica l i c two Footnote seventy two Zosimus l ii p one hundred nineteen one hundred twenty Zonaras tom ii l xiii p thirteen and the Abbreviators As soon as the death of Constans had decided this easy but important revolution the example of the court of Autun was imitated by the provinces of the West The authority of Magnentius was acknowledged through the whole extent of the two great praefectures of Gaul and Italy and the usurper prepared by every act of oppression to collect a treasure which might discharge the obligation of an immense donative and supply the expenses of a civil war The martial countries of Illyricum from the Danube to the extremity of Greece had long obeyed the government of Vetranio an aged general beloved for the simplicity of his manners and who had acquired some reputation by his experience and services in war seventy three Attached by habit by duty and by gratitude to the house of Constantine he immediately gave the strongest assurances to the only surviving son of his late master that he would expose with unshaken fidelity his person and his troops to inflict a just revenge on the traitors of Gaul But the legions of Vetranio were seduced rather than provoked by the example of rebellion their leader soon betrayed a want of firmness or a want of sincerity and his ambition derived a specious pretence from the approbation of the princess Constantina That cruel and aspiring woman who had obtained from the great Constantine her father the rank of Augusta placed the diadem with her own hands on the head of the Illyrian general and seemed to expect from his victory the accomplishment of those unbounded hopes of which she had been disappointed by the death of her husband Hannibalianus Perhaps it was without the consent of Constantina that the new emperor formed a necessary though dishonorable alliance with the usurper of the West whose purple was so recently stained with her brother s blood seventy four Footnote seventy three Eutropius x ten describes Vetranio with more temper and probably with more truth than either of the two Victors Vetranio was born of obscure parents in the wildest parts of Maesia and so much had his education been neglected that after his elevation he studied the alphabet Footnote seventy four The doubtful fluctuating conduct of Vetranio is described by Julian in his first oration and accurately explained by Spanheim who discusses the situation and behavior of Constantina The intelligence of these important events which so deeply affected the honor and safety of the Imperial house recalled the arms of Constantius from the inglorious prosecution of the Persian war He recommended the care of the East to his lieutenants and afterwards to his cousin Gallus whom he raised from a prison to a throne and marched towards Europe with a mind agitated by the conflict of hope and fear of grief and indignation On his arrival at Heraclea in Thrace the emperor gave audience to the ambassadors of Magnentius and Vetranio The first author of the conspiracy Marcellinus who in some measure had bestowed the purple on his new master boldly accepted this dangerous commission and his three colleagues were selected from the illustrious personages of the state and army These deputies were instructed to soothe the resentment and to alarm the fears of Constantius They were empowered to offer him the friendship and alliance of the western princes to cement their union by a double marriage of Constantius with the daughter of Magnentius and of Magnentius himself with the ambitious Constantina and to acknowledge in the treaty the preeminence of rank which might justly be claimed by the emperor of the East Should pride and mistaken piety urge him to refuse these equitable conditions the ambassadors were ordered to expatiate on the inevitable ruin which must attend his rashness if he ventured to provoke the sovereigns of the West to exert their superior strength and to employ against him that valor those abilities and those legions to which the house of Constantine had been indebted for so many triumphs Such propositions and such arguments appeared to deserve the most serious attention the answer of Constantius was deferred till the next day and as he had reflected on the importance of justifying a civil war in the opinion of the people he thus addressed his council who listened with real or affected credulity Last night said he after I retired to rest the shade of the great Constantine embracing the corpse of my murdered brother rose before my eyes his well known voice awakened me to revenge forbade me to despair of the republic and assured me of the success and immortal glory which would crown the justice of my arms The authority of such a vision or rather of the prince who alleged it silenced every doubt and excluded all negotiation The ignominious terms of peace were rejected with disdain One of the ambassadors of the tyrant was dismissed with the haughty answer of Constantius his colleagues as unworthy of the privileges of the law of nations were put in irons and the contending powers prepared to wage an implacable war seventy five Footnote seventy five See Peter the Patrician in the Excerpta Legationem p twenty seven Such was the conduct and such perhaps was the duty of the brother of Constans towards the perfidious usurper of Gaul The situation and character of Vetranio admitted of milder measures and the policy of the Eastern emperor was directed to disunite his antagonists and to separate the forces of Illyricum from the cause of rebellion It was an easy task to deceive the frankness and simplicity of Vetranio who fluctuating some time between the opposite views of honor and interest displayed to the world the insincerity of his temper and was insensibly engaged in the snares of an artful negotiation Constantius acknowledged him as a legitimate and equal colleague in the empire on condition that he would renounce his disgraceful alliance with Magnentius and appoint a place of interview on the frontiers of their respective provinces where they might pledge their friendship by mutual vows of fidelity and regulate by common consent the future operations of the civil war In consequence of this agreement Vetranio advanced to the city of Sardica seventy six at the head of twenty thousand horse and of a more numerous body of infantry a power so far superior to the forces of Constantius that the Illyrian emperor appeared to command the life and fortunes of his rival who depending on the success of his private negotiations had seduced the troops and undermined the throne of Vetranio The chiefs who had secretly embraced the party of Constantius prepared in his favor a public spectacle calculated to discover and inflame the passions of the multitude seventy seven The united armies were commanded to assemble in a large plain near the city In the centre according to the rules of ancient discipline a military tribunal or rather scaffold was erected from whence the emperors were accustomed on solemn and important occasions to harangue the troops The well ordered ranks of Romans and Barbarians with drawn swords or with erected spears the squadrons of cavalry and the cohorts of infantry distinguished by the variety of their arms and ensigns formed an immense circle round the tribunal and the attentive silence which they preserved was sometimes interrupted by loud bursts of clamor or of applause In the presence of this formidable assembly the two emperors were called upon to explain the situation of public affairs the precedency of rank was yielded to the royal birth of Constantius and though he was indifferently skilled in the arts of rhetoric he acquitted himself under these difficult circumstances with firmness dexterity and eloquence The first part of his oration seemed to be pointed only against the tyrant of Gaul but while he tragically lamented the cruel murder of Constans he insinuated that none except a brother could claim a right to the succession of his brother He displayed with some complacency the glories of his Imperial race and recalled to the memory of the troops the valor the triumphs the liberality of the great Constantine to whose sons they had engaged their allegiance by an oath of fidelity which the ingratitude of his most favored servants had tempted them to violate The officers who surrounded the tribunal and were instructed to act their part in this extraordinary scene confessed the irresistible power of reason and eloquence by saluting the emperor Constantius as their lawful sovereign The contagion of loyalty and repentance was communicated from rank to rank till the plain of Sardica resounded with the universal acclamation of Away with these upstart usurpers Long life and victory to the son of Constantine Under his banners alone we will fight and conquer The shout of thousands their menacing gestures the fierce clashing of their arms astonished and subdued the courage of Vetranio who stood amidst the defection of his followers in anxious and silent suspense Instead of embracing the last refuge of generous despair he tamely submitted to his fate and taking the diadem from his head in the view of both armies fell prostrate at the feet of his conqueror Constantius used his victory with prudence and moderation and raising from the ground the aged suppliant whom he affected to style by the endearing name of Father he gave him his hand to descend from the throne The city of Prusa was assigned for the exile or retirement of the abdicated monarch who lived six years in the enjoyment of ease and affluence He often expressed his grateful sense of the goodness of Constantius and with a very amiable simplicity advised his benefactor to resign the sceptre of the world and to seek for content where alone it could be found in the peaceful obscurity of a private condition seventy eight Footnote seventy six Zonaras tom ii l xiii p sixteen The position of Sardica near the modern city of Sophia appears better suited to this interview than the situation of either Naissus or Sirmium where it is placed by Jerom Socrates and Sozomen Footnote seventy seven See the two first orations of Julian particularly p thirty one and Zosimus l ii p one hundred twenty two The distinct narrative of the historian serves to illustrate the diffuse but vague descriptions of the orator Footnote seventy eight The younger Victor assigns to his exile the emphatical appellation of Voluptarium otium Socrates l ii c twenty eight is the voucher for the correspondence with the emperor which would seem to prove that Vetranio was indeed prope ad stultitiam simplicissimus The behavior of Constantius on this memorable occasion was celebrated with some appearance of justice and his courtiers compared the studied orations which a Pericles or a Demosthenes addressed to the populace of Athens with the victorious eloquence which had persuaded an armed multitude to desert and depose the object of their partial choice seventy nine The approaching contest with Magnentius was of a more serious and bloody kind The tyrant advanced by rapid marches to encounter Constantius at the head of a numerous army composed of Gauls and Spaniards of Franks and Saxons of those provincials who supplied the strength of the legions and of those barbarians who were dreaded as the most formidable enemies of the republic The fertile plains eighty of the Lower Pannonia between the Drave the Save and the Danube presented a spacious theatre and the operations of the civil war were protracted during the summer months by the skill or timidity of the combatants eighty one Constantius had declared his intention of deciding the quarrel in the fields of Cibalis a name that would animate his troops by the remembrance of the victory which on the same auspicious ground had been obtained by the arms of his father Constantine Yet by the impregnable fortifications with which the emperor encompassed his camp he appeared to decline rather than to invite a general engagement It was the object of Magnentius to tempt or to compel his adversary to relinquish this advantageous position and he employed with that view the various marches evolutions and stratagems which the knowledge of the art of war could suggest to an experienced officer He carried by assault the important town of Siscia made an attack on the city of Sirmium which lay in the rear of the Imperial camp attempted to force a passage over the Save into the eastern provinces of Illyricum and cut in pieces a numerous detachment which he had allured into the narrow passes of Adarne During the greater part of the summer the tyrant of Gaul showed himself master of the field The troops of Constantius were harassed and dispirited his reputation declined in the eye of the world and his pride condescended to solicit a treaty of peace which would have resigned to the assassin of Constans the sovereignty of the provinces beyond the Alps These offers were enforced by the eloquence of Philip the Imperial ambassador and the council as well as the army of Magnentius were disposed to accept them But the haughty usurper careless of the remonstrances of his friends gave orders that Philip should be detained as a captive or at least as a hostage while he despatched an officer to reproach Constantius with the weakness of his reign and to insult him by the promise of a pardon if he would instantly abdicate the purple That he should confide in the justice of his cause and the protection of an avenging Deity was the only answer which honor permitted the emperor to return But he was so sensible of the difficulties of his situation that he no longer dared to retaliate the indignity which had been offered to his representative The negotiation of Philip was not however ineffectual since he determined Sylvanus the Frank a general of merit and reputation to desert with a considerable body of cavalry a few days before the battle of Mursa Footnote seventy nine Eum Constantius facundiae vi dejectum Imperio in pri vatum otium removit Quae gloria post natum Imperium soli

seven hundred sixty two c Footnote eighty one Zosimus gives a very large account of the war and the negotiation l ii p one hundred twenty three one hundred thirty But as he neither shows himself a soldier nor a politician his narrative must be weighed with attention and received with caution The city of Mursa or Essek celebrated in modern times for a bridge of boats five miles in length over the River Drave and the adjacent morasses eighty two has been always considered as a place of importance in the wars of Hungary Magnentius directing his march towards Mursa set fire to the gates and by a sudden assault had almost scaled the walls of the town The vigilance of the garrison extinguished the flames the approach of Constantius left him no time to continue the operations of the siege and the emperor soon removed the only obstacle that could embarrass his motions by forcing a body of troops which had taken post in an adjoining amphitheatre The field of battle round Mursa was a naked and level plain on this ground the army of Constantius formed with the Drave on their right while their left either from the nature of their disposition or from the superiority of their cavalry extended far beyond the right flank of Magnentius eighty three The troops on both sides remained under arms in anxious expectation during the greatest part of the morning and the son of Constantine after animating his soldiers by an eloquent speech retired into a church at some distance from the field of battle and committed to his generals the conduct of this decisive day eighty four They deserved his confidence by the valor and military skill which they exerted They wisely began the action upon the left and advancing their whole wing of cavalry in an oblique line they suddenly wheeled it on the right flank of the enemy which was unprepared to resist the impetuosity of their charge But the Romans of the West soon rallied by the habits of discipline and the Barbarians of Germany supported the renown of their national bravery The engagement soon became general was maintained with various and singular turns of fortune and scarcely ended with the darkness of the night The signal victory which Constantius obtained is attributed to the arms of his cavalry His cuirassiers are described as so many massy statues of steel glittering with their scaly armor and breaking with their ponderous lances the firm array of the Gallic legions As soon as the legions gave way the lighter and more active squadrons of the second line rode sword in hand into the intervals and completed the disorder In the mean while the huge bodies of the Germans were exposed almost naked to the dexterity of the Oriental archers and whole troops of those Barbarians were urged by anguish and despair to precipitate themselves into the broad and rapid stream of the Drave eighty five The number of the slain was computed at fifty four thousand men and the slaughter of the conquerors was more considerable than that of the vanquished eighty six a circumstance which proves the obstinacy of the contest and justifies the observation of an ancient writer that the forces of the empire were consumed in the fatal battle of Mursa by the loss of a veteran army sufficient to defend the frontiers or to add new triumphs to the glory of Rome eighty seven Notwithstanding the invectives of a servile orator there is not the least reason to believe that the tyrant deserted his own standard in the beginning of the engagement He seems to have displayed the virtues of a general and of a soldier till the day was irrecoverably lost and his camp in the possession of the enemy Magnentius then consulted his safety and throwing away the Imperial ornaments escaped with some difficulty from the pursuit of the light horse who incessantly followed his rapid flight from the banks of the Drave to the foot of the Julian Alps eighty eight Footnote eighty two This remarkable bridge which is

Sermonis acer animi tumidi et immodice timidus artifex tamen ad occultandam audaciae specie formidinem Is it most likely that in the battle of Mursa his behavior was governed by nature or by art should incline for the latter The approach of winter supplied the indolence of Constantius with specious reasons for deferring the prosecution of the war till the ensuing spring Magnentius had fixed his residence in the city of Aquileia and showed a seeming resolution to dispute the passage of the mountains and morasses which fortified the confines of the Venetian province The surprisal of a castle in the Alps by the secret march of the Imperialists could scarcely have determined him to relinquish the possession of Italy if the inclinations of the people had supported the cause of their tyrant eighty nine But the memory of the cruelties exercised by his ministers after the unsuccessful revolt of Nepotian had left a deep impression of horror and resentment on the minds of the Romans That rash youth the son of the princess Eutropia and the nephew of Constantine had seen with indignation the sceptre of the West usurped by a perfidious barbarian Arming a desperate troop of slaves and gladiators he overpowered the feeble guard of the domestic tranquillity of Rome received the homage of the senate and assuming the title of Augustus precariously reigned during a tumult of twenty eight days The march of some regular forces put an end to his ambitious hopes the rebellion was extinguished in the blood of Nepotian of his mother Eutropia and of his adherents and the proscription was extended to all who had contracted a fatal alliance with the name and family of Constantine ninety But as soon as Constantius after the battle of Mursa became master of the sea coast of Dalmatia a band of noble exiles who had ventured to equip a fleet in some harbor of the Adriatic sought protection and revenge in his victorious camp By their secret intelligence with their countrymen Rome and the Italian cities were persuaded to display the banners of Constantius on their walls The grateful veterans enriched by the liberality of the father signalized their gratitude and loyalty to the son The cavalry the legions and the auxiliaries of Italy renewed their oath of allegiance to Constantius and the usurper alarmed by the general desertion was compelled with the remains of his faithful troops to retire beyond the Alps into the provinces of Gaul The detachments however which were ordered either to press or to intercept the flight of Magnentius conducted themselves with the usual imprudence of success and allowed him in the plains of Pavia an opportunity of turning on his pursuers and of gratifying his despair by the carnage of a useless victory ninety one Footnote eighty nine

confided and afterwards several bishops whose holy character might obtain a more favorable audience with the offer of resigning the purple and the promise of devoting the remainder of his life to the service of the emperor But Constantius though he granted fair terms of pardon and reconciliation to all who abandoned the standard of rebellion ninety two avowed his inflexible resolution to inflict a just punishment on the crimes of an assassin whom he prepared to overwhelm on every side by the effort of his victorious arms An Imperial fleet acquired the easy possession of Africa and Spain confirmed the wavering faith of the Moorish nations and landed a considerable force which passed the Pyrenees and advanced towards Lyons the last and fatal station of Magnentius ninety three The temper of the tyrant which was never inclined to clemency was urged by distress to exercise every act of oppression which could extort an immediate supply from the cities of Gaul ninety four Their patience was at length exhausted and Treves the seat of Praetorian government gave the signal of revolt by shutting her gates against Decentius who had been raised by his brother to the rank either of Caesar or of Augustus ninety five From Treves Decentius was obliged to retire to Sens where he was soon surrounded by an army of Germans whom the pernicious arts of Constantius had introduced into the civil dissensions of Rome ninety six In the mean time the Imperial troops forced the passages of the Cottian Alps and in the bloody combat of Mount Seleucus irrevocably fixed the title of rebels on the party of Magnentius ninety seven He was unable to bring another army into the field the fidelity of his guards was corrupted and when he appeared in public to animate them by his exhortations he was saluted with a unanimous shout of Long live the emperor Constantius The tyrant who perceived that they were preparing to deserve pardon and rewards by the sacrifice of the most obnoxious criminal prevented their design by falling on his sword ninety eight a death more easy and more honorable than he could hope to obtain from the hands of an enemy whose revenge would have been colored with the specious pretence of justice and fraternal piety The example of suicide was imitated by Decentius who strangled himself on the news of his brother s death The author of the conspiracy Marcellinus had long since disappeared in the battle of Mursa ninety nine and the public tranquillity was confirmed by the execution of the surviving leaders of a guilty and unsuccessful faction A severe inquisition

Elevation Of Julian Sarmatian And Persian Wars Victories Of Julian In Gaul The divided provinces of the empire were again united by the victory of Constantius but as that feeble prince was destitute of personal merit either in peace or war as he feared his generals and distrusted his ministers the triumph of his arms served only to establish the reign of the eunuchs over the Roman world Those unhappy beings the ancient production of Oriental jealousy and despotism one were introduced into Greece and Rome by the contagion of Asiatic luxury two Their progress was rapid and the eunuchs who in the time of Augustus had been abhorred as the monstrous retinue of an Egyptian queen three were gradually admitted into the families of matrons of senators and of the emperors themselves four Restrained by the severe edicts of Domitian and Nerva cherished by the pride of Diocletian reduced to an humble station by the prudence of Constantine six they multiplied in the palaces of his degenerate sons and insensibly acquired the knowledge and at length the direction of the secret councils of Constantius The aversion and contempt which mankind had so uniformly entertained for that imperfect species appears to have degraded their character and to have rendered them almost as incapable as they were supposed to be of conceiving any generous sentiment or of performing any worthy action seven But the eunuchs were skilled in the arts of flattery and intrigue and they alternately governed the mind of Constantius by his fears his indolence and his vanity eight Whilst he viewed in a deceitful mirror the fair appearance of public prosperity he supinely permitted them to intercept the complaints of the injured provinces to accumulate immense treasures by the sale of justice and of honors to disgrace the most important dignities by the promotion of those who had purchased at their hands the powers of oppression nine and to gratify their resentment against the few independent spirits who arrogantly refused to solicit the protection of slaves Of these slaves the most distinguished was the chamberlain Eusebius who ruled the monarch and the palace with such absolute sway that Constantius according to the sarcasm of an impartial historian possessed some credit with this haughty favorite ten By his artful suggestions the emperor was persuaded to subscribe the condemnation of the unfortunate Gallus and to add a new crime to the long list of unnatural murders which pollute the honor of the house of Constantine Footnote one Ammianus l xiv c six imputes the first practice of castration to the cruel ingenuity of Semiramis who is supposed to have reigned above nineteen hundred years before Christ The use of eunuchs is of high antiquity both in Asia and Egypt They are

Dacier ad loe By the word spado the Romans very forcibly expressed their abhorrence of this mutilated condition The Greek appellation of eunuchs which insensibly prevailed had a milder sound and a

Alexander Severus and Constantine for restraining the tyranny of the eunuchs deplores the mischiefs which they occasioned in other reigns Huc accedit quod eunuchos nec in consiliis nec in ministeriis habuit qui soli principes perdunt dum eos more gentium aut regum Persarum volunt vivere qui a populo etiam amicissimum semovent qui internuntii sunt aliud quam respondetur referentes claudentes principem suum et agentes ante omnia ne quid sciat Footnote seven Xenophon Cyropaedia l viii p five hundred forty has stated the specious reasons which engaged Cyrus to intrust his person to the guard of eunuchs He had observed in animals that although the practice of castration might tame their ungovernable fierceness it did not diminish their strength or spirit and he persuaded himself that those who were separated from the rest of human kind would be more firmly attached to the person of their benefactor But a long experience has contradicted the judgment of Cyrus Some particular instances may occur of eunuchs distinguished by their fidelity their valor and their abilities but if we examine the general history of Persia India and China we shall find that the power of the eunuchs has uniformly marked the decline and fall of every dynasty Footnote eight See Ammianus Marcellinus l xxi c sixteen l xxii c four The whole tenor of his impartial history serves to justify the invectives of Mamertinus of Libanius and of Julian himself who have insulted the vices of the court of Constantius Footnote nine Aurelius Victor censures the negligence of his sovereign in choosing the governors of the provinces and the generals of the army and concludes his history with a very bold observation as it is much more dangerous under a feeble reign to attack the ministers than the master himself Uti verum absolvam brevi ut Imperatore ipso clarius ita apparitorum plerisque magis atrox nihil Footnote ten Apud quem si vere dici debeat multum Constantius potuit Ammian l xviii c four When the two nephews of Constantine Gallus and Julian were saved from the fury of the soldiers the former was about twelve and the latter about six years of age and as the eldest was thought to be of a sickly constitution they obtained with the less difficulty a precarious and dependent life from the affected pity of Constantius who was sensible that the execution of these helpless orphans would have been esteemed by all mankind an act of the most deliberate cruelty eleven Different cities of Ionia and Bithynia were assigned for the places of their exile and education but as soon as their growing years excited the jealousy of the emperor he judged it more prudent to secure those unhappy youths in the strong castle of Macellum near Caesarea The treatment which they experienced during a six years confinement was partly such as they could hope from a careful guardian and partly such as they might dread from a suspicious tyrant twelve Their prison was an ancient palace the residence of the kings of Cappadocia the situation was pleasant the buildings of stately the enclosure spacious They pursued their studies and practised their exercises under the tuition of the most skilful masters and the numerous household appointed to attend or rather to guard the nephews of Constantine was not unworthy of the dignity of their birth But they could not disguise to themselves that they were deprived of fortune of freedom and of safety secluded from the society of all whom they could trust or esteem and condemned to pass their melancholy hours in the company of slaves devoted to the commands of a tyrant who had already injured them beyond the hope of reconciliation At length however the emergencies of the state compelled the emperor or rather his eunuchs to invest Gallus in the twenty fifth year of his age with the title of Caesar and to cement this political connection by his marriage with the princess Constantina After a formal interview in which the two princes mutually engaged their faith never to undertake any thing to the prejudice of each other they repaired without delay to their respective stations Constantius continued his march towards the West and Gallus fixed his residence at Antioch from whence with a delegated authority he administered the five great dioceses of the eastern praefecture thirteen In this fortunate change the new Caesar was not unmindful of his brother Julian who obtained the honors of his rank the appearances of liberty and the restitution of an ample patrimony fourteen Footnote eleven Gregory Nazianzen Orat iii p ninety reproaches the apostate with his ingratitude towards Mark bishop of Arethusa who had contributed to save his life and we learn though from a less respectable authority Tillemont Hist des Empereurs tom iv p nine hundred sixteen that Julian was concealed in the sanctuary of a church Note Gallus and Julian were not sons of the same mother Their father Julius Constantius had had Gallus by his first wife named Galla Julian was the son of Basilina whom he had espoused in a second marriage Tillemont Hist des Emp Vie de Constantin art three G Footnote twelve The most authentic account of the education and adventures of Julian is contained in the epistle or manifesto which he himself addressed to the senate and people of Athens Libanius Orat Parentalis on the side of the Pagans and Socrates l iii c one on that of the Christians have preserved several interesting circumstances Footnote thirteen For the promotion of Gallus see Idatius Zosimus and the two Victors According to Philostorgius l iv c one Theophilus an Arian bishop was the witness and as it were the guarantee of this solemn engagement He supported that character with generous firmness but M de Tillemont Hist des Empereurs tom iv p eleven twenty thinks it very improbable that a heretic should have possessed such virtue Footnote fourteen Julian was at first permitted to pursue his studies at Constantinople but the reputation which he acquired soon excited the jealousy of Constantius and the young prince was advised to withdraw himself to the less conspicuous scenes of Bithynia and Ionia The writers the most indulgent to the memory of Gallus and even Julian himself though he wished to cast a veil over the frailties of his brother are obliged to confess that the Caesar was incapable of reigning Transported from a prison to a throne he possessed neither genius nor application nor docility to compensate for the want of knowledge and experience A temper naturally morose and violent instead of being corrected was soured by solitude and adversity the remembrance of what he had endured disposed him to retaliation rather than to sympathy and the ungoverned sallies of his rage were often fatal to those who approached his person or were subject to his power fifteen Constantina his wife is described not as a woman but as one of the infernal furies tormented with an insatiate thirst of human blood sixteen Instead of employing her influence to insinuate the mild counsels of prudence and humanity she exasperated the fierce passions of her husband and as she retained the vanity though she had renounced the gentleness of her sex a pearl necklace was esteemed an equivalent price for the murder of an innocent and virtuous nobleman seventeen The cruelty of Gallus was sometimes displayed in the undissembled violence of popular or military executions and was sometimes disguised by the abuse of law and the forms of judicial proceedings The private houses of Antioch and the places of public resort were besieged by spies and informers and the Caesar himself concealed in a a plebeian habit very frequently condescended to assume that odious character Every apartment of the palace was adorned with the instruments of death and torture and a general consternation was diffused through the capital of Syria The prince of the East as if he had been conscious how much he had to fear and how little he deserved to reign selected for the objects of his resentment the provincials accused of some imaginary treason and his own courtiers whom with more reason he suspected of incensing by their secret correspondence the timid and suspicious mind of Constantius But he forgot that he was depriving himself of his only support the affection of the people whilst he furnished the malice of his enemies with the arms of truth and afforded the emperor the fairest pretence of exacting the forfeit of his purple and of his life eighteen Footnote fifteen See Julian ad S P Q A p two hundred

minister of considerable rank and two obscure agents who were resolved to make their fortune As long as the civil war suspended the fate of the Roman world Constantius dissembled his knowledge of the weak and cruel administration to which his choice had subjected the East and the discovery of some assassins secretly despatched to Antioch by the tyrant of Gaul was employed to convince the public that the emperor and the Caesar were united by the same interest and pursued by the same enemies nineteen But when the victory was decided in favor of Constantius his dependent colleague became less useful and less formidable Every circumstance of his conduct was severely and suspiciously examined and it was privately resolved either to deprive Gallus of the purple or at least to remove him from the indolent luxury of Asia to the hardships and dangers of a German war The death of Theophilus consular of the province of Syria who in a time of scarcity had been massacred by the people of Antioch with the connivance and almost at the instigation of Gallus was justly resented not only as an act of wanton cruelty but as a dangerous insult on the supreme majesty of Constantius Two ministers of illustrious rank Domitian the Oriental praefect and Montius quaestor of the palace were empowered by a special commission nineteena to visit and reform the state of the East They were instructed to behave towards Gallus with moderation and respect and by the gentlest arts of persuasion to engage him to comply with the invitation of his brother and colleague The rashness of the praefect disappointed these prudent measures and hastened his own ruin as well as that of his enemy On his arrival at Antioch Domitian passed disdainfully before the gates of the palace and alleging a slight pretence of indisposition continued several days in sullen retirement to prepare an inflammatory memorial which he transmitted to the Imperial court Yielding at length to the pressing solicitations of Gallus the praefect condescended to take his seat in council but his first step was to signify a concise and haughty mandate importing that the Caesar should immediately repair to Italy and threatening that he himself would punish his delay or hesitation by suspending the usual allowance of his household The nephew and daughter of Constantine who could ill brook the insolence of a subject expressed their resentment by instantly delivering Domitian to the custody of a guard The quarrel still admitted of some terms of accommodation They were rendered impracticable by the imprudent behavior of Montius a statesman whose arts and experience were frequently betrayed by the levity of his disposition twenty The quaestor reproached Gallus in a haughty language that a prince who was scarcely authorized to remove a municipal magistrate should presume to imprison a Praetorian praefect convoked a meeting of the civil and military officers and required them in the name of their sovereign to defend the person and dignity of his representatives By this rash declaration of war the impatient temper of Gallus was provoked to embrace the most desperate counsels He ordered his guards to stand to their arms assembled the populace of Antioch and recommended to their zeal the care of his safety and revenge His commands were too fatally obeyed They rudely seized the praefect and the quaestor and tying their legs together with ropes they dragged them through the streets of the city inflicted a thousand insults and a thousand wounds on these unhappy victims and at last precipitated their mangled and lifeless bodies into the stream of the Orontes twenty one Footnote nineteen Zonaras l xiii tom ii p seventeen eighteen The assassins had seduced a great number of legionaries but their designs were discovered and revealed by an old woman in whose cottage they lodged Footnote nineteena The commission seems to have been granted to Domitian alone Montius interfered to support his authority Amm Marc loc cit M Footnote twenty In the present text of Ammianus we read Asper quidem sed ad lenitatem propensior which forms a sentence of contradictory nonsense With the aid of an old manuscript Valesius has rectified the first of these corruptions and we perceive a ray of light in the substitution of the word vafer If we venture to change lenitatem into lexitatem this alteration of a single letter will render the whole passage clear and consistent Footnote twenty one Instead of being obliged to collect scattered and imperfect hints from various sources we now enter into the full stream of the history of Ammianus and need only refer to the seventh and ninth chapters of his fourteenth book Philostorgius however l iii c twenty eight though partial to Gallus should not be entirely overlooked After such a deed whatever might have been the designs of Gallus it was only in a field of battle that he could assert his innocence with any hope of success But the mind of that prince was formed of an equal mixture of violence and weakness Instead of assuming the title of Augustus instead of employing in his defence the troops and treasures of the East he suffered himself to be deceived by the affected tranquillity of Constantius who leaving him the vain pageantry of a court imperceptibly recalled the veteran legions from the provinces of Asia But as it still appeared dangerous to arrest Gallus in his capital the slow and safer arts of dissimulation were practised with success The frequent and pressing epistles of Constantius were filled with professions of confidence and friendship exhorting the Caesar to discharge the duties of his high station to relieve his colleague from a part of the public cares and to assist the West by his presence his counsels and his arms After so many reciprocal injuries Gallus had reason to fear and to distrust But he had neglected the opportunities of flight and of resistance he was seduced by the flattering assurances of the tribune Scudilo who under the semblance of a rough soldier disguised the most artful insinuation and he depended on the credit of his wife Constantina till the unseasonable death of that princess completed the ruin in which he had been involved by her impetuous passions twenty two Footnote twenty two She had preceded her husband but died of a fever on the road at a little place in Bithynia called Coenum Gallicanum Chapter XIX Constantius Sole Emperor Part II After a long delay the reluctant Caesar set forwards on his journey to the Imperial court From Antioch to Hadrianople he traversed the wide extent of his dominions with a numerous and stately train and as he labored to conceal his apprehensions from the world and perhaps from himself he entertained the people of Constantinople with an exhibition of the games of the circus The progress of the journey might however have warned him of the impending danger In all the principal cities he was met by ministers of confidence commissioned to seize the offices of government to observe his motions and to prevent the hasty sallies of his despair The persons despatched to secure the provinces which he left behind passed him with cold salutations or affected disdain and the troops whose station lay along the public road were studiously removed on his approach lest they might be tempted to offer their swords for the service of a civil war twenty three After Gallus had been permitted to repose himself a few days at Hadrianople he received a mandate expressed in the most haughty and absolute style that his splendid retinue should halt in that city while the Caesar himself with only ten post carriages should hasten to the Imperial residence at Milan In this rapid journey the profound respect which was due to the brother and colleague of Constantius was insensibly changed into rude familiarity and Gallus who discovered in the countenances of the attendants that they already considered themselves as his guards and might soon be employed as his executioners began to accuse his fatal rashness and to recollect with terror and remorse the conduct by which he had provoked his fate The dissimulation which had hitherto been preserved was laid aside at Petovio twenty threea in Pannonia He was conducted to a palace in the suburbs where the general Barbatio with a select band of soldiers who could neither be moved by pity nor corrupted by rewards expected the arrival of his illustrious victim In the close of the evening he was arrested ignominiously stripped of the ensigns of Caesar and hurried away to Pola twenty threeb in Istria a sequestered prison which had been so recently polluted with royal blood The horror which he felt was soon increased by the appearance of his implacable enemy the eunuch Eusebius who with the assistance of a notary and a tribune proceeded to interrogate him concerning the administration of the East The Caesar sank under the weight of shame and guilt confessed all the criminal actions and all the treasonable designs with which he was charged and by imputing them to the advice of his wife exasperated the indignation of Constantius who reviewed with partial prejudice the minutes of the examination The emperor was easily convinced that his own safety was incompatible with the life of his cousin the sentence of death was signed despatched and executed and the nephew of Constantine with his hands tied behind his back was beheaded in prison like the vilest malefactor twenty four Those who are inclined to palliate the cruelties of Constantius assert that he soon relented and endeavored to recall the bloody mandate but that the second messenger intrusted with the reprieve was detained by the eunuchs who dreaded the unforgiving temper of Gallus and were desirous of reuniting to their empire the wealthy provinces of the East twenty five Footnote twenty three The Thebaean legions which were then quartered at Hadrianople sent a deputation to Gallus with a tender of their services Ammian l xiv c eleven The Notitia s six twenty thirty eight edit Labb mentions three several legions which bore the name of

See the complete narrative of the journey and death of Gallus in Ammianus l xiv c eleven Julian complains that his brother was put to death without a trial attempts to justify or at least to excuse the cruel revenge which he had inflicted on his enemies but seems at last to acknowledge that he might justly have been deprived of the purple Footnote twenty five Philostorgius l iv c one Zonaras l xiii tom ii p nineteen But the former was partial towards an Arian monarch and the latter transcribed without choice or criticism whatever he found in the writings of the ancients Besides the reigning emperor Julian alone survived of all the numerous posterity of Constantius Chlorus The misfortune of his royal birth involved him in the disgrace of Gallus From his retirement in the happy country of Ionia he was conveyed under a strong guard to the court of Milan where he languished above seven months in the continual apprehension of suffering the same ignominious death which was daily inflicted almost before his eyes on the friends and adherents of his persecuted family His looks his gestures his silence were scrutinized with malignant curiosity and he was perpetually assaulted by enemies whom he had never offended and by arts to which he was a stranger twenty six But in the school of adversity Julian insensibly acquired the virtues of firmness and discretion He defended his honor as well as his life against the insnaring subtleties of the eunuchs who endeavored to extort some declaration of his sentiments and whilst he cautiously suppressed his grief and resentment he nobly disdained to flatter the tyrant by any seeming approbation of his brother s murder Julian most devoutly ascribes his miraculous deliverance to the protection of the gods who had exempted his innocence from the sentence of destruction pronounced by their justice against the impious house of Constantine twenty seven As the most effectual instrument of their providence he gratefully acknowledges the steady and generous friendship of the empress Eusebia twenty eight a woman of beauty and merit who by the ascendant which she had gained over the mind of her husband counterbalanced in some measure the powerful conspiracy of the eunuchs By the intercession of his patroness Julian was admitted into the Imperial presence he pleaded his cause with a decent freedom he was heard with favor and notwithstanding the efforts of his enemies who urged the danger of sparing an avenger of the blood of Gallus the milder sentiment of Eusebia prevailed in the council But the effects of a second interview were dreaded by the eunuchs and Julian was advised to withdraw for a while into the neighborhood of Milan till the emperor thought proper to assign the city of Athens for the place of his honorable exile As he had discovered from his earliest youth a propensity or rather passion for the language the manners the learning and the religion of the Greeks he obeyed with pleasure an order so agreeable to his wishes Far from the tumult of arms and the treachery of courts he spent six months under the groves of the academy in a free intercourse with the philosophers of the age who studied to cultivate the genius to encourage the vanity and to inflame the devotion of their royal pupil Their labors were not unsuccessful and Julian inviolably preserved for Athens that tender regard which seldom fails to arise in a liberal mind from the recollection of the place where it has discovered and exercised its growing powers The gentleness and affability of manners which his temper suggested and his situation imposed insensibly engaged the affections of the strangers as well as citizens with whom he conversed Some of his fellow students might perhaps examine his behavior with an eye of prejudice and aversion but Julian established in the schools of Athens a general prepossession in favor of his virtues and talents which was soon diffused over the Roman world twenty nine Footnote twenty six See Ammianus Marcellin l xv c one three eight Julian himself in his epistle to the Athenians draws a very lively and just picture of his own danger and of his sentiments He shows however a tendency to exaggerate his sufferings by insinuating though in obscure terms that they lasted above a year a period which cannot be reconciled with the truth of chronology Footnote twenty seven Julian

arts as well as the powers of their eloquence to represent Julian as the first of heroes or the worst of tyrants Gregory was his fellow student at Athens and the symptoms which he so tragically describes of the future wickedness of the apostate amount only to some bodily imperfections and to some peculiarities in his speech and manner He protests however that he then foresaw and foretold the calamities of the church and state Greg Nazianzen Orat iv p one hundred twenty one one hundred twenty two Whilst his hours were passed in studious retirement the empress resolute to achieve the generous design which she had undertaken was not unmindful of the care of his fortune The death of the late Caesar had left Constantius invested with the sole command and oppressed by the accumulated weight of a mighty empire Before the wounds of civil discord could be healed the provinces of Gaul were overwhelmed by a deluge of Barbarians The Sarmatians no longer respected the barrier of the Danube The impunity of rapine had increased the boldness and numbers of the wild Isaurians those robbers descended from their craggy mountains to ravage the adjacent country and had even presumed though without success to besiege the important city of Seleucia which was defended by a garrison of three Roman legions Above all the Persian monarch elated by victory again threatened the peace of Asia and the presence of the emperor was indispensably required both in the West and in the East For the first time Constantius sincerely acknowledged that his single strength was unequal to such an extent of care and of dominion thirty Insensible to the voice of flattery which assured him that his all powerful virtue and celestial fortune would still continue to triumph over every obstacle he listened with complacency to the advice of Eusebia which gratified his indolence without offending his suspicious pride As she perceived that the remembrance of Gallus dwelt on the emperor s mind she artfully turned his attention to the opposite characters of the two brothers which from their infancy had been compared to those of Domitian and of Titus thirty one She accustomed her husband to consider Julian as a youth of a mild unambitious disposition whose allegiance and gratitude might be secured by the gift of the purple and who was qualified to fill with honor a subordinate station without aspiring to dispute the commands or to shade the glories of his sovereign and benefactor After an obstinate though secret struggle the opposition of the favorite eunuchs submitted to the ascendency of the empress and it was resolved that Julian after celebrating his nuptials with Helena sister of Constantius should be appointed with the title of Caesar to reign over the countries beyond the Alps thirty two Footnote thirty Succumbere tot necessitatibus tamque crebris unum se quod nunquam fecerat aperte demonstrans Ammian l xv c eight He then expresses in their own words the fattering assurances of the courtiers Footnote thirty one Tantum a temperatis moribus Juliani differens fratris quantum inter Vespasiani filios fuit Domitianum et Titum Ammian l xiv c eleven The circumstances and education of the two brothers were so nearly the same as to afford a strong example of the innate difference of characters Footnote thirty two Ammianus l xv c eight Zosimus l iii p one hundred thirty seven one hundred thirty eight Although the order which recalled him to court was probably accompanied by some intimation of his approaching greatness he appeals to the people of Athens to witness his tears of undissembled sorrow when he was reluctantly torn away from his beloved retirement thirty three He trembled for his life for his fame and even for his virtue and his sole confidence was derived from the persuasion that Minerva inspired all his actions and that he was protected by an invisible guard of angels whom for that purpose she had borrowed from the Sun and Moon He approached with horror the palace of Milan nor could the ingenuous youth conceal his indignation when he found himself accosted with false and servile respect by the assassins of his family Eusebia rejoicing in the success of her benevolent schemes embraced him with the tenderness of a sister and endeavored by the most soothing caresses to dispel his terrors and reconcile him to his fortune But the ceremony of shaving his beard and his awkward demeanor when he first exchanged the cloak of a Greek philosopher for the military habit of a Roman prince amused during a few days the levity of the Imperial court thirty four Footnote thirty three Julian ad S P Q A p two hundred seventy five two hundred seventy six Libanius Orat x p two hundred sixty eight Julian did not yield till the gods had signified their will by repeated visions and omens His piety then forbade him to resist Footnote thirty four Julian himself relates p two hundred seventy four with some humor the circumstances of his own metamorphoses his downcast looks and his perplexity at being thus suddenly transported into a new world where every object appeared strange and hostile The emperors of the age of Constantine no longer deigned to consult with the senate in the choice of a colleague but they were anxious that their nomination should be ratified by the consent of the army On this solemn occasion the guards with the other troops whose stations were in the neighborhood of Milan appeared under arms and Constantius ascended his lofty tribunal holding by the hand his cousin Julian who entered the same day into the twenty fifth year of his age thirty five In a studied speech conceived and delivered with dignity the emperor represented the various dangers which threatened the prosperity of the republic the necessity of naming a Caesar for the administration of the West and his own intention if it was agreeable to their wishes of rewarding with the honors of the purple the promising virtues of the nephew of Constantine The approbation of the soldiers was testified by a respectful murmur they gazed on the manly countenance of Julian and observed with pleasure that the fire which sparkled in his eyes was tempered by a modest blush on being thus exposed for the first time to the public view of mankind As soon as the ceremony of his investiture had been performed Constantius addressed him with the tone of authority which his superior age and station permitted him to assume and exhorting the new Caesar to deserve by heroic deeds that sacred and immortal name the emperor gave his colleague the strongest assurances of a friendship which should never be impaired by time nor interrupted by their separation into the most distant climes As soon as the speech was ended the troops as a token of applause clashed their shields against their knees thirty six while the officers who surrounded the tribunal expressed with decent reserve their sense of the merits of the representative of Constantius Footnote thirty five See Ammian Marcellin l xv c eight Zosimus l iii p one hundred thirty nine Aurelius Victor Victor Junior in Epitom Eutrop x fourteen Footnote thirty six Militares omnes

potiori reverentia servaretur nec supra modum laudabant nec infra quam decebat The two princes returned to the palace in the same chariot and during the slow procession Julian repeated to himself a verse of his favorite Homer which he might equally apply to his fortune and to his fears thirty seven The four and twenty days which the Caesar spent at Milan after his investiture and the first months of his Gallic reign were devoted to a splendid but severe captivity nor could the acquisition of honor compensate for the loss of freedom thirty eight His steps were watched his correspondence was intercepted and he was obliged by prudence to decline the visits of his most intimate friends Of his former domestics four only were permitted to attend him two pages his physician and his librarian the last of whom was employed in the care of a valuable collection of books the gift of the empress who studied the inclinations as well as the interest of her friend In the room of these faithful servants a household was formed such indeed as became the dignity of a Caesar but it was filled with a crowd of slaves destitute and perhaps incapable of any attachment for their new master to whom for the most part they were either unknown or suspected His want of experience might require the assistance of a wise council but the minute instructions which regulated the service of his table and the distribution of his hours were adapted to a youth still under the discipline of his preceptors rather than to the situation of a prince intrusted with the conduct of an important war If he aspired to deserve the esteem of his subjects he was checked by the fear of displeasing his sovereign and even the fruits of his marriage bed were blasted by the jealous artifices of Eusebia thirty nine herself who on this occasion alone seems to have been unmindful of the tenderness of her sex and the generosity of her character The memory of his father and of his brothers reminded Julian of his own danger and his apprehensions were increased by the recent and unworthy fate of Sylvanus In the summer which preceded his own elevation that general had been chosen to deliver Gaul from the tyranny of the Barbarians but Sylvanus soon discovered that he had left his most dangerous enemies in the Imperial court A dexterous informer countenanced by several of the principal ministers procured from him some recommendatory letters and erasing the whole of the contents except the signature filled up the vacant parchment with matters of high and treasonable import By the industry and courage of his friends the fraud was however detected and in a great council of the civil and military officers held in the presence of the emperor himself the innocence of Sylvanus was publicly acknowledged But the discovery came too late the report of the calumny and the hasty seizure of his estate had already provoked the indignant chief to the rebellion of which he was so unjustly accused He assumed the purple at his head quarters of Cologne and his active powers appeared to menace Italy with an invasion and Milan with a siege In this emergency Ursicinus a general of equal rank regained by an act of treachery the favor which he had lost by his eminent services in the East Exasperated as he might speciously allege by the injuries of a similar nature he hastened with a few followers to join the standard and to betray the confidence of his too credulous friend After a reign of only twenty eight days Sylvanus was assassinated the soldiers who without any criminal intention had blindly followed the example of their leader immediately returned to their allegiance and the flatterers of Constantius celebrated the wisdom and felicity of the monarch who had extinguished a civil war without the hazard of a battle forty Footnote thirty seven The word purple which Homer had used as a vague but common epithet for death was applied by Julian to express very aptly the nature and object of his own apprehensions Footnote thirty eight He represents in the most pathetic terms p two hundred seventy seven the distress of his new situation The provision for his table was however so elegant and sumptuous that the young philosopher rejected it with disdain Quum legeret libellum assidue quem Constantius ut privignum ad studia mittens manu sua conscripserat praelicenter disponens quid in convivio Caesaris impendi deberit Phasianum et vulvam et sumen exigi vetuit et inferri Ammian Marcellin l xvi c five Footnote thirty nine If we recollect that Constantine the father of Helena died above eighteen years before in a mature old age it will appear probable that the daughter though a virgin could not be very young at the time of her marriage She was soon afterwards delivered of a son who died immediately quod obstetrix corrupta mercede mox natum praesecto plusquam convenerat umbilico necavit She accompanied the emperor and empress in their journey to Rome and the latter quaesitum venenum bibere per fraudem illexit ut quotiescunque concepisset immaturum abjicerit partum Ammian l xvi c ten Our physicians will determine whether there exists such a poison For my own part I am inclined to hope that the public malignity imputed the effects of accident as the guilt of Eusebia Footnote forty Ammianus xv v was perfectly well informed of the conduct and fate of Sylvanus He himself was one of the few followers who attended Ursicinus in his dangerous enterprise The protection of the Rhaetian frontier and the persecution of the Catholic church detained Constantius in Italy above eighteen months after the departure of Julian Before the emperor returned into the East he indulged his pride and curiosity in a visit to the ancient capital forty one He proceeded from Milan to Rome along the Aemilian and Flaminian ways and as soon as he approached within forty miles of the city the march of a prince who had never vanquished a foreign enemy assumed the appearance of a triumphal procession His splendid train was composed of all the ministers of luxury but in a time of profound peace he was encompassed by the glittering arms of the numerous squadrons of his guards and cuirassiers Their streaming banners of silk embossed with gold and shaped in the form of dragons waved round the person of the emperor Constantius sat alone in a lofty car resplendent with gold and precious gems and except when he bowed his head to pass under the gates of the cities he affected a stately demeanor of inflexible and as it might seem of insensible gravity The severe discipline of the Persian youth had been introduced by the eunuchs into the Imperial palace and such were the habits of patience which they had inculcated that during a slow and sultry march he was never seen to move his hand towards his face or to turn his eyes either to the right or to the left He was received by the magistrates and senate of Rome and the emperor surveyed with attention the civil honors of the republic and the consular images of the noble families The streets were lined with an innumerable multitude Their repeated acclamations expressed their joy at beholding after an absence of thirty two years the sacred person of their sovereign and Constantius himself expressed with some pleasantry he affected surprise that the human race should thus suddenly be collected on the same spot The son of Constantine was lodged in the ancient palace of Augustus he presided in the senate harangued the people from the tribunal which Cicero had so often ascended assisted with unusual courtesy at the games of the Circus and accepted the crowns of gold as well as the Panegyrics which had been prepared for the ceremony by the deputies of the principal cities His short visit of thirty days was employed in viewing the monuments of art and power which were scattered over the seven hills and the interjacent valleys He admired the awful majesty of the Capitol the vast extent of the baths of Caracalla and Diocletian the severe simplicity of the Pantheon the massy greatness of the amphitheatre of Titus the elegant architecture of the theatre of Pompey and the Temple of Peace and above all the stately structure of the Forum and column of Trajan acknowledging that the voice of fame so prone to invent and to magnify had made an inadequate report of the metropolis of the world The traveller who has contemplated the ruins of ancient Rome may conceive some imperfect idea of the sentiments which they must have inspired when they reared their heads in the splendor of unsullied beauty See The Pantheon The severe simplicity of the Pantheon Footnote forty one For the particulars of the visit of Constantius to Rome see Ammianus l xvi c ten We have only to add that Themistius was appointed deputy from Constantinople and that he composed his fourth oration for his ceremony The satisfaction which Constantius had received from this journey excited him to the generous emulation of bestowing on the Romans some memorial of his own gratitude and munificence His first idea was to imitate the equestrian and colossal statue which he had seen in the Forum of Trajan but when he had maturely weighed the difficulties of the execution forty two he chose rather to embellish the capital by the gift of an Egyptian obelisk In a remote but polished age which seems to have preceded the invention of alphabetical writing a great number of these obelisks had been erected in the cities of Thebes and Heliopolis by the ancient sovereigns of Egypt in a just confidence that the simplicity of their form and the hardness of their substance would resist the injuries of time and violence forty three Several of these extraordinary columns had been transported to Rome by Augustus and his successors as the most durable monuments of their power and victory forty four but there remained one obelisk which from its size or sanctity escaped for a long time the rapacious vanity of the conquerors It was designed by Constantine to adorn his new city forty five and after being removed by his order from the pedestal where it stood before the Temple of the Sun at Heliopolis was floated down the Nile to Alexandria The death of Constantine suspended the execution of his purpose and this obelisk was destined by his son to the ancient capital of the empire A vessel of uncommon strength and capaciousness was provided to convey this enormous weight of granite at least a hundred and fifteen feet in length from the banks of the Nile to those of the Tyber The obelisk of Constantius was landed about three miles from the city and elevated by the efforts of art and labor in the great Circus of Rome forty six forty sixa Footnote forty two Hormisdas a fugitive prince of Persia observed to the emperor that if he made such a horse he must think of preparing a similar stable the Forum of Trajan Another saying of Hormisdas is recorded that one thing only had displeased him to find that men died at Rome as well as elsewhere If we adopt this reading of the text of Ammianus displicuisse instead of placuisse we may consider it as a reproof of Roman vanity The contrary sense would be that of a misanthrope Footnote forty three When Germanicus visited the ancient monuments of Thebes the eldest of the priests explained to him the meaning of these hiero glyphics Tacit Annal ii c sixty But it seems probable that before the useful invention of an alphabet these natural or arbitrary signs were the common characters of the Egyptian nation See Warburton s Divine Legation of Moses vol iii p sixty nine two hundred forty three Footnote forty four See Plin Hist Natur l xxxvi c fourteen fifteen Footnote forty five Ammian Marcellin l xvii c four He gives us a Greek interpretation of the hieroglyphics and his commentator Lindenbrogius adds a Latin inscription which in twenty verses of the age of Constantius contain a short history of the obelisk Footnote forty six See Donat Roma Antiqua l iii c fourteen l iv c twelve and the learned though confused Dissertation of Bargaeus on Obelisks inserted in the fourth volume of Graevius s Roman Antiquities p eighteen ninety seven nineteen thirty six This dissertation is dedicated to Pope Sixtus V who erected the obelisk of Constantius in the square before the patriarchal church of at John Lateran Footnote forty sixa It is doubtful whether the obelisk transported by Constantius to Rome now exists Even from the text of Ammianus it is uncertain whether the interpretation of Hermapion refers to the older obelisk obelisco incisus est veteri quem videmus in Circo raised as he himself states in the Circus Maximus long before by Augustus or to the one brought by Constantius The obelisk in the square before the church of saint John Lateran is ascribed not to Rameses the Great but to Thoutmos II Champollion one Lettre a M de Blacas p thirty two M The departure of Constantius from Rome was hastened by the alarming intelligence of the distress and danger of the Illyrian provinces The distractions of civil war and the irreparable loss which the Roman legions had sustained in the battle of Mursa exposed those countries almost without defence to the light cavalry of the Barbarians and particularly to the inroads of the Quadi a fierce and powerful nation who seem to have exchanged the institutions of Germany for the arms and military arts of their Sarmatian allies forty seven The garrisons of the frontiers were insufficient to check their progress and the indolent monarch was at length compelled to assemble from the extremities of his dominions the flower of the Palatine troops to take the field in person and to employ a whole campaign with the preceding autumn and the ensuing spring in the serious prosecution of the war The emperor passed the Danube on a bridge of boats cut in pieces all that encountered his march penetrated into the heart of the country of the Quadi and severely retaliated the calamities which they had inflicted on the Roman province The dismayed Barbarians were soon reduced to sue for peace they offered the restitution of his captive subjects as an atonement for the past and the noblest hostages as a pledge of their future conduct The generous courtesy which was shown to the first among their chieftains who implored the clemency of Constantius encouraged the more timid or the more obstinate to imitate their example and the Imperial camp was crowded with the princes and ambassadors of the most distant tribes who occupied the plains of the Lesser Poland and who might have deemed themselves secure behind the lofty ridge of the Carpathian Mountains While Constantius gave laws to the Barbarians beyond the Danube he distinguished with specious compassion the Sarmatian exiles who had been expelled from their native country by the rebellion of their slaves and who formed a very considerable accession to the power of the Quadi The emperor embracing a generous but artful system of policy released the Sarmatians from the bands of this humiliating dependence and restored them by a separate treaty to the dignity of a nation united under the government of a king the friend and ally of the republic He declared his resolution of asserting the justice of their cause and of securing the peace of the provinces by the extirpation or at least the banishment of the Limigantes whose manners were still infected with the vices of their servile origin The execution of this design was attended with more difficulty than glory The territory of the Limigantes was protected against the Romans by the Danube against the hostile Barbarians by the Teyss The marshy lands which lay between those rivers and were often covered by their inundations formed an intricate wilderness pervious only to the inhabitants who were acquainted with its secret paths and inaccessible fortresses On the approach of Constantius the Limigantes tried the efficacy of prayers of fraud and of arms but he sternly rejected their supplications defeated their rude stratagems and repelled with skill and firmness the efforts of their irregular valor One of their most warlike tribes established in a small island towards the conflux of the Teyss and the Danube consented to pass the river with the intention of surprising the emperor during the security of an amicable conference They soon became the victims of the perfidy which they meditated Encompassed on every side trampled down by the cavalry slaughtered by the swords of the legions they disdained to ask for mercy and with an undaunted countenance still grasped their weapons in the agonies of death After this victory a considerable body of Romans was landed on the opposite banks of the Danube the Taifalae a Gothic tribe engaged in the service of the empire invaded the Limigantes on the side of the Teyss and their former masters the free Sarmatians animated by hope and revenge penetrated through the hilly country into the heart of their ancient possessions A general conflagration revealed the huts of the Barbarians which were seated in the depth of the wilderness and the soldier fought with confidence on marshy ground which it was dangerous for him to tread In this extremity the bravest of the Limigantes were resolved to die in arms rather than to yield but the milder sentiment enforced by the authority of their elders at length prevailed and the suppliant crowd followed by their wives and children repaired to the Imperial camp to learn their fate from the mouth of the conqueror After celebrating his own clemency which was still inclined to pardon their repeated crimes and to spare the remnant of a guilty nation Constantius assigned for the place of their exile a remote country where they might enjoy a safe and honorable repose The Limigantes obeyed with reluctance but before they could reach at least before they could occupy their destined habitations they returned to the banks of the Danube exaggerating the hardships of their situation and requesting with fervent professions of fidelity that the emperor would grant them an undisturbed settlement within the limits of the Roman provinces Instead of consulting his own experience of their incurable perfidy Constantius listened to his flatterers who were ready to represent the honor and advantage of accepting a colony of soldiers at a time when it was much easier to obtain the pecuniary contributions than the military service of the subjects of the empire The Limigantes were permitted to pass the Danube and the emperor gave audience to the multitude in a large plain near the modern city of Buda They surrounded the tribunal and seemed to hear with respect an oration full of mildness and dignity when one of the Barbarians casting his shoe into the air exclaimed with a loud voice Marha Marha forty sevena a word of defiance which was received as a signal of the tumult They rushed with fury to seize the person of the emperor his royal throne and golden couch were pillaged by these rude hands but the faithful defence of his guards who died at his feet allowed him a moment to mount a fleet horse and to escape from the confusion The disgrace which had been incurred by a treacherous surprise was soon retrieved by the numbers and discipline of the Romans and the combat was only terminated by the extinction of the name and nation of the Limigantes The free Sarmatians were reinstated in the possession of their ancient seats and although Constantius distrusted the levity of their character he entertained some hopes that a sense of gratitude might influence their future conduct He had remarked the lofty stature and obsequious demeanor of Zizais one of the noblest of their chiefs He conferred on him the title of King and Zizais proved that he was not unworthy to reign by a sincere and lasting attachment to the interests of his benefactor who after this splendid success received the name of Sarmaticus from the acclamations of his victorious army forty eight Footnote forty seven The events of this Quadian and Sarmatian war are related by Ammianus xvi ten xvii twelve

emperor and the Persian monarch at the distance of three thousand miles defended their extreme limits against the Barbarians of the Danube and of the Oxus their intermediate frontier experienced the vicissitudes of a languid war and a precarious truce Two of the eastern ministers of Constantius the Praetorian praefect Musonian whose abilities were disgraced by the want of truth and integrity and Cassian duke of Mesopotamia a hardy and veteran soldier opened a secret negotiation with the satrap Tamsapor forty nine forty ninea These overtures of peace translated into the servile and flattering language of Asia were transmitted to the camp of the Great King who resolved to signify by an ambassador the terms which he was inclined to grant to the suppliant Romans Narses whom he invested with that character was honorably received in his passage through Antioch and Constantinople he reached Sirmium after a long journey and at his first audience respectfully unfolded the silken veil which covered the haughty epistle of his sovereign Sapor King of Kings and Brother of the Sun and Moon such were the lofty titles affected by Oriental vanity expressed his satisfaction that his brother Constantius Caesar had been taught wisdom by adversity As the lawful successor of Darius Hystaspes Sapor asserted that the River Strymon in Macedonia was the true and ancient boundary of his empire declaring however that as an evidence of his moderation he would content himself with the provinces of Armenia and Mesopotamia which had been fraudulently extorted from his ancestors He alleged that without the restitution of these disputed countries it was impossible to establish any treaty on a solid and permanent basis and he arrogantly threatened that if his ambassador returned in vain he was prepared to take the field in the spring and to support the justice of his cause by the strength of his invincible arms Narses who was endowed with the most polite and amiable manners endeavored as far as was consistent with his duty to soften the harshness of the message fifty Both the style and substance were maturely weighed in the Imperial council and he was dismissed with the following answer Constantius had a right to disclaim the officiousness of his ministers who had acted without any specific orders from the throne he was not however averse to an equal and honorable treaty but it was highly indecent as well as absurd to propose to the sole and victorious emperor of the Roman world the same conditions of peace which he had indignantly rejected at the time when his power was contracted within the narrow limits of the East the chance of arms was uncertain and Sapor should recollect that if the Romans had sometimes been vanquished in battle they had almost always been successful in the event of the war A few days after the departure of Narses three ambassadors were sent to the court of Sapor who was already returned from the Scythian expedition to his ordinary residence of Ctesiphon A count a notary and a sophist had been selected for this important commission and Constantius who was secretly anxious for the conclusion of the peace entertained some hopes that the dignity of the first of these ministers the dexterity of the second and the rhetoric of the third fifty one would persuade the Persian monarch to abate of the rigor of his demands But the progress of their negotiation was opposed and defeated by the hostile arts of Antoninus fifty two a Roman subject of Syria who had fled from oppression and was admitted into the councils of Sapor and even to the royal table where according to the custom of the Persians the most important business was frequently discussed fifty three The dexterous fugitive promoted his interest by the same conduct which gratified his revenge He incessantly urged the ambition of his new master to embrace the favorable opportunity when the bravest of the Palatine troops were employed with the emperor in a distant war on the Danube He pressed Sapor to invade the exhausted and defenceless provinces of the East with the numerous armies of Persia now fortified by the alliance and accession of the fiercest Barbarians The ambassadors of Rome retired without success and a second embassy of a still more honorable rank was detained in strict confinement and threatened either with death or exile Footnote

fifty four who was himself despatched to observe the army of the Persians as they were preparing to construct a bridge of boats over the Tigris beheld from an eminence the plain of Assyria as far as the edge of the horizon covered with men with horses and with arms Sapor appeared in the front conspicuous by the splendor of his purple On his left hand the place of honor among the Orientals Grumbates king of the Chionites displayed the stern countenance of an aged and renowned warrior The monarch had reserved a similar place on his right hand for the king of the Albanians who led his independent tribes from the shores of the Caspian fifty foura The satraps and generals were distributed according to their several ranks and the whole army besides the numerous train of Oriental luxury consisted of more than one hundred thousand effective men inured to fatigue and selected from the bravest nations of Asia The Roman deserter who in some measure guided the councils of Sapor had prudently advised that instead of wasting the summer in tedious and difficult sieges he should march directly to the Euphrates and press forwards without delay to seize the feeble and wealthy metropolis of Syria But the Persians were no sooner advanced into the plains of Mesopotamia than they discovered that every precaution had been used which could retard their progress or defeat their design The inhabitants with their cattle were secured in places of strength the green forage throughout the country was set on fire the fords of the rivers were fortified by sharp stakes military engines were planted on the opposite banks and a seasonable swell of the waters of the Euphrates deterred the Barbarians from attempting the ordinary passage of the bridge of Thapsacus Their skilful guide changing his plan of operations then conducted the army by a longer circuit but through a fertile territory towards the head of the Euphrates where the infant river is reduced to a shallow and accessible stream Sapor overlooked with prudent disdain the strength of Nisibis but as he passed under the walls of Amida he resolved to try whether the majesty of his presence would not awe the garrison into immediate submission The sacrilegious insult of a random dart which glanced against the royal tiara convinced him of his error and the indignant monarch listened with impatience to the advice of his ministers who conjured him not to sacrifice the success of his ambition to the gratification of his resentment The following day Grumbates advanced towards the gates with a select body of troops and required the instant surrender of the city as the only atonement which could be accepted for such an act of rashness and insolence His proposals were answered by a general discharge and his only son a beautiful and valiant youth was pierced through the heart by a javelin shot from one of the balistae The funeral of the prince of the Chionites was celebrated according to the rites of the country and the grief of his aged father was alleviated by the solemn promise of Sapor that the guilty city of Amida should serve as a funeral pile to expiate the death and to perpetuate the memory of his son Footnote fifty four Ammian lxviii six seven eight ten Footnote fifty foura These perhaps were the barbarous tribes who inhabit the northern part of the present Schirwan the Albania

Marcellinus speaks saint Martin ii two hundred eighty five M The ancient city of Amid or Amida fifty five which sometimes assumes the provincial appellation of Diarbekir fifty six is advantageously situate in a fertile plain watered by the natural and artificial channels of the Tigris of which the least inconsiderable stream bends in a semicircular form round the eastern part of the city The emperor Constantius had recently conferred on Amida the honor of his own name and the additional fortifications of strong walls and lofty towers It was provided with an arsenal of military engines and the ordinary garrison had been reenforced to the amount of seven legions when the place was invested by the arms of Sapor fifty seven His first and most sanguine hopes depended on the success of a general assault To the several nations which followed his standard their respective posts were assigned the south to the Vertae the north to the Albanians the east to the Chionites inflamed with grief and indignation the west to the Segestans the bravest of his warriors who covered their front with a formidable line of Indian elephants fifty eight The Persians on every side supported their efforts and animated their courage and the monarch himself careless of his rank and safety displayed in the prosecution of the siege the ardor of a youthful soldier After an obstinate combat the Barbarians were repulsed they incessantly returned to the charge they were again driven back with a dreadful slaughter and two rebel legions of Gauls who had been banished into the East signalized their undisciplined courage by a nocturnal sally into the heart of the Persian camp In one of the fiercest of these repeated assaults Amida was betrayed by the treachery of a deserter who indicated to the Barbarians a secret and neglected staircase scooped out of the rock that hangs over the stream of the Tigris Seventy chosen archers of the royal guard ascended in silence to the third story of a lofty tower which commanded the precipice they elevated on high the Persian banner the signal of confidence to the assailants and of dismay to the besieged and if this devoted band could have maintained their post a few minutes longer the reduction of the place might have been purchased by the sacrifice of their lives After Sapor had tried without success the efficacy of force and of stratagem he had recourse to the slower but more certain operations of a regular siege in the conduct of which he was instructed by the skill of the Roman deserters The trenches were opened at a convenient distance and the troops destined for that service advanced under the portable cover of strong hurdles to fill up the ditch and undermine the foundations of the walls Wooden towers were at the same time constructed and moved forwards on wheels till the soldiers who were provided with every species of missile weapons could engage almost on level ground with the troops who defended the rampart Every mode of resistance which art could suggest or courage could execute was employed in the defence of Amida and the works of Sapor were more than once destroyed by the fire of the Romans But the resources of a besieged city may be exhausted The Persians repaired their losses and pushed their approaches a large preach was made by the battering ram and the strength of the garrison wasted by the sword and by disease yielded to the fury of the assault The soldiers the citizens their wives their children all who had not time to escape through the opposite gate were involved by the conquerors in

passage of the emperor Julian in support of his opinion They are the Ossetae now inhabiting part of Caucasus Tableaux Hist de l Asie p one hundred seventy nine one hundred eighty M The Vertae are still unknown It is possible that the Chionites are the same as the Huns These people were already known and we find from Armenian authors that they were making at this period incursions into Asia They were often at war with the Persians The name was perhaps pronounced differently in the East and in the West and this prevents us from recognizing it saint Martin ii one hundred seventy seven M But the ruin of Amida was the safety of the Roman provinces As soon as the first transports of victory had subsided Sapor was at leisure to reflect that to chastise a disobedient city he had lost the flower of his troops and the most favorable season for conquest fifty nine Thirty thousand of his veterans had fallen under the walls of Amida during the continuance of a siege which lasted seventy three days and the disappointed monarch returned to his capital with affected triumph and secret mortification It is more than probable that the inconstancy of his Barbarian allies was tempted to relinquish a war in which they had encountered such unexpected difficulties and that the aged king of the Chionites satiated with revenge turned away with horror from a scene of action where he had been deprived of the hope of his family and nation The strength as well as the spirit of the army with which Sapor took the field in the ensuing spring was no longer equal to the unbounded views of his ambition Instead of aspiring to the conquest of the East he was obliged to content himself with the reduction of two fortified cities of Mesopotamia Singara and Bezabde sixty the one situate in the midst of a sandy desert the other in a small peninsula surrounded almost on every side by the deep and rapid stream of the Tigris Five Roman legions of the diminutive size to which they had been reduced in the age of Constantine were made prisoners and sent into remote captivity on the extreme confines of Persia After dismantling the walls of Singara the conqueror abandoned that solitary and sequestered place but he carefully restored the fortifications of Bezabde and fixed in that important post a garrison or colony of veterans amply supplied with every means of defence and animated by high sentiments of honor and fidelity Towards the close of the campaign the arms of Sapor incurred some disgrace by an unsuccessful enterprise against Virtha or Tecrit a strong or as it was universally esteemed till the age of Tamerlane an impregnable fortress of the independent Arabs sixty one sixty onea Footnote fifty nine Ammianus has marked the chronology of this year by three signs which do not perfectly coincide with each other or with the series of the history one The corn was ripe when Sapor invaded Mesopotamia Cum jam stipula flaveate turgerent a circumstance which in the latitude of Aleppo would naturally refer us to the month of April or May See Harmer s Observations on Scripture vol i p forty one Shaw s Travels p three hundred thirty five edit fourto two The progress of Sapor was checked by the overflowing of the Euphrates which generally happens in July and August Plin Hist Nat v twenty one Viaggi di Pietro della Valle tom i p six hundred ninety six three When Sapor had taken Amida after a siege of seventy three days the autumn was far advanced Autumno praecipiti haedorumque improbo sidere exorto To reconcile these apparent contradictions we must allow for some delay in the Persian king some inaccuracy in the historian and some disorder in the seasons Footnote sixty The account of these sieges is given by Ammianus xx six seven The Christian bishop of Bezabde went to the camp of the king of Persia to persuade him to check the waste of human blood Amm Mare xx seven M Footnote sixty one For the identity of Virtha and Tecrit see D Anville Geographie For the siege of that castle by Timur Bec or Tamerlane see Cherefeddin l iii c thirty three The Persian biographer exaggerates the merit and difficulty of this exploit which delivered the caravans of Bagdad from a formidable gang of robbers Footnote sixty onea saint Martin doubts whether it lay so much to the south The word Girtha means in Syriac a castle or fortress and might be applied to many places The defence of the East against the arms of Sapor required and would have exercised the abilities of the most consummate general and it seemed fortunate for the state that it was the actual province of the brave Ursicinus who alone deserved the confidence of the soldiers and people In the hour of danger sixty two Ursicinus was removed from his station by the intrigues of the eunuchs and the military command of the East was bestowed by the same influence on Sabinian a wealthy and subtle veteran who had attained the infirmities without acquiring the experience of age By a second order which issued from the same jealous and inconstant councils Ursicinus was again despatched to the frontier of Mesopotamia and condemned to sustain the labors of a war the honors of which had been transferred to his unworthy rival Sabinian fixed his indolent station under the walls of Edessa and while he amused himself with the idle parade of military exercise and moved to the sound of flutes in the Pyrrhic dance the public defence was abandoned to the boldness and diligence of the former general of the East But whenever Ursicinus recommended any vigorous plan of operations when he proposed at the head of a light and active army to wheel round the foot of the mountains to intercept the convoys of the enemy to harass the wide extent of the Persian lines and to relieve the distress of Amida the timid and envious commander alleged that he was restrained by his positive orders from endangering the safety of the troops Amida was at length taken its bravest defenders who had escaped the sword of the Barbarians died in the Roman camp by the hand of the executioner and Ursicinus himself after supporting the disgrace of a partial inquiry was punished for the misconduct of Sabinian by the loss of his military rank But Constantius soon experienced the truth of the prediction which honest indignation had extorted from his injured lieutenant that as long as such maxims of government were suffered to prevail the emperor himself would find it is no easy task to defend his eastern dominions from the invasion of a foreign enemy When he had subdued or pacified the Barbarians of the Danube Constantius proceeded by slow marches into the East and after he had wept over the smoking ruins of Amida he formed with a powerful army the siege of Becabde The walls were shaken by the reiterated efforts of the most enormous of the battering rams the town was reduced to the last extremity but it was still defended by the patient and intrepid valor of the garrison till the approach of the rainy season obliged the emperor to raise the siege and ingloviously to retreat into his winter quarters at Antioch sixty three The pride of Constantius and the ingenuity of his courtiers were at a loss to discover any materials for panegyric in the events of the Persian war while the glory of his cousin Julian to whose military command he had intrusted the provinces of Gaul was proclaimed to the world in the simple and concise narrative of his exploits Footnote sixty two Ammianus xviii five six xix three xx two represents the merit and disgrace of Ursicinus with that faithful attention which a soldier owed to his general Some partiality may be suspected yet the whole account is consistent and probable Footnote sixty three Ammian xx eleven Omisso vano incepto hiematurus Antiochiae redit in Syriam aerumnosam perpessus et ulcerum sed et atrocia diuque deflenda It is thus that James Gronovius has restored an obscure passage and he thinks that this correction alone would have deserved a new edition of his author whose sense may now be darkly perceived I expected some additional light from the recent labors of the learned Ernestus Lipsiae seventeen seventy three Note The late editor Wagner has nothing better to suggest and le menta with Gibbon the silence of Ernesti M In the blind fury of civil discord Constantius had abandoned to the Barbarians of Germany the countries of Gaul which still acknowledged the authority of his rival A numerous swarm of Franks and Alemanni were invited to cross the Rhine by presents and promises by the hopes of spoil and by a perpetual grant of all the territories which they should be able to subdue sixty four But the emperor who for a temporary service had thus imprudently provoked the rapacious spirit of the Barbarians soon discovered and lamented the difficulty of dismissing these formidable allies after they had tasted the richness of the Roman soil Regardless of the nice distinction of loyalty and rebellion these undisciplined robbers treated as their natural enemies all the subjects of the empire who possessed any property which they were desirous of acquiring Forty five flourishing cities Tongres Cologne Treves Worms Spires Strasburgh c besides a far greater number of towns and villages were pillaged and for the most part reduced to ashes The Barbarians of Germany still faithful to the maxims of their ancestors abhorred the confinement of walls to which they applied the odious names of prisons and sepulchres and fixing their independent habitations on the banks of rivers the Rhine the Moselle and the Meuse they secured themselves against the danger of a surprise by a rude and hasty fortification of large trees which were felled and thrown across the roads The Alemanni were established in the modern countries of Alsace and Lorraine the Franks occupied the island of the Batavians together with an extensive district of Brabant which was then known by the appellation of Toxandria sixty five and may deserve to be considered as the original seat of their Gallic monarchy sixty six From the sources to the mouth of the Rhine the conquests of the Germans extended above forty miles to the west of that river over a country peopled by colonies of their own name and nation and the scene of their devastations was three times more extensive than that of their conquests At a still greater distance the open towns of Gaul were deserted and the inhabitants of the fortified cities who trusted to their strength and vigilance were obliged to content themselves with such supplies of corn as they could raise on the vacant land within the enclosure of their walls The diminished legions destitute of pay and provisions of arms and discipline trembled at the approach and even at the name of the Barbarians Footnote sixty four The ravages of the Germans and the distress of Gaul may be collected from Julian himself Orat ad S P Q Athen p two hundred seventy seven Ammian xv ll Libanius Orat x Zosimus l iii p one hundred forty Sozomen l iii c l Mamertin Grat Art c iv Footnote sixty five Ammianus xvi eight This name seems to be derived from the Toxandri of Pliny and very frequently occurs in the histories of the middle age Toxandria was a country of woods and morasses which extended from the neighborhood of Tongres to the conflux of the Vahal and the Rhine See Valesius Notit Galliar p five hundred fifty eight Footnote sixty six The paradox of P Daniel that the Franks never obtained any permanent settlement on this side of the Rhine before the time of Clovis is refuted with much learning and good sense by M Biet who has proved by a chain of evidence their uninterrupted possession of Toxandria one hundred and thirty years before the accession of Clovis The Dissertation of M Biet was crowned by the Academy of Soissons in the year seventeen thirty six and seems to have been justly preferred to the discourse of his more celebrated competitor the Abbe le Boeuf an antiquarian whose name was happily expressive of his talents Chapter XIX Constantius Sole Emperor Part IV Under these melancholy circumstances an unexperienced youth was appointed to save and to govern the provinces of Gaul or rather as he expressed it himself to exhibit the vain image of Imperial greatness The retired scholastic education of Julian in which he had been more conversant with books than with arms with the dead than with the living left him in profound ignorance of the practical arts of war and government and when he awkwardly repeated some military exercise which it was necessary for him to learn he exclaimed with a sigh O Plato Plato what a task for a philosopher Yet even this speculative philosophy which men of business are too apt to despise had filled the mind of Julian with the noblest precepts and the most shining examples had animated him with the love of virtue the desire of fame and the contempt of death The habits of temperance recommended in the schools are still more essential in the severe discipline of a camp The simple wants of nature regulated the measure of his food and sleep Rejecting with disdain the delicacies provided for his table he satisfied his appetite with the coarse and common fare which was allotted to the meanest soldiers During the rigor of a Gallic winter he never suffered a fire in his bed chamber and after a short and interrupted slumber he frequently rose in the middle of the night from a carpet spread on the floor to despatch any urgent business to visit his rounds or to steal a few moments for the prosecution of his favorite studies sixty seven The precepts of eloquence which he had hitherto practised on fancied topics of declamation were more usefully applied to excite or to assuage the passions of an armed multitude and although Julian from his early habits of conversation and literature was more familiarly acquainted with the beauties of the Greek language he had attained a competent knowledge of the Latin tongue sixty eight Since Julian was not originally designed for the character of a legislator or a judge it is probable that the civil jurisprudence of the Romans had not engaged any considerable share of his attention but he derived from his philosophic studies an inflexible regard for justice tempered by a disposition to clemency the knowledge of the general principles of equity and evidence and the faculty of patiently investigating the most intricate and tedious questions which could be proposed for his discussion The measures of policy and the operations of war must submit to the various accidents of circumstance and character and the unpractised student will often be perplexed in the application of the most perfect theory But in the acquisition of this important science Julian was assisted by the active vigor of his own genius as well as by the wisdom and experience of Sallust and officer of rank who soon conceived a sincere attachment for a prince so worthy of his friendship and whose incorruptible integrity was adorned by the talent of insinuating the harshest truths without wounding the delicacy of a royal ear sixty nine Footnote sixty seven The private life of Julian in Gaul and the severe discipline which he embraced are displayed by Ammianus xvi five who professes to praise and by Julian himself who affects to ridicule Misopogon p three hundred forty a conduct which in a prince of the house of Constantine might justly excite the surprise of mankind Footnote sixty eight Aderat Latine quoque disserenti sufficiens sermo Ammianus xvi five But Julian educated in the schools of Greece always considered the language of the Romans as a foreign and popular dialect which he might use on necessary occasions Footnote sixty nine We are ignorant of the actual office of this excellent minister whom Julian afterwards created praefect of Gaul Sallust was speedly recalled by the jealousy of the emperor and we may still read a sensible but pedantic discourse p two hundred forty two hundred fifty two in which Julian deplores the loss of so valuable a friend to whom he acknowledges himself indebted for his reputation See La Bleterie Preface a la Vie de lovien p twenty Immediately after Julian had received the purple at Milan he was sent into Gaul with a feeble retinue of three hundred and sixty soldiers At Vienna where he passed a painful and anxious winter in the hands of those ministers to whom Constantius had intrusted the direction of his conduct the Caesar was informed of the siege and deliverance of Autun That large and ancient city protected only by a ruined wall and pusillanimous garrison was saved by the generous resolution of a few veterans who resumed their arms for the defence of their country In his march from Autun through the heart of the Gallic provinces Julian embraced with ardor the earliest opportunity of signalizing his courage At the head of a small body of archers and heavy cavalry he preferred the shorter but the more dangerous of two roads sixty ninea and sometimes eluding and sometimes resisting the attacks of the Barbarians who were masters of the field he arrived with honor and safety at the camp near Rheims where the Roman troops had been ordered to assemble The aspect of their young prince revived the drooping spirits of the soldiers and they marched from Rheims in search of the enemy with a confidence which had almost proved fatal to them The Alemanni familiarized to the knowledge of the country secretly collected their scattered forces and seizing the opportunity of a dark and rainy day poured with unexpected fury on the rear guard of the Romans Before the inevitable disorder could be remedied two legions were destroyed and Julian was taught by experience that caution and vigilance are the most important lessons of the art of war In a second and more successful action he recovered and established his military fame but as the agility of the Barbarians saved them from the pursuit his victory was neither bloody nor decisive He advanced however to the banks of the Rhine surveyed the ruins of Cologne convinced himself of the difficulties of the war and retreated on the approach of winter discontented with the court with his army and with his own success seventy The power of the enemy was yet unbroken and the Caesar had no sooner separated his troops and fixed his own quarters at Sens in the centre of Gaul than he was surrounded and besieged by a numerous host of Germans Reduced in this extremity to the resources of his own mind he displayed a prudent intrepidity which compensated for all the deficiencies of the place and garrison and the Barbarians at the end of thirty days were obliged to retire with disappointed rage Footnote sixty ninea Aliis per Arbor quibusdam per Sedelaucum et Coram in debere firrantibus Amm Marc xvi two I do not know what place can be meant by the mutilated name Arbor

one hundred sixty two M Note At Brocomages Brumat near Strasburgh saint Martin ii one hundred eighty four M Footnote seventy Ammianus xvi two three appears much better satisfied with the success of his first campaign than Julian himself who very fairly owns that he did nothing of consequence and that he fled before the enemy The conscious pride of Julian who was indebted only to his sword for this signal deliverance was imbittered by the reflection that he was abandoned betrayed and perhaps devoted to destruction by those who were bound to assist him by every tie of honor and fidelity Marcellus master general of the cavalry in Gaul interpreting too strictly the jealous orders of the court beheld with supine indifference the distress of Julian and had restrained the troops under his command from marching to the relief of Sens If the Caesar had dissembled in silence so dangerous an insult his person and authority would have been exposed to the contempt of the world and if an action so criminal had been suffered to pass with impunity the emperor would have confirmed the suspicions which received a very specious color from his past conduct towards the princes of the Flavian family Marcellus was recalled and gently dismissed from his office seventy one In his room Severus was appointed general of the cavalry an experienced soldier of approved courage and fidelity who could advise with respect and execute with zeal and who submitted without reluctance to the supreme command which Julian by the inrerest of his patroness Eusebia at length obtained over the armies of Gaul seventy two A very judicious plan of operations was adopted for the approaching campaign Julian himself at the head of the remains of the veteran bands and of some new levies which he had been permitted to form boldly penetrated into the centre of the German cantonments and carefully reestablished the fortifications of Saverne in an advantageous post which would either check the incursions or intercept the retreat of the enemy At the same time Barbatio general of the infantry advanced from Milan with an army of thirty thousand men and passing the mountains prepared to throw a bridge over the Rhine in the neighborhood of Basil It was reasonable to expect that the Alemanni pressed on either side by the Roman arms would soon be forced to evacuate the provinces of Gaul and to hasten to the defence of their native country But the hopes of the campaign were defeated by the incapacity or the envy or the secret instructions of Barbatio who acted as if he had been the enemy of the Caesar and the secret ally of the Barbarians The negligence with which he permitted a troop of pillagers freely to pass and to return almost before the gates of his camp may be imputed to his want of abilities but the treasonable act of burning a number of boats and a superfluous stock of provisions which would have been of the most essential service to the army of Gaul was an evidence of his hostile and criminal intentions The Germans despised an enemy who appeared destitute either of power or of inclination to offend them and the ignominious retreat of Barbatio deprived Julian of the expected support and left him to extricate himself from a hazardous situation where he could neither remain with safety nor retire with honor seventy three Footnote seventy one Ammian xvi seven Libanius speaks rather more advantageously of the military talents of Marcellus Orat x p two hundred seventy two And Julian insinuates that he would not have been so easily recalled unless he had given other reasons of offence to the court p two hundred seventy eight Footnote seventy two Severus non discors non arrogans sed longa militiae frugalitate compertus et eum recta praeeuntem secuturus

and Libanius Orat x p two hundred seventy three Note Barbatio seems to have allowed himself to be surprised and defeated M As soon as they were delivered from the fears of invasion the Alemanni prepared to chastise the Roman youth who presumed to dispute the possession of that country which they claimed as their own by the right of conquest and of treaties They employed three days and as many nights in transporting over the Rhine their military powers The fierce Chnodomar shaking the ponderous javelin which he had victoriously wielded against the brother of Magnentius led the van of the Barbarians and moderated by his experience the martial ardor which his example inspired seventy four He was followed by six other kings by ten princes of regal extraction by a long train of high spirited nobles and by thirty five thousand of the bravest warriors of the tribes of Germany The confidence derived from the view of their own strength was increased by the intelligence which they received from a deserter that the Caesar with a feeble army of thirteen thousand men occupied a post about one and twenty miles from their camp of Strasburgh With this inadequate force Julian resolved to seek and to encounter the Barbarian host and the chance of a general action was preferred to the tedious and uncertain operation of separately engaging the dispersed parties of the Alemanni The Romans marched in close order and in two columns the cavalry on the right the infantry on the left and the day was so far spent when they appeared in sight of the enemy that Julian was desirous of deferring the battle till the next morning and of allowing his troops to recruit their exhausted strength by the necessary refreshments of sleep and food Yielding however with some reluctance to the clamors of the soldiers and even to the opinion of his council he exhorted them to justify by their valor the eager impatience which in case of a defeat would be universally branded with the epithets of rashness and presumption The trumpets sounded the military shout was heard through the field and the two armies rushed with equal fury to the charge The Caesar who conducted in person his right wing depended on the dexterity of his archers and the weight of his cuirassiers But his ranks were instantly broken by an irregular mixture of light horse and of light infantry and he had the mortification of beholding the flight of six hundred of his most renowned cuirassiers seventy five The fugitives were stopped and rallied by the presence and authority of Julian who careless of his own safety threw himself before them and urging every motive of shame and honor led them back against the victorious enemy The conflict between the two lines of infantry was obstinate and bloody The Germans possessed the superiority of strength and stature the Romans that of discipline and temper and as the Barbarians who served under the standard of the empire united the respective advantages of both parties their strenuous efforts guided by a skilful leader at length determined the event of the day The Romans lost four tribunes and two hundred and forty three soldiers in this memorable battle of Strasburgh so glorious to the Caesar seventy six and so salutary to the afflicted provinces of Gaul Six thousand of the Alemanni were slain in the field without including those who were drowned in the Rhine or transfixed with darts while they attempted to swim across the river seventy seven Chnodomar himself was surrounded and taken prisoner with three of his brave companions who had devoted themselves to follow in life or death the fate of their chieftain Julian received him with military pomp in the council of his officers and expressing a generous pity for the fallen state dissembled his inward contempt for the abject humiliation of his captive Instead of exhibiting the vanquished king of the Alemanni as a grateful spectacle to the cities of Gaul he respectfully laid at the feet of the emperor this splendid trophy of his victory Chnodomar experienced an honorable treatment but the impatient Barbarian could not long survive his defeat his confinement and his exile seventy eight Footnote seventy four Ammianus xvi twelve describes with his inflated eloquence the figure and character of Chnodomar Audax et fidens ingenti robore lacertorum ubi ardor proelii sperabatur immanis equo spumante sublimior erectus in jaculum formidandae vastitatis armorumque nitore conspicuus antea strenuus et miles et utilis praeter caeteros ductor Decentium Caesarem superavit aequo marte congressus Footnote seventy five After the battle Julian ventured to revive the rigor of ancient discipline by exposing these fugitives in female apparel to the derision of the whole camp In the next campaign these troops nobly retrieved their honor Zosimus l iii p one hundred forty two Footnote seventy six Julian himself ad S P Q Athen p two hundred seventy nine speaks of the battle of Strasburgh with the modesty of conscious merit Zosimus compares it with the victory of Alexander over Darius and yet we are at a loss to discover any of those strokes of military genius which fix the attention of ages on the conduct and success of a single day Footnote seventy seven Ammianus xvi twelve Libanius adds two thousand more to the number of the slain Orat x p two hundred seventy four But these trifling differences disappear before the sixty thousand Barbarians whom Zosimus has sacrificed to the glory of his hero l iii p one hundred forty one We might attribute this extravagant number to the carelessness of transcribers if this credulous or partial historian had not swelled the army of thirty five thousand Alemanni to an innumerable multitude of Barbarians It is our own fault if this detection does not inspire us with proper distrust on similar occasions Footnote seventy eight Ammian xvi twelve Libanius Orat x p two hundred seventy six After Julian had repulsed the Alemanni from the provinces of the Upper Rhine he turned his arms against the Franks who were seated nearer to the ocean on the confines of Gaul and Germany and who from their numbers and still more from their intrepid valor had ever been esteemed the most formidable of the Barbarians seventy nine Although they were strongly actuated by the allurements of rapine they professed a disinterested love of war which they considered as the supreme honor and felicity of human nature and their minds and bodies were so completely hardened by perpetual action that according to the lively expression of an orator the snows of winter were as pleasant to them as the flowers of spring In the month of December which followed the battle of Strasburgh Julian attacked a body of six hundred Franks who had thrown themselves into two castles on the Meuse eighty In the midst of that severe season they sustained with inflexible constancy a siege of fifty four days till at length exhausted by hunger and satisfied that the vigilance of the enemy in breaking the ice of the river left them no hopes of escape the Franks consented for the first time to dispense with the ancient law which commanded them to conquer or to die The Caesar immediately sent his captives to the court of Constantius who accepting them as a valuable present eighty one rejoiced in the opportunity of adding so many heroes to the choicest troops of his domestic guards The obstinate resistance of this handful of Franks apprised Julian of the difficulties of the expedition which he meditated for the ensuing spring against the whole body of the nation His rapid diligence surprised and astonished the active Barbarians Ordering his soldiers to provide themselves with biscuit for twenty days he suddenly pitched his camp near Tongres while the enemy still supposed him in his winter quarters of Paris expecting the slow arrival of his convoys from Aquitain Without allowing the Franks to unite or deliberate he skilfully spread his legions from Cologne to the ocean and by the terror as well as by the success of his arms soon reduced the suppliant tribes to implore the clemency and to obey the commands of their conqueror The Chamavians submissively retired to their former habitations beyond the Rhine but the Salians were permitted to possess their new establishment of Toxandria as the subjects and auxiliaries of the Roman empire eighty two The treaty was ratified by solemn oaths and perpetual inspectors were appointed to reside among the Franks with the authority of enforcing the strict observance of the conditions An incident is related interesting enough in itself and by no means repugnant to the character of Julian who ingeniously contrived both the plot and the catastrophe of the tragedy When the Chamavians sued for peace he required the son of their king as the only hostage on whom he could rely A mournful silence interrupted by tears and groans declared the sad perplexity of the Barbarians and their aged chief lamented in pathetic language that his private loss was now imbittered by a sense of public calamity While the Chamavians lay prostrate at the foot of his throne the royal captive whom they believed to have been slain unexpectedly appeared before their eyes and as soon as the tumult of joy was hushed into attention the Caesar addressed the assembly in the following terms Behold the son the prince whom you wept You had lost him by your fault God and the Romans have restored him to you I shall still preserve and educate the youth rather as a monument of my own virtue than as a pledge of your sincerity Should you presume to violate the faith which you have sworn the arms of the republic will avenge the perfidy not on the innocent but on the guilty The Barbarians withdrew from his presence impressed with the warmest sentiments of gratitude and admiration eighty three Footnote seventy nine Libanius Orat iii p one hundred thirty seven draws a very lively picture of the manners of the Franks Footnote eighty Ammianus xvii two Libanius Orat x p two hundred seventy eight The Greek orator by misapprehending a passage of Julian has been induced to represent the Franks as consisting of a thousand men and as his head was always full of the Peloponnesian war he compares them to the Lacedaemonians who were besieged and taken in the Island of Sphatoria Footnote eighty one Julian ad S P Q Athen p two hundred eighty Libanius Orat x p two hundred seventy eight According to the expression of Libanius the emperor which La Bleterie understands Vie de Julien p one hundred eighteen as an honest confession and Valesius ad Ammian xvii two as a mean evasion of the truth Dom Bouquet Historiens de France tom i p seven hundred thirty three by substituting another word would suppress both the difficulty and the spirit of this passage Footnote eighty two Ammian xvii eight Zosimus l iii p one hundred forty six one hundred fifty his narrative is darkened by a mixture of fable and Julian ad S P Q Athen p two hundred eighty His expression This difference of treatment confirms the opinion that the Salian Franks were permitted to retain the settlements in Toxandria Note A newly discovered fragment of Eunapius whom Zosimus probably transcribed illustrates this transaction Julian commanded the Romans to abstain from all hostile measures against the Salians neither to waste or ravage their own country for he called every country their own which was surrendered without resistance or toil on the part of the conquerors Mai Script Vez Nov Collect ii two hundred fifty six and Eunapius in Niebuhr Byzant Hist Footnote eighty three This interesting story which Zosimus has abridged is related by Eunapius in Excerpt Legationum p fifteen sixteen seventeen with all the amplifications of Grecian rhetoric but the silence of Libanius of Ammianus and of Julian himself renders the truth of it extremely suspicious It was not enough for Julian to have delivered the provinces of Gaul from the Barbarians of Germany He aspired to emulate the glory of the first and most illustrious of the emperors after whose example he composed his own commentaries of the Gallic war eighty four Caesar has related with conscious pride the manner in which he twice passed the Rhine Julian could boast that before he assumed the title of Augustus he had carried the Roman eagles beyond that great river in three successful expeditions eighty five The consternation of the Germans after the battle of Strasburgh encouraged him to the first attempt and the reluctance of the troops soon yielded to the persuasive eloquence of a leader who shared the fatigues and dangers which he imposed on the meanest of the soldiers The villages on either side of the Meyn which were plentifully stored with corn and cattle felt the ravages of an invading army The principal houses constructed with some imitation of Roman elegance were consumed by the flames and the Caesar boldly advanced about ten miles till his progress was stopped by a dark and impenetrable forest undermined by subterraneous passages which threatened with secret snares and ambush every step of the assailants The ground was already covered with snow and Julian after repairing an ancient castle which had been erected by Trajan granted a truce of ten months to the submissive Barbarians At the expiration of the truce Julian undertook a second expedition beyond the Rhine to humble the pride of Surmar and Hortaire two of the kings of the Alemanni who had been present at the battle of Strasburgh They promised to restore all the Roman captives who yet remained alive and as the Caesar had procured an exact account from the cities and villages of Gaul of the inhabitants whom they had lost he detected every attempt to deceive him with a degree of readiness and accuracy which almost established the belief of his supernatural knowledge His third expedition was still more splendid and important than the two former The Germans had collected their military powers and moved along the opposite banks of the river with a design of destroying the bridge and of preventing the passage of the Romans But this judicious plan of defence was disconcerted by a skilful diversion Three hundred light armed and active soldiers were detached in forty small boats to fall down the stream in silence and to land at some distance from the posts of the enemy They executed their orders with so much boldness and celerity that they had almost surprised the Barbarian chiefs who returned in the fearless confidence of intoxication from one of their nocturnal festivals Without repeating the uniform and disgusting tale of slaughter and devastation it is sufficient to observe that Julian dictated his own conditions of peace to six of the haughtiest kings of the Alemanni three of whom were permitted to view the severe discipline and martial pomp of a Roman camp Followed by twenty thousand captives whom he had rescued from the chains of the Barbarians the Caesar repassed the Rhine after terminating a war the success of which has been compared to the ancient glories of the Punic and Cimbric victories Footnote eighty four Libanius the friend of Julian clearly insinuates Orat ix p one hundred seventy eight that his hero had composed the history of his Gallic campaigns But Zosimus l iii p one hundred forty seems to have derived his information only from the Orations and the Epistles of Julian The discourse which is addressed to the Athenians contains an accurate though general account of the war against the Germans Footnote eighty five See Ammian xvii one ten xviii two and Zosim l iii p one hundred forty four Julian ad S P Q Athen p two hundred eighty As soon as the valor and conduct of Julian had secured an interval of peace he applied himself to a work more congenial to his humane and philosophic temper The cities of Gaul which had suffered from the inroads of the Barbarians he diligently repaired and seven important posts between Mentz and the mouth of the Rhine are particularly mentioned as having been rebuilt and fortified by the order of Julian eighty six The vanquished Germans had submitted to the just but humiliating condition of preparing and conveying the necessary materials The active zeal of Julian urged the prosecution of the work and such was the spirit which he had diffused among the troops that the auxiliaries themselves waiving their exemption from any duties of fatigue contended in the most servile labors with the diligence of the Roman soldiers It was incumbent on the Caesar to provide for the subsistence as well as for the safety of the inhabitants and of the garrisons The desertion of the former and the mutiny of the latter must have been the fatal and inevitable consequences of famine The tillage of the provinces of Gaul had been interrupted by the calamities of war but the scanty harvests of the continent were supplied by his paternal care from the plenty of the adjacent island Six hundred large barks framed in the forest of the Ardennes made several voyages to the coast of Britain and returning from thence laden with corn sailed up the Rhine and distributed their cargoes to the several towns and fortresses along the banks of the river eighty seven The arms of Julian had restored a free and secure navigation which Constantinius had offered to purchase at the expense of his dignity and of a tributary present of two thousand pounds of silver The emperor parsimoniously refused to his soldiers the sums which he granted with a lavish and trembling hand to the Barbarians The dexterity as well as the firmness of Julian was put to a severe trial when he took the field with a discontented army which had already served two campaigns without receiving any regular pay or any extraordinary donative eighty eight Footnote eighty six Ammian xviii two Libanius Orat x p two hundred seventy nine two hundred

into a mutiny immediately before the second passage of the Rhine Ammian xvii nine A tender regard for the peace and happiness of his subjects was the ruling principle which directed or seemed to direct the administration of Julian eighty nine He devoted the leisure of his winter quarters to the offices of civil government and affected to assume with more pleasure the character of a magistrate than that of a general Before he took the field he devolved on the provincial governors most of the public and private causes which had been referred to his tribunal but on his return he carefully revised their proceedings mitigated the rigor of the law and pronounced a second judgment on the judges themselves Superior to the last temptation of virtuous minds an indiscreet and intemperate zeal for justice he restrained with calmness and dignity the warmth of an advocate who prosecuted for extortion the president of the Narbonnese province Who will ever be found guilty exclaimed the vehement Delphidius if it be enough to deny And who replied Julian will ever be innocent if it be sufficient to affirm In the general administration of peace and war the interest of the sovereign is commonly the same as that of his people but Constantius would have thought himself deeply injured if the virtues of Julian had defrauded him of any part of the tribute which he extorted from an oppressed and exhausted country The prince who was invested with the ensigns of royalty might sometimes presume to correct the rapacious insolence of his inferior agents to expose their corrupt arts and to introduce an equal and easier mode of collection But the management of the finances was more safely intrusted to Florentius praetorian praefect of Gaul an effeminate tyrant incapable of pity or remorse and the haughty minister complained of the most decent and gentle opposition while Julian himself was rather inclined to censure the weakness of his own behavior The Caesar had rejected with abhorrence a mandate for the levy of an extraordinary tax a new superindiction which the praefect had offered for his signature and the faithful picture of the public misery by which he had been obliged to justify his refusal offended the court of Constantius We may enjoy the pleasure of reading the sentiments of Julian as he expresses them with warmth and freedom in a letter to one of his most intimate friends After stating his own conduct he proceeds in the following terms Was it possible for the disciple of Plato and Aristotle to act otherwise than I have done Could I abandon the unhappy subjects intrusted to my care Was I not called upon to defend them from the repeated injuries of these unfeeling robbers A tribune who deserts his post is punished with death and deprived of the honors of burial With what justice could I pronounce his sentence if in the hour of danger I myself neglected a duty far more sacred and far more important God has placed me in this elevated post his providence will guard and support me Should I be condemned to suffer I shall derive comfort from the testimony of a pure and upright conscience Would to Heaven that I still possessed a counsellor like Sallust If they think proper to send me a successor I shall submit without reluctance and had much rather improve the short opportunity of doing good than enjoy a long and lasting impunity of evil ninety The precarious and dependent situation of Julian displayed his virtues and concealed his defects The young hero who supported in Gaul the throne of Constantius was not permitted to reform the vices of the government but he had courage to alleviate or to pity the distress of the people Unless he had been able to revive the martial spirit of the Romans or to introduce the arts of industry and refinement among their savage enemies he could not entertain any rational hopes of securing the public tranquillity either by the peace or conquest of Germany Yet the victories of Julian suspended for a short time the inroads of the Barbarians and delayed the ruin of the Western Empire Footnote eighty nine Ammian xvi five xviii one Mamertinus in Panegyr Vet xi four Footnote ninety Ammian xvii three Julian Epistol xv edit Spanheim Such a conduct almost justifies the encomium of Mamertinus Ita illi anni spatia divisa sunt ut aut Barbaros domitet aut civibus jura restituat perpetuum professus aut contra hostem aut contra vitia certamen His salutary influence restored the cities of Gaul which had been so long exposed to the evils of civil discord Barbarian war and domestic tyranny and the spirit of industry was revived with the hopes of enjoyment Agriculture manufactures and commerce again flourished under the protection of the laws and the curioe or civil corporations were again filled with useful and respectable members the youth were no longer apprehensive of marriage and married persons were no longer apprehensive of posterity the public and private festivals were celebrated with customary pomp and the frequent and secure intercourse of the provinces displayed the image of national prosperity ninety one A mind like that of Julian must have felt the general happiness of which he was the author but he viewed with particular satisfaction and complacency the city of Paris the seat of his winter residence and the object even of his partial affection ninety two That splendid capital which now embraces an ample territory on either side of the Seine was originally confined to the small island in the midst of the river from whence the inhabitants derived a supply of pure and salubrious water The river bathed the foot of the walls and the town was accessible only by two wooden bridges A forest overspread the northern side of the Seine but on the south the ground which now bears the name of the University was insensibly covered with houses and adorned with a palace and amphitheatre baths an aqueduct and a field of Mars for the exercise of the Roman troops The severity of the climate was tempered by the neighborhood of the ocean and with some precautions which experience had taught the vine and fig tree were successfully cultivated But in remarkable winters the Seine was deeply frozen and the huge pieces of ice that floated down the stream might be compared by an Asiatic to the blocks of white marble which were extracted from the quarries of Phrygia The licentiousness and corruption of Antioch recalled to the memory of Julian the severe and simple manners of his beloved Lutetia ninety three where the amusements of the theatre were unknown or despised He indignantly contrasted the effeminate Syrians with the brave and honest simplicity of the Gauls and almost forgave the intemperance which was the only stain of the Celtic character ninety four If Julian could now revisit the capital of France he might converse with men of science and genius capable of understanding and of instructing a disciple of the Greeks he might excuse the lively and graceful follies of a nation whose martial spirit has never been enervated by the indulgence of luxury and he must applaud the perfection of that inestimable art which softens and refines and embellishes the intercourse of social life Footnote ninety one Libanius Orat Parental in Imp Julian c thirty eight in Fabricius Bibliothec Graec tom vii p

hundred sixty Chapter XX Conversion Of Constantine Part I The Motives Progress And Effects Of The Conversion Of Constantine Legal Establishment And Constitution Of The Christian Or Catholic Church The public establishment of Christianity may be considered as one of those important and domestic revolutions which excite the most lively curiosity and afford the most valuable instruction The victories and the civil policy of Constantine no longer influence the state of Europe but a considerable portion of the globe still retains the impression which it received from the conversion of that monarch and the ecclesiastical institutions of his reign are still connected by an indissoluble chain with the opinions the passions and the interests of the present generation In the consideration of a subject which may be examined with impartiality but cannot be viewed with indifference a difficulty immediately arises of a very unexpected nature that of ascertaining the real and precise date of the conversion of Constantine The eloquent Lactantius in the midst of his court seems impatient one to proclaim to the world the glorious example of the sovereign of Gaul who in the first moments of his reign acknowledged and adored the majesty of the true and only God two The learned Eusebius has ascribed the faith of Constantine to the miraculous sign which was displayed in the heavens whilst he meditated and prepared the Italian expedition three The historian Zosimus maliciously asserts that the emperor had imbrued his hands in the blood of his eldest son before he publicly renounced the gods of Rome and of his ancestors four The perplexity produced by these discordant authorities is derived from the behavior of Constantine himself According to the strictness of ecclesiastical language the first of the Christian emperors was unworthy of that name till the moment of his death since it was only during his last illness that he received as a catechumen the imposition of hands five and was afterwards admitted by the initiatory rites of baptism into the number of the faithful six The Christianity of Constantine must be allowed in a much more vague and qualified sense and the nicest accuracy is required in tracing the slow and almost imperceptible gradations by which the monarch declared himself the protector and at length the proselyte of the church It was an arduous task to eradicate the habits and prejudices of his education to acknowledge the divine power of Christ and to understand that the truth of his revelation was incompatible with the worship of the gods The obstacles which he had probably experienced in his own mind instructed him to proceed with caution in the momentous change of a national religion and he insensibly discovered his new opinions as far as he could enforce them with safety and with effect During the whole course of his reign the stream of Christianity flowed with a gentle though accelerated motion but its general direction was sometimes checked and sometimes diverted by the accidental circumstances of the times and by the prudence or possibly by the caprice of the monarch His ministers were permitted to signify the intentions of their master in the various language which was best adapted to their respective principles seven and he artfully balanced the hopes and fears of his subjects by publishing in the same year two edicts the first of which enjoined the solemn observance of Sunday eight and the second directed the regular consultation of the Aruspices nine While this important revolution yet remained in suspense the Christians and the Pagans watched the conduct of their sovereign with the same anxiety but with very opposite sentiments The former were prompted by every motive of zeal as well as vanity to exaggerate the marks of his favor and the evidences of his faith The latter till their just apprehensions were changed into despair and resentment attempted to conceal from the world and from themselves that the gods of Rome could no longer reckon the emperor in the number of their votaries The same passions and prejudices have engaged the partial writers of the times to connect the public profession of Christianity with the most glorious or the most ignominious aera of the reign of Constantine Footnote one The date of the Divine Institutions of Lactantius has been accurately discussed difficulties have been started solutions proposed and an expedient imagined of two original editions the former published during the persecution of Diocletian the latter under that of Licinius See Dufresnoy Prefat p v Tillemont Mem Ecclesiast tom vi p four hundred sixty five four hundred seventy Lardner s Credibility part ii vol vii p seventy eight eighty six For my own part I am almost

asperity Whatever symptoms of Christian piety might transpire in the discourses or actions of Constantine he persevered till he was near forty years of age in the practice of the established religion ten and the same conduct which in the court of Nicomedia might be imputed to his fear could be ascribed only to the inclination or policy of the sovereign of Gaul His liberality restored and enriched the temples of the gods the medals which issued from his Imperial mint are impressed with the figures and attributes of Jupiter and Apollo of Mars and Hercules and his filial piety increased the council of Olympus by the solemn apotheosis of his father Constantius eleven But the devotion of Constantine was more peculiarly directed to the genius of the Sun the Apollo of Greek and Roman mythology and he was pleased to be represented with the symbols of the God of Light and Poetry The unerring shafts of that deity the brightness of his eyes his laurel wreath immortal beauty and elegant accomplishments seem to point him out as the patron of a young hero The altars of Apollo were crowned with the votive offerings of Constantine and the credulous multitude were taught to believe that the emperor was permitted to behold with mortal eyes the visible majesty of their tutelar deity and that either walking or in a vision he was blessed with the auspicious omens of a long and victorious reign The Sun was universally celebrated as the invincible guide and protector of Constantine and the Pagans might reasonably expect that the insulted god would pursue with unrelenting vengeance the impiety of his ungrateful favorite twelve Footnote ten Theodoret l i c eighteen seems to insinuate that Helena gave her son a Christian education but we may be assured from the superior authority of Eusebius in Vit Constant l iii c forty seven that she herself was indebted to Constantine for the knowledge of Christianity Footnote eleven See the medals of Constantine in Ducange and Banduri As few cities had retained the privilege of coining almost all the medals of that age issued from the mint under the sanction of the Imperial authority Footnote twelve The panegyric of Eumenius vii inter Panegyr Vet which was pronounced a few months before the Italian war abounds with the most unexceptionable evidence of the Pagan superstition of Constantine and of his particular veneration for Apollo or the Sun to which Julian alludes As long as Constantine exercised a limited sovereignty over the provinces of Gaul his Christian subjects were protected by the authority and perhaps by the laws of a prince who wisely left to the gods the care of vindicating their own honor If we may credit the assertion of Constantine himself he had been an indignant spectator of the savage cruelties which were inflicted by the hands of Roman soldiers on those citizens whose religion was their only crime thirteen In the East and in the West he had seen the different effects of severity and indulgence and as the former was rendered still more odious by the example of Galerius his implacable enemy the latter was recommended to his imitation by the authority and advice of a dying father The son of Constantius immediately suspended or repealed the edicts of persecution and granted the free exercise of their religious ceremonies to all those who had already professed themselves members of the church They were soon encouraged to depend on the favor as well as on the justice of their sovereign who had imbibed a secret and sincere reverence for the name of Christ and for the God of the Christians fourteen Footnote thirteen Constantin Orat ad Sanctos c twenty five But it might easily be shown that the Greek translator has improved the sense of the Latin original and the aged emperor might recollect the persecution of Diocletian with a more lively abhorrence than he had actually felt to the days of his youth and Paganism Footnote fourteen See Euseb Hist Eccles l viii thirteen l ix nine and in Vit Const l i c sixteen seventeen Lactant Divin Institut i l Caecilius de Mort Persecut c twenty five About five months after the conquest of Italy the emperor made a solemn and authentic declaration of his sentiments by the celebrated edict of Milan which restored peace to the Catholic church In the personal interview of the two western princes Constantine by the ascendant of genius and power obtained the ready concurrence of his colleague Licinius the union of their names and authority disarmed the fury of Maximin and after the death of the tyrant of the East the edict of Milan was received as a general and fundamental law of the Roman world fifteen Footnote fifteen Caecilius de Mort Persecut c forty eight has preserved the Latin original and Eusebius Hist Eccles l x c five has given a Greek translation of this perpetual edict which refers to some provisional regulations The wisdom of the emperors provided for the restitution of all the civil and religious rights of which the Christians had been so unjustly deprived It was enacted that the places of worship and public lands which had been confiscated should be restored to the church without dispute without delay and without expense and this severe injunction was accompanied with a gracious promise that if any of the purchasers had paid a fair and adequate price they should be indemnified from the Imperial treasury The salutary regulations which guard the future tranquillity of the faithful are framed on the principles of enlarged and equal toleration and such an equality must have been interpreted by a recent sect as an advantageous and honorable distinction The two emperors proclaim to the world that they have granted a free and absolute power to the Christians and to all others of following the religion which each individual thinks proper to prefer to which he has addicted his mind and which he may deem the best adapted to his own use They carefully explain every ambiguous word remove every exception and exact from the governors of the provinces a strict obedience to the true and simple meaning of an edict which was designed to establish and secure without any limitation the claims of religious liberty They condescend to assign two weighty reasons which have induced them to allow this universal toleration the humane intention of consulting the peace and happiness of their people and the pious hope that by such a conduct they shall appease and propitiate the Deity whose seat is in heaven They gratefully acknowledge the many signal proofs which they have received of the divine favor and they trust that the same Providence will forever continue to protect the prosperity of the prince and people From these vague and indefinite expressions of piety three suppositions may be deduced of a different but not of an incompatible nature The mind of Constantine might fluctuate between the Pagan and the Christian religions According to the loose and complying notions of Polytheism he might acknowledge the God of the Christians as one of the many deities who compose the hierarchy of heaven Or perhaps he might embrace the philosophic and pleasing idea that notwithstanding the variety of names of rites and of opinions all the sects and all the nations of mankind are united in the worship of the common Father and Creator of the universe sixteen Footnote sixteen A panegyric of Constantine pronounced seven or eight months after the edict of Milan see Gothofred Chronolog Legum p seven and Tillemont Hist des Empereurs tom iv p two hundred forty six uses the following remarkable expression Summe rerum sator cujus tot nomina sant quot linguas gentium esse voluisti quem enim te ipse dici velin scire non possumus Panegyr Vet ix twenty six In explaining Constantine s progress in the faith Mosheim p nine hundred seventy one c is ingenious subtle prolix But the counsels of princes are more frequently influenced by views of temporal advantage than by considerations of abstract and speculative truth The partial and increasing favor of Constantine may naturally be referred to the esteem which he entertained for the moral character of the Christians and to a persuasion that the propagation of the gospel would inculcate the practice of private and public virtue Whatever latitude an absolute monarch may assume in his own conduct whatever indulgence he may claim for his own passions it is undoubtedly his interest that all his subjects should respect the natural and civil obligations of society But the operation of the wisest laws is imperfect and precarious They seldom inspire virtue they cannot always restrain vice Their power is insufficient to prohibit all that they condemn nor can they always punish the actions which they prohibit The legislators of antiquity had summoned to their aid the powers of education and of opinion But every principle which had once maintained the vigor and purity of Rome and Sparta was long since extinguished in a declining and despotic empire Philosophy still exercised her temperate sway over the human mind but the cause of virtue derived very feeble support from the influence of the Pagan superstition Under these discouraging circumstances a prudent magistrate might observe with pleasure the progress of a religion which diffused among the people a pure benevolent and universal system of ethics adapted to every duty and every condition of life recommended as the will and reason of the supreme Deity and enforced by the sanction of eternal rewards or punishments The experience of Greek and Roman history could not inform the world how far the system of national manners might be reformed and improved by the precepts of a divine revelation and Constantine might listen with some confidence to the flattering and indeed reasonable assurances of Lactantius The eloquent apologist seemed firmly to expect and almost ventured to promise that the establishment of Christianity would restore the innocence and felicity of the primitive age that the worship of the true God would extinguish war and dissension among those who mutually considered themselves as the children of a common parent that every impure desire every angry or selfish passion would be restrained by the knowledge of the gospel and that the magistrates might sheath the sword of justice among a people who would be universally actuated by the sentiments of truth and piety of equity and moderation of harmony and universal love seventeen Footnote seventeen See the elegant description of Lactantius Divin Institut v eight who is much more perspicuous and positive than becomes a discreet prophet The passive and unresisting obedience which bows under the yoke of authority or even of oppression must have appeared in the eyes of an absolute monarch the most conspicuous and useful of the evangelic virtues eighteen The primitive Christians derived the institution of civil government not from the consent of the people but from the decrees of Heaven The reigning emperor though he had usurped the sceptre by treason and murder immediately assumed the sacred character of vicegerent of the Deity To the Deity alone he was accountable for the abuse of his power and his subjects were indissolubly bound by their oath of fidelity to a tyrant who had violated every law of nature and society The humble Christians were sent into the world as sheep among wolves and since they were not permitted to employ force even in the defence of their religion they should be still more criminal if they were tempted to shed the blood of their fellow creatures in disputing the vain privileges or the sordid possessions of this transitory life Faithful to the doctrine of the apostle who in the reign of Nero had preached the duty of unconditional submission the Christians of the three first centuries preserved their conscience pure and innocent of the guilt of secret conspiracy or open rebellion While they experienced the rigor of persecution they were never provoked either to meet their tyrants in the field or indignantly to withdraw themselves into some remote and sequestered corner of the globe nineteen The Protestants of France of Germany and of Britain who asserted with such intrepid courage their civil and religious freedom have been insulted by the invidious comparison between the conduct of the primitive and of the reformed Christians twenty Perhaps instead of censure some applause may be due to the superior sense and spirit of our ancestors who had convinced themselves that religion cannot abolish the unalienable rights of human nature twenty one Perhaps the patience of the primitive church may be ascribed to its weakness as well as to its virtue A sect of unwarlike plebeians without leaders without arms without fortifications must have encountered inevitable destruction in a rash and fruitless resistance to the master of the Roman legions But the Christians when they deprecated the wrath of Diocletian or solicited the favor of Constantine could allege with truth and confidence that they held the principle of passive obedience and that in the space of three centuries their conduct had always been conformable to their principles They might add that the throne of the emperors would be established on a fixed and permanent basis if all their subjects embracing the Christian doctrine should learn to suffer and to obey Footnote eighteen The political system of the Christians is explained by Grotius de Jure Belli et Pacis l i c three four Grotius was a republican and an exile but the mildness of his temper inclined him to support the established powers Footnote nineteen Tertullian Apolog c thirty two thirty four thirty five thirty six Tamen nunquam Albiniani nec Nigriani vel Cassiani inveniri potuerunt Christiani Ad Scapulam c two If this assertion be strictly true it excludes the Christians of that age from all civil and military

are considered as the ministers of Heaven appointed to rule or to chastise the nations of the earth But sacred history affords many illustrious examples of the more immediate interposition of the Deity in the government of his chosen people The sceptre and the sword were committed to the hands of Moses of Joshua of Gideon of David of the Maccabees the virtues of those heroes were the motive or the effect of the divine favor the success of their arms was destined to achieve the deliverance or the triumph of the church If the judges of Israel were occasional and temporary magistrates the kings of Judah derived from the royal unction of their great ancestor an hereditary and indefeasible right which could not be forfeited by their own vices nor recalled by the caprice of their subjects The same extraordinary providence which was no longer confined to the Jewish people might elect Constantine and his family as the protectors of the Christian world and the devout Lactantius announces in a prophetic tone the future glories of his long and universal reign twenty two Galerius and Maximin Maxentius and Licinius were the rivals who shared with the favorite of heaven the provinces of the empire The tragic deaths of Galerius and Maximin soon gratified the resentment and fulfilled the sanguine expectations of the Christians The success of Constantine against Maxentius and Licinius removed the two formidable competitors who still opposed the triumph of the second David and his cause might seem to claim the peculiar interposition of Providence The character of the Roman tyrant disgraced the purple and human nature and though the Christians might enjoy his precarious favor they were exposed with the rest of his subjects to the effects of his wanton and capricious cruelty The conduct of Licinius soon betrayed the reluctance with which he had consented to the wise and humane regulations of the edict of Milan The convocation of provincial synods was prohibited in his dominions his Christian officers were ignominiously dismissed and if he avoided the guilt or rather danger of a general persecution his partial oppressions were rendered still more odious by the violation of a solemn and voluntary engagement twenty three While the East according to the lively expression of Eusebius was involved in the shades of infernal darkness the auspicious rays of celestial light warmed and illuminated the provinces of the West The piety of Constantine was admitted as an unexceptionable proof of the justice of his arms and his use of victory confirmed the opinion of the Christians that their hero was inspired and conducted by the Lord of Hosts The conquest of Italy produced a general edict of toleration and as soon as the defeat of Licinius had invested Constantine with the sole dominion of the Roman world he immediately by circular letters exhorted all his subjects to imitate without delay the example of their sovereign and to embrace the divine truth of Christianity twenty four Footnote twenty two Lactant Divin Institut i l Eusebius in the course of his history his life and his oration repeatedly inculcates the divine right of Constantine to the empire Footnote twenty three Our imperfect knowledge of the persecution of Licinius is derived from Eusebius Hist l x c eight Vit Constantin l i c forty nine fifty six l ii c one two Aurelius Victor mentions his cruelty in general terms Footnote twenty four Euseb in Vit Constant l ii c twenty four forty two forty eight sixty Chapter XX Conversion Of Constantine Part II The assurance that the elevation of Constantine was intimately connected with the designs of Providence instilled into the minds of the Christians two opinions which by very different means assisted the accomplishment of the prophecy Their warm and active loyalty exhausted in his favor every resource of human industry and they confidently expected that their strenuous efforts would be seconded by some divine and miraculous aid The enemies of Constantine have imputed to interested motives the alliance which he insensibly contracted with the Catholic church and which apparently contributed to the success of his ambition In the beginning of the fourth century the Christians still bore a very inadequate proportion to the inhabitants of the empire but among a degenerate people who viewed the change of masters with the indifference of slaves the spirit and union of a religious party might assist the popular leader to whose service from a principle of conscience they had devoted their lives and fortunes twenty five The example of his father had instructed Constantine to esteem and to reward the merit of the Christians and in the distribution of public offices he had the advantage of strengthening his government by the choice of ministers or generals in whose fidelity he could repose a just and unreserved confidence By the influence of these dignified missionaries the proselytes of the new faith must have multiplied in the court and army the Barbarians of Germany who filled the ranks of the legions were of a careless temper which acquiesced without resistance in the religion of their commander and when they passed the Alps it may fairly be presumed that a great number of the soldiers had already consecrated their swords to the service of Christ and of Constantine twenty six The habits of mankind and the interests of religion gradually abated the horror of war and bloodshed which had so long prevailed among the Christians and in the councils which were assembled under the gracious protection of Constantine the authority of the bishops was seasonably employed to ratify the obligation of the military oath and to inflict the penalty of excommunication on those soldiers who threw away their arms during the peace of the church twenty seven While Constantine in his own dominions increased the number and zeal of his faithful adherents he could depend on the support of a powerful faction in those provinces which were still possessed or usurped by his rivals A secret disaffection was diffused among the Christian subjects of Maxentius and Licinius and the resentment which the latter did not attempt to conceal served only to engage them still more deeply in the interest of his competitor The regular correspondence which connected the bishops of the most distant provinces enabled them freely to communicate their wishes and their designs and to transmit without danger any useful intelligence or any pious contributions which might promote the service of Constantine who publicly declared that he had taken up arms for the deliverance of the church twenty eight Footnote twenty five In the beginning of the last century the Papists of England were only a thirtieth and the Protestants of France only a fifteenth part of the respective nations to whom their spirit and power were a constant object of apprehension See the relations which Bentivoglio who was then nuncio at Brussels and afterwards cardinal transmitted to the court of Rome Relazione tom ii p two hundred eleven two hundred forty one Bentivoglio was curious well informed but somewhat partial Footnote twenty six This careless temper of the Germans appears almost uniformly on the history of the conversion of each of the tribes The legions of Constantine were recruited with Germans

pace placuit eos abstinere a communione Council Arelat Canon iii The best critics apply these words to the peace of the church Footnote twenty eight Eusebius always considers the second civil war against Licinius as a sort of religious crusade At the invitation of the tyrant some Christian officers had resumed their zones or in other words had returned to the military service Their conduct was afterwards censured by the twelfth canon of the Council of Nice if this particular application may be received instead of the lo se and general sense of the Greek interpreters Balsamor Zonaras and Alexis Aristenus See Beveridge Pandect Eccles Graec tom i p seventy two tom ii p seventy three Annotation The enthusiasm which inspired the troops and perhaps the emperor himself had sharpened their swords while it satisfied their conscience They marched to battle with the full assurance that the same God who had formerly opened a passage to the Israelites through the waters of Jordan and had thrown down the walls of Jericho at the sound of the trumpets of Joshua would display his visible majesty and power in the victory of Constantine The evidence of ecclesiastical history is prepared to affirm that their expectations were justified by the conspicuous miracle to which the conversion of the first Christian emperor has been almost unanimously ascribed The real or imaginary cause of so important an event deserves and demands the attention of posterity and I shall endeavor to form a just estimate of the famous vision of Constantine by a distinct consideration of the standard the dream and the celestial sign by separating the historical the natural and the marvellous parts of this extraordinary story which in the composition of a specious argument have been artfully confounded in one splendid and brittle mass I An instrument of the tortures which were inflicted only on slaves and strangers became on object of horror in the eyes of a Roman citizen and the ideas of guilt of pain and of ignominy were closely united with the idea of the cross twenty nine The piety rather than the humanity of Constantine soon abolished in his dominions the punishment which the Savior of mankind had condescended to suffer thirty but the emperor had already learned to despise the prejudices of his education and of his people before he could erect in the midst of Rome his own statue bearing a cross in its right hand with an inscription which referred the victory of his arms and the deliverance of Rome to the virtue of that salutary sign the true symbol of force and courage thirty

which adorned the person of the emperor himself were distinguished only by richer materials and more exquisite workmanship thirty two But the principal standard which displayed the triumph of the cross was styled the Labarum thirty three an obscure though celebrated name which has been vainly derived from almost all the languages of the world It is described thirty four as a long pike intersected by a transversal beam The silken veil which hung down from the beam was curiously inwrought with the images of the reigning monarch and his children The summit of the pike supported a crown of gold which enclosed the mysterious monogram at once expressive of the figure of the cross and the initial letters of the name of Christ thirty five The safety of the labarum was intrusted to fifty guards of approved valor and fidelity their station was marked by honors and emoluments and some fortunate accidents soon introduced an opinion that as long as the guards of the labarum were engaged in the execution of their office they were secure and invulnerable amidst the darts of the enemy In the second civil war Licinius felt and dreaded the power of this consecrated banner the sight of which in the distress of battle animated the soldiers of Constantine with an invincible enthusiasm and scattered terror and dismay through the ranks of the adverse legions thirty six The Christian emperors who respected the example of Constantine displayed in all their military expeditions the standard of the cross but when the degenerate successors of Theodosius had ceased to appear in person at the head of their armies the labarum was deposited as a venerable but useless relic in the palace of Constantinople thirty seven Its honors are still preserved on the medals of the Flavian family Their grateful devotion has placed the monogram of Christ in the midst of the ensigns of Rome The solemn epithets of safety of the republic glory of the army restoration of public happiness are equally applied to the religious and military trophies and there is still extant a medal of the emperor Constantius where the standard of the labarum is accompanied with these memorable

Cod Theod l vi tit xxv Sozomen l i c two Theophan Chronograph p eleven Theophanes lived towards the end of the eighth century almost five hundred years after Constantine The modern Greeks were not inclined to display in the field the standard of the empire and of Christianity and though they depended on every superstitious hope of defence the promise of victory would have appeared too bold a fiction Footnote thirty eight The Abbe du Voisin p one hundred three c alleges several of these medals and quotes a particular dissertation of a Jesuit the Pere de Grainville on this subject II In all occasions of danger and distress it was the practice of the primitive Christians to fortify their minds and bodies by the sign of the cross which they used in all their ecclesiastical rites in all the daily occurrences of life as an infallible preservative against every species of spiritual or temporal evil thirty nine The authority of the church might alone have had sufficient weight to justify the devotion of Constantine who in the same prudent and gradual progress acknowledged the truth and assumed the symbol of Christianity But the testimony of a contemporary writer who in a formal treatise has avenged the cause of religion bestows on the piety of the emperor a more awful and sublime character He affirms with the most perfect confidence that in the night which preceded the last battle against Maxentius Constantine was admonished in a dream thirty ninea to inscribe the shields of his soldiers with the celestial sign of God the sacred monogram of the name of Christ that he executed the commands of Heaven and that his valor and obedience were rewarded by the decisive victory of the Milvian Bridge Some considerations might perhaps incline a sceptical mind to suspect the judgment or the veracity of the rhetorician whose pen either from zeal or interest was devoted to the cause of the prevailing faction forty He appears to have published his deaths of the persecutors at Nicomedia about three years after the Roman victory but the interval of a thousand miles and a thousand days will allow an ample latitude for the invention of declaimers the credulity of party and the tacit approbation of the emperor himself who might listen without indignation to a marvellous tale which exalted his fame and promoted his designs In favor of Licinius who still dissembled his animosity to the Christians the same author has provided a similar vision of a form of prayer which was communicated by an angel and repeated by the whole army before they engaged the legions of the tyrant Maximin The frequent repetition of miracles serves to provoke where it does not subdue the reason of mankind forty one but if the dream of Constantine is separately considered it may be naturally explained either by the policy or the enthusiasm of the emperor Whilst his anxiety for the approaching day which must decide the fate of the empire was suspended by a short and interrupted slumber the venerable form of Christ and the well known symbol of his religion might forcibly offer themselves to the active fancy of a prince who reverenced the name and had perhaps secretly implored the power of the God of the Christians As readily might a consummate statesman indulge himself in the use of one of those military stratagems one of those pious frauds which Philip and Sertorius had employed with such art and effect forty two The praeternatural origin of dreams was universally admitted by the nations of antiquity and a considerable part of the Gallic army was already prepared to place their confidence in the salutary sign of the Christian religion The secret vision of Constantine could be disproved only by the event and the intrepid hero who had passed the Alps and the Apennine might view with careless despair the consequences of a defeat under the walls of Rome The senate and people exulting in their own deliverance from an odious tyrant acknowledged that the victory of Constantine surpassed the powers of man without daring to insinuate that it had been obtained by the protection of the gods The triumphal arch which was erected about three years after the event proclaims in ambiguous language that by the greatness of his own mind and by an instinct or impulse of the Divinity he had saved and avenged the Roman republic forty three The Pagan orator who had seized an earlier opportunity of celebrating the virtues of the conqueror supposes that he alone enjoyed a secret and intimate commerce with the Supreme Being who delegated the care of mortals to his subordinate deities and thus assigns a very plausible reason why the subjects of Constantine should not presume to embrace the new religion of their sovereign forty four Footnote thirty nine

probably conclude that if the eyes of the spectators have sometimes been deceived by fraud the understanding of the readers has much more frequently been insulted by fiction Every event or appearance or accident which seems to deviate from the ordinary course of nature has been rashly ascribed to the immediate action of the Deity and the astonished fancy of the multitude has sometimes given shape and color language and motion to the fleeting but uncommon meteors of the air forty five Nazarius and Eusebius are the two most celebrated orators who in studied panegyrics have labored to exalt the glory of Constantine Nine years after the Roman victory Nazarius forty six describes an army of divine warriors who seemed to fall from the sky he marks their beauty their spirit their gigantic forms the stream of light which beamed from their celestial armor their patience in suffering themselves to be heard as well as seen by mortals and their declaration that they were sent that they flew to the assistance of the great Constantine For the truth of this prodigy the Pagan orator appeals to the whole Gallic nation in whose presence he was then speaking and seems to hope that the ancient apparitions forty seven would now obtain credit from this recent and public event The Christian fable of Eusebius which in the space of twenty six years might arise from the original dream is cast in a much more correct and elegant mould In one of the marches of Constantine he is reported to have seen with his own eyes the luminous trophy of the cross placed above the meridian sun and inscribed with the following words By This Conquer This amazing object in the sky astonished the whole army as well as the emperor himself who was yet undetermined in the choice of a religion but his astonishment was converted into faith by the vision of the ensuing night Christ appeared before his eyes and displaying the same celestial sign of the cross he directed Constantine to frame a similar standard and to march with an assurance of victory against Maxentius and all his enemies forty eight The learned bishop of Caesarea appears to be sensible that the recent discovery of this marvellous anecdote would excite some surprise and distrust among the most pious of his readers Yet instead of ascertaining the precise circumstances of time and place which always serve to detect falsehood or establish truth forty nine instead of collecting and recording the evidence of so many living witnesses who must have been spectators of this stupendous miracle fifty Eusebius contents himself with alleging a very singular testimony that of the deceased Constantine who many years after the event in the freedom of conversation had related to him this extraordinary incident of his own life and had attested the truth of it by a solemn oath The prudence and gratitude of the learned prelate forbade him to suspect the veracity of his victorious master but he plainly intimates that in a fact of such a nature he should have refused his assent to any meaner authority This motive of credibility could not survive the power of the Flavian family and the celestial sign which the Infidels might afterwards deride fifty one was disregarded by the Christians of the age which immediately followed the conversion of Constantine fifty two But the Catholic church both of the East and of the West has adopted a prodigy which favors or seems to favor the popular worship of the cross The vision of Constantine maintained an honorable place in the legend of superstition till the bold and sagacious spirit of criticism presumed to depreciate the triumph and to arraign the truth of the first Christian emperor fifty three Footnote forty five M Freret Memoires de l Academie des Inscriptions tom iv p

of Constantine among the solar halos Bibliothec Graec tom iv p eight twenty nine Note The great difficulty in resolving it into a natural phenomenon arises from the inscription even the most heated or awe struck imagination would hardly discover distinct and legible letters in a solar halo But the inscription may have been a later embellishment or an interpretation of the meaning which the sign was construed to convey Compare Heirichen Excur in locum Eusebii and the authors quoted Footnote forty six Nazarius inter Panegyr Vet x fourteen fifteen It is unnecessary to name the moderns whose

Footnote fifty two The advocates for the vision are unable to produce a single testimony from the Fathers of the fourth and fifth centuries who in their voluminous writings repeatedly celebrate the triumph of the church and of Constantine As these venerable men had not any dislike to a miracle we may suspect and the suspicion is confirmed by the ignorance of Jerom that they were all unacquainted

equal zeal by Cardinal Baronius and the Centuriators of Magdeburgh Since that time many of the Protestant critics have inclined towards doubt and disbelief The objections are urged with great force by M Chauffepie Dictionnaire Critique tom iv p six eleven and in the year seventeen seventy four a doctor of Sorbonne the Abbe du Veisin published an apology which deserves the praise of learning and moderation Note The first Excursus of Heinichen in Vitam Constantini p five hundred seven contains a full summary of the opinions and arguments of the later writers who have discussed this interminable subject As to his conversion where interest and inclination state policy and if not a sincere conviction of its truth at least a respect an esteem an awe of Christianity thus coincided Constantine himself would probably have been unable to trace the actual history of the workings of his own mind or to assign its real influence to each concurrent motive M The Protestant and philosophic readers of the present age will incline to believe that in the account of his own conversion Constantine attested a wilful falsehood by a solemn and deliberate perjury They may not hesitate to pronounce that in the choice of a religion his mind was determined only by a sense of interest and that according to the expression of a profane poet fifty four he used the altars of the church as a convenient footstool to the throne of the empire A conclusion so harsh and so absolute is not however warranted by our knowledge of human nature of Constantine or of Christianity In an age of religious fervor the most artful statesmen are observed to feel some part of the enthusiasm which they inspire and the most orthodox saints assume the dangerous privilege of defending the cause of truth by the arms of deceit and falsehood Personal interest is often the standard of our belief as well as of our practice and the same motives of temporal advantage which might influence the public conduct and professions of Constantine would insensibly dispose his mind to embrace a religion so propitious to his fame and fortunes His vanity was gratified by the flattering assurance that he had been chosen by Heaven to reign over the earth success had justified his divine title to the throne and that title was founded on the truth of the Christian revelation As real virtue is sometimes excited by undeserved applause the specious piety of Constantine if at first it was only specious might gradually by the influence of praise of habit and of example be matured into serious faith and fervent devotion The bishops and teachers of the new sect whose dress and manners had not qualified them for the residence of a court were admitted to the Imperial table they accompanied the monarch in his expeditions and the ascendant which one of them an Egyptian or a Spaniard fifty five acquired over his mind was imputed by the Pagans to the effect of magic fifty six Lactantius who has adorned the precepts of the gospel with the eloquence of Cicero fifty seven and Eusebius who has consecrated the learning and philosophy of the Greeks to the service of religion fifty eight were both received into the friendship and familiarity of their sovereign and those able masters of controversy could patiently watch the soft and yielding moments of persuasion and dexterously apply the arguments which were the best adapted to his character and understanding Whatever advantages might be derived from the acquisition of an Imperial proselyte he was distinguished by the splendor of his purple rather than by the superiority of wisdom or virtue from the many thousands of his subjects who had embraced the doctrines of Christianity Nor can it be deemed incredible that the mind of an unlettered soldier should have yielded to the weight of evidence which in a more enlightened age has satisfied or subdued the reason of a Grotius a Pascal or a Locke In the midst of the incessant labors of his great office this soldier employed or affected to employ the hours of the night in the diligent study of the Scriptures and the composition of theological discourses which he afterwards pronounced in the presence of a numerous and applauding audience In a very long discourse which is still extant the royal preacher expatiates on the various proofs still extant the royal preacher expatiates on the various proofs of religion but he dwells with peculiar complacency on the Sibylline verses fifty nine and the fourth eclogue of Virgil sixty Forty years before the birth of Christ the Mantuan bard as if inspired by the celestial muse of Isaiah had celebrated with all the pomp of oriental metaphor the return of the Virgin the fall of the serpent the approaching birth of a godlike child the offspring of the great Jupiter who should expiate the guilt of human kind and govern the peaceful universe with the virtues of his father the rise and appearance of a heavenly race primitive nation throughout the world and the gradual restoration of the innocence and felicity of the golden age The poet was perhaps unconscious of the secret sense and object of these sublime predictions which have been so unworthily applied to the infant son of a consul or a triumvir sixty one but if a more splendid and indeed specious interpretation of the fourth eclogue contributed to the conversion of the first Christian emperor Virgil may deserve to be ranked among the most successful missionaries of the gospel sixty two Footnote fifty four Lors Constantin dit ces propres paroles J ai renverse le

Conversion Of Constantine Part III The awful mysteries of the Christian faith and worship were concealed from the eyes of strangers and even of catechu mens with an affected secrecy which served to excite their wonder and curiosity sixty three But the severe rules of discipline which the prudence of the bishops had instituted were relaxed by the same prudence in favor of an Imperial proselyte whom it was so important to allure by every gentle condescension into the pale of the church and Constantine was permitted at least by a tacit dispensation to enjoy most of the privileges before he had contracted any of the obligations of a Christian Instead of retiring from the congregation when the voice of the deacon dismissed the profane multitude he prayed with the faithful disputed with the bishops preached on the most sublime and intricate subjects of theology celebrated with sacred rites the vigil of Easter and publicly declared himself not only a partaker but in some measure a priest and hierophant of the Christian mysteries sixty four The pride of Constantine might assume and his services had deserved some extraordinary distinction and ill timed rigor might have blasted the unripened fruits of his conversion and if the doors of the church had been strictly closed against a prince who had deserted the altars of the gods the master of the empire would have been left destitute of any form of religious worship In his last visit to Rome he piously disclaimed and insulted the superstition of his ancestors by refusing to lead the military procession of the equestrian order and to offer the public vows to the Jupiter of the Capitoline Hill sixty five Many years before his baptism and death Constantine had proclaimed to the world that neither his person nor his image should ever more be seen within the walls of an idolatrous temple while he distributed through the provinces a variety of medals and pictures which represented the emperor in an humble and suppliant posture of Christian devotion sixty six Footnote sixty three The distinction between the public and the secret parts of divine service the missa catechumenorum and the missa fidelium and the

Footnote sixty six Eusebius in Vit Constant l iv c fifteen sixteen The pride of Constantine who refused the privileges of a catechumen cannot easily be explained or excused but the delay of his baptism may be justified by the maxims and the practice of ecclesiastical antiquity The sacrament of baptism sixty seven was regularly administered by the bishop himself with his assistant clergy in the cathedral church of the diocese during the fifty days between the solemn festivals of Easter and Pentecost and this holy term admitted a numerous band of infants and adult persons into the bosom of the church The discretion of parents often suspended the baptism of their children till they could understand the obligations which they contracted the severity of ancient bishops exacted from the new converts a novitiate of two or three years and the catechumens themselves from different motives of a temporal or a spiritual nature were seldom impatient to assume the character of perfect and initiated Christians The sacrament of baptism was supposed to contain a full and absolute expiation of sin and the soul was instantly restored to its original purity and entitled to the promise of eternal salvation Among the proselytes of Christianity there are many who judged it imprudent to precipitate a salutary rite which could not be repeated to throw away an inestimable privilege which could never be recovered By the delay of their baptism they could venture freely to indulge their passions in the enjoyments of this world while they still retained in their own hands the means of a sure and easy absolution sixty eight The sublime theory of the gospel had made a much fainter impression on the heart than on the understanding of Constantine himself He pursued the great object of his ambition through the dark and bloody paths of war and policy and after the victory he abandoned himself without moderation to the abuse of his fortune Instead of asserting his just superiority above the imperfect heroism and profane philosophy of Trajan and the Antonines the mature age of Constantine forfeited the reputation which he had acquired in his youth As he gradually advanced in the knowledge of truth he proportionally declined in the practice of virtue and the same year of his reign in which he convened the council of Nice was polluted by the execution or rather murder of his eldest son This date is alone sufficient to refute the ignorant and malicious suggestions of Zosimus sixty nine who affirms that after the death of Crispus the remorse of his father accepted from the ministers of christianity the expiation which he had vainly solicited from the Pagan pontiffs At the time of the death of Crispus the emperor could no longer hesitate in the choice of a religion he could no longer be ignorant that the church was possessed of an infallible remedy though he chose to defer the application of it till the approach of death had removed the temptation and danger of a relapse The bishops whom he summoned in his last illness to the palace of Nicomedia were edified by the fervor with which he requested and received the sacrament of baptism by the solemn protestation that the remainder of his life should be worthy of a disciple of Christ and by his humble refusal to wear the Imperial purple after he had been clothed in the white garment of a Neophyte The example and reputation of Constantine seemed to countenance the delay of baptism seventy Future tyrants were encouraged to believe that the innocent blood which they might shed in a long reign would instantly be washed away in the waters of regeneration and the abuse of religion dangerously undermined the foundations of moral virtue Footnote sixty seven The theory and practice of antiquity with regard to the sacrament of baptism have been copiously explained by Dom Chardon Hist des Sacremens tom i p three four hundred five Dom Martenne de Ritibus Ecclesiae Antiquis tom i and by Bingham in the tenth and eleventh books of his Christian Antiquities One circumstance may be observed in which the modern churches have materially departed from the ancient custom The sacrament of baptism even when it was administered to infants was immediately followed by confirmation and the holy communion Footnote sixty eight The Fathers who censured this criminal delay could not deny the certain and victorious efficacy even of a death bed baptism The ingenious rhetoric of Chrysostom could find only three arguments against these prudent Christians one That we should love and pursue virtue for her own sake and not merely for the reward two That we may be surprised by death without an opportunity of baptism three That although we shall be placed in heaven we shall only twinkle like little stars when compared to the suns of righteousness who have run their appointed course with labor with success and with glory Chrysos tom in Epist ad Hebraeos Homil xiii apud Chardon Hist des Sacremens tom i p forty nine I believe that this delay of baptism though attended with the most pernicious consequences was never condemned by any general or provincial council or by any public act or declaration of the church The zeal of the bishops was easily kindled on much slighter occasion Note This passage of Chrysostom though not in his more forcible manner is not quite fairly represented He is stronger in other places in Act Hom xxiii and Hom i Compare likewise the sermon of Gregory of Nysea on this subject and Gregory Nazianzen After all to those who believed in the efficacy of baptism what argument could be more conclusive than the danger of dying without it Orat xl M Footnote sixty nine Zosimus l ii p one hundred four For this disingenuous falsehood he has deserved and experienced the harshest treatment from all the ecclesiastical writers except Cardinal Baronius A D three hundred twenty four No fifteen twenty eight who had occasion to employ the infidel on a particular service against the Arian Eusebius Note Heyne in a valuable note on this passage of Zosimus has shown decisively that this malicious way of accounting for the conversion of Constantine was not an invention of Zosimus It appears to have been the current calumny eagerly adopted and propagated by the exasperated Pagan party Reitemeter a later editor of Zosimus whose notes are retained in the recent edition in the collection of the Byzantine historians has a disquisition on the passage as candid but not more conclusive than some which have preceded him M Footnote seventy Eusebius l iv c sixty one sixty two sixty three The bishop of Caesarea supposes the salvation of Constantine with the most perfect confidence The gratitude of the church has exalted the virtues and excused the failings of a generous patron who seated Christianity on the throne of the Roman world and the Greeks who celebrate the festival of the Imperial saint seldom mention the name of Constantine without adding the title of equal to the Apostles seventy one Such a comparison if it allude to the character of those divine missionaries must be imputed to the extravagance of impious flattery But if the parallel be confined to the extent and number of their evangelic victories the success of Constantine might perhaps equal that of the Apostles themselves By the edicts of toleration he removed the temporal disadvantages which had hitherto retarded the progress of Christianity and its active and numerous ministers received a free permission a liberal encouragement to recommend the salutary truths of revelation by every argument which could affect the reason or piety of mankind The exact balance of the two religions continued but a moment and the piercing eye of ambition and avarice soon discovered that the profession of Christianity might contribute to the interest of the present as well as of a future life seventy two The hopes of wealth and honors the example of an emperor his exhortations his irresistible smiles diffused conviction among the venal and obsequious crowds which usually fill the apartments of a palace The cities which signalized a forward zeal by the voluntary destruction of their temples were distinguished by municipal privileges and rewarded with popular donatives and the new capital of the East gloried in the singular advantage that Constantinople was never profaned by the worship of idols seventy three As the lower ranks of society are governed by imitation the conversion of those who possessed any eminence of birth of power or of riches was soon followed by dependent multitudes seventy four The salvation of the common people was purchased at an easy rate if it be true that in one year twelve thousand men were baptized at Rome besides a proportionable number of women and children and that a white garment with twenty pieces of gold had been promised by the emperor to every convert seventy five The powerful influence of Constantine was not circumscribed by the narrow limits of his life or of his dominions The education which he bestowed on his sons and nephews secured to the empire a race of princes whose faith was still more lively and sincere as they imbibed in their earliest infancy the spirit or at least the doctrine of Christianity War and commerce had spread the knowledge of the gospel beyond the confines of the Roman provinces and the Barbarians who had disdained as humble and proscribed sect soon learned to esteem a religion which had been so lately embraced by the greatest monarch and the most civilized nation of the globe seventy six The Goths and Germans who enlisted under the standard of Rome revered the cross which glittered at the head of the legions and their fierce countrymen received at the same time the lessons of faith and of humanity The kings of Iberia and Armenia seventy sixa worshipped the god of their protector and their subjects who have invariably preserved the name of Christians soon formed a sacred and perpetual connection with their Roman brethren The Christians of Persia were suspected in time of war of preferring their religion to their country but as long as peace subsisted between the two empires the persecuting spirit of the Magi was effectually restrained by the interposition of Constantine seventy seven The rays of the gospel illuminated the coast of India The colonies of Jews who had penetrated into Arabia and Ethiopia seventy eight opposed the progress of Christianity but the labor of the missionaries was in some measure facilitated by a previous knowledge of the Mosaic revelation and Abyssinia still reveres the memory of Frumentius seventy eighta who in the time of Constantine devoted his life to the conversion of those sequestered regions Under the reign of his son Constantius Theophilus seventy nine who was himself of Indian extraction was invested with the double character of ambassador and bishop He embarked on the Red Sea with two hundred horses of the purest breed of Cappadocia which were sent by the emperor to the prince of the Sabaeans or Homerites Theophilus was intrusted with many other useful or curious presents which might raise the

Paradise strange monsters c The irresistible power of the Roman emperors was displayed in the important and dangerous change of the national religion The terrors of a military force silenced the faint and unsupported murmurs of the Pagans and there was reason to expect that the cheerful submission of the Christian clergy as well as people would be the result of conscience and gratitude It was long since established as a fundamental maxim of the Roman constitution that every rank of citizens was alike subject to the laws and that the care of religion was the right as well as duty of the civil magistrate Constantine and his successors could not easily persuade themselves that they had forfeited by their conversion any branch of the Imperial prerogatives or that they were incapable of giving laws to a religion which they had protected and embraced The emperors still continued to exercise a supreme jurisdiction over the ecclesiastical order and the sixteenth book of the Theodosian code represents under a variety of titles the authority which they assumed in the government of the Catholic church But the distinction of the spiritual and temporal powers eighty one which had never been imposed on the free spirit of Greece and Rome was introduced and confirmed by the legal establishment of Christianity The office of supreme pontiff which from the time of Numa to that of Augustus had always been exercised by one of the most eminent of the senators was at length united to the Imperial dignity The first magistrate of the state as often as he was prompted by superstition or policy performed with his own hands the sacerdotal functions eighty two nor was there any order of priests either at Rome or in the provinces who claimed a more sacred character among men or a more intimate communication with the gods But in the Christian church which instrusts the service of the altar to a perpetual succession of consecrated ministers the monarch whose spiritual rank is less honorable than that of the meanest deacon was seated below the rails of the sanctuary and confounded with the rest of the faithful multitude eighty three The emperor might be saluted as the father of his people but he owed a filial duty and reverence to the fathers of the church and the same marks of respect which Constantine had paid to the persons of saints and confessors were soon exacted by the pride of the episcopal order eighty four A secret conflict between the civil and ecclesiastical jurisdictions embarrassed the operation of the Roman government and a pious emperor was alarmed by the guilt and danger of touching with a profane hand the ark of the covenant The separation of men into the two orders of the clergy and of the laity was indeed familiar to many nations of antiquity and the priests of India of Persia of Assyria of Judea of Aethiopia of Egypt and of Gaul derived from a celestial origin the temporal power and possessions which they had acquired These venerable institutions had gradually assimilated themselves to the manners and government of their respective countries eighty five but the opposition or contempt of the civil power served to cement the discipline of the primitive church The Christians had been obliged to elect their own magistrates to raise and distribute a peculiar revenue and to regulate the internal policy of their republic by a code of laws which were ratified by the consent of the people and the practice of three hundred years When Constantine embraced the faith of the Christians he seemed to contract a perpetual alliance with a distinct and independent society and the privileges granted or confirmed by that emperor or by his successors were accepted not as the precarious favors of the court but as the just and inalienable rights of the ecclesiastical order Footnote eighty one See the epistle of Osius ap Athanasium vol i p eight hundred forty The public remonstrance which Osius was forced to address to the son contained the same principles of ecclesiastical and civil government which he had secretly instilled into the mind of the father Footnote eighty two M de la Bastiel has evidently proved that Augustus and his successors exercised in person all the sacred functions of pontifex maximus of high priest of the Roman empire Footnote eighty three Something of a contrary practice had insensibly prevailed in the church of Constantinople but the rigid Ambrose commanded Theodosius to retire below the rails and taught him to know the difference between a king and a priest See Theodoret l v c eighteen Footnote eighty four

empress Tillemont Hist des Empereurs tom iv p seven hundred fifty four Patres Apostol tom ii p one hundred seventy nine Footnote eighty five Plutarch in his treatise of Isis and Osiris informs us that the kings of Egypt who were not already priests were initiated after their election into the sacerdotal order The Catholic church was administered by the spiritual and legal jurisdiction of eighteen hundred bishops eighty six of whom one thousand were seated in the Greek and eight hundred in the Latin provinces of the empire The extent and boundaries of their respective dioceses had been variously and accidentally decided by the zeal and success of the first missionaries by the wishes of the people and by the propagation of the gospel Episcopal churches were closely planted along the banks of the Nile on the sea coast of Africa in the proconsular Asia and through the southern provinces of Italy The bishops of Gaul and Spain of Thrace and Pontus reigned over an ample territory and delegated their rural suffragans to execute the subordinate duties of the pastoral office eighty seven A Christian diocese might be spread over a province or reduced to a village but all the bishops possessed an equal and indelible character they all derived the same powers and privileges from the apostles from the people and from the laws While the civil and military professions were separated by the policy of Constantine a new and perpetual order of ecclesiastical ministers always respectable sometimes dangerous was established in the church and state The important review of their station and attributes may be distributed under the following heads I Popular Election II Ordination of the Clergy III Property IV Civil Jurisdiction V Spiritual censures VI Exercise of public oratory VII Privilege of legislative assemblies Footnote eighty six The numbers are not ascertained by any ancient writer or original catalogue for the partial lists of the eastern churches are comparatively modern The patient diligence of Charles a Sto Paolo of Luke Holstentius and of Bingham has laboriously investigated all the episcopal sees of the Catholic church which was almost commensurate with the

fourth century and this equivocal character which had excited the jealousy of the prelates was abolished before the end of the tenth both in the East and the West I The freedom of election subsisted long after the legal establishment of Christianity eighty eight and the subjects of Rome enjoyed in the church the privilege which they had lost in the republic of choosing the magistrates whom they were bound to obey As soon as a bishop had closed his eyes the metropolitan issued a commission to one of his suffragans to administer the vacant see and prepare within a limited time the future election The right of voting was vested in the inferior clergy who were best qualified to judge of the merit of the candidates in the senators or nobles of the city all those who were distinguished by their rank or property and finally in the whole body of the people who on the appointed day flocked in multitudes from the most remote parts of the diocese eighty nine and sometimes silenced by their tumultuous acclamations the voice of reason and the laws of discipline These acclamations might accidentally fix on the head of the most deserving competitor of some ancient presbyter some holy monk or some layman conspicuous for his zeal and piety But the episcopal chair was solicited especially in the great and opulent cities of the empire as a temporal rather than as a spiritual dignity The interested views the selfish and angry passions the arts of perfidy and dissimulation the secret corruption the open and even bloody violence which had formerly disgraced the freedom of election in the commonwealths of Greece and Rome too often influenced the choice of the successors of the apostles While one of the candidates boasted the honors of his family a second allured his judges by the delicacies of a plentiful table and a third more guilty than his rivals offered to share the plunder of the church among the accomplices of his sacrilegious hopes ninety The civil as well as ecclesiastical laws attempted to exclude the populace from this solemn and important transaction The canons of ancient discipline by requiring several episcopal qualifications of age station c restrained in some measure the indiscriminate caprice of the electors The authority of the provincial bishops who were assembled in the vacant church to consecrate the choice of the people was interposed to moderate their passions and to correct their mistakes The bishops could refuse to ordain an unworthy candidate and the rage of contending factions sometimes accepted their impartial mediation The submission or the resistance of the clergy and people on various occasions afforded different precedents which were insensibly converted into positive laws and provincial customs ninety one but it was every where admitted as a fundamental maxim of religious policy that no bishop could be imposed on an orthodox church without the consent of its members The emperors as the guardians of the public peace and as the first citizens of Rome and Constantinople might effectually declare their wishes in the choice of a primate but those absolute monarchs respected the freedom of ecclesiastical elections and while they distributed and resumed the honors of the state and army they allowed eighteen hundred perpetual magistrates to receive their important offices from the free suffrages of the people ninety two It was agreeable to the dictates of justice that these magistrates should not desert an honorable station from which they could not be removed but the wisdom of councils endeavored without much success to enforce the residence and to prevent the translation of bishops The discipline of the West was indeed less relaxed than that of the East but the same passions which made those regulations necessary rendered them ineffectual The reproaches which angry prelates have so vehemently urged against each other serve only to expose their common guilt and their mutual indiscretion Footnote eighty eight Thomassin Discipline de l Eglise tom ii l ii c one eight p six hundred seventy three seven hundred twenty one has copiously treated of the election of bishops during the five first centuries both in the East and in the West but he shows a very partial bias in favor of the episcopal aristocracy Bingham l iv c two is moderate and Chardon Hist des

The bishops alone possessed the faculty of spiritual generation and this extraordinary privilege might compensate in some degree for the painful celibacy ninety three which was imposed as a virtue as a duty and at length as a positive obligation The religions of antiquity which established a separate order of priests dedicated a holy race a tribe or family to the perpetual service of the gods ninety four Such institutions were founded for possession rather than conquest The children of the priests enjoyed with proud and indolent security their sacred inheritance and the fiery spirit of enthusiasm was abated by the cares the pleasures and the endearments of domestic life But the Christian sanctuary was open to every ambitious candidate who aspired to its heavenly promises or temporal possessions This office of priests like that of soldiers or magistrates was strenuously exercised by those men whose temper and abilities had prompted them to embrace the ecclesiastical profession or who had been selected by a discerning bishop as the best qualified to promote the glory and interest of the church The bishops ninety five till the abuse was restrained by the prudence of the laws might constrain the reluctant and protect the distressed and the imposition of hands forever bestowed some of the most valuable privileges of civil society The whole body of the Catholic clergy more numerous perhaps than the legions was exempted ninety fivea by the emperors from all service private or public all municipal offices and all personal taxes and contributions which pressed on their fellow citizens with intolerable weight and the duties of their holy profession were accepted as a full discharge of their obligations to the republic ninety six Each bishop acquired an absolute and indefeasible right to the perpetual obedience of the clerk whom he ordained the clergy of each episcopal church with its dependent parishes formed a regular and permanent society and the cathedrals of Constantinople ninety seven and Carthage ninety eight maintained their peculiar establishment of five hundred ecclesiastical ministers Their ranks ninety nine and numbers were insensibly multiplied by the superstition of the times which introduced into the church the splendid ceremonies of a Jewish or Pagan temple and a long train of priests deacons sub deacons acolythes exorcists readers singers and doorkeepers contributed in their respective stations to swell the pomp and harmony of religious worship The clerical name and privileges were extended to many pious fraternities who devoutly

swarms of monks who arose from the Nile overspread and darkened the face of the Christian world Footnote ninety three The celibacy of the clergy during the first five or six centuries is a subject of

admitting new ecclesiastics before a place should be vacant by the death of the occupant Godefroy ad Cod Theod t xii t i de Decur Valentinian the First by a rescript still more general enacted that no

XX Conversion Of Constantine Part IV III The edict of Milan secured the revenue as well as the peace of the church one hundred one The Christians not only recovered the lands and houses of which they had been stripped by the persecuting laws of Diocletian but they acquired a perfect title to all the possessions which they had hitherto enjoyed by the connivance of the magistrate As soon as Christianity became the religion of the emperor and the empire the national clergy might claim a decent and honorable maintenance and the payment of an annual tax might have delivered the people from the more oppressive tribute which superstition imposes on her votaries But as the wants and expenses of the church increased with her prosperity the ecclesiastical order was still supported and enriched by the voluntary oblations of the faithful Eight years after the edict of Milan Constantine granted to all his subjects the free and universal permission of bequeathing their fortunes to the holy Catholic church one hundred two and their devout liberality which during their lives was checked by luxury or avarice flowed with a profuse stream at the hour of their death The wealthy Christians were encouraged by the example of their sovereign An absolute monarch who is rich without patrimony may be charitable without merit and Constantine too easily believed that he should purchase the favor of Heaven if he maintained the idle at the expense of the industrious and distributed among the saints the wealth of the republic The same messenger who carried over to Africa the head of Maxentius might be intrusted with an epistle to Caecilian bishop of Carthage The emperor acquaints him that the treasurers of the province are directed to pay into his hands the sum of three thousand folles or eighteen thousand pounds sterling and to obey his further requisitions for the relief of the churches of Africa Numidia and Mauritania one hundred three The liberality of Constantine increased in a just proportion to his faith and to his vices He assigned in each city a regular allowance of corn to supply the fund of ecclesiastical charity and the persons of both sexes who embraced the monastic life became the peculiar favorites of their sovereign The Christian temples of Antioch Alexandria Jerusalem Constantinople c displayed the ostentatious piety of a prince ambitious in a declining age to equal the perfect labors of antiquity one hundred four The form of these religious edifices was simple and oblong though they might sometimes swell into the shape of a dome and sometimes branch into the figure of a cross The timbers were framed for the most part of cedars of Libanus the roof was covered with tiles perhaps of gilt brass and the walls the columns the pavement were encrusted with variegated marbles The most precious ornaments of gold and silver of silk and gems were profusely dedicated to the service of the altar and this specious magnificence was supported on the solid and perpetual basis of landed property In the space of two centuries from the reign of Constantine to that of Justinian the eighteen hundred churches of the empire were enriched by the frequent and unalienable gifts of the prince and people An annual income of six hundred pounds sterling may be reasonably assigned to the bishops who were placed at an equal distance between riches and poverty one hundred five but the standard of their wealth insensibly rose with the dignity and opulence of the cities which they governed An authentic but imperfect one hundred six rent roll specifies some houses shops gardens and farms which belonged to the three Basilicoe of Rome saint Peter saint Paul and saint John Lateran in the provinces of Italy Africa and the East They produce besides a reserved rent of oil linen paper aromatics c a clear annual revenue of twenty two thousand pieces of gold or twelve thousand pounds sterling In the age of Constantine and Justinian the bishops no longer possessed perhaps they no longer deserved the unsuspecting confidence of their clergy and people The ecclesiastical revenues of each diocese were divided into four parts for the respective uses of the bishop himself of his inferior clergy of the poor and of the public worship and the abuse of this sacred trust was strictly and repeatedly checked one hundred seven The patrimony of the church was still subject to all the public compositions of the state one hundred eight The clergy of Rome Alexandria Chessaionica c might solicit and obtain some partial exemptions

speculative heresies IV The Latin clergy who erected their tribunal on the ruins of the civil and common law have modestly accepted as the gift of Constantine one hundred ten the independent jurisdiction which was the fruit of time of accident and of their own industry But the liberality of the Christian emperors had actually endowed them with some legal prerogatives which secured and dignified the sacerdotal character one hundred eleven one Under a despotic government the bishops alone enjoyed and asserted the inestimable privilege of being tried only by their peers and even in a capital accusation a synod of their brethren were the sole judges of their guilt or innocence Such a tribunal unless it was inflamed by personal resentment or religious discord might be favorable or even partial to the sacerdotal order but Constantine was satisfied one hundred twelve that secret impunity would be less pernicious than public scandal and the Nicene council was edited by his public declaration that if he surprised a bishop in the act of adultery he should cast his Imperial mantle over the episcopal sinner two The domestic jurisdiction of the bishops was at once a privilege and a restraint of the ecclesiastical order whose civil causes were decently withdrawn from the cognizance of a secular judge Their venial offences were not exposed to the shame of a public trial or punishment and the gentle correction which the tenderness of youth may endure from its parents or instructors was inflicted by the temperate severity of the bishops But if the clergy were guilty of any crime which could not be sufficiently expiated by their degradation from an honorable and beneficial profession the Roman magistrate drew the sword of justice without any regard to ecclesiastical immunities three The arbitration of the bishops was ratified by a positive law and the judges were instructed to execute without appeal or delay the episcopal decrees whose validity had hitherto depended on the consent of the parties The conversion of the magistrates themselves and of the whole empire might gradually remove the fears and scruples of the Christians But they still resorted to the tribunal of the bishops whose abilities and integrity they esteemed and the venerable Austin enjoyed the satisfaction of complaining that his spiritual functions were perpetually interrupted by the invidious labor of deciding the claim or the possession of silver and gold of lands and cattle four The ancient privilege of sanctuary was transferred to the Christian temples and extended by the liberal piety of the younger Theodosius to the precincts of consecrated ground one hundred thirteen The fugitive and even guilty suppliants were permitted to implore either the justice or the mercy of the Deity and his ministers The rash violence of despotism was suspended by the mild interposition of the church and the lives or fortunes of the most eminent subjects might be protected by the mediation of the bishop Footnote one hundred ten From Eusebius in Vit Constant l iv c twenty seven and Sozomen l i c nine we are assured that the episcopal jurisdiction was extended and confirmed by Constantine but the forgery of a famous edict which was never fairly inserted in the Theodosian Code see at the end tom vi p three hundred three is demonstrated by Godefroy in the most satisfactory manner It is strange that M de Montesquieu who was a lawyer as well as a philosopher should allege this edict of Constantine Esprit des Loix l xxix c sixteen without intimating any suspicion Footnote

Institutes of Canon Law by the Abbe de Fleury and the Civil History of Naples by Giannone Their moderation was the effect of situation as well as of temper Fleury was a French ecclesiastic who respected the authority of the parliaments Giannone was an Italian lawyer who dreaded the power of the church And here let me observe that as the general propositions which I advance are the result of

ancient Greece might perhaps contain fifteen or twenty axyla or sanctuaries a number which at present may be found in Italy within the walls of a single city V The bishop was the perpetual censor of the morals of his people The discipline of penance was digested into a system of canonical jurisprudence one hundred fourteen which accurately defined the duty of private or public confession the rules of evidence the degrees of guilt and the measure of punishment It was impossible to execute this spiritual censure if the Christian pontiff who punished the obscure sins of the multitude respected the conspicuous vices and destructive crimes of the magistrate but it was impossible to arraign the conduct of the magistrate without controlling the administration of civil government Some considerations of religion or loyalty or fear protected the sacred persons of the emperors from the zeal or resentment of the bishops but they boldly censured and excommunicated the subordinate tyrants who were not invested with the majesty of the purple saint Athanasius excommunicated one of the ministers of Egypt and the interdict which he pronounced of fire and water was solemnly transmitted to the churches of Cappadocia one hundred fifteen Under the reign of the younger Theodosius the polite and eloquent Synesius one of the descendants of Hercules one hundred sixteen filled the episcopal seat of Ptolemais near the ruins of ancient Cyrene one hundred seventeen and the philosophic bishop supported with dignity the character which he had assumed with reluctance one hundred eighteen He vanquished the monster of Libya the president Andronicus who abused the authority of a venal office invented new modes of rapine and torture and aggravated the guilt of oppression by that of sacrilege one hundred nineteen After a fruitless attempt to reclaim the haughty magistrate by mild and religious admonition Synesius proceeds to inflict the last sentence of ecclesiastical justice one hundred twenty which devotes Andronicus with his associates and their families to the abhorrence of earth and heaven The impenitent sinners more cruel than Phalaris or Sennacherib more destructive than war pestilence or a cloud of locusts are deprived of the name and privileges of Christians of the participation of the sacraments and of the hope of Paradise The bishop exhorts the clergy the

VI Every popular government has experienced the effects of rude or artificial eloquence The coldest nature is animated the firmest reason is moved by the rapid communication of the prevailing impulse and each hearer is affected by his own passions and by those of the surrounding multitude The ruin of civil liberty had silenced the demagogues of Athens and the tribunes of Rome the custom of preaching which seems to constitute a considerable part of Christian devotion had not been introduced into the temples of antiquity and the ears of monarchs were never invaded by the harsh sound of popular eloquence till the pulpits of the empire were filled with sacred orators who possessed some advantages unknown to their profane predecessors one hundred twenty two The arguments and rhetoric of the tribune were instantly opposed with equal arms by skilful and resolute antagonists and the cause of truth and reason might derive an accidental support from the conflict of hostile passions The bishop or some distinguished presbyter to whom he cautiously delegated the powers of preaching harangued without the danger of interruption or reply a submissive multitude whose minds had been prepared and subdued by the awful ceremonies of religion Such was the strict subordination of the Catholic church that the same concerted sounds might issue at once from a hundred pulpits of Italy or Egypt if they were tuned one hundred twenty three by the master hand of the Roman or Alexandrian primate The design of this institution was laudable but the fruits were not always salutary The preachers recommended the practice of the social duties but they exalted the perfection of monastic virtue which is painful to the individual and useless to mankind Their charitable exhortations betrayed a secret wish that the clergy might be permitted to manage the wealth of the faithful for the benefit of the poor The most sublime representations of the attributes and laws of the Deity were sullied by an idle mixture of metaphysical subleties puerile rites and fictitious miracles and they expatiated with the most fervent zeal on the religious merit of hating the adversaries and obeying the ministers of the church When the public peace was distracted by heresy and schism the sacred orators sounded the trumpet of discord and perhaps of sedition The understandings of their congregations were perplexed by mystery their passions were inflamed by invectives and they rushed from the Christian temples of Antioch or Alexandria prepared either to suffer or to inflict martyrdom The corruption of taste and language is strongly marked in the vehement declamations of the Latin bishops but the compositions of Gregory and Chrysostom have been compared with the most splendid models of Attic or at least of Asiatic eloquence one hundred twenty four Footnote one hundred twenty two See Thomassin Discipline de l Eglise tom ii l iii c eighty three p seventeen sixty one

they endeavored to acquire the arts of eloquence VII The representatives of the Christian republic were regularly assembled in the spring and autumn of each year and these synods diffused the spirit of ecclesiastical discipline and legislation through the hundred and twenty provinces of the Roman world one hundred twenty five The archbishop or metropolitan was empowered by the laws to summon the suffragan bishops of his province to revise their conduct to vindicate their rights to declare their faith and to examine the merits of the candidates who were elected by the clergy and people to supply the vacancies of the episcopal college The primates of Rome Alexandria Antioch Carthage and afterwards Constantinople who exercised a more ample jurisdiction convened the numerous assembly of their dependent bishops But the convocation of great and extraordinary synods was the prerogative of the emperor alone Whenever the emergencies of the church required this decisive measure he despatched a peremptory summons to the bishops or the deputies of each province with an order for the use of post horses and a competent allowance for the expenses of their journey At an early period when Constantine was the protector rather than the proselyte of Christianity he referred the African controversy to the council of Arles in which the bishops of York of Treves of Milan and of Carthage met as friends and brethren to debate in their native tongue on the common interest of the Latin or Western church one hundred twenty six Eleven years afterwards a more numerous and celebrated assembly was convened at Nice in Bithynia to extinguish by their final sentence the subtle disputes which had arisen in Egypt on the subject of the Trinity Three hundred and eighteen bishops obeyed the summons of their indulgent master the ecclesiastics of every rank and sect and denomination have been computed at two thousand and forty eight persons one hundred twenty seven the Greeks appeared in person and the consent of the Latins was expressed by the legates of the Roman pontiff The session which lasted about two months was frequently honored by the presence of the emperor Leaving his guards at the door he seated himself with the permission of the council on a low stool in the midst of the hall Constantine listened with patience and spoke with modesty and while he influenced the debates he humbly professed that he was the minister not the judge of the successors of the apostles who had been established as priests and as gods upon earth one hundred twenty eight Such profound reverence of an absolute monarch towards a feeble and unarmed assembly of his own subjects can only be compared to the respect with which the senate had been treated by the Roman princes who adopted the policy of Augustus Within the space of fifty years a philosophic spectator of the vicissitudes of human affairs might have contemplated Tacitus in the senate of Rome and Constantine in the council of Nice The fathers of the Capitol and those of the church had alike degenerated from the virtues of their founders but as the bishops were more deeply rooted in the public opinion they sustained their dignity with more decent pride and sometimes opposed with a manly spirit the wishes of their sovereign The progress of time and superstition erased the memory of the weakness the passion the

Donatists The Arian Controversy Athanasius Distracted State Of The Church And Empire Under Constantine And His Sons Toleration Of Paganism The grateful applause of the clergy has consecrated the memory of a prince who indulged their passions and promoted their interest Constantine gave them security wealth honors and revenge and the support of the orthodox faith was considered as the most sacred and important duty of the civil magistrate The edict of Milan the great charter of toleration had confirmed to each individual of the Roman world the privilege of choosing and professing his own religion But this inestimable privilege was soon violated with the knowledge of truth the emperor imbibed the maxims of persecution and the sects which dissented from the Catholic church were afflicted and oppressed by the triumph of Christianity Constantine easily believed that the Heretics who presumed to dispute his opinions or to oppose his commands were guilty of the most absurd and criminal obstinacy and that a seasonable application of moderate severities might save those unhappy men from the danger of an everlasting condemnation Not a moment was lost in excluding the ministers and teachers of the separated congregations from any share of the rewards and immunities which the emperor had so liberally bestowed on the orthodox clergy But as the sectaries might still exist under the cloud of royal disgrace the conquest of the East was immediately followed by an edict which announced their total destruction one After a preamble filled with passion and reproach Constantine absolutely prohibits the assemblies of the Heretics and confiscates their public property to the use either of the revenue or of the Catholic church The sects against whom the Imperial severity was directed appear to have been the adherents of Paul of Samosata the Montanists of Phrygia who maintained an enthusiastic succession of prophecy the Novatians who sternly rejected the temporal efficacy of repentance the Marcionites and Valentinians under whose leading banners the various Gnostics of Asia and Egypt had insensibly rallied and perhaps the Manichaeans who had recently imported from Persia a more artful composition of Oriental and Christian theology two The design of extirpating the name or at least of restraining the progress of these odious Heretics was prosecuted with vigor and effect Some of the penal regulations were copied from the edicts of Diocletian and this method of conversion was applauded by the same bishops who had felt the hand of oppression and pleaded for the rights of humanity Two immaterial circumstances may serve however to prove that the mind of Constantine was not entirely corrupted by the spirit of zeal and bigotry Before he condemned the Manichaeans and their kindred sects he resolved to make an accurate inquiry into the nature of their religious principles As if he distrusted the impartiality of his ecclesiastical counsellors this delicate commission was intrusted to a civil magistrate whose learning and moderation he justly esteemed and of whose venal character he was probably ignorant three The emperor was soon convinced that he had too hastily proscribed the orthodox faith and the exemplary morals of the Novatians who had dissented from the church in some articles of discipline which were not perhaps essential to salvation By a particular edict he exempted them from the general penalties of the law four allowed them to build a church at Constantinople respected the miracles of their saints invited their bishop Acesius to the council of Nice and gently ridiculed the narrow tenets of his sect by a familiar jest which from the mouth of a sovereign must have been received with applause and gratitude five

have been suspected but I think without reason of an attachment to the Novatian doctrine The emperor said to the bishop Acesius take a ladder and get up to heaven by yourself Most of the Christian sects have by turns borrowed the ladder of Acesius The complaints and mutual accusations which assailed the throne of Constantine as soon as the death of Maxentius had submitted Africa to his victorious arms were ill adapted to edify an imperfect proselyte He learned with surprise that the provinces of that great country from the confines of Cyrene to the columns of Hercules were distracted with religious discord six The source of the division was derived from a double election in the church of Carthage the second in rank and opulence of the ecclesiastical thrones of the West Caecilian and Majorinus were the two rival prelates of Africa and the death of the latter soon made room for Donatus who by his superior abilities and apparent virtues was the firmest support of his party The advantage which Caecilian might claim from the priority of his ordination was destroyed by the illegal or at least indecent haste with which it had been performed without expecting the arrival of the bishops of Numidia The authority of these bishops who to the number of seventy condemned Caecilian and consecrated Majorinus is again weakened by the infamy of some of their personal characters and by the female intrigues sacrilegious bargains and tumultuous proceedings which are imputed to this Numidian council seven The bishops of the contending factions maintained with equal ardor and obstinacy that their adversaries were degraded or at least dishonored by the odious crime of delivering the Holy Scriptures to the officers of Diocletian From their mutual reproaches as well as from the story of this dark transaction it may justly be inferred that the late persecution had imbittered the zeal without reforming the manners of the African Christians That divided church was incapable of affording an impartial judicature the controversy was solemnly tried in five successive tribunals which were appointed by the emperor and the whole proceeding from the first appeal to the final sentence lasted above three years A severe inquisition which was taken by the Praetorian vicar and the proconsul of Africa the report of two episcopal visitors who had been sent to Carthage the decrees of the councils of Rome and of Arles and the supreme judgment of Constantine himself in his sacred consistory were all favorable to the cause of Caecilian and he was unanimously acknowledged by the civil and ecclesiastical powers as the true and lawful primate of Africa The honors and estates of the church were attributed to his suffragan bishops and it was not without difficulty that Constantine was satisfied with inflicting the punishment of exile on the principal leaders of the Donatist faction As their cause was examined with attention perhaps it was determined with justice Perhaps their complaint was not without foundation that the credulity of the emperor had been abused by the insidious arts of his favorite Osius The influence of falsehood and corruption might procure the condemnation of the innocent or aggravate the sentence of the guilty Such an act however of injustice if it concluded an importunate dispute might be numbered among the transient evils of a despotic administration which are neither felt nor remembered by posterity Footnote six The best materials for this part of ecclesiastical history may be found in the edition of Optatus Milevitanus published Paris seventeen hundred by M Dupin who has enriched it with critical notes geographical discussions original records and an accurate abridgment of the whole controversy M de Tillemont has bestowed on the Donatists the greatest part of a volume tom vi part i and I am indebted to him for an ample collection of all the passages of his favorite saint Augustin which relate to those heretics

Optat l i c nineteen But this incident so inconsiderable that it scarcely deserves a place in history was productive of a memorable schism which afflicted the provinces of Africa above three hundred years and was extinguished only with Christianity itself The inflexible zeal of freedom and fanaticism animated the Donatists to refuse obedience to the usurpers whose election they disputed and whose spiritual powers they denied Excluded from the civil and religious communion of mankind they boldly excommunicated the rest of mankind who had embraced the impious party of Caecilian and of the Traditors from which he derived his pretended ordination They asserted with confidence and almost with exultation that the Apostolical succession was interrupted that all the bishops of Europe and Asia were infected by the contagion of guilt and schism and that the prerogatives of the Catholic church were confined to the chosen portion of the African believers who alone had preserved inviolate the integrity of their faith and discipline This rigid theory was supported by the most uncharitable conduct Whenever they acquired a proselyte even from the distant provinces of the East they carefully repeated the sacred rites of baptism eight and ordination as they rejected the validity of those which he had already received from the hands of heretics or schismatics Bishops virgins and even spotless infants were subjected to the disgrace of a public penance before they could be admitted to the communion of the Donatists If they obtained possession of a church which had been used by their Catholic adversaries they purified the unhallowed building with the same zealous care which a temple of idols might have required They washed the pavement scraped the walls burnt the altar which was commonly of wood melted the consecrated plate and cast the Holy Eucharist to the dogs with every circumstance of ignominy which could provoke and perpetuate the animosity of religious factions nine Notwithstanding this irreconcilable aversion the two parties who were mixed and separated in all the cities of Africa had the same language and manners the same zeal and learning the same faith and worship Proscribed by the civil and ecclesiastical powers of the empire the Donatists still maintained in some provinces particularly in Numidia their superior numbers and four hundred bishops acknowledged the jurisdiction of their primate But the invincible spirit of the sect sometimes preyed on its own vitals and the bosom of their schismatical church was torn by intestine divisions A fourth part of the Donatist bishops followed the independent standard of the Maximianists The narrow and solitary path which their first leaders had marked out continued to deviate from the great society of mankind Even the imperceptible sect of the Rogatians could affirm without a blush that when Christ should descend to judge the earth he would find his true religion preserved only in a few nameless villages of the Caesarean Mauritania ten Footnote eight The councils of Arles of Nice and of Trent confirmed the wise and moderate practice of the church of Rome The Donatists however had the advantage of maintaining the sentiment of Cyprian and of a considerable part of the primitive church Vincentius Lirinesis p five hundred thirty two ap Tillemont Mem Eccles tom vi p one hundred thirty

The schism of the Donatists was confined to Africa the more diffusive mischief of the Trinitarian controversy successively penetrated into every part of the Christian world The former was an accidental quarrel occasioned by the abuse of freedom the latter was a high and mysterious argument derived from the abuse of philosophy From the age of Constantine to that of Clovis and Theodoric the temporal interests both of the Romans and Barbarians were deeply involved in the theological disputes of Arianism The historian may therefore be permitted respectfully to withdraw the veil of the sanctuary and to deduce the progress of reason and faith of error and passion from the school of Plato to the decline and fall of the empire The genius of Plato informed by his own meditation or by the traditional knowledge of the priests of Egypt eleven had ventured to explore the mysterious nature of the Deity When he had elevated his mind to the sublime contemplation of the first self existent necessary cause of the universe the Athenian sage was incapable of conceiving how the simple unity of his essence could admit the infinite variety of distinct and successive ideas which compose the model of the intellectual world how a Being purely incorporeal could execute that perfect model and mould with a plastic hand the rude and independent chaos The vain hope of extricating himself from these difficulties which must ever oppress the feeble powers of the human mind might induce Plato to consider the divine nature under the threefold modification of the first cause the reason or Logos and the soul or spirit of the universe His poetical imagination sometimes fixed and animated these metaphysical abstractions the three archical on original principles were represented in the Platonic system as three Gods united with each other by a mysterious and ineffable generation and the Logos was particularly considered under the more accessible character of the Son of an Eternal Father and the Creator and Governor of the world Such appear to have been the secret doctrines which were cautiously whispered in the gardens of the academy and which according to the more recent disciples of Plato elevena could not be perfectly understood till after an assiduous study of thirty years twelve Footnote eleven Plato Aegyptum peragravit ut a sacerdotibus Barbaris numeros et coelestia acciperet Cicero de Finibus v twenty five The Egyptians might still preserve the traditional creed of the Patriarchs Josephus has persuaded many of the Christian fathers that Plato derived a part of his knowledge from the Jews but this vain opinion cannot be reconciled with the obscure state and unsocial manners of the Jewish people whose scriptures were not accessible to Greek curiosity till more than one hundred years after the death of Plato See Marsham Canon Chron p one hundred forty four Le Clerc Epistol Critic vii p one hundred seventy seven one hundred ninety four Footnote elevena This exposition of the doctrine of Plato appears to me contrary to the true sense of that philosopher s writings The brilliant imagination which he carried into metaphysical inquiries his style full of allegories and figures have misled those interpreters who did not seek from the whole tenor of his works and beyond the images which the writer employs the system of this philosopher In my opinion there is no Trinity in Plato he has established no mysterious generation between the three pretended principles which he is made to distinguish Finally he conceives only as attributes of the Deity or of matter those ideas of which it is supposed that he made substances real beings According to Plato God and matter existed from all eternity Before the creation of the world matter had in itself a principle of motion but without end or laws it is this principle which Plato calls the irrational soul of the world because according to his doctrine every spontaneous and original principle of motion is called soul God wished to impress form upon matter that is to say one To mould matter and make it into a body two To regulate its motion and subject it to some end and to certain laws The Deity in this operation could not act but according to the ideas existing in his intelligence their union filled this and formed the ideal type of the world It is this ideal world this divine intelligence existing with God from all eternity and called by Plato which he is supposed to personify to substantialize while an attentive examination is sufficient to convince us that he has never assigned it an existence external to the Deity hors de la Divinite and that he considered the as the aggregate of the ideas of God the divine understanding in its relation to the world The contrary opinion is irreconcilable with all his philosophy thus he says that to the idea of the Deity is essentially united that of intelligence of a logos He would thus have admitted a double logos one inherent in the Deity as an attribute the other independently existing as a substance He affirms that the intelligence the principle of order cannot exist but as an attribute of a soul the principle of motion and of life of which the nature is unknown to us How then according to this could he consider the logos as a substance endowed with an independent existence In other places he explains it by these two words knowledge science which signify the attributes of the Deity When Plato separates God the ideal archetype of the world and matter it is to explain how according to his system God has proceeded at the creation to unite the principle of order which he had within himself his proper intelligence the principle of motion to the principle of motion the irrational soul which was in matter When he speaks of the place occupied by the ideal world it is to designate the divine intelligence which is its cause Finally in no part of his writings do we find a true personification of the pretended beings of which he is said to have formed a trinity and if this personification existed it would equally apply to many other notions of which might be formed many different trinities This error into which many ancient as well as modern interpreters of Plato have fallen was very natural Besides the snares which were concealed in his figurative style besides the necessity of comprehending as a whole the system of his ideas and not to explain isolated passages the nature of his doctrine itself would conduce to this error When Plato appeared the uncertainty of human knowledge and the continual illusions of the senses were acknowledged and had given rise to a general scepticism Socrates had aimed at raising morality above the influence of this scepticism Plato endeavored to save metaphysics by seeking in the human intellect a source of certainty which the senses could not furnish He invented the system of innate ideas of which the aggregate formed according to him the ideal world and affirmed that these ideas were real attributes not only attached to our conceptions of objects but to the nature of the objects themselves a nature of which from them we might obtain a knowledge He gave then to these ideas a positive existence as attributes his commentators could easily give them a real existence as substances especially as the terms which he used to designate them essential beauty essential goodness lent themselves to this substantialization hypostasis G We have retained this view of the original philosophy of Plato in which there is probably much truth The genius of Plato was rather metaphysical than impersonative his poetry was in his language rather than like that of the Orientals in his conceptions M Footnote twelve The modern guides who lead me to the knowledge of the Platonic system are Cudworth Basnage Le Clerc and Brucker As the learning of these writers was equal and their intention different an inquisitive observer may derive instruction from their disputes and certainty from their agreement The arms of the Macedonians diffused over Asia and Egypt the language and learning of Greece and the theological system of Plato was taught with less reserve and perhaps with some improvements in the celebrated school of Alexandria thirteen A numerous colony of Jews had been invited by the favor of the Ptolemies to settle in their new capital fourteen While the bulk of the nation practised the legal ceremonies and pursued the lucrative occupations of commerce a few Hebrews of a more liberal spirit devoted their lives to religious and philosophical contemplation fifteen They cultivated with diligence and embraced with ardor the theological system of the Athenian sage But their national pride would have been mortified by a fair confession of their former poverty and they boldly marked as the sacred inheritance of their ancestors the gold and jewels which they had so lately stolen from their Egyptian masters One hundred years before the birth of Christ a philosophical treatise which manifestly betrays the style and sentiments of the school of Plato was produced by the Alexandrian Jews and unanimously received as a genuine and valuable relic of the inspired Wisdom of Solomon sixteen A similar union of the Mosaic faith and the Grecian philosophy distinguishes the works of Philo which were composed for the most part under the reign of Augustus seventeen The material soul of the universe eighteen might offend the piety of the Hebrews but they applied the character of the Logos to the Jehovah of Moses and the patriarchs and the Son of God was introduced upon earth under a visible and even human appearance to perform those familiar offices which seem incompatible with the nature and attributes of the Universal Cause nineteen Footnote thirteen Brucker Hist Philosoph tom i p thirteen forty nine thirteen fifty seven The Alexandrian school is celebrated by Strabo l xvii and Ammianus xxii six Note The philosophy of Plato was not the only source of that professed in the school of Alexandria That city in which Greek Jewish and Egyptian men of letters were assembled was the scene of a strange fusion of the system of these three people The Greeks brought a Platonism already much changed the Jews who had acquired at Babylon a great number of Oriental notions and whose theological opinions had undergone great changes by this intercourse endeavored to reconcile Platonism with their new doctrine and disfigured it entirely lastly the Egyptians who were not willing to abandon notions for which the Greeks themselves entertained respect endeavored on their side to reconcile their own with those of their neighbors It is in Ecclesiasticus and the Wisdom of Solomon that we trace the influence of Oriental philosophy rather than that of Platonism We find in these books and in those of the later prophets as in Ezekiel notions unknown to the Jews before the Babylonian captivity of which we do not discover the germ in Plato but which are manifestly derived from the Orientals Thus God represented under the image of light and the principle of evil under that of darkness the history of the good and bad angels paradise and hell c are doctrines of which the origin or at least the positive determination can only be referred to the Oriental philosophy Plato supposed matter eternal the Orientals and the Jews considered it as a creation of God who alone was eternal It is impossible to explain the philosophy of the Alexandrian school solely by the blending of the Jewish theology with the Greek philosophy The Oriental philosophy however little it may be known is recognized at every instant Thus according to the Zend Avesta it is by the Word honover more ancient than the world that Ormuzd created the universe This word is the logos of Philo consequently very different from that of Plato I have shown that Plato never personified the logos as the ideal archetype of the world Philo ventured this personification The Deity according to him has a double logos the first is the ideal archetype of the world the ideal world the first born of the Deity the second is the word itself of God personified under the image of a being acting to create the sensible world and to make it like to the ideal world it is the second born of God Following out his imaginations Philo went so far as to personify anew the ideal world under the image of a celestial man the primitive type of man and the sensible world under the image of another man less perfect than the celestial man Certain notions of the Oriental philosophy may have given rise to this strange abuse of allegory which it is sufficient to relate to show what alterations Platonism had already undergone and what was their source Philo moreover of all the Jews of Alexandria is the one whose Platonism is the most pure It is from this mixture of Orientalism Platonism and Judaism that Gnosticism arose which had produced so many theological and philosophical extravagancies and in which Oriental notions evidently predominate G Footnote fourteen Joseph Antiquitat l xii c one three

mysterious doctrine which might please but could not satisfy a rational mind A prophet or apostle inspired by the Deity can alone exercise a lawful dominion over the faith of mankind and the theology of Plato might have been forever confounded with the philosophical visions of the Academy the Porch and the Lycaeum if the name and divine attributes of the Logos had not been confirmed by the celestial pen of the last and most sublime of the Evangelists twenty The Christian Revelation which was consummated under the reign of Nerva disclosed to the world the amazing secret that the Logos who was with God from the beginning and was God who had made all things and for whom all things had been made was incarnate in the person of Jesus of Nazareth who had been born of a virgin and suffered death on the cross Besides the genera design of fixing on a perpetual basis the divine honors of Christ the most ancient and respectable of the ecclesiastical writers have ascribed to the evangelic theologian a particular intention to confute two opposite heresies which disturbed the peace of the primitive church twenty one I The faith of the Ebionites twenty two perhaps of the Nazarenes twenty three was gross and imperfect They revered Jesus as the greatest of the prophets endowed with supernatural virtue and power They ascribed to his person and to his future reign all the predictions of the Hebrew oracles which relate to the spiritual and everlasting kingdom of the promised Messiah twenty four Some of them might confess that he was born of a virgin but they obstinately rejected the preceding existence and divine perfections of the Logos or Son of God which are so clearly defined in the Gospel of saint John About fifty years afterwards the Ebionites whose errors are mentioned by Justin Martyr with less severity than they seem to deserve twenty five formed a very inconsiderable portion of the Christian name II The Gnostics who were distinguished by the epithet of Docetes deviated into the contrary extreme and betrayed the human while they asserted the divine nature of Christ Educated in the school of Plato accustomed to the sublime idea of the Logos they readily conceived that the brightest Aeon or Emanation of the Deity might assume the outward shape and visible appearances of a mortal twenty six but they vainly pretended that the imperfections of matter are incompatible with the purity of a celestial substance While the blood of Christ yet smoked on Mount Calvary the Docetes invented the impious and extravagant hypothesis that instead of issuing from the womb of the Virgin twenty seven he had descended on the banks of the Jordan in the form of perfect manhood that he had imposed on the senses of his enemies and of his disciples and that the ministers of Pilate had wasted their impotent rage on an ury phantom who seemed to expire on the cross and after three days to rise from the dead twenty eight Footnote twenty The Platonists admired the beginning of the Gospel of saint John as containing an exact transcript of their own principles Augustin de Civitat Dei x twenty nine Amelius apud Cyril advers Julian l viii p two hundred eighty three But in the third and fourth centuries the Platonists of Alexandria might improve their Trinity by the secret study of the Christian theology Note A short discussion on the sense in which saint John has used the word Logos will prove that he has not borrowed it from the philosophy of Plato The evangelist adopts this word without previous explanation as a term with which his contemporaries were already familiar and which they could at once comprehend To know the sense which he gave to it we must inquire that which it generally bore in his time We find two the one attached to the word logos by the Jews of Palestine the other by the school of Alexandria particularly by Philo The Jews had feared at all times to pronounce the name of Jehovah they had formed a habit of designating God by one of his attributes they called him sometimes Wisdom sometimes the Word By the word of the Lord were the heavens made Psalm xxxiii six Accustomed to allegories they often addressed themselves to this attribute of the Deity as a real being Solomon makes Wisdom say The Lord possessed me in the beginning of his way before his works of old I was set up from everlasting from the beginning or ever the earth was Prov viii twenty two twenty three Their residence in Persia only increased this inclination to sustained allegories In the Ecclesiasticus of the son of Sirach and the Book of Wisdom we find allegorical descriptions of Wisdom like the following I came out of the mouth of the Most High I covered the earth as a cloud I alone compassed the circuit of heaven and walked in the bottom of the deep The Creator created me from the beginning before the world and I shall never fail Eccles xxiv thirty five thirty nine See also the Wisdom of Solomon c vii v nine The latter book is clearly Alexandrian M We see from this that the Jews understood from the Hebrew and Chaldaic words which signify Wisdom the Word and which were translated into Greek a simple attribute of the Deity allegorically personified but of which they did not make a real particular being separate from the Deity The school of Alexandria on the contrary and Philo among the rest mingling Greek with Jewish and Oriental notions and abandoning himself to his inclination to mysticism personified the logos and represented it a distinct being created by God and intermediate between God and man This is the second logos of Philo that which acts from the beginning of the world alone in its kind creator of the sensible world formed by God according to the ideal world which he had in himself and which was the first logos the first born of the Deity The logos taken in this sense then was a created being but anterior to the creation of the world near to God and charged with his revelations to mankind Which of these two senses is that which saint John intended to assign to the word logos in the first chapter of his Gospel and in all his writings saint John was a Jew born and educated in Palestine he had no knowledge at least very little of the philosophy of the Greeks and that of the Grecizing Jews he would naturally then attach to the word logos the sense attached to it by the Jews of Palestine If in fact we compare the attributes which he assigns to the logos with those which are assigned to it in Proverbs in the Wisdom of Solomon in Ecclesiasticus we shall see that they are the same The Word was in the world and the world was made by him in him was life and the life was the light of men c i v ten fourteen It is impossible not to trace in this chapter the ideas which the Jews had formed of the allegorized logos The evangelist afterwards really personifies that which his predecessors have personified only poetically for he affirms that the Word became flesh v fourteen It was to prove this that he wrote Closely examined the ideas which he gives of the logos cannot agree with those of Philo and the school of Alexandria they correspond on the contrary with those of the Jews of Palestine Perhaps saint John employing a well known term to explain a doctrine which was yet unknown has slightly altered the sense it is this alteration which we appear to discover on comparing different passages of his writings It is worthy of remark that the Jews of Palestine who did not perceive this alteration could find nothing extraordinary in what saint John said of the Logos at least they comprehended it without difficulty while the Greeks and Grecizing Jews on their part brought to it prejudices and preconceptions easily reconciled with those of the evangelist who did not expressly contradict them This circumstance must have much favored the progress of Christianity Thus the fathers of the church in the two first centuries and later formed almost all in the school of Alexandria gave to the Logos of saint John a sense nearly similar to that which it received from Philo Their doctrine approached very near to that which in the fourth century the council of Nice condemned in the person of Arius G M Guizot has forgotten the long residence of saint John at Ephesus the centre of the mingling opinions of the East and West which were gradually growing up into Gnosticism See Matter Hist du Gnosticisme vol i p one hundred fifty four saint John s sense of the Logos seems as far removed from the simple allegory ascribed to the Palestinian Jews as from the Oriental impersonation of the Alexandrian The simple truth may be that saint John took the familiar term and as it were infused into it the peculiar and Christian sense in which it is used in his writings M Footnote twenty one See Beausobre Hist Critique du Manicheisme tom i p three hundred seventy seven The Gospel according to saint John is supposed to have been published about seventy years

they were unwilling to admit that one of the pure substances one of the aeons which came forth from God had by partaking in the material nature allied himself to the principle of evil and this was

Apost c five seven G The divine sanction which the Apostle had bestowed on the fundamental principle of the theology of Plato encouraged the learned proselytes of the second and third centuries to admire and study the writings of the Athenian sage who had thus marvellously anticipated one of the most surprising discoveries of the Christian revelation The respectable name of Plato was used by the orthodox twenty nine and abused by the heretics thirty as the common support of truth and error the authority of his skilful commentators and the science of dialectics were employed to justify the remote consequences of his opinions and to supply the discreet silence of the inspired writers The same subtle and profound questions concerning the nature the generation the distinction and the equality of the three divine persons of the mysterious Triad or Trinity thirty one were agitated in the philosophical and in the Christian schools of Alexandria An eager spirit of curiosity urged them to explore the secrets of the abyss and the pride of the professors and of their disciples was satisfied with the sciences of words But the most sagacious of the Christian theologians the great Athanasius himself has candidly confessed thirty two that whenever he forced his understanding to meditate on the divinity of the Logos his toilsome and unavailing efforts recoiled on themselves that the more he thought the less he comprehended and the more he wrote the less capable was he of expressing his thoughts In every step of the inquiry we are compelled to feel and acknowledge the immeasurable disproportion between the size of the object and the capacity of the human mind We may strive to abstract the notions of time of space and of matter which so closely adhere to all the perceptions of our experimental knowledge But as soon as we presume to reason of infinite substance of spiritual generation as often as we deduce any positive conclusions from a negative idea we are involved in darkness perplexity and inevitable contradiction As these difficulties arise from the nature of the subject they oppress with the same insuperable weight the philosophic and the theological disputant but we may observe two essential and peculiar circumstances which discriminated the doctrines of the Catholic church from the opinions of the Platonic school Footnote twenty nine

Footnote thirty one If Theophilus bishop of Antioch see Dupin Bibliotheque Ecclesiastique tom i p sixty six was the first who employed the word Triad Trinity that abstract term which was already familiar to the schools of philosophy must have been introduced into the theology of the Christians after the middle of the second century Footnote thirty two Athanasius tom i p eight hundred eight His expressions have an uncommon energy and as he was writing to monks there could not be any occasion for him to affect a rational language I A chosen society of philosophers men of a liberal education and curious disposition might silently meditate and temperately discuss in the gardens of Athens or the library of Alexandria the abstruse questions of metaphysical science The lofty speculations which neither convinced the understanding nor agitated the passions of the Platonists themselves were carelessly overlooked by the idle the busy and even the studious part of mankind thirty three But after the Logos had been revealed as the sacred object of the faith the hope and the religious worship of the Christians the mysterious system was embraced by a numerous and increasing multitude in every province of the Roman world Those persons who from their age or sex or occupations were the least qualified to judge who were the least exercised in the habits of abstract reasoning aspired to contemplate the economy of the Divine Nature and it is the boast of Tertullian thirty four that a Christian mechanic could readily answer such questions as had perplexed the wisest of the Grecian sages Where the subject lies so far beyond our reach the difference between the highest and the lowest of human understandings may indeed be calculated as infinitely small yet the degree of weakness may perhaps be measured by the degree of obstinacy and dogmatic confidence These speculations instead of being treated as the amusement of a vacant hour became the most serious business of the present and the most useful preparation for a future life A theology which it was incumbent to believe which it was impious to doubt and which it might be dangerous and even fatal to mistake became the familiar topic of private meditation and popular discourse The cold indifference of philosophy was inflamed by the fervent spirit of devotion and even the metaphors of common language suggested the fallacious prejudices of sense and experience The Christians who abhorred the gross and impure generation of the Greek mythology thirty five were tempted to argue from the familiar analogy of the filial and paternal relations The character of Son seemed to imply a perpetual subordination to the voluntary author of his existence thirty six but as the act of generation in the most spiritual and abstracted sense must be supposed to transmit the properties of a common nature thirty seven they durst not presume to circumscribe the powers or the duration of the Son of an eternal and omnipotent Father Fourscore years after the death of Christ the Christians of Bithynia declared before the tribunal of Pliny that they invoked him as a god and his divine honors have been perpetuated in every age and country by the various sects who assume the name of his disciples thirty eight Their tender reverence for the memory of Christ and their horror for the profane worship of any created being would have engaged them to assert the equal and absolute divinity of the Logos if their rapid ascent towards the throne of heaven had not been imperceptibly checked by the apprehension of violating the unity and sole supremacy of the great Father of Christ and of the Universe The suspense and fluctuation produced in the minds of the Christians by these opposite tendencies may be observed in the writings of the theologians who flourished after the end of the apostolic age and before the origin of the Arian controversy Their suffrage is claimed with equal confidence by the orthodox and by the heretical parties and the most inquisitive critics have fairly allowed that if they had the good fortune of possessing the Catholic verity they have delivered their conceptions in loose inaccurate and sometimes contradictory language thirty nine Footnote thirty three In a treatise which professed to explain the opinions of the ancient philosophers concerning the nature of the gods we might expect to discover the theological Trinity of Plato But Cicero very honestly confessed that although he had translated the Timaeus he could never understand

Burton s work on the doctrine of the Ante Nicene fathers must be consulted by those who wish to obtain clear notions on this subject M Chapter XXI Persecution Of Heresy State Of The Church Part III II The devotion of individuals was the first circumstance which distinguished the Christians from the Platonists the second was the authority of the church The disciples of philosophy asserted the rights of intellectual freedom and their respect for the sentiments of their teachers was a liberal and voluntary tribute which they offered to superior reason But the Christians formed a numerous and disciplined society and the jurisdiction of their laws and magistrates was strictly exercised over the minds of the faithful The loose wanderings of the imagination were gradually confined by creeds and confessions forty the freedom of private judgment submitted to the public wisdom of synods the authority of a theologian was determined by his ecclesiastical rank and the episcopal successors of the apostles inflicted the censures of the church on those who deviated from the orthodox belief But in an age of religious controversy every act of oppression adds new force to the elastic vigor of the mind and the zeal or obstinacy of a spiritual rebel was sometimes stimulated by secret motives of ambition or avarice A metaphysical argument became the cause or pretence of political contests the subtleties of the Platonic school were used as the badges of popular factions and the distance which separated their respective tenets were enlarged or magnified by the acrimony of dispute As long as the dark heresies of Praxeas and Sabellius labored to confound the Father with the Son forty one the orthodox party might be excused if they adhered more strictly and more earnestly to the distinction than to the equality of the divine persons But as soon as the heat of controversy had subsided and the progress of the Sabellians was no longer an object of terror to the churches of Rome of Africa or of Egypt the tide of theological opinion began to flow with a gentle but steady motion towards the contrary extreme and the most orthodox doctors allowed themselves the use of the terms and definitions which had been censured in the mouth of the sectaries forty two After the edict of toleration had restored peace and leisure to the Christians the Trinitarian controversy was revived in the ancient seat of Platonism the learned the opulent the tumultuous city of Alexandria and the flame of religious discord was rapidly communicated from the schools to the clergy the people the province and the East The abstruse question of the eternity of the Logos was agitated in ecclesiastic conferences and popular sermons and the heterodox opinions of Arius forty three were soon made public by his own zeal and by that of his adversaries His most implacable adversaries have acknowledged the learning and blameless life of that eminent presbyter who in a former election had declared and perhaps generously declined his pretensions to the episcopal throne forty four His competitor Alexander assumed the office of his judge The important cause was argued before him and if at first he seemed to hesitate he at length pronounced his final sentence as an absolute rule of faith forty five The undaunted presbyter who presumed to resist the authority of his angry bishop was separated from the community of the church But the pride of Arius was supported by the applause of a numerous party He reckoned among his immediate followers two bishops of Egypt seven presbyters twelve deacons and what may appear almost incredible seven hundred virgins A large majority of the bishops of Asia appeared to support or favor his cause and their measures were conducted by Eusebius of Caesarea the most learned of the Christian prelates and by Eusebius of Nicomedia who had acquired the reputation of a statesman without forfeiting that of a saint Synods in Palestine and Bithynia were opposed to the synods of Egypt The attention of the prince and people was attracted by this theological dispute and the decision at the end of six years forty six was referred to the supreme authority of the general council of Nice Footnote forty The most ancient creeds were drawn up with the greatest latitude See Bull Judicium Eccles Cathol who tries to prevent Episcopius from deriving any advantage from this observation Footnote forty one The heresies of Praxeas Sabellius c are accurately explained by Mosheim p four hundred twenty five six hundred eighty seven hundred fourteen Praxeas who came to Rome about the end of the second century deceived for some time the simplicity of the bishop and was confuted by the pen of the angry Tertullian Footnote forty two Socrates acknowledges that the heresy of Arius proceeded from his strong desire to embrace an opinion the most diametrically opposite to that of Sabellius Footnote forty three The figure and manners of Arius the character and numbers of his first proselytes are painted in very lively colors by Epiphanius tom i Haeres lxix three p seven hundred twenty nine and we cannot but regret that he should soon forget the historian to assume the task of controversy Footnote forty four See Philostorgius l i c three and Godefroy s ample Commentary Yet the credibility of Philostorgius is lessened in the eyes of the orthodox by his Arianism and in those of rational critics by his passion his prejudice and his ignorance Footnote forty five Sozomen l i c fifteen represents Alexander as indifferent and even ignorant in the beginning of the controversy while Socrates l i c five ascribes the origin of the dispute to the vain curiosity of his theological speculations doctor Jortin Remarks on Ecclesiastical History vol ii p one hundred seventy eight has censured with his usual freedom the conduct of Alexander Footnote forty six The flames of Arianism might burn for some time in secret but there is reason to believe that they burst out with violence as early as the year three hundred nineteen Tillemont Mem Eccles tom vi p seven hundred seventy four seven hundred eighty When the mysteries of the Christian faith were dangerously exposed to public debate it might be observed that the human understanding was capable of forming three district though imperfect systems concerning the nature of the Divine Trinity and it was pronounced that none of these systems in a pure and absolute sense were exempt from heresy and error forty seven I According to the first hypothesis which was maintained by Arius and his disciples the Logos was a dependent and spontaneous production created from nothing by the will of the father The Son by whom all things were made forty eight had been begotten before all worlds and the longest of the astronomical periods could be compared only as a fleeting moment to the extent of his duration yet this duration was not infinite forty nine and there had been a time which preceded the ineffable generation of the Logos On this only begotten Son the Almighty Father had transfused his ample spirit and impressed the effulgence of his glory Visible image of invisible perfection he saw at an immeasurable distance beneath his feet the thrones of the brightest archangels yet he shone only with a reflected light and like the sons of the Romans emperors who were invested with the titles of Caesar or Augustus fifty he governed the universe in obedience to the will of his Father and Monarch II In the second hypothesis the Logos possessed all the inherent incommunicable perfections which religion and philosophy appropriate to the Supreme God Three distinct and infinite minds or substances three coequal and coeternal beings composed the Divine Essence fifty one and it would have implied contradiction that any of them should not have existed or that they should ever cease to exist fifty two The advocates of a system which seemed to establish three independent Deities attempted to preserve the unity of the First Cause so conspicuous in the design and order of the world by the perpetual concord of their administration and the essential agreement of their will A faint resemblance of this unity of action may be discovered in the societies of men and even of animals The causes which disturb their harmony proceed only from the imperfection and inequality of their faculties but the omnipotence which is guided by infinite wisdom and goodness cannot fail of choosing the same means for the accomplishment of the same ends III Three beings who by the self derived necessity of their existence possess all the divine attributes in the most perfect degree who are eternal in duration infinite in space and intimately present to each other and to the whole universe irresistibly force themselves on the astonished mind as one and the same being fifty three who in the economy of grace as well as in that of nature may manifest himself under different forms and be considered under different aspects By this hypothesis a real substantial trinity is refined into a trinity of names and abstract modifications that subsist only in the mind which conceives them The Logos is no longer a person but an attribute and it is only in a figurative sense that the epithet of Son can be applied to the eternal reason which was with God from the beginning and by which not by whom all things were made The incarnation of the Logos is reduced to a mere inspiration of the Divine Wisdom which filled the soul and directed all the actions of the man Jesus Thus after revolving around the theological circle we are surprised to find that the Sabellian ends where the Ebionite had begun and that the incomprehensible mystery which excites our adoration eludes our inquiry fifty four Footnote forty seven Quid credidit Certe aut tria nomina audiens tres Deos esse credidit et idololatra effectus est aut in tribus vocabulis trinominem credens Deum in Sabellii haeresim incurrit

hundred eighty one and Beausobre tom i l iii c six p five hundred thirty three If the bishops of the council of Nice fifty five had been permitted to follow the unbiased dictates of their conscience Arius and his associates could scarcely have flattered themselves with the hopes of obtaining a majority of votes in favor of an hypothesis so directly averse to the two most popular opinions of the Catholic world The Arians soon perceived the danger of their situation and prudently assumed those modest virtues which in the fury of civil and religious dissensions are seldom practised or even praised except by the weaker party They recommended the exercise of Christian charity and moderation urged the incomprehensible nature of the controversy disclaimed the use of any terms or definitions which could not be found in the Scriptures and offered by very liberal concessions to satisfy their adversaries without renouncing the integrity of their own principles The victorious faction received all their proposals with haughty suspicion and anxiously sought for some irreconcilable mark of distinction the rejection of which might involve the Arians in the guilt and consequences of heresy A letter was publicly read and ignominiously torn in which their patron Eusebius of Nicomedia ingenuously confessed that the admission of the Homoousion or Consubstantial a word already familiar to the Platonists was incompatible with the principles of their theological system The fortunate opportunity was eagerly embraced by the bishops who governed the resolutions of the synod and according to the lively expression of Ambrose fifty six they used the sword which heresy itself had drawn from the scabbard to cut off the head of the hated monster The consubstantiality of the Father and the Son was established by the council of Nice and has been unanimously received as a fundamental article of the Christian faith by the consent of the Greek the Latin the Oriental and the Protestant churches But if the same word had not served to stigmatize the heretics and to unite the Catholics it would have been inadequate to the purpose of the majority by whom it was introduced into the orthodox creed This majority was divided into two parties distinguished by a contrary tendency to the sentiments of the Tritheists and of the Sabellians But as those opposite extremes seemed to overthrow the foundations either of natural or revealed religion they mutually agreed to qualify the rigor of their principles and to disavow the just but invidious consequences which might be urged by their antagonists The interest of the common cause inclined them to join their numbers and to conceal their differences their animosity was softened by the healing counsels of toleration and their disputes were suspended by the use of the mysterious Homoousion which either party was free to interpret according to their peculiar tenets The Sabellian sense which about fifty years before had obliged the council of Antioch fifty seven to prohibit this celebrated term had endeared it to those theologians who entertained a secret but partial affection for a nominal Trinity But the more fashionable saints of the Arian times the intrepid Athanasius the learned Gregory Nazianzen and the other pillars of the church who supported with ability and success the Nicene doctrine appeared to consider the expression of substance as if it had been synonymous with that of nature and they ventured to illustrate their meaning by affirming that three men as they belong to the same common species are consubstantial or homoousian to each other fifty eight This pure and distinct equality was tempered on the one hand by the internal connection and spiritual penetration which indissolubly unites the divine persons fifty nine and on the other by the preeminence of the Father which was acknowledged as far as it is compatible with the independence of the Son sixty Within these limits the almost invisible and tremulous ball of orthodoxy was allowed securely to vibrate On either side beyond this consecrated ground the heretics and the daemons lurked in ambush to surprise and devour the unhappy wanderer But as the degrees of theological hatred depend on the spirit of the war rather than on the importance of the controversy the heretics who degraded were treated with more severity than those who annihilated the person of the Son The life of Athanasius was consumed in irreconcilable opposition to the impious madness of the Arians sixty one but he defended above twenty years the Sabellianism of Marcellus of Ancyra and when at last he was compelled to withdraw himself from his communion he continued to mention with an ambiguous smile the venial errors of his respectable friend

which in the course of a few years erected eighteen different models of religion sixty three and avenged the violated dignity of the church The zealous Hilary sixty four who from the peculiar hardships of his situation was inclined to extenuate rather than to aggravate the errors of the Oriental clergy declares that in the wide extent of the ten provinces of Asia to which he had been banished there could be found very few prelates who had preserved the knowledge of the true God sixty five The oppression which he had felt the disorders of which he was the spectator and the victim appeased during a short interval the angry passions of his soul and in the following passage of which I shall transcribe a few lines the bishop of Poitiers unwarily deviates into the style of a Christian philosopher It is a thing says Hilary equally deplorable and dangerous that there are as many creeds as opinions among men as many doctrines as inclinations and as many sources of blasphemy as there are faults among us because we make creeds arbitrarily and explain them as arbitrarily The Homoousion is rejected and received and explained away by successive synods The partial or total resemblance of the Father and of the Son is a subject of dispute for these unhappy times Every year nay every moon we make new creeds to describe invisible mysteries We repent of what we have done we defend those who repent we anathematize those whom we defended We condemn either the doctrine of others in ourselves or our own in that of others and reciprocally tearing one another to pieces we have been the cause of each other s ruin sixty six Footnote sixty three Athanasius in his epistle concerning the Synods of Seleucia and Rimini tom i p eight hundred eighty six nine hundred five has given

twenty eight This remarkable passage deserved the attention of mister Locke who has transcribed it vol iii p four hundred seventy into the model of his new common place book It will not be expected it would not perhaps be endured that I should swell this theological digression by a minute examination of the eighteen creeds the authors of which for the most part disclaimed the odious name of their parent Arius It is amusing enough to delineate the form and to trace the vegetation of a singular plant but the tedious detail of leaves without flowers and of branches without fruit would soon exhaust the patience and disappoint the curiosity of the laborious student One question which gradually arose from the Arian controversy may however be noticed as it served to produce and discriminate the three sects who were united only by their common aversion to the Homoousion of the Nicene synod one If they were asked whether the Son was like unto the Father the question was resolutely answered in the negative by the heretics who adhered to the principles of Arius or indeed to those of philosophy which seem to establish an infinite difference between the Creator and the most excellent of his creatures This obvious consequence was maintained by Aetius sixty seven on whom the zeal of his adversaries bestowed the surname of the Atheist His restless and aspiring spirit urged him to try almost every profession of human life He was successively a slave or at least a husbandman a travelling tinker a goldsmith a physician a schoolmaster a theologian and at last the apostle of a new church which was propagated by the abilities of his disciple Eunomius sixty eight Armed with texts of Scripture and with captious syllogisms from the logic of Aristotle the subtle Aetius had acquired the fame of an invincible disputant whom it was impossible either to silence or to convince Such talents engaged the friendship of the Arian bishops till they were forced to renounce and even to persecute a dangerous ally who by the accuracy of his reasoning had prejudiced their cause in the popular opinion and offended the piety of their most devoted followers two The omnipotence of the Creator suggested a specious and respectful solution of the likeness of the Father and the Son and faith might humbly receive what reason could not presume to deny that the Supreme God might communicate his infinite perfections and create a being similar only to himself sixty nine These Arians were powerfully supported by the weight and abilities of their leaders who had succeeded to the management of the Eusebian interest and who occupied the principal thrones of the East They detested perhaps with some affectation the impiety of Aetius they professed to believe either without reserve or according to the Scriptures that the Son was different from all other creatures and similar only to the Father But they denied the he was either of the same or of a similar substance sometimes boldly justifying their dissent and sometimes objecting to the use of the word substance which seems to imply an adequate or at least a distinct notion of the nature of the Deity three The sect which deserted the doctrine of a similar substance was the most numerous at least in the provinces of Asia and when the leaders of both parties were assembled in the council of Seleucia seventy their opinion would have prevailed by a majority of one hundred and five to forty three bishops The Greek word which was chosen to express this mysterious resemblance bears so close an affinity to the orthodox symbol that the profane of every age have derided the furious contests which the difference of a single diphthong excited between the Homoousians and the Homoiousians As it frequently happens that the sounds and characters which approach the nearest to each other accidentally represent the most opposite ideas the observation would be itself ridiculous if it were possible to mark any real and sensible distinction between the doctrine of the Semi Arians as they were improperly styled and that of the Catholics themselves The bishop of Poitiers who in his Phrygian exile very wisely aimed at a coalition of parties endeavors to prove that by a pious and faithful interpretation seventy one the Homoiousion may be reduced to a consubstantial sense Yet he confesses that the word has a dark and suspicious aspect and as if darkness were congenial to theological disputes the Semi Arians who advanced to the doors of the church assailed them with the most unrelenting fury Footnote sixty seven In Philostorgius l iii c fifteen the character and adventures of Aetius appear singular enough though they are carefully softened by the hand of a friend The editor Godefroy p one hundred fifty three who was more attached to his principles than to his author has collected the odious circumstances which his various adversaries have preserved or invented Footnote sixty eight According to the judgment of a man who respected both these sectaries Aetius had been endowed with a stronger understanding and Eunomius had acquired more art and learning Philostorgius l viii c eighteen The confession and

oh six See p eleven forty six Philostorgius who saw those objects through a different medium is inclined to forget the difference of the important diphthong See in particular viii seventeen and Godefroy p three hundred fifty two The provinces of Egypt and Asia which cultivated the language and manners of the Greeks had deeply imbibed the venom of the Arian controversy The familiar study of the Platonic system a vain and argumentative disposition a copious and flexible idiom supplied the clergy and people of the East with an inexhaustible flow of words and distinctions and in the midst of their fierce contentions they easily forgot the doubt which is recommended by philosophy and the submission which is enjoined by religion The inhabitants of the West were of a less inquisitive spirit their passions were not so forcibly moved by invisible objects their minds were less frequently exercised by the habits of dispute and such was the happy ignorance of the Gallican church that Hilary himself above thirty years after the first general council was still a stranger to the Nicene creed seventy two The Latins had received the rays of divine knowledge through the dark and doubtful medium of a translation The poverty and stubbornness of their native tongue was not always capable of affording just equivalents for the Greek terms for the technical words of the Platonic philosophy seventy three which had been consecrated by the gospel or by the church to express the mysteries of the Christian faith and a verbal defect might introduce into the Latin theology a long train of error or perplexity seventy four But as the western provincials had the good fortune of deriving their religion from an orthodox source they preserved with steadiness the doctrine which they had accepted with docility and when the Arian pestilence approached their frontiers they were supplied with the seasonable preservative of the Homoousion by the paternal care of the Roman pontiff Their sentiments and their temper were displayed in the memorable synod of Rimini which surpassed in numbers the council of Nice since it was composed of above four hundred bishops of Italy Africa Spain Gaul Britain and Illyricum From the first debates it appeared that only fourscore prelates adhered to the party though they affected to anathematize the name and memory of Arius But this inferiority was compensated by the advantages of skill of experience and of discipline and the minority was conducted by Valens and Ursacius two bishops of Illyricum who had spent their lives in the intrigues of courts and councils and who had been trained under the Eusebian banner in the religious wars of the East By their arguments and negotiations they embarrassed they confounded they at last deceived the honest simplicity of the Latin bishops who suffered the palladium of the faith to be extorted from their hand by fraud and importunity rather than by open violence The council of Rimini was not allowed to separate till the members had imprudently subscribed a captious creed in which some expressions susceptible of an heretical sense were inserted in the room of the Homoousion It was on this occasion that according to Jerom the world was surprised to find itself Arian seventy five But the bishops of the Latin provinces had no sooner reached their respective dioceses than they discovered their mistake and repented of their weakness The ignominious capitulation was rejected with disdain and abhorrence and the Homoousian standard which had been shaken but not overthrown was more firmly replanted in all the churches of the West seventy six Footnote seventy two Testor Deumcoeli atque terrae me cum neutrum audissem semper tamen utrumque sensisse Regeneratus pridem et in

Of The Church Part IV Such was the rise and progress and such were the natural revolutions of those theological disputes which disturbed the peace of Christianity under the reigns of Constantine and of his sons But as those princes presumed to extend their despotism over the faith as well as over the lives and fortunes of their subjects the weight of their suffrage sometimes inclined the ecclesiastical balance and the prerogatives of the King of Heaven were settled or changed or modified in the cabinet of an earthly monarch The unhappy spirit of discord which pervaded the provinces of the East interrupted the triumph of Constantine but the emperor continued for some time to view with cool and careless indifference the object of the dispute As he was yet ignorant of the difficulty of appeasing the quarrels of theologians he addressed to the contending parties to Alexander and to Arius a moderating epistle seventy seven which may be ascribed with far greater reason to the untutored sense of a soldier and statesman than to the dictates of any of his episcopal counsellors He attributes the origin of the whole controversy to a trifling and subtle question concerning an incomprehensible point of law which was foolishly asked by the bishop and imprudently resolved by the presbyter He laments that the Christian people who had the same God the same religion and the same worship should be divided by such inconsiderable distinctions and he seriously recommend to the clergy of Alexandria the example of the Greek philosophers who could maintain their arguments without losing their temper and assert their freedom without violating their friendship The indifference and contempt of the sovereign would have been perhaps the most effectual method of silencing the dispute if the popular current had been less rapid and impetuous and if Constantine himself in the midst of faction and fanaticism could have preserved the calm possession of his own mind But his ecclesiastical ministers soon contrived to seduce the impartiality of the magistrate and to awaken the zeal of the proselyte He was provoked by the insults which had been offered to his statues he was alarmed by the real as well as the imaginary magnitude of the spreading mischief and he extinguished the hope of peace and toleration from the moment that he assembled three hundred bishops within the walls of the same palace The presence of the monarch swelled the importance of the debate his attention multiplied the arguments and he exposed his person with a patient intrepidity which animated the valor of the combatants Notwithstanding the applause which has been bestowed on the eloquence and sagacity of Constantine seventy eight a Roman general whose religion might be still a subject of doubt and whose mind had not been enlightened either by study or by inspiration was indifferently qualified to discuss in the Greek language a metaphysical question or an article of faith But the credit of his favorite Osius who appears to have presided in the council of Nice might dispose the emperor in favor of the orthodox party and a well timed insinuation that the same Eusebius of Nicomedia who now protected the heretic had lately assisted the tyrant seventy nine might exasperate him against their adversaries The Nicene creed was ratified by Constantine and his firm declaration that those who resisted the divine judgment of the synod must prepare themselves for an immediate exile annihilated the murmurs of a feeble opposition which from seventeen was almost instantly reduced to two protesting bishops Eusebius of Caesarea yielded a reluctant and ambiguous consent to the Homoousion eighty and the wavering conduct of the Nicomedian Eusebius served only to delay about three months his disgrace and exile eighty one The impious Arius was banished into one of the remote provinces of Illyricum his person and disciples were branded by law with the odious name of Porphyrians his writings were condemned to the flames and a capital punishment was denounced against those in whose possession they should be found The emperor had now imbibed the spirit of controversy and the angry sarcastic style of his edicts was designed to inspire his subjects with the hatred which he had conceived against the enemies of Christ eighty two Footnote seventy seven Eusebius in Vit Constant l ii c sixty four seventy two The principles of toleration and religious indifference contained in this epistle have given great offence to Baronius Tillemont c who suppose that the emperor had some evil counsellor either Satan or Eusebius at his elbow See Cortin s Remarks tom ii p one hundred eighty three Note Heinichen Excursus xi quotes with approbation the term golden words applied by Ziegler to

accuser of one of his subjects he styles Eusebius and complains of his hostile behavior during the civil war Footnote eighty See in Socrates l i c eight or rather in Theodoret l i c twelve an original letter of Eusebius of Caesarea in which he attempts to justify his subscribing the Homoousion The character of Eusebius has always been a problem but those who have read the second critical epistle of Le Clerc Ars Critica tom iii p thirty sixty nine must entertain a very unfavorable opinion of the orthodoxy and sincerity of the bishop of Caesarea Footnote eighty one Athanasius tom i p seven hundred twenty seven Philostorgius l i c ten and Godefroy s Commentary p forty one Footnote eighty two Socrates l i c nine In his circular letters which were addressed to the several cities Constantine employed against the heretics the arms of ridicule and comic raillery But as if the conduct of the emperor had been guided by passion instead of principle three years from the council of Nice were scarcely elapsed before he discovered some symptoms of mercy and even of indulgence towards the proscribed sect which was secretly protected by his favorite sister The exiles were recalled and Eusebius who gradually resumed his influence over the mind of Constantine was restored to the episcopal throne from which he had been ignominiously degraded Arius himself was treated by the whole court with the respect which would have been due to an innocent and oppressed man His faith was approved by the synod of Jerusalem and the emperor seemed impatient to repair his injustice by issuing an absolute command that he should be solemnly admitted to the communion in the cathedral of Constantinople On the same day which had been fixed for the triumph of Arius he expired and the strange and horrid circumstances of his death might excite a suspicion that the orthodox saints had contributed more efficaciously than by their prayers to deliver the church from the most formidable of her enemies eighty three The three principal leaders of the Catholics Athanasius of Alexandria Eustathius of Antioch and Paul of Constantinople were deposed on various f accusations by the sentence of numerous councils and were afterwards banished into distant provinces by the first of the Christian emperors who in the last moments of his life received the rites of baptism from the Arian bishop of Nicomedia The ecclesiastical government of Constantine cannot be justified from the reproach of levity and weakness But the credulous monarch unskilled in the stratagems of theological warfare might be deceived by the modest and specious professions of the heretics whose sentiments he never perfectly understood and while he protected Arius and persecuted Athanasius he still considered the council of Nice as the bulwark of the Christian faith and the peculiar glory of his own reign eighty four Footnote eighty three We derive the original story from Athanasius tom i p six hundred seventy who expresses some reluctance to stigmatize the memory of the dead He might exaggerate but the perpetual commerce of Alexandria and Constantinople would have rendered it dangerous to invent Those who press the literal narrative of the death of Arius his bowels suddenly burst out in a privy must make their option between poison and miracle Footnote eighty four The change in the sentiments or at least in the conduct of Constantine may be traced in Eusebius in Vit Constant l iii c twenty three l iv c forty one Socrates l i c twenty three thirty nine Sozomen l ii c sixteen thirty four Theodoret l i c fourteen thirty four and Philostorgius l ii c one seventeen But the first of these writers was too near the scene of action and the others were too remote from it It is singular enough that the important task of continuing the history of the church should have been left for two laymen and a heretic The sons of Constantine must have been admitted from their childhood into the rank of catechumens but they imitated in the delay of their baptism the example of their father Like him they presumed to pronounce their judgment on mysteries into which they had never been regularly initiated eighty five and the fate of the Trinitarian controversy depended in a great measure on the sentiments of Constantius who inherited the provinces of the East and acquired the possession of the whole empire The Arian presbyter or bishop who had secreted for his use the testament of the deceased emperor improved the fortunate occasion which had introduced him to the familiarity of a prince whose public counsels were always swayed by his domestic favorites The eunuchs and slaves diffused the spiritual poison through the palace and the dangerous infection was communicated by the female attendants to the guards and by the empress to her unsuspicious husband eighty six The partiality which Constantius always expressed towards the Eusebian faction was insensibly fortified by the dexterous management of their leaders and his victory over the tyrant Magnentius increased his inclination as well as ability to employ the arms of power in the cause of Arianism While the two armies were engaged in the plains of Mursa and the fate of the two rivals depended on the chance of war the son of Constantine passed the anxious moments in a church of the martyrs under the walls of the city His spiritual comforter Valens the Arian bishop of the diocese employed the most artful precautions to obtain such early intelligence as might secure either his favor or his escape A secret chain of swift and trusty messengers informed him of the vicissitudes of the battle and while the courtiers stood trembling round their affrighted master Valens assured him that the Gallic legions gave way and insinuated with some presence of mind that the glorious event had been revealed to him by an angel The grateful emperor ascribed his success to the merits and intercession of the bishop of Mursa whose faith had deserved the public and miraculous approbation of Heaven eighty seven The Arians who considered as their own the victory of Constantius preferred his glory to that of his father eighty eight Cyril bishop of Jerusalem immediately composed the description of a celestial cross encircled with a splendid rainbow which during the festival of Pentecost about the third hour of the day had appeared over the Mount of Olives to the edification of the devout pilgrims and the people of the holy city eighty nine The size of the meteor was gradually magnified and the Arian historian has ventured to affirm that it was conspicuous to the two armies in the plains of Pannonia and that the tyrant who is purposely represented as an idolater fled before the auspicious sign of orthodox Christianity ninety Footnote eighty five Quia etiam tum catechumenus sacramentum fidei merito videretiu potuisse nescire Sulp Sever Hist Sacra l ii p four hundred ten Footnote eighty six Socrates l ii

been found in the bowels of the earth but that it had appeared in the reign of Constantius in the midst of the heavens This opposition evidently proves that Cyril was ignorant of the stupendous miracle to which the conversion of Constantine is attributed and this ignorance is the more surprising since it was no more than twelve years after his death that Cyril was consecrated bishop of Jerusalem by the immediate successor of Eusebius of Caesarea See Tillemont Mem Eccles tom viii p seven hundred fifteen Footnote eighty nine It is not easy to determine how far the ingenuity of Cyril might be assisted by some natural appearances of a solar halo Footnote ninety Philostorgius l iii c twenty six He is followed by the author of the Alexandrian Chronicle by Cedrenus and by Nicephorus See Gothofred Dissert p one hundred eighty eight They could not refuse a miracle even from the hand of an enemy The sentiments of a judicious stranger who has impartially considered the progress of civil or ecclesiastical discord are always entitled to our notice and a short passage of Ammianus who served in the armies and studied the character of Constantius is perhaps of more value than many pages of theological invectives The Christian religion which in itself says that moderate historian is plain and simple he confounded by the dotage of superstition Instead of reconciling the parties by the weight of his authority he cherished and promulgated by verbal disputes the differences which his vain curiosity had excited The highways were covered with troops of bishops galloping from every side to the assemblies which they call synods and while they labored to reduce the whole sect to their own particular opinions the public establishment of the posts was almost ruined by their hasty and repeated journeys ninety one Our more intimate knowledge of the ecclesiastical transactions of the reign of Constantius would furnish an ample commentary on this remarkable passage which justifies the rational apprehensions of Athanasius that the restless activity of the clergy who wandered round the empire in search of the true faith would excite the contempt and laughter of the unbelieving world ninety two As soon as the emperor was relieved from the terrors of the civil war he devoted the leisure of his winter quarters at Arles Milan Sirmium and Constantinople to the amusement or toils of controversy the sword of the magistrate and even of the tyrant was unsheathed to enforce the reasons of the theologian and as he opposed the orthodox faith of Nice it is readily confessed that his incapacity and ignorance were equal to his presumption ninety three The eunuchs the women and the bishops who governed the vain and feeble mind of the emperor had inspired him with an insuperable dislike to the Homoousion but his timid conscience was alarmed by the impiety of Aetius The guilt of that atheist was aggravated by the suspicious favor of the unfortunate Gallus and even the death of the Imperial ministers who had been massacred at Antioch were imputed to the suggestions of that dangerous sophist The mind of Constantius which could neither be moderated by reason nor fixed by faith was blindly impelled to either side of the dark and empty abyss by his horror of the opposite extreme he alternately embraced and condemned the sentiments he successively banished and recalled the leaders of the Arian and Semi Arian factions ninety four During the season of public business or festivity he employed whole days and even nights in selecting the words and weighing the syllables which composed his fluctuating creeds The subject of his meditations still pursued and occupied his slumbers the incoherent dreams of the emperor were received as celestial visions and he accepted with complacency the lofty title of bishop of bishops from those ecclesiastics who forgot the interest of their order for the gratification of their passions The design of establishing a uniformity of doctrine which had engaged him to convene so many synods in Gaul Italy Illyricum and Asia was repeatedly baffled by his own levity by the divisions of the Arians and by the resistance of the Catholics and he resolved as the last and decisive effort imperiously to dictate the decrees of a general council The destructive earthquake of Nicomedia the difficulty of finding a convenient place and perhaps some secret motives of policy produced an alteration in the summons The bishops of the East were directed to meet at Seleucia in Isauria while those of the West held their deliberations at Rimini on the coast of the Hadriatic and instead of two or three deputies from each province the whole episcopal body was ordered to march The Eastern council after consuming four days in fierce and unavailing debate separated without any definitive conclusion The council of the West was protracted till the seventh month Taurus the Praetorian praefect was instructed not to dismiss the prelates till they should all be united in the same opinion and his efforts were supported by the power of banishing fifteen of the most refractory and a promise of the consulship if he achieved so difficult an adventure His prayers and threats the authority of the sovereign the sophistry of Valens and Ursacius the distress of cold and hunger and the tedious melancholy of a hopeless exile at length extorted the reluctant consent of the bishops of Rimini The deputies of the East and of the West attended the emperor in the palace of Constantinople and he enjoyed the satisfaction of imposing on the world a profession of faith which established the likeness without expressing the consubstantiality of the Son of God ninety five But the triumph of Arianism had been preceded by the removal of the orthodox clergy whom it was impossible either to intimidate or to corrupt and the reign of Constantius was disgraced by the unjust and ineffectual persecution of the great Athanasius

Footnote ninety five Sulp Sever Hist Sacra l ii p four hundred eighteen four hundred thirty The Greek historians were very ignorant of the affairs of the West We have seldom an opportunity of observing either in active or speculative life what effect may be produced or what obstacles may be surmounted by the force of a single mind when it is inflexibly applied to the pursuit of a single object The immortal name of Athanasius ninety six will never be separated from the Catholic doctrine of the Trinity to whose defence he consecrated every moment and every faculty of his being Educated in the family of Alexander he had vigorously opposed the early progress of the Arian heresy he exercised the important functions of secretary under the aged prelate and the fathers of the Nicene council beheld with surprise and respect the rising virtues of the young deacon In a time of public danger the dull claims of age and of rank are sometimes superseded and within five months after his return from Nice the deacon Athanasius was seated on the archiepiscopal throne of Egypt He filled that eminent station above forty six years and his long administration was spent in a perpetual combat against the powers of Arianism Five times was Athanasius expelled from his throne twenty years he passed as an exile or a fugitive and almost every province of the Roman empire was successively witness to his merit and his sufferings in the cause of the Homoousion which he considered as the sole pleasure and business as the duty and as the glory of his life Amidst the storms of persecution the archbishop of Alexandria was patient of labor jealous of fame careless of safety and although his mind was tainted by the contagion of fanaticism Athanasius displayed a superiority of character and abilities which would have qualified him far better than the degenerate sons of Constantine for the government of a great monarchy His learning was much less profound and extensive than that of Eusebius of Caesarea and his rude eloquence could not be compared with the polished oratory of Gregory of Basil but whenever the primate of Egypt was called upon to justify his sentiments or his conduct his unpremeditated style either of speaking or writing was clear forcible and persuasive He has always been revered in the orthodox school as one of the most accurate masters of the Christian theology and he was supposed to possess two profane sciences less adapted to the episcopal character the knowledge of jurisprudence ninety seven and that of divination ninety eight Some fortunate conjectures of future events which impartial reasoners might ascribe to the experience and judgment of Athanasius were attributed by his friends to heavenly inspiration and imputed by his enemies to infernal magic Footnote ninety six We may regret that Gregory Nazianzen composed a panegyric instead of a life of Athanasius but we should enjoy and improve the advantage of drawing our most authentic materials from the rich fund of his own epistles and apologies tom i p six hundred seventy nine hundred fifty one I shall not imitate the example of Socrates l ii c l who published the first edition of the history without giving himself the trouble to consult the writings of Athanasius Yet even Socrates the more curious Sozomen and the learned Theodoret connect the life of Athanasius with the series of ecclesiastical history The diligence of Tillemont tom viii and of the Benedictine editors has collected every fact and examined every difficulty Footnote ninety seven Sulpicius Severus Hist Sacra l ii p three hundred ninety six calls him a lawyer a jurisconsult This character cannot now be discovered either in the life or writings of Athanasius Footnote ninety eight Dicebatur enim fatidicarum sortium fidem quaeve augurales portenderent alites scientissime callens aliquoties praedixisse futura Ammianus xv seven A prophecy or rather a joke is related by Sozomen l iv c ten which evidently proves if the crows speak Latin that Athanasius understood the language of the crows But as Athanasius was continually engaged with the prejudices and passions of every order of men from the monk to the emperor the knowledge of human nature was his first and most important science He preserved a distinct and unbroken view of a scene which was incessantly shifting and never failed to improve those decisive moments which are irrecoverably past before they are perceived by a common eye The archbishop of Alexandria was capable of distinguishing how far he might boldly command and where he must dexterously insinuate how long he might contend with power and when he must withdraw from persecution and while he directed the thunders of the church against heresy and rebellion he could assume in the bosom of his own party the flexible and indulgent temper of a prudent leader The election of Athanasius has not escaped the reproach of irregularity and precipitation ninety nine but the propriety of his behavior conciliated the affections both of the clergy and of the people The Alexandrians were impatient to rise in arms for the defence of an eloquent and liberal pastor In his distress he always derived support or at least consolation from the faithful attachment of his parochial clergy and the hundred bishops of Egypt adhered with unshaken zeal to the cause of Athanasius In the modest equipage which pride and policy would affect he frequently performed the episcopal visitation of his provinces from the mouth of the Nile to the confines of Aethiopia familiarly conversing with the meanest of the populace and humbly saluting the saints and hermits of the desert one hundred Nor was it only in ecclesiastical assemblies among men whose education and manners were similar to his own that Athanasius displayed the ascendancy of his genius He appeared with easy and respectful firmness in the courts of princes and in the various turns of his prosperous and adverse fortune he never lost the confidence of his friends or the esteem of his enemies Footnote ninety nine The irregular ordination of Athanasius was slightly mentioned in the councils which were held against him See Philostorg l ii c eleven and Godefroy p seventy one but it can scarcely be supposed that the assembly of the bishops of Egypt would solemnly attest a public falsehood Athanas tom i p seven hundred twenty six Footnote one hundred See the history of the Fathers of the Desert published by Rosweide and Tillemont Mem Eccles tom vii in the lives of Antony Pachomius c Athanasius himself who did not disdain to compose the life of his friend Antony has carefully observed how often the holy monk deplored and prophesied the mischiefs of the Arian heresy Athanas tom ii p four hundred ninety two four hundred ninety eight c In his youth the primate of Egypt resisted the great Constantine who had repeatedly signified his will that Arius should be restored to the Catholic communion one hundred one The emperor respected and might forgive this inflexible resolution and the faction who considered Athanasius as their most formidable enemy was constrained to dissemble their hatred and silently to prepare an indirect and distant assault They scattered rumors and suspicions represented the archbishop as a proud and oppressive tyrant and boldly accused him of violating the treaty which had been ratified in the Nicene council with the schismatic followers of Meletius one hundred two Athanasius had openly disapproved that ignominious peace and the emperor was disposed to believe that he had abused his ecclesiastical and civil power to prosecute those odious sectaries that he had sacrilegiously broken a chalice in one of their churches of Mareotis that he had whipped or imprisoned six of their bishops and that Arsenius a seventh bishop of the same party had been murdered or at least mutilated by the cruel hand of the primate one hundred three These charges which affected his honor and his life were referred by Constantine to his brother Dalmatius the censor who resided at Antioch the synods of Caesarea and Tyre were successively convened and the bishops of the East were instructed to judge the cause of Athanasius before they proceeded to consecrate the new church of the Resurrection at Jerusalem The primate might be conscious of his innocence but he was sensible that the same implacable spirit which had dictated the accusation would direct the proceeding and pronounce the sentence He prudently declined the tribunal of his enemies despised the summons of the synod of Caesarea and after a long and artful delay submitted to the peremptory commands of the emperor who threatened to punish his criminal disobedience if he refused to appear in the council of Tyre one hundred four Before Athanasius at the head of fifty Egyptian prelates sailed from Alexandria he had wisely secured the alliance of the Meletians and Arsenius himself his imaginary victim and his secret friend was privately concealed in his train The synod of Tyre was conducted by Eusebius of Caesarea with more passion and with less art than his learning and experience might promise his numerous faction repeated the names of homicide and tyrant and their clamors were encouraged by the seeming patience of Athanasius who expected the decisive moment to produce Arsenius alive and unhurt in the midst of the assembly The nature of the other charges did not admit of such clear and satisfactory replies yet the archbishop was able to prove that in the village where he was accused of breaking a consecrated chalice neither church nor altar nor chalice could really exist The Arians who had secretly determined the guilt and condemnation of their enemy attempted however to disguise their injustice by the imitation of judicial forms the synod appointed an episcopal commission of six delegates to collect evidence on the spot and this measure which was vigorously opposed by the Egyptian bishops opened new scenes of violence and perjury one hundred five After the return of the deputies from Alexandria the majority of the council pronounced the final sentence of degradation and exile against the primate of Egypt The decree expressed in the fiercest language of malice and revenge was communicated to the emperor and the Catholic church and the bishops immediately resumed a mild and devout aspect such as became their holy pilgrimage to the Sepulchre of Christ one hundred six Footnote one hundred one At first Constantine threatened in speaking but requested in writing His letters gradually assumed a menacing tone by while he required that the entrance of the church should be open to all he avoided the odious name of Arius Athanasius like a skilful politician has accurately marked these distinctions tom i p seven hundred eighty eight which allowed him some scope for excuse and delay Footnote one hundred two The Meletians in Egypt like the Donatists in Africa were produced by an episcopal quarrel which arose from the persecution I have not leisure to pursue the obscure controversy which seems to have been misrepresented by the partiality of Athanasius and the ignorance of Epiphanius See Mosheim s General History of the Church vol i p two hundred one Footnote one hundred three The treatment of the six bishops is specified by Sozomen l ii c twenty five but Athanasius himself so copious on the subject of Arsenius and the chalice leaves this grave accusation without a reply Note This grave charge if made and it rests entirely on the authority of Soz omen seems to have been silently dropped by the parties themselves it is never alluded to in the subsequent investigations From Sozomen himself who gives the unfavorable report of the commission of inquiry sent to Egypt concerning the cup it does not appear that they noticed this accusation of personal violence M Footnote one hundred four Athanas tom i p seven hundred eighty eight Socrates l i c

the synod would apply those reproaches to Athanasius Footnote one hundred five See in particular the second Apology of Athanasius tom i p seven hundred sixty three eight hundred eight and his Epistles

less absurd Footnote one hundred six Eusebius in Vit Constantin l iv c forty one forty seven Chapter XXI Persecution Of Heresy State Of The Church Part V But the injustice of these ecclesiastical judges had not been countenanced by the submission or even by the presence of Athanasius He resolved to make a bold and dangerous experiment whether the throne was inaccessible to the voice of truth and before the final sentence could be pronounced at Tyre the intrepid primate threw himself into a bark which was ready to hoist sail for the Imperial city The request of a formal audience might have been opposed or eluded but Athanasius concealed his arrival watched the moment of Constantine s return from an adjacent villa and boldly encountered his angry sovereign as he passed on horseback through the principal street of Constantinople So strange an apparition excited his surprise and indignation and the guards were ordered to remove the importunate suitor but his resentment was subdued by involuntary respect and the haughty spirit of the emperor was awed by the courage and eloquence of a bishop who implored his justice and awakened his conscience one hundred seven Constantine listened to the complaints of Athanasius with impartial and even gracious attention the members of the synod of Tyre were summoned to justify their proceedings and the arts of the Eusebian faction would have been confounded if they had not aggravated the guilt of the primate by the dexterous supposition of an unpardonable offence a criminal design to intercept and detain the corn fleet of Alexandria which supplied the subsistence of the new capital one hundred eight The emperor was satisfied that the peace of Egypt would be secured by the absence of a popular leader but he refused to fill the vacancy of the archiepiscopal throne and the sentence which after long hesitation he pronounced was that of a jealous ostracism rather than of an ignominious exile In the remote province of Gaul but in the hospitable court of Treves Athanasius passed about twenty eight months The death of the emperor changed the face of public affairs and amidst the general indulgence of a young reign the primate was restored to his country by an honorable edict of the younger Constantine who expressed a deep sense of the innocence and merit of his venerable guest one hundred nine Footnote one

martyrdoms Footnote one hundred eight Athanas tom i p seven hundred twenty nine Eunapius has related in Vit Sophist p thirty six thirty seven edit Commelin a strange example of the cruelty and credulity of Constantine on a similar occasion The eloquent Sopater a Syrian philosopher enjoyed his friendship and provoked the resentment of Ablavius his Praetorian praefect The corn fleet was detained for want of a south wind the people of Constantinople were discontented and Sopater was beheaded on a charge that he had bound the winds by the power of magic Suidas adds that Constantine wished to prove by this execution that he had absolutely renounced the superstition of the Gentiles Footnote one hundred nine In his return he saw Constantius twice at Viminiacum and at Caesarea in Cappadocia Athanas tom i p six hundred seventy six Tillemont supposes that Constantine introduced him to the meeting of the three royal brothers in Pannonia Memoires Eccles tom viii p sixty nine The death of that prince exposed Athanasius to a second persecution and the feeble Constantius the sovereign of the East soon became the secret accomplice of the Eusebians Ninety bishops of that sect or faction assembled at Antioch under the specious pretence of dedicating the cathedral They composed an ambiguous creed which is faintly tinged with the colors of Semi Arianism and twenty five canons which still regulate the discipline of the orthodox Greeks one hundred ten It was decided with some appearance of equity that a bishop deprived by a synod should not resume his episcopal functions till he had been absolved by the judgment of an equal synod the law was immediately applied to the case of Athanasius the council of Antioch pronounced or rather confirmed his degradation a stranger named Gregory was seated on his throne and Philagrius one hundred eleven the praefect of Egypt was instructed to support the new primate with the civil and military powers of the province Oppressed by the conspiracy of the Asiatic prelates Athanasius withdrew from Alexandria and passed three years one hundred twelve as an exile and a suppliant on the holy threshold of the Vatican one hundred thirteen By the assiduous study of the Latin language he soon qualified himself to negotiate with the western clergy his decent flattery swayed and directed the haughty Julius the Roman pontiff was persuaded to consider his appeal as the peculiar interest of the Apostolic see and his innocence was unanimously declared in a council of fifty bishops of Italy At the end of three years the primate was summoned to the court of Milan by the emperor Constans who in the indulgence of unlawful pleasures still professed a lively regard for the orthodox faith The cause of truth and justice was promoted by the influence of gold one hundred fourteen and the ministers of Constans advised their sovereign to require the convocation of an ecclesiastical assembly which might act as the representatives of the Catholic church Ninety four bishops of the West seventy six bishops of the East encountered each other at Sardica on the verge of the two empires but in the dominions of the protector of Athanasius Their debates soon degenerated into hostile altercations the Asiatics apprehensive for their personal safety retired to Philippopolis in Thrace and the rival synods reciprocally hurled their spiritual thunders against their enemies whom they piously condemned as the enemies of the true God Their decrees were published and ratified in their respective provinces and Athanasius who in the West was revered as a saint was exposed as a criminal to the abhorrence of the East one hundred fifteen The council of Sardica reveals the first symptoms of discord and schism between the Greek and Latin churches which were separated by the accidental difference of faith and the permanent distinction of language Footnote one hundred ten See Beveridge Pandect tom i p

Footnote one hundred fifteen The canon which allows appeals to the Roman pontiffs has almost raised the council of Sardica to the dignity of a general council and its acts have been ignorantly or artfully confounded with those of the Nicene synod See Tillemont tom vii p six hundred eighty nine and Geddos s Tracts vol ii p four hundred nineteen four hundred sixty During his second exile in the West Athanasius was frequently admitted to the Imperial presence at Capua Lodi Milan Verona Padua Aquileia and Treves The bishop of the diocese usually assisted at these interviews the master of the offices stood before the veil or curtain of the sacred apartment and the uniform moderation of the primate might be attested by these respectable witnesses to whose evidence he solemnly appeals one hundred sixteen Prudence would undoubtedly suggest the mild and respectful tone that became a subject and a bishop In these familiar conferences with the sovereign of the West Athanasius might lament the error of Constantius but he boldly arraigned the guilt of his eunuchs and his Arian prelates deplored the distress and danger of the Catholic church and excited Constans to emulate the zeal and glory of his father The emperor declared his resolution of employing the troops and treasures of Europe in the orthodox cause and signified by a concise and peremptory epistle to his brother Constantius that unless he consented to the immediate restoration of Athanasius he himself with a fleet and army would seat the archbishop on the throne of Alexandria one hundred seventeen But this religious war so horrible to nature was prevented by the timely compliance of Constantius and the emperor of the East condescended to solicit a reconciliation with a subject whom he had injured Athanasius waited with decent pride till he had received three successive epistles full of the strongest assurances of the protection the favor and the esteem of his sovereign who invited him to resume his episcopal seat and who added the humiliating precaution of engaging his principal ministers to attest the sincerity of his intentions They were manifested in a still more public manner by the strict orders which were despatched into Egypt to recall the adherents of Athanasius to restore their privileges to proclaim their innocence and to erase from the public registers the illegal proceedings which had been obtained during the prevalence of the Eusebian faction After every satisfaction and security had been given which justice or even delicacy could require the primate proceeded by slow journeys through the provinces of Thrace Asia and Syria and his progress was marked by the abject homage of the Oriental bishops who excited his contempt without deceiving his penetration one hundred eighteen At Antioch he saw the emperor Constantius sustained with modest firmness the embraces and protestations of his master and eluded the proposal of allowing the Arians a single church at Alexandria by claiming in the other cities of the empire a similar toleration for his own party a reply which might have appeared just and moderate in the mouth of an independent prince The entrance of the archbishop into his capital was a triumphal procession absence and persecution had endeared him to the Alexandrians his authority which he exercised with rigor was more firmly established and his fame was diffused from Aethiopia to Britain over the whole extent of the Christian world one hundred nineteen Footnote one hundred sixteen As Athanasius dispersed secret invectives against Constantius see the Epistle to the Monks at the same time that he assured him of his profound respect we might distrust the professions of the archbishop Tom i p six hundred seventy

evidence of Lucifer of Cagliari and even of Constantius himself See Tillemont tom viii p six hundred ninety three Footnote one hundred eighteen I have always entertained some doubts concerning the retraction of Ursacius and Valens Athanas tom i p seven hundred seventy six Their epistles to Julius bishop of Rome and to Athanasius himself are of so different a cast from each other that they cannot both be genuine The one speaks the language of criminals who confess their guilt and infamy the other of enemies who solicit on equal terms an honorable reconciliation Note I cannot quite comprehend the ground of Gibbon s doubts Athanasius distinctly asserts the fact of their retractation Athan Op i p one hundred twenty four edit Benedict The epistles are apparently translations from the Latin if in fact more than the substance of the epistles That to Athanasius is brief almost abrupt Their retractation is likewise mentioned in the address of the orthodox bishops of Rimini to

sixty nine and eight hundred twenty two eight hundred forty three Socrates l ii c eighteen Sozomen l iii c nineteen Theodoret l ii c eleven twelve Philostorgius l iii c twelve But the subject who has reduced his prince to the necessity of dissembling can never expect a sincere and lasting forgiveness and the tragic fate of Constans soon deprived Athanasius of a powerful and generous protector The civil war between the assassin and the only surviving brother of Constans which afflicted the empire above three years secured an interval of repose to the Catholic church and the two contending parties were desirous to conciliate the friendship of a bishop who by the weight of his personal authority might determine the fluctuating resolutions of an important province He gave audience to the ambassadors of the tyrant with whom he was afterwards accused of holding a secret correspondence one hundred twenty and the emperor Constantius repeatedly assured his dearest father the most reverend Athanasius that notwithstanding the malicious rumors which were circulated by their common enemies he had inherited the sentiments as well as the throne of his deceased brother one hundred twenty one Gratitude and humanity would have disposed the primate of Egypt to deplore the untimely fate of Constans and to abhor the guilt of Magnentius but as he clearly understood that the apprehensions of Constantius were his only safeguard the fervor of his prayers for the success of the righteous cause might perhaps be somewhat abated The ruin of Athanasius was no longer contrived by the obscure malice of a few bigoted or angry bishops who abused the authority of a credulous monarch The monarch himself avowed the resolution which he had so long suppressed of avenging his private injuries one hundred twenty two and the first winter after his victory which he passed at Arles was employed against an enemy more odious to him than the vanquished tyrant of Gaul Footnote one hundred twenty Athanasius tom i p six hundred seventy seven six hundred seventy eight defends his innocence by pathetic complaints solemn assertions and specious arguments He admits that letters had been forged in his name but he requests that his own secretaries and those of the tyrant might be examined whether those letters had been written by the former or received by the latter Footnote one hundred twenty one Athanas tom i p eight hundred twenty five eight hundred forty four Footnote one hundred twenty two Athanas tom i p eight hundred sixty one Theodoret l ii c sixteen The emperor declared that he was more desirous to subdue Athanasius than he had been to vanquish Magnentius or Sylvanus If the emperor had capriciously decreed the death of the most eminent and virtuous citizen of the republic the cruel order would have been executed without hesitation by the ministers of open violence or of specious injustice The caution the delay the difficulty with which he proceeded in the condemnation and punishment of a popular bishop discovered to the world that the privileges of the church had already revived a sense of order and freedom in the Roman government The sentence which was pronounced in the synod of Tyre and subscribed by a large majority of the Eastern bishops had never been expressly repealed and as Athanasius had been once degraded from his episcopal dignity by the judgment of his brethren every subsequent act might be considered as irregular and even criminal But the memory of the firm and effectual support which the primate of Egypt had derived from the attachment of the Western church engaged Constantius to suspend the execution of the sentence till he had obtained the concurrence of the Latin bishops Two years were consumed in ecclesiastical negotiations and the important cause between the emperor and one of his subjects was solemnly debated first in the synod of Arles and afterwards in the great council of Milan one hundred twenty three which consisted of above three hundred bishops Their integrity was gradually undermined by the arguments of the Arians the dexterity of the eunuchs and the pressing solicitations of a prince who gratified his revenge at the expense of his dignity and exposed his own passions whilst he influenced those of the clergy Corruption the most infallible symptom of constitutional liberty was successfully practised honors gifts and immunities were offered and accepted as the price of an episcopal vote one hundred twenty four and the condemnation of the Alexandrian primate was artfully represented as the only measure which could restore the peace and union of the Catholic church The friends of Athanasius were not however wanting to their leader or to their cause With a manly spirit which the sanctity of their character rendered less dangerous they maintained in public debate and in private conference with the emperor the eternal obligation of religion and justice They declared that neither the hope of his favor nor the fear of his displeasure should prevail on them to join in the condemnation of an absent an innocent a respectable brother one hundred twenty five They affirmed with apparent reason that the illegal and obsolete decrees of the council of Tyre had long since been tacitly abolished by the Imperial edicts the honorable reestablishment of the archbishop of Alexandria and the silence or recantation of his most clamorous adversaries They alleged that his innocence had been attested by the unanimous bishops of Egypt and had been acknowledged in the councils of Rome and Sardica one hundred twenty six by the impartial judgment of the Latin church They deplored the hard condition of Athanasius who after enjoying so many years his seat his reputation and the seeming confidence of his sovereign was again called upon to confute the most groundless and extravagant accusations Their language was specious their conduct was honorable but in this long and obstinate contest which fixed the eyes of the whole empire on a single bishop the ecclesiastical factions were prepared to sacrifice truth and justice to the more interesting object of defending or removing the intrepid champion of the Nicene faith The Arians still thought it prudent to disguise in ambiguous language their real sentiments and designs but the orthodox bishops armed with the favor of the people and the decrees of a general council insisted on every occasion and particularly at Milan that their adversaries should purge themselves from the suspicion of heresy before they presumed to arraign the conduct of the great Athanasius one hundred twenty seven Footnote one hundred twenty three The affairs of the council of Milan are so imperfectly and erroneously related by the Greek writers that we must rejoice in the supply of some letters of Eusebius extracted by Baronius from the archives of the church of Vercellae and of an old life of Dionysius of Milan published by Bollandus See Baronius A D three hundred fifty five and Tillemont tom vii p fourteen fifteen Footnote one hundred twenty four The honors presents feasts which seduced so many bishops are mentioned with indignation by those

principal of whom they immediately deposed Footnote one hundred twenty seven Sulp Severus in Hist Sacra l ii p four hundred twelve But the voice of reason if reason was indeed on the side of Athanasius was silenced by the clamors of a factious or venal majority and the councils of Arles and Milan were not dissolved till the archbishop of Alexandria had been solemnly condemned and deposed by the judgment of the Western as well as of the Eastern church The bishops who had opposed were required to subscribe the sentence and to unite in religious communion with the suspected leaders of the adverse party A formulary of consent was transmitted by the messengers of state to the absent bishops and all those who refused to submit their private opinion to the public and inspired wisdom of the councils of Arles and Milan were immediately banished by the emperor who affected to execute the decrees of the Catholic church Among those prelates who led the honorable band of confessors and exiles Liberius of Rome Osius of Cordova Paulinus of Treves Dionysius of Milan Eusebius of Vercellae Lucifer of Cagliari and Hilary of Poitiers may deserve to be particularly distinguished The eminent station of Liberius who governed the capital of the empire the personal merit and long experience of the venerable Osius who was revered as the favorite of the great Constantine and the father of the Nicene faith placed those prelates at the head of the Latin church and their example either of submission or resistance would probable be imitated by the episcopal crowd But the repeated attempts of the emperor to seduce or to intimidate the bishops of Rome and Cordova were for some time ineffectual The Spaniard declared himself ready to suffer under Constantius as he had suffered threescore years before under his grandfather Maximian The Roman in the presence of his sovereign asserted the innocence of Athanasius and his own freedom When he was banished to Beraea in Thrace he sent back a large sum which had been offered for the accommodation of his journey and insulted the court of Milan by the haughty remark that the emperor and his eunuchs might want that gold to pay their soldiers and their bishops one hundred twenty eight The resolution of Liberius and Osius was at length subdued by the hardships of exile and confinement The Roman pontiff purchased his return by some criminal compliances and afterwards expiated his guilt by a seasonable repentance Persuasion and violence were employed to extort the reluctant signature of the decrepit bishop of Cordova whose strength was broken and whose faculties were perhaps impaired by the weight of a hundred years and the insolent triumph of the Arians provoked some of the orthodox party to treat with inhuman severity the character or rather the memory of an unfortunate old man to whose former services Christianity itself was so deeply indebted one hundred twenty nine Footnote one hundred twenty eight The exile of Liberius is mentioned by Ammianus xv seven See Theodoret l ii c sixteen Athanas tom i p eight hundred thirty four eight hundred thirty seven Hilar Fragment l Footnote one hundred twenty nine The life of Osius is collected by Tillemont tom vii p five hundred twenty four five hundred sixty one who in the most extravagant terms first admires and then reprobates the bishop of Cordova In the midst of their lamentations on his fall the prudence of Athanasius may be distinguished from the blind and intemperate zeal of Hilary The fall of Liberius and Osius reflected a brighter lustre on the firmness of those bishops who still adhered with unshaken fidelity to the cause of Athanasius and religious truth The ingenious malice of their enemies had deprived them of the benefit of mutual comfort and advice separated those illustrious exiles into distant provinces and carefully selected the most inhospitable spots of a great empire one hundred thirty Yet they soon experienced that the deserts of Libya and the most barbarous tracts of Cappadocia were less inhospitable than the residence of those cities in which an Arian bishop could satiate without restraint the exquisite rancor of theological hatred one hundred thirty one Their consolation was derived from the consciousness of rectitude and independence from the applause the visits the letters and the liberal alms of their adherents one hundred thirty two and from the satisfaction which they soon enjoyed of observing the intestine divisions of the adversaries of the Nicene faith Such was the nice and capricious taste of the emperor Constantius and so easily was he offended by the slightest deviation from his imaginary standard of Christian truth that he persecuted with equal zeal those who defended the consubstantiality those who asserted the similar substance and those who denied the likeness of the Son of God Three bishops degraded and banished for those adverse opinions might possibly meet in the same place of exile and according to the difference of their temper might either pity or insult the blind enthusiasm of their antagonists whose present sufferings would never be compensated by future happiness Footnote one

and exile of the orthodox bishops of the West were designed as so many preparatory steps to the ruin of Athanasius himself one hundred thirty three Six and twenty months had elapsed during which the Imperial court secretly labored by the most insidious arts to remove him from Alexandria and to withdraw the allowance which supplied his popular liberality But when the primate of Egypt deserted and proscribed by the Latin church was left destitute of any foreign support Constantius despatched two of his secretaries with a verbal commission to announce and execute the order of his banishment As the justice of the sentence was publicly avowed by the whole party the only motive which could restrain Constantius from giving his messengers the sanction of a written mandate must be imputed to his doubt of the event and to a sense of the danger to which he might expose the second city and the most fertile province of the empire if the people should persist in the resolution of defending by force of arms the innocence of their spiritual father Such extreme caution afforded Athanasius a specious pretence respectfully to dispute the truth of an order which he could not reconcile either with the equity or with the former declarations of his gracious master The civil powers of Egypt found themselves inadequate to the task of persuading or compelling the primate to abdicate his episcopal throne and they were obliged to conclude a treaty with the popular leaders of Alexandria by which it was stipulated that all proceedings and all hostilities should be suspended till the emperor s pleasure had been more distinctly ascertained By this seeming moderation the Catholics were deceived into a false and fatal security while the legions of the Upper Egypt and of Libya advanced by secret orders and hasty marches to besiege or rather to surprise a capital habituated to sedition and inflamed by religious zeal one hundred thirty four The position of Alexandria between the sea and the Lake Mareotis facilitated the approach and landing of the troops who were introduced into the heart of the city before any effectual measures could be taken either to shut the gates or to occupy the important posts of defence At the hour of midnight twenty three days after the signature of the treaty Syrianus duke of Egypt at the head of five thousand soldiers armed and prepared for an assault unexpectedly invested the church of saint Theonas where the archbishop with a part of his clergy and people performed their nocturnal devotions The doors of the sacred edifice yielded to the impetuosity of the attack which was accompanied with every horrid circumstance of tumult and bloodshed but as the bodies of the slain and the fragments of military weapons remained the next day an unexceptionable evidence in the possession of the Catholics the enterprise of Syrianus may be considered as a successful irruption rather than as an absolute conquest The other churches of the city were profaned by similar outrages and during at least four months Alexandria was exposed to the insults of a licentious army stimulated by the ecclesiastics of a hostile faction Many of the faithful were killed who may deserve the name of martyrs if their deaths were neither provoked nor revenged bishops and presbyters were treated with cruel ignominy consecrated virgins were stripped naked scourged and violated the houses of wealthy citizens were plundered and under the mask of religious zeal lust avarice and private resentment were gratified with impunity and even with applause The Pagans of Alexandria who still formed a numerous and discontented party were easily persuaded to desert a bishop whom they feared and esteemed The hopes of some peculiar favors and the apprehension of being involved in the general penalties of rebellion engaged them to promise their support to the destined successor of Athanasius the famous George of Cappadocia The usurper after receiving the consecration of an Arian synod was placed on the episcopal throne by the arms of Sebastian who had been appointed Count of Egypt for the execution of that important design In the use as well as in the acquisition of power the tyrant George disregarded the laws of religion of justice and of humanity and the same scenes of violence and scandal which had been exhibited in the capital were repeated in more than ninety episcopal cities of Egypt Encouraged by success Constantius ventured to approve the conduct of his minister By a public and passionate epistle the emperor congratulates the deliverance of Alexandria from a popular tyrant who deluded his blind votaries by the magic of his eloquence expatiates on the virtues and piety of the most reverend George the elected bishop and aspires as the patron and benefactor of the city to surpass the fame of Alexander himself But he solemnly declares his unalterable resolution to pursue with fire and sword the seditious adherents of the wicked Athanasius who by flying from justice has confessed his guilt and escaped the ignominious death which he had so often deserved one hundred thirty five Footnote one hundred thirty three

VI Athanasius had indeed escaped from the most imminent dangers and the adventures of that extraordinary man deserve and fix our attention On the memorable night when the church of saint Theonas was invested by the troops of Syrianus the archbishop seated on his throne expected with calm and intrepid dignity the approach of death While the public devotion was interrupted by shouts of rage and cries of terror he animated his trembling congregation to express their religious confidence by chanting one of the psalms of David which celebrates the triumph of the God of Israel over the haughty and impious tyrant of Egypt The doors were at length burst open a cloud of arrows was discharged among the people the soldiers with drawn swords rushed forwards into the sanctuary and the dreadful gleam of their arms was reflected by the holy luminaries which burnt round the altar one hundred thirty six Athanasius still rejected the pious importunity of the monks and presbyters who were attached to his person and nobly refused to desert his episcopal station till he had dismissed in safety the last of the congregation The darkness and tumult of the night favored the retreat of the archbishop and though he was oppressed by the waves of an agitated multitude though he was thrown to the ground and left without sense or motion he still recovered his undaunted courage and eluded the eager search of the soldiers who were instructed by their Arian guides that the head of Athanasius would be the most acceptable present to the emperor From that moment the primate of Egypt disappeared from the eyes of his enemies and remained above six years concealed in impenetrable obscurity one hundred thirty seven Footnote one hundred thirty six These minute circumstances are curious as they are literally transcribed from the protest which was publicly presented three days afterwards by the Catholics of Alexandria See Athanas tom l n eight hundred sixty seven Footnote one hundred thirty seven The Jansenists have often compared Athanasius and Arnauld and have expatiated with pleasure on the faith and zeal the merit and exile of those celebrated doctors This concealed parallel is very dexterously managed by the Abbe de la Bleterie Vie de Jovien tom i p one hundred thirty The despotic power of his implacable enemy filled the whole extent of the Roman world and the exasperated monarch had endeavored by a very pressing epistle to the Christian princes of Ethiopia one hundred thirty sevena to exclude Athanasius from the most remote and sequestered regions of the earth Counts praefects tribunes whole armies were successively employed to pursue a bishop and a fugitive the vigilance of the civil and military powers was excited by the Imperial edicts liberal rewards were promised to the man who should produce Athanasius either alive or dead and the most severe penalties were denounced against those who should dare to protect the public enemy one hundred thirty eight But the deserts of Thebais were now peopled by a race of wild yet submissive fanatics who preferred the commands of their abbot to the laws of their sovereign The numerous disciples of Antony and Pachonnus received the fugitive primate as their father admired the patience and humility with which he conformed to their strictest institutions collected every word which dropped from his lips as the genuine effusions of inspired wisdom and persuaded themselves that their prayers their fasts and their vigils were less meritorious than the zeal which they expressed and the dangers which they braved in the defence of truth and innocence one hundred thirty nine The monasteries of Egypt were seated in lonely and desolate places on the summit of mountains or in the islands of the Nile and the sacred horn or trumpet of Tabenne was the well known signal which assembled several thousand robust and determined monks who for the most part had been the peasants of the adjacent country When their dark retreats were invaded by a military force which it was impossible to resist they silently stretched out their necks to the executioner and supported their national character that tortures could never wrest from an Egyptian the confession of a secret which he was resolved not to disclose one hundred forty The archbishop of Alexandria for whose safety they eagerly devoted their lives was lost among a uniform and well disciplined multitude and on the nearer approach of danger he was swiftly removed by their officious hands from one place of concealment to another till he reached the formidable deserts which the gloomy and credulous temper of superstition had peopled with daemons and savage monsters The retirement of Athanasius which ended only with the life of Constantius was spent for the most part in the society of the monks who faithfully served him as guards as secretaries and as messengers but the importance of maintaining a more intimate connection with the Catholic party tempted him whenever the diligence of the pursuit was abated to emerge from the desert to introduce himself into Alexandria and to trust his person to the discretion of his friends and adherents His various adventures might have furnished the subject of a very entertaining romance He was once secreted in a dry cistern which he had scarcely left before he was betrayed by the treachery of a female slave one hundred forty one and he was once concealed in a still more extraordinary asylum the house of a virgin only twenty years of age and who was celebrated in the whole city for her exquisite beauty At the hour of midnight as she related the story many years afterwards she was surprised by the appearance of the archbishop in a loose undress who advancing with hasty steps conjured her to afford him the protection which he had been directed by a celestial vision to seek under her hospitable roof The pious maid accepted and preserved the sacred pledge which was intrusted to her prudence and courage Without imparting the secret to any one she instantly conducted Athanasius into her most secret chamber and watched over his safety with the tenderness of a friend and the assiduity of a servant As long as the danger continued she regularly supplied him with books and provisions washed his feet managed his correspondence and dexterously concealed from the eye of suspicion this familiar and solitary intercourse between a saint whose character required the most unblemished chastity and a female whose charms might excite the most dangerous emotions one hundred forty two During the six years of persecution and exile Athanasius repeated his visits to his fair and faithful companion and the formal declaration that he saw the councils of Rimini and Seleucia one hundred forty three forces us to believe that he was secretly present at the time and place of their convocation The advantage of personally negotiating with his friends and of observing and improving the divisions of his enemies might justify in a prudent statesman so bold and dangerous an enterprise and Alexandria was connected by trade and navigation with every seaport of the Mediterranean From the depth of his inaccessible retreat the intrepid primate waged an incessant and offensive war against the protector of the Arians and his seasonable writings which were diligently circulated and eagerly perused contributed to unite and animate the orthodox party In his public apologies which he addressed to the emperor himself he sometimes affected the praise of moderation whilst at the same time in secret and vehement invectives he exposed Constantius as a weak and wicked prince the executioner of his family the tyrant of the republic and the Antichrist of the church In the height of his prosperity the victorious monarch who had chastised the rashness of Gallus and suppressed the revolt of Sylvanus who had taken the diadem from the head of Vetranio and vanquished in the field the legions of Magnentius received from an invisible hand a wound which he could neither heal nor revenge and the son of Constantine was the first of the Christian princes who experienced the strength of those principles which in the cause of religion could resist the most violent exertions one hundred forty four of the civil power Footnote one hundred thirty sevena These princes were called Aeizanas and Saiazanas Athanasius calls them the kings of Axum In the superscription of his letter Constantius gives them no title mister Salt during his first journey in Ethiopia in eighteen oh six discovered in the ruins of Axum a long and very interesting inscription relating to these princes It was erected to commemorate the victory of Aeizanas over the Bougaitae saint Martin considers them the Blemmyes whose true name is Bedjah or Bodjah Aeizanas is styled king of the Axumites the Homerites of Raeidan of the Ethiopians of the Sabsuites of Silea of Tiamo of the Bougaites and of Kaei It appears that at this time the king of the Ethiopians ruled over the Homerites the inhabitants of Yemen He was not yet a Christian as he calls himself son of the invincible Mars Another brother besides Saiazanas

less danger if he published his invective in Gaul after the revolt of Julian but Lucifer sent his libels to Constantius and almost challenged the reward of martyrdom See Tillemont tom vii p nine hundred five The persecution of Athanasius and of so many respectable bishops who suffered for the truth of their opinions or at least for the integrity of their conscience was a just subject of indignation and discontent to all Christians except those who were blindly devoted to the Arian faction The people regretted the loss of their faithful pastors whose banishment was usually followed by the intrusion of a stranger one hundred forty five into the episcopal chair and loudly complained that the right of election was violated and that they were condemned to obey a mercenary usurper whose person was unknown and whose principles were suspected The Catholics might prove to the world that they were not involved in the guilt and heresy of their ecclesiastical governor by publicly testifying their dissent or by totally separating themselves from his communion The first of these methods was invented at Antioch and practised with such success that it was soon diffused over the Christian world The doxology or sacred hymn which celebrates the glory of the Trinity is susceptible of very nice but material inflections and the substance of an orthodox or an heretical creed may be expressed by the difference of a disjunctive or a copulative particle Alternate responses and a more regular psalmody one hundred forty six were introduced into the public service by Flavianus and Diodorus two devout and active laymen who were attached to the Nicene faith Under their conduct a swarm of monks issued from the adjacent desert bands of well disciplined singers were stationed in the cathedral of Antioch the Glory to the Father And the Son And the Holy Ghost one hundred forty seven was triumphantly chanted by a full chorus of voices and the Catholics insulted by the purity of their doctrine the Arian prelate who had usurped the throne of the venerable Eustathius The same zeal which inspired their songs prompted the more scrupulous members of the orthodox party to form separate assemblies which were governed by the presbyters till the death of their exiled bishop allowed the election and consecration of a new episcopal pastor one hundred forty eight The revolutions of the court multiplied the number of pretenders and the same city was often disputed under the reign of Constantius by two or three or even four bishops who exercised their spiritual jurisdiction over their respective followers and alternately lost and regained the temporal possessions of the church The abuse of Christianity introduced into the Roman government new causes of tyranny and sedition the bands of civil society were torn asunder by the fury of religious factions and the obscure citizen who might calmly have surveyed the elevation and fall of successive emperors imagined and experienced that his own life and fortune were connected with the interests of a popular ecclesiastic The example of the two capitals Rome and Constantinople may serve to represent the state of

communion continued for some time to join in prayer Philostorgius l iii c fourteen I The Roman pontiff as long as he maintained his station and his principles was guarded by the warm attachment of a great people and could reject with scorn the prayers the menaces and the oblations of an heretical prince When the eunuchs had secretly pronounced the exile of Liberius the well grounded apprehension of a tumult engaged them to use the utmost precautions in the execution of the sentence The capital was invested on every side and the praefect was commanded to seize the person of the bishop either by stratagem or by open force The order was obeyed and Liberius with the greatest difficulty at the hour of midnight was swiftly conveyed beyond the reach of the Roman people before their consternation was turned into rage As soon as they were informed of his banishment into Thrace a general assembly was convened and the clergy of Rome bound themselves by a public and solemn oath never to desert their bishop never to acknowledge the usurper Faelix who by the influence of the eunuchs had been irregularly chosen and consecrated within the walls of a profane palace At the end of two years their pious obstinacy subsisted entire and unshaken and when Constantius visited Rome he was assailed by the importunate solicitations of a people who had preserved as the last remnant of their ancient freedom the right of treating their sovereign with familiar insolence The wives of many of the senators and most honorable citizens after pressing their husbands to intercede in favor of Liberius were advised to undertake a commission which in their hands would be less dangerous and might prove more successful The emperor received with politeness these female deputies whose wealth and dignity were displayed in the magnificence of their dress and ornaments he admired their inflexible resolution of following their beloved pastor to the most distant regions of the earth and consented that the two bishops Liberius and Faelix should govern in peace their respective congregations But the ideas of toleration were so repugnant to the practice and even to the sentiments of those times that when the answer of Constantius was publicly read in the Circus of Rome so reasonable a project of accommodation was rejected with contempt and ridicule The eager vehemence which animated the spectators in the decisive moment of a horse race was now directed towards a different object and the Circus resounded with the shout of thousands who repeatedly exclaimed One God One Christ One Bishop The zeal of the Roman people in the cause of Liberius was not confined to words alone and the dangerous and bloody sedition which they excited soon after the departure of Constantius determined that prince to accept the submission of the exiled prelate and to restore him to the undivided dominion of the capital After some ineffectual resistance his rival was expelled from the city by the permission of the emperor and the power of the opposite faction the adherents of Faelix were inhumanly murdered in the streets in the public places in the baths and even in the churches and the face

Rome Alexandria and the other great cities of the empire still contained a strong and powerful faction of Infidels who envied the prosperity and who ridiculed even in their theatres the theological disputes of the church Constantinople alone enjoyed the advantage of being born and educated in the bosom of the faith The capital of the East had never been polluted by the worship of idols and the whole body of the people had deeply imbibed the opinions the virtues and the passions which distinguished the Christians of that age from the rest of mankind After the death of Alexander the episcopal throne was disputed by Paul and Macedonius By their zeal and abilities they both deserved the eminent station to which they aspired and if the moral character of Macedonius was less exceptionable his competitor had the advantage of a prior election and a more orthodox doctrine His firm attachment to the Nicene creed which has given Paul a place in the calendar among saints and martyrs exposed him to the resentment of the Arians In the space of fourteen years he was five times driven from his throne to which he was more frequently restored by the violence of the people than by the permission of the prince and the power of Macedonius could be secured only by the death of his rival The unfortunate Paul was dragged in chains from the sandy deserts of Mesopotamia to the most desolate places of Mount Taurus one hundred fifty confined in a dark and narrow dungeon left six days without food and at length strangled by the order of Philip one of the principal ministers of the emperor Constantius one hundred fifty one The first blood which stained the new capital was spilt in this ecclesiastical contest and many persons were slain on both sides in the furious and obstinate seditions of the people The commission of enforcing a sentence of banishment against Paul had been intrusted to Hermogenes the master general of the cavalry but the execution of it was fatal to himself The Catholics rose in the defence of their bishop the palace of Hermogenes was consumed the first military officer of the empire was dragged by the heels through the streets of Constantinople and after he expired his lifeless corpse was exposed to their wanton insults one hundred fifty two The fate of Hermogenes instructed Philip the Praetorian praefect to act with more precaution on a similar occasion In the most gentle and honorable terms he required the attendance of Paul in the baths of Xeuxippus which had a private communication with the palace and the sea A vessel which lay ready at the garden stairs immediately hoisted sail and while the people were still ignorant of the meditated sacrilege their bishop was already embarked on his voyage to Thessalonica They soon beheld with surprise and indignation the gates of the palace thrown open and the usurper Macedonius seated by the side of the praefect on a lofty chariot which was surrounded by troops of guards with drawn swords The military procession advanced towards the cathedral the Arians and the Catholics eagerly rushed to occupy that important post and three thousand one hundred and fifty persons lost their lives in the confusion of the tumult Macedonius who was supported by a regular force obtained a decisive victory but his reign was disturbed by clamor and sedition and the causes which appeared the least connected with the subject of dispute were sufficient to nourish and to kindle the flame of civil discord As the chapel in which the body of the great Constantine had been deposited was in a ruinous condition the bishop transported those venerable remains into the church of saint Acacius This prudent and even pious measure was represented as a wicked profanation by the whole party which adhered to the Homoousian doctrine The factions immediately flew to arms the consecrated ground was used as their field of battle and one of the ecclesiastical historians has observed as a real fact not as a figure of rhetoric that the well before the church overflowed with a stream of blood which filled the porticos and the adjacent courts The writer who should impute these tumults solely to a religious principle would betray a very imperfect knowledge of human nature yet it must be confessed that the motive which misled the sincerity of zeal and the pretence which disguised the licentiousness of passion suppressed the remorse which in another cause would have succeeded to the rage of the Christians at Constantinople one hundred fifty three Footnote one hundred fifty Cucusus was the last stage of his life and

without adding fables and miracles is entitled to some commendation Chapter XXI Persecution Of Heresy State Of The Church Part VII The cruel and arbitrary disposition of Constantius which did not always require the provocations of guilt and resistance was justly exasperated by the tumults of his capital and the criminal behavior of a faction which opposed the authority and religion of their sovereign The ordinary punishments of death exile and confiscation were inflicted with partial vigor and the Greeks still revere the holy memory of two clerks a reader and a sub deacon who were accused of the murder of Hermogenes and beheaded at the gates of Constantinople By an edict of Constantius against the Catholics which has not been judged worthy of a place in the Theodosian code those who refused to communicate with the Arian bishops and particularly with Macedonius were deprived of the immunities of ecclesiastics and of the rights of Christians they were compelled to relinquish the possession of the churches and were strictly prohibited from holding their assemblies within the walls of the city The execution of this unjust law in the provinces of Thrace and Asia Minor was committed to the zeal of Macedonius the civil and military powers were directed to obey his commands and the cruelties exercised by this Semi Arian tyrant in the support of the Homoiousion exceeded the commission and disgraced the reign of Constantius The sacraments of the church were administered to the reluctant victims who denied the vocation and abhorred the principles of Macedonius The rites of baptism were conferred on women and children who for that purpose had been torn from the arms of their friends and parents the mouths of the communicants were held open by a wooden engine while the consecrated bread was forced down their throat the breasts of tender virgins were either burnt with red hot egg shells or inhumanly compressed betweens harp and heavy boards one hundred fifty four The Novatians of Constantinople and the adjacent country by their firm attachment to the Homoousian standard deserved to be confounded with the Catholics themselves Macedonius was informed that a large district of Paphlagonia one hundred fifty five was almost entirely inhabited by those sectaries He resolved either to convert or to extirpate them and as he distrusted on this occasion the efficacy of an ecclesiastical mission he commanded a body of four thousand legionaries to march against the rebels and to reduce the territory of Mantinium under his spiritual dominion The Novatian peasants animated by despair and religious fury boldly encountered the invaders of their country and though many of the Paphlagonians were slain the Roman legions were vanquished by an irregular multitude armed only with scythes and axes and except a few who escaped by an ignominious flight four thousand soldiers were left dead on the field of battle The successor of Constantius has expressed in a concise but lively manner some of the theological calamities which afflicted the empire and more especially the East in the reign of a prince who was the slave of his own passions and of those of his eunuchs Many were imprisoned and persecuted and driven into exile Whole troops of those who are styled heretics were massacred particularly at Cyzicus and at Samosata In Paphlagonia Bithynia Galatia and in many other provinces towns and villages were laid waste and utterly destroyed one hundred fifty six Footnote one hundred fifty four Socrates l ii c twenty seven thirty eight

consumed the vitals of the empire the African provinces were infested by their peculiar enemies the savage fanatics who under the name of Circumcellions formed the strength and scandal of the Donatist party one hundred fifty seven The severe execution of the laws of Constantine had excited a spirit of discontent and resistance the strenuous efforts of his son Constans to restore the unity of the church exasperated the sentiments of mutual hatred which had first occasioned the separation and the methods of force and corruption employed by the two Imperial commissioners Paul and Macarius furnished the schismatics with a specious contrast between the maxims of the apostles and the conduct of their pretended successors one hundred fifty eight The peasants who inhabited the villages of Numidia and Mauritania were a ferocious race who had been imperfectly reduced under the authority of the Roman laws who were imperfectly converted to the Christian faith but who were actuated by a blind and furious enthusiasm in the cause of their Donatist teachers They indignantly supported the exile of their bishops the demolition of their churches and the interruption of their secret assemblies The violence of the officers of justice who were usually sustained by a military guard was sometimes repelled with equal violence and the blood of some popular ecclesiastics which had been shed in the quarrel inflamed their rude followers with an eager desire of revenging the death of these holy martyrs By their own cruelty and rashness the ministers of persecution sometimes provoked their fate and the guilt of an accidental tumult precipitated the criminals into despair and rebellion Driven from their native villages the Donatist peasants assembled in formidable gangs on the edge of the Getulian desert and readily exchanged the habits of labor for a life of idleness and rapine which was consecrated by the name of religion and faintly condemned by the doctors of the sect The leaders of the Circumcellions assumed the title of captains of the saints their principal weapon as they were indifferently provided with swords and spears was a huge and weighty club which they termed an Israelite and the well known sound of Praise be to God which they used as their cry of war diffused consternation over the unarmed provinces of Africa At first their depredations were colored by the plea of necessity but they soon exceeded the measure of subsistence indulged without control their intemperance and avarice burnt the villages which they had pillaged and reigned the licentious tyrants of the open country The occupations of husbandry and the administration of justice were interrupted and as the Circumcellions pretended to restore the primitive equality of mankind and to reform the abuses of civil society they opened a secure asylum for the slaves and debtors who flocked in crowds to their holy standard When they were not resisted they usually contented themselves with plunder but the slightest opposition provoked them to acts of violence and murder and some Catholic priests who had imprudently signalized their zeal were tortured by the fanatics with the most refined and wanton barbarity The spirit of the Circumcellions was not always exerted against their defenceless enemies they engaged and sometimes defeated the troops of the province and in the bloody action of Bagai they attacked in the open field but with unsuccessful valor an advanced guard of the Imperial cavalry The Donatists who were taken in arms received and they soon deserved the same treatment which might have been shown to the wild beasts of the desert The captives died without a murmur either by the sword the axe or the fire and the measures of retaliation were multiplied in a rapid proportion which aggravated the horrors of rebellion and excluded the hope of mutual forgiveness In the beginning of the present century the example of the Circumcellions has been renewed in the persecution the boldness the crimes and the enthusiasm of the Camisards and if the fanatics of Languedoc surpassed those of Numidia by their military achievements the Africans maintained their fierce independence with more resolution and perseverance one hundred fifty nine Footnote one hundred fifty seven See Optatus Milevitanus particularly iii four with the Donatis

tyranny but the rage of the Donatists was inflamed by a frenzy of a very extraordinary kind and which if it really prevailed among them in so extravagant a degree cannot surely be paralleled in any country or in any age Many of these fanatics were possessed with the horror of life and the desire of martyrdom and they deemed it of little moment by what means or by what hands they perished if their conduct was sanctified by the intention of devoting themselves to the glory of the true faith and the hope of eternal happiness one hundred sixty Sometimes they rudely disturbed the festivals and profaned the temples of Paganism with the design of exciting the most zealous of the idolaters to revenge the insulted honor of their gods They sometimes forced their way into the courts of justice and compelled the affrighted judge to give orders for their immediate execution They frequently stopped travellers on the public highways and obliged them to inflict the stroke of martyrdom by the promise of a reward if they consented and by the threat of instant death if they refused to grant so very singular a favor When they were disappointed of every other resource they announced the day on which in the presence of their friends and brethren they should east themselves headlong from some lofty rock and many precipices were shown which had acquired fame by the number of religious suicides In the actions of these desperate enthusiasts who were admired by one party as the martyrs of God and abhorred by the other as the victims of Satan an impartial philosopher may discover the influence and the last abuse of that inflexible spirit which was originally derived from the character and principles of the Jewish nation Footnote one hundred sixty The Donatist suicides alleged in their justification the example of Razias which is related in the fourteenth chapter of the second book of the Maccabees The simple narrative of the intestine divisions which distracted the peace and dishonored the triumph of the church will confirm the remark of a Pagan historian and justify the complaint of a venerable bishop The experience of Ammianus had convinced him that the enmity of the Christians towards each other surpassed the fury of savage beasts against man one hundred sixty one and Gregory Nazianzen most pathetically laments that the kingdom of heaven was converted by discord

measure of good and evil to the hostile sectaries who assumed and bestowed the appellations of orthodox and heretics They had been educated in the same religion and the same civil society Their hopes and fears in the present or in a future life were balanced in the same proportion On either side the error might be innocent the faith sincere the practice meritorious or corrupt Their passions were excited by similar objects and they might alternately abuse the favor of the court or of the people The metaphysical opinions of the Athanasians and the Arians could not influence their moral character and they were alike actuated by the intolerant spirit which has been extracted from the pure and simple maxims of the gospel Footnote one hundred sixty one Nullus infestas hominibus bestias

to enumerate among the causes of the decline of the empire a law of Constantine by which the exercise of the Pagan worship was absolutely suppressed and a considerable part of his subjects was left destitute of priests of temples and of any public religion The zeal of the philosophic historian for the rights of mankind has induced him to acquiesce in the ambiguous testimony of those ecclesiastics who have too lightly ascribed to their favorite hero the merit of a general persecution one hundred sixty four Instead of alleging this imaginary law which would have blazed in the front of the Imperial codes we may safely appeal to the original epistle which Constantine addressed to the followers of the ancient religion at a time when he no longer disguised his conversion nor dreaded the rivals of his throne He invites and exhorts in the most pressing terms the subjects of the Roman empire to imitate the example of their master but he declares that those who still refuse to open their eyes to the celestial light may freely enjoy their temples and their fancied gods A report that the ceremonies of paganism were suppressed is formally contradicted by the emperor himself who wisely assigns as the principle of his moderation the invincible force of habit of prejudice and of superstition one hundred sixty five Without violating the sanctity of his promise without alarming the fears of the Pagans the artful monarch advanced by slow and cautious steps to undermine the irregular and decayed fabric of polytheism The partial acts of severity which he occasionally exercised though they were secretly promoted by a Christian zeal were colored by the fairest pretences of justice and the public good and while Constantine designed to ruin the foundations he seemed to reform the abuses of the ancient religion After the example of the wisest of his predecessors he condemned under the most rigorous penalties the occult and impious arts of divination which excited the vain hopes and sometimes the criminal attempts of those who were discontented with their present condition An ignominious silence was imposed on the oracles which had been publicly convicted of fraud and falsehood the effeminate priests of the Nile were abolished and Constantine discharged the duties of a Roman censor when he gave orders for the demolition of several temples of Phoenicia in which every mode of prostitution was devoutly practised in the face of day and to the honor of Venus one hundred sixty six The Imperial city of Constantinople was in some measure raised at the expense and was adorned with the spoils of the opulent temples of Greece and Asia the sacred property was confiscated the statues of gods and heroes were transported with rude familiarity among a people who considered them as objects not of adoration but of curiosity the gold and silver were restored to circulation and the magistrates the bishops and the eunuchs improved the fortunate occasion of gratifying at once their zeal their avarice and their resentment But these depredations were confined to a small part of the Roman world and the provinces had been long since accustomed to endure the same sacrilegious rapine from the tyranny of princes and proconsuls who could not be suspected of any design to subvert the established religion one hundred sixty seven Footnote one hundred sixty

Bacchanals and the demolition of the temple of Isis by the magistrates of Pagan Rome Footnote one hundred sixty seven Eusebius in Vit Constan l iii c fifty four fifty eight and Libanius Orat pro Templis p nine ten edit Gothofred both mention the pious sacrilege of Constantine which they viewed in very different lights The latter expressly declares that he made use of the sacred money but made no alteration in the legal worship the temples indeed were impoverished but the sacred rites were performed there Lardner s Jewish and Heathen Testimonies vol iv p one hundred forty The sons of Constantine trod in the footsteps of their father with more zeal and with less discretion The pretences of rapine and oppression were insensibly multiplied one hundred sixty eight every indulgence was shown to the illegal behavior of the Christians every doubt was explained to the disadvantage of Paganism and the demolition of the temples was celebrated as one of the auspicious events of the reign of Constans and Constantius one hundred sixty nine The name of Constantius is prefixed to a concise law which might have superseded the necessity of any future prohibitions It is our pleasure that in all places and in all cities the temples be immediately shut and carefully guarded that none may have the power of offending It is likewise our pleasure that all our subjects should abstain from sacrifices If any one should be guilty of such an act let him feel the sword of vengeance and after his execution let his property be confiscated to the public use We denounce the same penalties against the governors of the provinces if they neglect to punish the criminals one hundred seventy But there is the strongest reason to believe that this formidable edict was either composed without being published or was published without being executed The evidence of facts and the monuments which are still extant of brass and marble continue to prove the public exercise of the Pagan worship during the whole reign of the sons of Constantine In the East as well as in the West in cities as well as in the country a great number of temples were respected or at least were spared and the devout multitude still enjoyed the luxury of sacrifices of festivals and of processions by the permission or by the connivance of the civil government About four years after the supposed date of this bloody edict Constantius visited the temples of Rome and the decency of his behavior is recommended by a pagan orator as an example worthy of the imitation of succeeding princes That emperor says Symmachus suffered the privileges of the vestal virgins to remain inviolate he bestowed the sacerdotal dignities on the nobles of Rome granted the customary allowance to defray the expenses of the public rites and sacrifices and though he had embraced a different religion he never attempted to deprive the empire of the sacred worship of antiquity one hundred seventy one The senate still presumed to consecrate by solemn decrees the divine memory of their sovereigns and Constantine himself was associated after his death to those gods whom he had renounced and insulted during his life The title the ensigns the prerogatives of sovereign pontiff which had been instituted by Numa and assumed by Augustus were accepted without hesitation by seven Christian emperors who were invested with a more absolute authority over the religion which they had deserted than over that which they professed one hundred seventy two Footnote one hundred sixty eight Ammianus xxii four speaks of some court eunuchs who were spoliis templorum pasti Libanius says Orat pro Templ p twenty three that the emperor often gave away a temple like a dog or a horse or a slave or a gold cup but the devout philosopher

one hundred forty four is a very learned and judicious performance which explains the state and prove the toleration of Paganism from Constantino to Gratian The assertion of Zosimus that Gratian was the first who refused the pontifical robe is confirmed beyond a doubt and the murmurs of bigotry on that subject are almost silenced The divisions of Christianity suspended the ruin of Paganism one hundred seventy three and the holy war against the infidels was less vigorously prosecuted by princes and bishops who were more immediately alarmed by the guilt and danger of domestic rebellion The extirpation of idolatry one hundred seventy four might have been justified by the established principles of intolerance but the hostile sects which alternately reigned in the Imperial court were mutually apprehensive of alienating and perhaps exasperating the minds of a powerful though declining faction Every motive of authority and fashion of interest and reason now militated on the side of Christianity but two or three generations elapsed before their victorious influence was universally felt The religion which had so long and so lately been established in the Roman empire was still revered by a numerous people less attached indeed to speculative opinion than to ancient custom The honors of the state and army were indifferently bestowed on all the subjects of Constantine and Constantius and a considerable portion of knowledge and wealth and valor was still engaged in the service of polytheism The superstition of the senator and of the peasant of the poet and the philosopher was derived from very different causes but they met with equal devotion in the temples of the gods Their zeal was insensibly provoked by the insulting triumph of a proscribed sect and their hopes were revived by the well grounded confidence that the presumptive heir of the empire a young and valiant hero who had delivered Gaul from the arms of the Barbarians had secretly embraced the religion of his ancestors Footnote one hundred seventy three As I have freely anticipated the use of pagans and paganism I shall now trace the singular revolutions of those celebrated words one in the Doric dialect so familiar to the Italians signifies a fountain and the rural neighborhood which frequented the same fountain derived the common appellation of pagus and pagans Festus sub voce and Servius ad Virgil Georgic ii three hundred eighty two two By an easy extension of the word pagan and rural became almost synonymous Plin Hist Natur xxviii five and the meaner rustics acquired that name which has been corrupted into peasants in the modern languages of Europe three The amazing increase of the military order introduced the necessity of a correlative term Hume s Essays vol i p five

the sacred and ecclesiastical writers and the reproach of idolatry has stigmatized that visible and abject mode of superstition which some sects of Christianity should not hastily impute to the polytheists of Greece and Rome Chapter XXII Julian Declared Emperor Part I Julian Is Declared Emperor By The Legions Of Gaul His March And Success The Death Of Constantius Civil Administration Of Julian While the Romans languished under the ignominious tyranny of eunuchs and bishops the praises of Julian were repeated with transport in every part of the empire except in the palace of Constantius The barbarians of Germany had felt and still dreaded the arms of the young Caesar his soldiers were the companions of his victory the grateful provincials enjoyed the blessings of his reign but the favorites who had opposed his elevation were offended by his virtues and they justly considered the friend of the people as the enemy of the court As long as the fame of Julian was doubtful the buffoons of the palace who were skilled in the language of satire tried the efficacy of those arts which they had so often practised with success They easily discovered that his simplicity was not exempt from affectation the ridiculous epithets of a hairy savage of an ape invested with the purple were applied to the dress and person of the philosophic warrior and his modest despatches were stigmatized as the vain and elaborate fictions of a loquacious Greek a speculative soldier who had studied the art of war amidst the groves of the academy one The voice of malicious folly was at length silenced by the shouts of victory the conqueror of the Franks and Alemanni could no longer be painted as an object of contempt and the monarch himself was meanly ambitious of stealing from his lieutenant the honorable reward of his labors In the letters crowned with laurel which according to ancient custom were addressed to the provinces the name of Julian was omitted Constantius had made his dispositions in person he had signalized his valor in the foremost ranks his military conduct had secured the victory and the captive king of the barbarians was presented to him on the field of battle from which he was at that time distant about forty days journey two So extravagant a fable was incapable however of deceiving the public credulity or even of satisfying the pride of the emperor himself Secretly conscious that the applause and favor of the Romans accompanied the rising fortunes of Julian his discontented mind was prepared to receive the subtle poison of those artful sycophants who colored their mischievous designs with the fairest appearances of truth and candor three Instead of depreciating the merits of Julian they acknowledged and even exaggerated his popular fame superior talents and important services But they darkly insinuated that the virtues of the Caesar might instantly be converted into the most dangerous crimes if the inconstant multitude should prefer their inclinations to their duty or if the general of a victorious army should be tempted from his allegiance by the hopes of revenge and independent greatness The personal fears of Constantius were interpreted by his council as a laudable anxiety for the public safety whilst in private and perhaps in his own breast he disguised under the less odious appellation of fear the sentiments of hatred and envy which he had secretly conceived for the inimitable virtues of Julian Footnote one Omnes qui plus poterant in palatio adulandi professores jam docti recte consulta

addressed to the senate of Constantinople Aurelius Victor who published his Abridgment in the last year of Constantius ascribes the German victories to the wisdom of the emperor and the fortune of the Caesar Yet the historian soon afterwards was indebted to the favor or esteem of Julian for the honor of a brass statue and the important offices of consular of the second Pannonia and praefect of the city Ammian xxi ten Footnote three Callido nocendi artificio accusatoriam diritatem laudum titulis peragebant Hae voces fuerunt ad inflammanda odia probria omnibus potentiores See Mamertin in Actione Gratiarum in Vet Panegyr xi five six The apparent tranquillity of Gaul and the imminent danger of the eastern provinces offered a specious pretence for the design which was artfully concerted by the Imperial ministers They resolved to disarm the Caesar to recall those faithful troops who guarded his person and dignity and to employ in a distant war against the Persian monarch the hardy veterans who had vanquished on the banks of the Rhine the fiercest nations of Germany While Julian used the laborious hours of his winter quarters at Paris in the administration of power which in his hands was the exercise of virtue he was surprised by the hasty arrival of a tribune and a notary with positive orders from the emperor which they were directed to execute and he was commanded not to oppose Constantius signified his pleasure that four entire legions the Celtae and Petulants the Heruli and the Batavians should be separated from the standard of Julian under which they had acquired their fame and discipline that in each of the remaining bands three hundred of the bravest youths should be selected and that this numerous detachment the strength of the Gallic army should instantly begin their march and exert their utmost diligence to arrive before the opening of the campaign on the frontiers of Persia four The Caesar foresaw and lamented the consequences of this fatal mandate Most of the auxiliaries who engaged their voluntary service had stipulated that they should never be obliged to pass the Alps The public faith of Rome and the personal honor of Julian had been pledged for the observance of this condition Such an act of treachery and oppression would destroy the confidence and excite the resentment of the independent warriors of Germany who considered truth as the noblest of their virtues and freedom as the most valuable of their possessions The legionaries who enjoyed the title and privileges of Romans were enlisted for the general defence of the republic but those mercenary troops heard with cold indifference the antiquated names of the republic and of Rome Attached either from birth or long habit to the climate and manners of Gaul they loved and admired Julian they despised and perhaps hated the emperor they dreaded the laborious march the Persian arrows and the burning deserts of Asia They claimed as their own the country which they had saved and excused their want of spirit by pleading the sacred and more immediate duty of protecting their families and friends The apprehensions of the Gauls were derived from the knowledge of the impending and inevitable danger As soon as the provinces were exhausted of their military strength the Germans would violate a treaty which had been imposed on their fears and notwithstanding the abilities and valor of Julian the general of a nominal army to whom the public calamities would be imputed must find himself after a vain resistance either a prisoner in the camp of the barbarians or a criminal in the palace of Constantius If Julian complied with the orders which he had received he subscribed his own destruction and that of a people who deserved his affection But a positive refusal was an act of rebellion and a declaration of war The inexorable jealousy of the emperor the peremptory and perhaps insidious nature of his commands left not any room for a fair apology or candid interpretation and the dependent station of the Caesar scarcely allowed him to pause or to deliberate Solitude increased the perplexity of Julian he could no longer apply to the faithful counsels of Sallust who had been removed from his office by the judicious malice of the eunuchs he could not even enforce his representations by the concurrence of the ministers who would have been afraid or ashamed to approve the ruin of Gaul The moment had been chosen when Lupicinus five the general of the cavalry was despatched into Britain to repulse the inroads of the Scots and Picts and Florentius was occupied at Vienna by the assessment of the tribute The latter a crafty and corrupt statesman declining to assume a responsible part on this dangerous occasion eluded the pressing and repeated invitations of Julian who represented to him that in every important measure the presence of the praefect was indispensable in the council of the prince In the mean while the Caesar was oppressed by the rude and importunate solicitations of the Imperial messengers who presumed to suggest that if he expected the return of his ministers he would charge himself with the guilt of the delay and reserve for them the merit of the execution Unable to resist unwilling to comply Julian expressed in the most serious terms his wish and even his intention of resigning the purple which he could not preserve with honor but which he could not abdicate with safety Footnote four The minute interval which may be interposed between the hyeme adulta and the primo vere of Ammianus xx l four instead of allowing a sufficient space for a march of three thousand miles would render the orders of Constantius as extravagant as they were unjust The troops of Gaul could not have reached Syria till the end of autumn The memory of Ammianus must have been inaccurate and his language incorrect Note The late editor of Ammianus attempts to vindicate his author from the charge of inaccuracy It is clear from the whole course of the narrative that Constantius entertained this design of demanding his troops from Julian immediately after the taking of Amida in the autumn of the preceding year and had transmitted his orders into Gaul before it was known that Lupicinus had gone into Britain with the Herulians and Batavians Wagner note to Amm xx four But it seems also clear that the troops were in winter quarters hiemabant when the orders arrived Ammianus can scarcely be acquitted of incorrectness in his language at least M Footnote five Ammianus xx l The valor of Lupicinus and his military skill are acknowledged by the historian who in his affected language accuses the general of exalting the horns of his pride bellowing in a tragic tone and exciting a doubt whether he was more cruel or avaricious The danger from the Scots and Picts was so serious that Julian himself had some thoughts of passing over into the island After a painful conflict Julian was compelled to acknowledge that obedience was the virtue of the most eminent subject and that the sovereign alone was entitled to judge of the public welfare He issued the necessary orders for carrying into execution the commands of Constantius a part of the troops began their march for the Alps and the detachments from the several garrisons moved towards their respective places of assembly They advanced with difficulty through the trembling and affrighted crowds of provincials who attempted to excite their pity by silent despair or loud lamentations while the wives of the soldiers holding their infants in their arms accused the desertion of their husbands in the mixed language of grief of tenderness and of indignation This scene of general distress afflicted the humanity of the Caesar he granted a sufficient number of post wagons to transport the wives and families of the soldiers six endeavored to alleviate the hardships which he was constrained to inflict and increased by the most laudable arts his own popularity and the discontent of the exiled troops The grief of an armed multitude is soon converted into rage their licentious murmurs which every hour were communicated from tent to tent with more boldness and effect prepared their minds for the most daring acts of sedition and by the connivance of their tribunes a seasonable libel was secretly dispersed which painted in lively colors the disgrace of the Caesar the oppression of the Gallic army and the feeble vices of the tyrant of Asia The servants of Constantius were astonished and alarmed by the progress of this dangerous spirit They pressed the Caesar to hasten the departure of the troops but they imprudently rejected the honest and judicious advice of Julian who proposed that they should not march through Paris and suggested the danger and temptation of a last interview Footnote six He granted them the permission of the cursus clavularis or clabularis These post wagons are often mentioned in the Code and were supposed to carry fifteen hundred pounds weight See Vales ad Ammian xx four As soon as the approach of the troops was announced the Caesar went out to meet them and ascended his tribunal which had been erected in a plain before the gates of the city After distinguishing the officers and soldiers who by their rank or merit deserved a peculiar attention Julian addressed himself in a studied oration to the surrounding multitude he celebrated their exploits with grateful applause encouraged them to accept with alacrity the honor of serving under the eye of a powerful and liberal monarch and admonished them that the commands of Augustus required an instant and cheerful obedience The soldiers who were apprehensive of offending their general by an indecent clamor or of belying their sentiments by false and venal acclamations maintained an obstinate silence and after a short pause were dismissed to their quarters The principal officers were entertained by the Caesar who professed in the warmest language of friendship his desire and his inability to reward according to their deserts the brave companions of his victories They retired from the feast full of grief and perplexity and lamented the hardship of their fate which tore them from their beloved general and their native country The only expedient which could prevent their separation was boldly agitated and approved the popular resentment was insensibly moulded into a regular conspiracy their just reasons of complaint were heightened by passion and their passions were inflamed by wine as on the eve of their departure the troops were indulged in licentious festivity At the hour of midnight the impetuous multitude with swords and bows and torches in their hands rushed into the suburbs encompassed the palace seven and careless of future dangers pronounced the fatal and irrevocable words Julian Augustus The prince whose anxious suspense was interrupted by their disorderly acclamations secured the doors against their intrusion and as long as it was in his power secluded his person and dignity from the accidents of a nocturnal tumult At the dawn of day the soldiers whose zeal was irritated by opposition forcibly entered the palace seized with respectful violence the object of their choice guarded Julian with drawn swords through the streets of Paris placed him on the tribunal and with repeated shouts saluted him as their emperor Prudence as well as loyalty inculcated the propriety of resisting their treasonable designs and of preparing for his oppressed virtue the excuse of violence Addressing himself by turns to the multitude and to individuals he sometimes implored their mercy and sometimes expressed his indignation conjured them not to sully the fame of their immortal victories and ventured to promise that if they would immediately return to their allegiance he would undertake to obtain from the emperor not only a free and gracious pardon but even the revocation of the orders which had excited their resentment But the soldiers who were conscious of their guilt chose rather to depend on the gratitude of Julian than on the clemency of the emperor Their zeal was insensibly turned into impatience and their impatience into rage The inflexible Caesar sustained till the third hour of the day their prayers their reproaches and their menaces nor did he yield till he had been repeatedly assured that if he wished to live he must consent to reign He was exalted on a shield in the presence and amidst the unanimous acclamations of the troops a rich military collar which was offered by chance supplied the want of a diadem eight the ceremony was concluded by the promise of a moderate donative and the new emperor overwhelmed with real or affected grief retired into the most secret recesses of his apartment ten Footnote seven Most probably the palace of the baths Thermarum of which a solid and lofty hall still subsists in the Rue de la Harpe The buildings covered a considerable space of the modern quarter of the university and the gardens under the Merovingian kings communicated with the abbey of saint Germain des Prez By the injuries of time and the Normans this ancient palace was reduced in the twelfth century to a maze of ruins whose dark recesses were the scene of licentious love Explicat aula sinus montemque amplectitur alis Multiplici latebra scelerum tersura ruborem

fifty three who in the reign of Julian appears to follow the more respectable authority of Eunapius With such guides we might neglect the abbreviators and ecclesiastical historians The grief of Julian could proceed only from his innocence out his innocence must appear extremely doubtful eleven in the eyes of those who have learned to suspect the motives and the professions of princes His lively and active mind was susceptible of the various impressions of hope and fear of gratitude and revenge of duty and of ambition of the love of fame and of the fear of reproach But it is impossible for us to calculate the respective weight and operation of these sentiments or to ascertain the principles of action which might escape the observation while they guided or rather impelled the steps of Julian himself The discontent of the troops was produced by the malice of his enemies their tumult was the natural effect of interest and of passion and if Julian had tried to conceal a deep design under the appearances of chance he must have employed the most consummate artifice without necessity and probably without success He solemnly declares in the presence of Jupiter of the Sun of Mars of Minerva and of all the other deities that till the close of the evening which preceded his elevation he was utterly ignorant of the designs of the soldiers twelve and it may seem ungenerous to distrust the honor of a hero and the truth of a philosopher Yet the superstitious confidence that Constantius was the enemy and that he himself was the favorite of the gods might prompt him to desire to solicit and even to hasten the auspicious moment of his reign which was predestined to restore the ancient religion of mankind When Julian had received the intelligence of the conspiracy he resigned himself to a short slumber and afterwards related to his friends that he had seen the genius of the empire waiting with some impatience at his door pressing for admittance and reproaching his want of spirit and ambition thirteen Astonished and perplexed he addressed his prayers to the great Jupiter who immediately signified by a clear and manifest omen that he should submit to the will of heaven and of the army The conduct which disclaims the ordinary maxims of reason excites our suspicion and eludes our inquiry Whenever the spirit of fanaticism at once so credulous and so crafty has insinuated itself into a noble mind it insensibly corrodes the vital principles of virtue and veracity Footnote eleven Eutropius a respectable witness uses a doubtful expression consensu militum x fifteen

which before the event he gave credit of a stately tree thrown to the ground of a small plant striking a deep root into the earth Even in his sleep the mind of the Caesar must have been agitated by the hopes and fears of his fortune Zosimus l iii p one hundred fifty five relates a subsequent dream To moderate the zeal of his party to protect the persons of his enemies fourteen to defeat and to despise the secret enterprises which were formed against his life and dignity were the cares which employed the first days of the reign of the new emperor Although he was firmly resolved to maintain the station which he had assumed he was still desirous of saving his country from the calamities of civil war of declining a contest with the superior forces of Constantius and of preserving his own character from the reproach of perfidy and ingratitude Adorned with the ensigns of military and imperial pomp Julian showed himself in the field of Mars to the soldiers who glowed with ardent enthusiasm in the cause of their pupil their leader and their friend He recapitulated their victories lamented their sufferings applauded their resolution animated their hopes and checked their impetuosity nor did he dismiss the assembly till he had obtained a solemn promise from the troops that if the emperor of the East would subscribe an equitable treaty they would renounce any views of conquest and satisfy themselves with the tranquil possession of the Gallic provinces On this foundation he composed in his own name and in that of the army a specious and moderate epistle fifteen which was delivered to Pentadius his master of the offices and to his chamberlain Eutherius two ambassadors whom he appointed to receive the answer and observe the dispositions of Constantius This epistle is inscribed with the modest appellation of Caesar but Julian solicits in a peremptory though respectful manner the confirmation of the title of Augustus He acknowledges the irregularity of his own election while he justifies in some measure the resentment and violence of the troops which had extorted his reluctant consent He allows the supremacy of his brother Constantius and engages to send him an annual present of Spanish horses to recruit his army with a select number of barbarian youths and to accept from his choice a Praetorian praefect of approved discretion and fidelity But he reserves for himself the nomination of his other civil and military officers with the troops the revenue and the sovereignty of the provinces beyond the Alps He admonishes the emperor to consult the dictates of justice to distrust the arts of those venal flatterers who subsist only by the discord of princes and to embrace the offer of a fair and honorable treaty equally advantageous to the republic and to the house of Constantine In this negotiation Julian claimed no more than he already possessed The delegated authority which he had long exercised over the provinces of Gaul Spain and Britain was still obeyed under a name more independent and august The soldiers and the people rejoiced in a revolution which was not stained even with the blood of the guilty Florentius was a fugitive Lupicinus a prisoner The persons who were disaffected to the new government were disarmed and secured and the vacant offices were distributed according to the recommendation of merit by a prince who despised the intrigues of the palace and the clamors of the soldiers sixteen Footnote fourteen The difficult situation of the prince of a rebellious army is finely described by Tacitus Hist one eighty

vigorous preparations for war The army which Julian held in readiness for immediate action was recruited and augmented by the disorders of the times The cruel persecutions of the faction of Magnentius had filled Gaul with numerous bands of outlaws and robbers They cheerfully accepted the offer of a general pardon from a prince whom they could trust submitted to the restraints of military discipline and retained only their implacable hatred to the person and government of Constantius seventeen As soon as the season of the year permitted Julian to take the field he appeared at the head of his legions threw a bridge over the Rhine in the neighborhood of Cleves and prepared to chastise the perfidy of the Attuarii a tribe of Franks who presumed that they might ravage with impunity the frontiers of a divided empire The difficulty as well as glory of this enterprise consisted in a laborious march and Julian had conquered as soon as he could penetrate into a country which former princes had considered as inaccessible After he had given peace to the Barbarians the emperor carefully visited the fortifications along the Qhine from Cleves to Basil surveyed with peculiar attention the territories which he had recovered from the hands of the Alemanni passed through Besancon eighteen which had severely suffered from their fury and fixed his headquarters at Vienna for the ensuing winter The barrier of Gaul was improved and strengthened with additional fortifications and Julian entertained some hopes that the Germans whom he had so often vanquished might in his absence be restrained by the terror of his name Vadomair nineteen was the only prince of the Alemanni whom he esteemed or feared and while the subtle Barbarian affected to observe the faith of treaties the progress of his arms threatened the state with an unseasonable and dangerous war The policy of Julian condescended to surprise the prince of the Alemanni by his own arts and Vadomair who in the character of a friend had incautiously accepted an invitation from the Roman governors was seized in the midst of the entertainment and sent away prisoner into the heart of Spain Before the Barbarians were recovered from their amazement the emperor appeared in arms on the banks of the Rhine and once more crossing the river renewed the deep impressions of terror and respect which had been already

to execute with the utmost diligence their important commission But in their passage through Italy and Illyricum they were detained by the tedious and affected delays of the provincial governors they were conducted by slow journeys from Constantinople to Caesarea in Cappadocia and when at length they were admitted to the presence of Constantius they found that he had already conceived from the despatches of his own officers the most unfavorable opinion of the conduct of Julian and of the Gallic army The letters were heard with impatience the trembling messengers were dismissed with indignation and contempt and the looks gestures the furious language of the monarch expressed the disorder of his soul The domestic connection which might have reconciled the brother and the husband of Helena was recently dissolved by the death of that princess whose pregnancy had been several times fruitless and was at last fatal to herself twenty one The empress Eusebia had preserved to the last moment of her life the warm and even jealous affection which she had conceived for Julian and her mild influence might have moderated the resentment of a prince who since her death was abandoned to his own passions and to the arts of his eunuchs But the terror of a foreign invasion obliged him to suspend the punishment of a private enemy he continued his march towards the confines of Persia and thought it sufficient to signify the conditions which might entitle Julian and his guilty followers to the clemency of their offended sovereign He required that the presumptuous Caesar should expressly renounce the appellation and rank of Augustus which he had accepted from the rebels that he should descend to his former station of a limited and dependent minister that he should vest the powers of the state and army in the hands of those officers who were appointed by the Imperial court and that he should trust his safety to the assurances of pardon which were announced by Epictetus a Gallic bishop and one of the Arian favorites of Constantius Several months were ineffectually consumed in a treaty which was negotiated at the distance of three thousand miles between Paris and Antioch and as soon as Julian perceived that his modest and respectful behavior served only to irritate the pride of an implacable adversary he boldly resolved to commit his life and fortune to the chance of a civil war He gave a public and military audience to the quaestor Leonas the haughty epistle of Constantius was read to the attentive multitude and Julian protested with the most flattering deference that he was ready to resign the title of Augustus if he could obtain the consent of those whom he acknowledged as the authors of his elevation The faint proposal was impetuously silenced and the acclamations of Julian Augustus continue to reign by the authority of the army of the people of the republic which you have saved thundered at once from every part of the field and terrified the pale ambassador of Constantius A part of the letter was afterwards read in which the emperor arraigned the ingratitude of Julian whom he had invested with the honors of the purple whom he had educated with so much care and tenderness whom he had preserved in his infancy when he was left a helpless orphan An orphan interrupted Julian who justified his cause by indulging his passions does the assassin of my family reproach me that I was left an orphan He urges me to revenge those injuries which I have long studied to forget The assembly was dismissed and Leonas who with some difficulty had been protected from the popular fury was sent back to his master with an epistle in which Julian expressed in a strain of the most vehement eloquence the sentiments of contempt of hatred and of resentment which had been suppressed and imbittered by the dissimulation of twenty years After this message which might be considered as a signal of irreconcilable war Julian who some weeks before had celebrated the Christian festival of the Epiphany twenty two made a public declaration that he committed the care of his safety to the Immortal Gods and thus publicly renounced the religion as well as the friendship of Constantius twenty three Footnote twenty one Her remains were sent to Rome and interred near those of her sister Constantina in the suburb of the Via Nomentana Ammian xxi one

materials The situation of Julian required a vigorous and immediate resolution He had discovered from intercepted letters that his adversary sacrificing the interest of the state to that of the monarch had again excited the Barbarians to invade the provinces of the West The position of two magazines one of them collected on the banks of the Lake of Constance the other formed at the foot of the Cottian Alps seemed to indicate the march of two armies and the size of those magazines each of which consisted of six hundred thousand quarters of wheat or rather flour twenty four was a threatening evidence of the strength and numbers of the enemy who prepared to surround him But the Imperial legions were still in their distant quarters of Asia the Danube was feebly guarded and if Julian could occupy by a sudden incursion the important provinces of Illyricum he might expect that a people of soldiers would resort to his standard and that the rich mines of gold and silver would contribute to the expenses of the civil war He proposed this bold enterprise to the assembly of the soldiers inspired them with a just confidence in their general and in themselves and exhorted them to maintain their reputation of being terrible to the enemy moderate to their fellow citizens and obedient to their officers His spirited discourse was received with the loudest acclamations and the same troops which had taken up arms against Constantius when he summoned them to leave Gaul now declared with alacrity that they would follow Julian to the farthest extremities of Europe or Asia The oath of fidelity was administered and the soldiers clashing their shields and pointing their drawn swords to their throats devoted themselves with horrid imprecations to the service of a leader whom they celebrated as the deliverer of Gaul and the conqueror of the Germans twenty five This solemn engagement which seemed to be dictated by affection rather than by duty was singly opposed by Nebridius who had been admitted to the office of Praetorian praefect That faithful minister alone and unassisted asserted the rights of Constantius in the midst of an armed and angry multitude to whose fury he had almost fallen an honorable but useless sacrifice After losing one of his hands by the stroke of a sword he embraced the knees of the prince whom he had offended Julian covered the praefect with his Imperial mantle and protecting him from the zeal of his followers dismissed him to his own house with less respect than was perhaps due to the virtue of an enemy twenty six The high office of Nebridius was bestowed on Sallust and the provinces of Gaul which were now delivered from the intolerable oppression of taxes enjoyed the mild and equitable administration of the friend of Julian who was permitted to practise those virtues which he had instilled into the mind of his pupil twenty seven Footnote twenty four Three hundred myriads or three millions of medimni a corn measure

quodam praeter merita suffragante ad potiorem veniat gradum Ammian xx five Absence did not weaken his regard for Sallust with whose name A D three hundred sixty three he honored the consulship The hopes of Julian depended much less on the number of his troops than on the celerity of his motions In the execution of a daring enterprise he availed himself of every precaution as far as prudence could suggest and where prudence could no longer accompany his steps he trusted the event to valor and to fortune In the neighborhood of Basil he assembled and divided his army twenty eight One body which consisted of ten thousand men was directed under the command of Nevitta general of the cavalry to advance through the midland parts of Rhaetia and Noricum A similar division of troops under the orders of Jovius and Jovinus prepared to follow the oblique course of the highways through the Alps and the northern confines of Italy The instructions to the generals were conceived with energy and precision to hasten their march in close and compact columns which according to the disposition of the ground might readily be changed into any order of battle to secure themselves against the surprises of the night by strong posts and vigilant guards to prevent resistance by their unexpected arrival to elude examination by their sudden departure to spread the opinion of their strength and the terror of his name and to join their sovereign under the walls of Sirmium For himself Julian had reserved a more difficult and extraordinary part He selected three thousand brave and active volunteers resolved like their leader to cast behind them every hope of a retreat at the head of this faithful band he fearlessly plunged into the recesses of the Marcian or Black Forest which conceals the sources of the Danube twenty nine and for many days the fate of Julian was unknown to the world The secrecy of his march his diligence and vigor surmounted every obstacle he forced his way over mountains and morasses occupied the bridges or swam the rivers pursued his direct course thirty without reflecting whether he traversed the territory of the Romans or of the Barbarians and at length emerged between Ratisbon and Vienna at the place where he designed to embark his troops on the Danube By a well concerted stratagem he seized a fleet of light brigantines thirty one as it lay at anchor secured a apply of coarse provisions sufficient to satisfy the indelicate and voracious appetite of a Gallic army and boldly committed himself to the stream of the Danube The labors of the mariners who plied their oars with incessant diligence and the steady continuance of a favorable wind carried his fleet above seven hundred miles in eleven days thirty two and he had already disembarked his troops at Bononia thirty twoa only nineteen miles from Sirmium before his enemies could receive any certain intelligence that he had left the banks of the Rhine In the course of this long and rapid navigation the mind of Julian was fixed on the object of his enterprise and though he accepted the deputations of some cities which hastened to claim the merit of an early submission he passed before the hostile stations which were placed along the river without indulging the temptation of signalizing a useless and ill timed valor The banks of the Danube were crowded on either side with spectators who gazed on the military pomp anticipated the importance of the event and diffused through the adjacent country the fame of a young hero who advanced with more than mortal speed at the head of the innumerable forces of the West Lucilian who with the rank of general of the cavalry commanded the military powers of Illyricum was alarmed and perplexed by the doubtful reports which he could neither reject nor believe He had taken some slow and irresolute measures for the purpose of collecting his troops when he was surprised by Dagalaiphus an active officer whom Julian as soon as he landed at Bononia had pushed forwards with some light infantry The captive general uncertain of his life or death was hastily thrown upon a horse and conducted to the presence of Julian who kindly raised him from the ground and dispelled the terror and amazement which seemed to stupefy his faculties But Lucilian had no sooner recovered his spirits than he betrayed his want of discretion by presuming to admonish his conqueror that he had rashly ventured with a handful of men to expose his person in the midst of his enemies Reserve for your master Constantius these timid remonstrances replied Julian with a smile of contempt when I gave you my purple to kiss I received you not as a counsellor but as a suppliant Conscious that success alone could justify his attempt and that boldness only could command success he instantly advanced at the head of three thousand soldiers to attack the strongest and most populous city of the Illyrian provinces As he entered the long suburb of Sirmium he was received by the joyful acclamations of the army and people who crowned with flowers and holding lighted tapers in their hands conducted their acknowledged sovereign to his Imperial residence Two days were devoted to the public joy which was celebrated by the games of the circus but early on the morning of the third day Julian marched to occupy the narrow pass of Succi in the defiles of Mount Haemus which almost in the midway between Sirmium and Constantinople separates the provinces of Thrace and Dacia by an abrupt descent towards the former and a gentle declivity on the side of the latter thirty three The defence of this important post was intrusted to the brave Nevitta who as well as the generals of the Italian division successfully executed the plan of the march and junction which their master had so ably conceived thirty four Footnote twenty eight Ammianus xxi eight ascribes the same practice and the same motive to Alexander the Great and other skilful generals Footnote twenty nine This wood was a part of the great Hercynian forest which is the time of Caesar stretched away from the country of the Rauraci Basil into the boundless regions of the

four Whatever circumstances we may borrow elsewhere Ammianus xx eight nine ten still supplies the series of the narrative The homage which Julian obtained from the fears or the inclination of the people extended far beyond the immediate effect of his arms thirty five The praefectures of Italy and Illyricum were administered by Taurus and Florentius who united that important office with the vain honors of the consulship and as those magistrates had retired with precipitation to the court of Asia Julian who could not always restrain the levity of his temper stigmatized their flight by adding in all the Acts of the Year the epithet of fugitive to the names of the two consuls The provinces which had been deserted by their first magistrates acknowledged the authority of an emperor who conciliating the qualities of a soldier with those of a philosopher was equally admired in the camps of the Danube and in the cities of Greece From his palace or more properly from his head quarters of Sirmium and Naissus he distributed to the principal cities of the empire a labored apology for his own conduct published the secret despatches of Constantius and solicited the judgment of mankind between two competitors the one of whom had expelled and the other had invited the Barbarians thirty six Julian whose mind was deeply wounded by the reproach of ingratitude aspired to maintain by argument as well as by arms the superior merits of his cause and to excel not only in the arts of war but in those of composition His epistle to the senate and people of Athens thirty seven seems to have been dictated by an elegant enthusiasm which prompted him to submit his actions and his motives to the degenerate Athenians of his own times with the same humble deference as if he had been pleading in the days of Aristides before the tribunal of the Areopagus His application to the senate of Rome which was still permitted to bestow the titles of Imperial power was agreeable to the forms of the expiring republic An assembly was summoned by Tertullus praefect of the city the epistle of Julian was read and as he appeared to be master of Italy his claims were admitted without a dissenting voice His oblique censure of the innovations of Constantine and his passionate invective against the vices of Constantius were heard with less satisfaction and the senate as if Julian had been present unanimously exclaimed Respect we beseech you the author of your own fortune thirty eight An artful expression which according to the chance of war might be differently explained as a manly reproof of the ingratitude of the usurper or as a flattering confession that a single act of such benefit to the state ought to atone for all the failings of Constantius Footnote thirty five Ammian xxi nine ten Libanius Orat Parent c fifty four p two hundred seventy nine two hundred eighty Zosimus l iii p one hundred fifty six one hundred fifty seven Footnote thirty six Julian ad S P Q

the cities Yet Ammianus xxi four expresses himself with cool and candid hesitation si famoe solius admittenda est fides He specifies however an intercepted letter from Vadomair to Constantius which supposes an intimate correspondence between them disciplinam non habet Footnote thirty seven Zosimus mentions his epistles to the Athenians the Corinthians and the Lacedaemonians The substance was

reverentiam rogamus Ammian xxi ten It is amusing enough to observe the secret conflicts of the senate between flattery and fear See Tacit Hist i eighty five The intelligence of the march and rapid progress of Julian was speedily transmitted to his rival who by the retreat of Sapor had obtained some respite from the Persian war Disguising the anguish of his soul under the semblance of contempt Constantius professed his intention of returning into Europe and of giving chase to Julian for he never spoke of his military expedition in any other light than that of a hunting party thirty nine In the camp of Hierapolis in Syria he communicated this design to his army slightly mentioned the guilt and rashness of the Caesar and ventured to assure them that if the mutineers of Gaul presumed to meet them in the field they would be unable to sustain the fire of their eyes and the irresistible weight of their shout of onset The speech of the emperor was received with military applause and Theodotus the president of the council of Hierapolis requested with tears of adulation that his city might be adorned with the head of the vanquished rebel forty A chosen detachment was despatched away in post wagons to secure if it were yet possible the pass of Succi the recruits the horses the arms and the magazines which had been prepared against Sapor were appropriated to the service of the civil war and the domestic victories of Constantius inspired his partisans with the most sanguine assurances of success The notary Gaudentius had occupied in his name the provinces of Africa the subsistence of Rome was intercepted and the distress of Julian was increased by an unexpected event which might have been productive of fatal consequences Julian had received the submission of two legions and a cohort of archers who were stationed at Sirmium but he suspected with reason the fidelity of those troops which had been distinguished by the emperor and it was thought expedient under the pretence of the exposed state of the Gallic frontier to dismiss them from the most important scene of action They advanced with reluctance as far as the confines of Italy but as they dreaded the length of the way and the savage fierceness of the Germans they resolved by the instigation of one of their tribunes to halt at Aquileia and to erect the banners of Constantius on the walls of that impregnable city The vigilance of Julian perceived at once the extent of the mischief and the necessity of applying an immediate remedy By his order Jovinus led back a part of the army into Italy and the siege of Aquileia was formed with diligence and prosecuted with vigor But the legionaries who seemed to have rejected the yoke of discipline conducted the defence of the place with skill and perseverance vited the rest of Italy to imitate the example of their courage and loyalty and threatened the retreat of Julian if he should be forced to yield to the superior numbers of the armies of the East forty one Footnote thirty nine Tanquam venaticiam praedam caperet hoc enim ad Jeniendum suorum metum subinde praedicabat Ammian xxii seven Footnote forty See the speech and preparations in Ammianus xxi thirteen The vile Theodotus afterwards implored and obtained his pardon from the merciful conqueror who signified his wish of diminishing his enemies and increasing the numbers of his friends xxii fourteen Footnote forty one Ammian xxi seven eleven twelve He seems to describe with superfluous labor the operations of the siege of Aquileia which on this occasion maintained its impregnable fame Gregory Nazianzen Orat iii p sixty eight ascribes this accidental revolt to the wisdom of Constantius whose assured victory he announces with some appearance of truth Constantio quem credebat procul dubio fore victorem nemo enim omnium tunc ab hac constanti sententia discrepebat Ammian xxi seven But the humanity of Julian was preserved from the cruel alternative which he pathetically laments of destroying or of being himself destroyed and the seasonable death of Constantius delivered the Roman empire from the calamities of civil war The approach of winter could not detain the monarch at Antioch and his favorites durst not oppose his impatient desire of revenge A slight fever which was perhaps occasioned by the agitation of his spirits was increased by the fatigues of the journey and Constantius was obliged to halt at the little town of Mopsucrene twelve miles beyond Tarsus where he expired after a short illness in the forty fifth year of his age and the twenty fourth of his reign forty two His genuine character which was composed of pride and weakness of superstition and cruelty has been fully displayed in the preceding narrative of civil and ecclesiastical events The long abuse of power rendered him a considerable object in the eyes of his contemporaries but as personal merit can alone deserve the notice of posterity the last of the sons of Constantine may be dismissed from the world with the remark that he inherited the defects without the abilities of his father Before Constantius expired he is said to have named Julian for his successor nor does it seem improbable that his anxious concern for the fate of a young and tender wife whom he left with child may have prevailed in his last moments over the harsher passions of hatred and revenge Eusebius and his guilty associates made a faint attempt to prolong the reign of the eunuchs by the election of another emperor but their intrigues were rejected with disdain by an army which now abhorred the thought of civil discord and two officers of rank were instantly despatched to assure Julian that every sword in the empire would be drawn for his service The military designs of that prince who had formed three different attacks against Thrace were prevented by this fortunate event Without shedding the blood of his fellow citizens he escaped the dangers of a doubtful conflict and acquired the advantages of a complete victory Impatient to visit the place of his birth and the new capital of the empire he advanced from Naissus through the mountains of Haemus and the cities of Thrace When he reached Heraclea at the distance of sixty miles all Constantinople was poured forth to receive him and he made his triumphal entry amidst the dutiful acclamations of the soldiers the people and the senate At innumerable multitude pressed around him with eager respect and were perhaps disappointed when they beheld the small stature and simple garb of a hero whose unexperienced youth had vanquished the Barbarians of Germany and who had now traversed in a successful career the whole continent of Europe from the shores of the Atlantic to those of the Bosphorus forty three A few days afterwards when the remains of the deceased emperor were landed in the harbor the subjects of Julian applauded the real or affected humanity of their sovereign On foot without his diadem and clothed in a mourning habit he accompanied the funeral as far as the church of the Holy Apostles where the body was deposited and if these marks of respect may be interpreted as a selfish tribute to the birth and dignity of his Imperial kinsman the tears of Julian professed to the world that he had forgot the injuries and remembered only the obligations which he had received from Constantius forty four As soon as the legions of Aquileia were assured of the death of the emperor they opened the gates of the city and by the sacrifice of their guilty leaders obtained an easy pardon from the prudence or lenity of Julian who in the thirty second year of his age acquired the undisputed possession of the Roman empire forty five Footnote forty two His death and character are faithfully delineated by Ammianus xxi fourteen fifteen sixteen and we are authorized to despise and detest the foolish calumny of Gregory Orat iii p sixty eight who accuses Julian of contriving the death of his benefactor The private repentance of the emperor that he had spared and promoted Julian p sixty nine and Orat xxi p three hundred eighty nine is not improbable in itself nor incompatible with the public verbal testament which prudential considerations might dictate in the last moments of his life Note Wagner thinks this sudden change of sentiment altogether a fiction of the attendant courtiers and chiefs of the army who up to this time had been hostile to Julian Note in loco Ammian M Footnote forty three In describing the triumph of Julian Ammianus xxii l two assumes the lofty tone of an orator or poet while Libanius Orat Parent c fifty six p two hundred eighty one sinks to the grave simplicity of an historian Footnote forty four The funeral of Constantius is described by Ammianus xxi sixteen Gregory Nazianzen Orat iv p one hundred nineteen Mamertinus in Panegyr Vet xi twenty seven Libanius Orat Parent c lvi p two hundred eighty three and Philostorgius l vi c six with Godefroy s Dissertations p two hundred sixty five These writers and their followers Pagans Catholics Arians beheld with very different eyes both the dead and the living emperor Footnote forty five The day and year of the birth of Julian are not perfectly ascertained The day is probably the sixth of November and the year must be either three hundred thirty one or three hundred thirty two Tillemont Hist des Empereurs tom iv p six hundred ninety three Ducange Fam Byzantin p fifty I have preferred the earlier date Chapter XXII Julian Declared Emperor Part III Philosophy had instructed Julian to compare the advantages of action and retirement but the elevation of his birth and the accidents of his life never allowed him the freedom of choice He might perhaps sincerely have preferred the groves of the academy and the society of Athens but he was constrained at first by the will and afterwards by the injustice of Constantius to expose his person and fame to the dangers of Imperial greatness and to make himself accountable to the world and to posterity for the happiness of millions forty six Julian recollected with terror the observation of his master Plato forty seven that the government of our flocks and herds is always committed to beings of a superior species and that the conduct of nations requires and deserves the celestial powers of the gods or of the genii From this principle he justly concluded that the man who presumes to reign should aspire to the perfection of the divine nature that he should purify his soul from her mortal and terrestrial part that he should extinguish his appetites enlighten his understanding regulate his passions and subdue the wild beast which according to the lively metaphor of Aristotle forty eight seldom fails to ascend the throne of a despot The throne of Julian which the death of Constantius fixed on an independent basis was the seat of reason of virtue and perhaps of vanity He despised the honors renounced the pleasures and discharged with incessant diligence the duties of his exalted station and there were few among his subjects who would have consented to relieve him from the weight of the diadem had they been obliged to submit their time and their actions to the rigorous laws which that philosophic emperor imposed on himself One of his most intimate friends forty nine who had often shared the frugal simplicity of his table has remarked that his light and sparing diet which was usually of the vegetable kind left his mind and body always free and active for the various and important business of an author a pontiff a magistrate a general and a prince In one and the same day he gave audience to several ambassadors and wrote or dictated a great number of letters to his generals his civil magistrates his private friends and the different cities of his dominions He listened to the memorials which had been received considered the subject of the petitions and signified his intentions more rapidly than they could be taken in short hand by the diligence of his secretaries He possessed such flexibility of thought and such firmness of attention that he could employ his hand to write his ear to listen and his voice to dictate and pursue at once three several trains of ideas without hesitation and without error While his ministers reposed the prince flew with agility from one labor to another and after a hasty dinner retired into his library till the public business which he had appointed for the evening summoned him to interrupt the prosecution of his studies The supper of the emperor was still less substantial than the former meal his sleep was never clouded by the fumes of indigestion and except in the short interval of a marriage which was the effect of policy rather than love the chaste Julian never shared his bed with a female companion fifty He was soon awakened by the entrance of fresh secretaries who had slept the preceding day and his servants were obliged to wait alternately while their indefatigable master allowed himself scarcely any other refreshment than the change of occupation The predecessors of Julian his uncle his brother and his cousin indulged their puerile taste for the games of the Circus under the specious pretence of complying with the inclinations of the people and they frequently remained the greatest part of the day as idle spectators and as a part of the splendid spectacle till the ordinary round of twenty four races fifty one was completely finished On solemn festivals Julian who felt and professed an unfashionable dislike to these frivolous amusements condescended to appear in the Circus and after bestowing a careless glance at five or six of the races he hastily withdrew with the impatience of a philosopher who considered every moment as lost that was not devoted to the advantage of the public or the improvement of his own mind fifty two By this avarice of time he seemed to protract the short duration of his reign and if the dates were less securely ascertained we should refuse to believe that only sixteen months elapsed between the death of Constantius and the departure of his successor for the Persian war The actions of Julian can only be preserved by the care of the historian but the portion of his voluminous writings which is still extant remains as a monument of the application as well as of the genius of the emperor The Misopogon the Caesars several of his orations and his elaborate work against the Christian religion were composed in the long nights of the two winters the former of which he passed at Constantinople and the latter at Antioch Footnote forty six Julian himself p two hundred fifty three two hundred sixty seven has expressed these philosophical ideas with much eloquence and some affectation in a very elaborate epistle to Themistius The Abbe de la Bleterie tom ii p one hundred forty six one hundred ninety three who has given an elegant translation is inclined to believe that it was the celebrated Themistius whose orations are still extant Footnote forty seven Julian ad Themist p two hundred fifty eight Petavius not p ninety five observes that this passage is taken from the fourth book De Legibus but either Julian quoted from memory or his MSS were different from ours Xenophon opens the Cyropaedia with a similar reflection Footnote forty eight Aristot ap Julian p two hundred sixty one The MS of Vossius unsatisfied with the single beast affords the stronger reading of which the experience of despotism may warrant Footnote forty nine Libanius Orat Parentalis c lxxxiv lxxxv p three hundred ten three hundred eleven three hundred twelve has given this interesting detail of the private life of Julian He himself in Misopogon p three hundred fifty mentions his vegetable diet and upbraids the gross and sensual appetite of the people of Antioch Footnote fifty Lectulus Vestalium toris purior is the praise which Mamertinus Panegyr Vet xi thirteen addresses to Julian himself Libanius affirms in sober peremptory language that Julian never knew a woman before his marriage or after the death of his wife Orat Parent c lxxxviii p three hundred thirteen The chastity of Julian is confirmed by the impartial testimony of Ammianus xxv four and the partial silence of the Christians Yet Julian ironically urges the reproach of the people of Antioch that he almost always in Misopogon p three hundred forty five lay alone This suspicious expression is explained by the Abbe de la Bleterie Hist de Jovien tom ii p one hundred three one hundred nine with candor and ingenuity Footnote fifty one See Salmasius ad Sueton in Claud c xxi A twenty fifth race or missus was added to complete the number of one hundred chariots four of which the four colors started each heat Centum quadrijugos agitabo ad flumina currus It appears that they ran five or seven times round the Mota Sueton in Domitian c four and from the measure of the Circus Maximus at Rome the Hippodrome at Constantinople c it might be about a four mile course Footnote fifty two Julian in Misopogon p three hundred forty Julius Caesar had offended the Roman people by reading his despatches during the actual race Augustus indulged their taste or his own by his constant attention to the important business of the Circus for which he professed the warmest inclination Sueton in August c xlv The reformation of the Imperial court was one of the first and most necessary acts of the government of Julian fifty three Soon after his entrance into the palace of Constantinople he had occasion for the service of a barber An officer magnificently dressed immediately presented himself It is a barber exclaimed the prince with affected surprise that I want and not a receiver general of the finances fifty four He questioned the man concerning the profits of his employment and was informed that besides a large salary and some valuable perquisites he enjoyed a daily allowance for twenty servants and as many horses A thousand barbers a thousand cup bearers a thousand cooks were distributed in the several offices of luxury and the number of eunuchs could be compared only with the insects of a summer s day The monarch who resigned to his subjects the superiority of merit and virtue was distinguished by the oppressive magnificence of his dress his table his buildings and his train The stately palaces erected by Constantine and his sons were decorated with many colored marbles and ornaments of massy gold The most exquisite dainties were procured to gratify their pride rather than their taste birds of the most distant climates fish from the most remote seas fruits out of their natural season winter roses and summer snows fifty six The domestic crowd of the palace surpassed the expense of the legions yet the smallest part of this costly multitude was subservient to the use or even to the splendor of the throne The monarch was disgraced and the people was injured by the creation and sale of an infinite number of obscure and even titular employments and the most worthless of mankind might purchase the privilege of being maintained without the necessity of labor from the public revenue The waste of an enormous household the increase of fees and perquisites which were soon claimed as a lawful debt and the bribes which they extorted from those who feared their enmity or solicited their favor suddenly enriched these haughty menials They abused their fortune without considering their past or their future condition and their rapine and venality could be equalled only by the extravagance of their dissipations Their silken robes were embroidered with gold their tables were served with delicacy and profusion the houses which they built for their own use would have covered the farm of an ancient consul and the most honorable citizens were obliged to dismount from their horses and respectfully to salute a eunuch whom they met on the public highway The luxury of the palace excited the contempt and indignation of Julian who usually slept on the ground who yielded with reluctance to the indispensable calls of nature and who placed his vanity not in emulating but in despising the pomp of royalty Footnote fifty three The reformation of the palace is described by Ammianus xxii four Libanius Orat Parent c lxii p two hundred eighty

image of a senator Yet an officer of the finances who was satisfied with wealth might desire and obtain the honors of the senate Footnote fifty six The expressions of Mamertinus are lively and forcible Quis etiam prandiorum et caenarum laboratas magnitudines Romanus populus sensit cum quaesitissimae dapes non gustu sed difficultatibus aestimarentur miracula avium longinqui maris pisces aheni temporis poma aestivae nives hybernae rosae By the total extirpation of a mischief which was magnified even beyond its real extent he was impatient to relieve the distress and to appease the murmurs of the people who support with less uneasiness the weight of taxes if they are convinced that the fruits of their industry are appropriated to the service of the state But in the execution of this salutary work Julian is accused of proceeding with too much haste and inconsiderate severity By a single edict he reduced the palace of Constantinople to an immense desert and dismissed with ignominy the whole train of slaves and dependants fifty seven without providing any just or at least benevolent exceptions for the age the services or the poverty of the faithful domestics of the Imperial family Such indeed was the temper of Julian who seldom recollected the fundamental maxim of Aristotle that true virtue is placed at an equal distance between the opposite vices The splendid and effeminate dress of the Asiatics the curls and paint the collars and bracelets which had appeared so ridiculous in the person of Constantine were consistently rejected by his philosophic successor But with the fopperies Julian affected to renounce the decencies of dress and seemed to value himself for his neglect of the laws of cleanliness In a satirical performance which was designed for the public eye the emperor descants with pleasure and even with pride on the length of his nails and the inky blackness of his hands protests that although the greatest part of his body was covered with hair the use of the razor was confined to his head alone and celebrates with visible complacency the shaggy and populous fifty eight beard which he fondly cherished after the example of the philosophers of Greece Had Julian consulted the simple dictates of reason the first magistrate of the Romans would have scorned the affectation of Diogenes as well as that of Darius Footnote fifty seven Yet Julian himself was accused of bestowing whole towns on the eunuchs Orat vii against Polyclet p one hundred seventeen one hundred twenty seven Libanius contents himself with a cold but positive denial of the fact which seems indeed to belong more properly to Constantius This charge however may allude to some unknown circumstance Footnote fifty eight In the Misopogon p three hundred

of the French nation not to translate this passage so offensive to their delicacy Hist de Jovien tom ii p ninety four Like him I have contented myself with a transient allusion but the little animal which Julian names is a beast familiar to man and signifies love But the work of public reformation would have remained imperfect if Julian had only corrected the abuses without punishing the crimes of his predecessor s reign We are now delivered says he in a familiar letter to one of his intimate friends we are now surprisingly delivered from the voracious jaws of the Hydra fifty nine I do not mean to apply the epithet to my brother Constantius He is no more may the earth lie light on his head But his artful and cruel favorites studied to deceive and exasperate a prince whose natural mildness cannot be praised without some efforts of adulation It is not however my intention that even those men should be oppressed they are accused and they shall enjoy the benefit of a fair and impartial trial To conduct this inquiry Julian named six judges of the highest rank in the state and army and as he wished to escape the reproach of condemning his personal enemies he fixed this extraordinary tribunal at Chalcedon on the Asiatic side of the Bosphorus and transferred to the commissioners an absolute power to pronounce and execute their final sentence without delay and without appeal The office of president was exercised by the venerable praefect of the East a second Sallust sixty whose virtues conciliated the esteem of Greek sophists and of Christian bishops He was assisted by the eloquent Mamertinus sixty one one of the consuls elect whose merit is loudly celebrated by the doubtful evidence of his own applause But the civil wisdom of two magistrates was overbalanced by the ferocious violence of four generals Nevitta Agilo Jovinus and Arbetio Arbetio whom the public would have seen with less surprise at the bar than on the bench was supposed to possess the secret of the commission the armed and angry leaders of the Jovian and Herculian bands encompassed the tribunal and the judges were alternately swayed by the laws of justice and by the clamors of faction sixty two Footnote fifty nine Julian epist xxiii p three hundred eighty nine He uses the words in writing to his friend Hermogenes who like himself was conversant with the Greek poets Footnote sixty The two Sallusts the praefect of Gaul and the praefect of the East must be carefully distinguished Hist des Empereurs tom iv p six hundred ninety six I have used the surname of

related by Ammianus xxii three and praised by Libanius Orat Parent c seventy four p two hundred ninety nine three hundred The chamberlain Eusebius who had so long abused the favor of Constantius expiated by an ignominious death the insolence the corruption and cruelty of his servile reign The executions of Paul and Apodemius the former of whom was burnt alive were accepted as an inadequate atonement by the widows and orphans of so many hundred Romans whom those legal tyrants had betrayed and murdered But justice herself if we may use the pathetic expression of Ammianus sixty three appeared to weep over the fate of Ursulus the treasurer of the empire and his blood accused the ingratitude of Julian whose distress had been seasonably relieved by the intrepid liberality of that honest minister The rage of the soldiers whom he had provoked by his indiscretion was the cause and the excuse of his death and the emperor deeply wounded by his own reproaches and those of the public offered some consolation to the family of Ursulus by the restitution of his confiscated fortunes Before the end of the year in which they had been adorned with the ensigns of the prefecture and consulship sixty four Taurus and Florentius were reduced to implore the clemency of the inexorable tribunal of Chalcedon The former was banished to Vercellae in Italy and a sentence of death was pronounced against the latter A wise prince should have rewarded the crime of Taurus the faithful minister when he was no longer able to oppose the progress of a rebel had taken refuge in the court of his benefactor and his lawful sovereign But the guilt of Florentius justified the severity of the judges and his escape served to display the magnanimity of Julian who nobly checked the interested diligence of an informer and refused to learn what place concealed the wretched fugitive from his just resentment sixty five Some months after the tribunal of Chalcedon had been dissolved the praetorian vicegerent of Africa the notary Gaudentius and Artemius sixty six duke of Egypt were executed at Antioch Artemius had reigned the cruel and corrupt tyrant of a great province Gaudentius had long practised the arts of calumny against the innocent the virtuous and even the person of Julian himself Yet the circumstances of their trial and condemnation were so unskillfully managed that these wicked men obtained in the public opinion the glory of suffering for the obstinate loyalty with which they had supported the cause of Constantius The rest of his servants were protected by a general act of oblivion and they were left to enjoy with impunity the bribes which they had accepted either to defend the oppressed or to oppress the friendless This measure which on the soundest principles of policy may deserve our approbation was executed in a manner which seemed to degrade the majesty of the throne Julian was tormented by the importunities of a multitude particularly of Egyptians who loudly redemanded the gifts which they had imprudently or illegally bestowed he foresaw the endless prosecution of vexatious suits and he engaged a promise which ought always to have been sacred that if they would repair to Chalcedon he would meet them in person to hear and determine their complaints But as soon as they were landed he issued an absolute order which prohibited the watermen from transporting any Egyptian to Constantinople and thus detained his disappointed clients on the Asiatic shore till their patience and money being utterly exhausted they were obliged to return with indignant murmurs to their native country sixty seven Footnote sixty three Ursuli vero necem ipsa mihi videtur flesse justitia Libanius who imputes his death to the soldiers attempts to criminate the court of the largesses Footnote sixty four Such respect was still entertained for the venerable names of the commonwealth that the public was surprised and scandalized to hear Taurus summoned as a criminal under the consulship of Taurus The summons of his colleague Florentius was probably delayed till the commencement of the ensuing year Footnote sixty five Ammian xx seven Footnote sixty six For the guilt and punishment of Artemius see Julian Epist x p three hundred seventy nine and Ammianus xxii six and Vales ad hoc The merit of Artemius who demolished temples and was put to death by an apostate has tempted the Greek and Latin churches to honor him as a martyr But as ecclesiastical history attests that he was not only a tyrant but an Arian it is not altogether easy to justify this indiscreet promotion Tillemont Mem Eccles tom vii p thirteen nineteen Footnote sixty seven See Ammian xxii six and Vales ad locum and the Codex Theodosianus l ii tit xxxix leg i and Godefroy s Commentary tom i p two hundred eighteen ad locum Chapter XXII Julian Declared Emperor Part IV The numerous army of spies of agents and informers enlisted by Constantius to secure the repose of one man and to interrupt that of millions was immediately disbanded by his generous successor Julian was slow in his suspicions and gentle in his punishments and his contempt of treason was the result of judgment of vanity and of courage Conscious of superior merit he was persuaded that few among his subjects would dare to meet him in the field to attempt his life or even to seat themselves on his vacant throne The philosopher could excuse the hasty sallies of discontent and the hero could despise the ambitious projects which surpassed the fortune or the abilities of the rash conspirators A citizen of Ancyra had prepared for his own use a purple garment and this indiscreet action which under the reign of Constantius would have been considered as a capital offence sixty eight was reported to Julian by the officious importunity of a private enemy

consul The moment he was reminded that he had trespassed on the jurisdiction of another magistrate he condemned himself to pay a fine of ten pounds of gold and embraced this public occasion of declaring to the world that he was subject like the rest of his fellow citizens to the laws seventy five and even to the forms of the republic The spirit of his administration and his regard for the place of his nativity induced Julian to confer on the senate of Constantinople the same honors privileges and authority which were still enjoyed by the senate of ancient Rome seventy six A legal fiction was introduced and gradually established that one half of the national council had migrated into the East and the despotic successors of Julian accepting the title of Senators acknowledged themselves the members of a respectable body which was permitted to represent the majesty of the Roman name From Constantinople the attention of the monarch was extended to the municipal senates of the provinces He abolished by repeated edicts the unjust and pernicious exemptions which had withdrawn so many idle citizens from the services of their country and by imposing an equal distribution of public duties he restored the strength the splendor or according to the glowing expression of Libanius seventy seven the soul of the expiring cities of his empire The venerable age of Greece excited the most tender compassion in the mind of Julian which kindled into rapture when he recollected the gods the heroes and the men superior to heroes and to gods who have bequeathed to the latest posterity the monuments of their genius or the example of their virtues He relieved the distress and restored the beauty of the cities of Epirus and Peloponnesus seventy eight Athens acknowledged him for her benefactor Argos for her deliverer The pride of Corinth again rising from her ruins with the honors of a Roman colony exacted a tribute from the adjacent republics for the purpose of defraying the games of the Isthmus which were celebrated in the amphitheatre with the hunting of bears and panthers From this tribute the cities of Elis of Delphi and of Argos which had inherited from their remote ancestors the sacred office of perpetuating the Olympic the Pythian and the Nemean games claimed a just exemption The immunity of Elis and Delphi was respected by the Corinthians but the poverty of Argos tempted the insolence of oppression and the feeble complaints of its deputies were silenced by the decree of a provincial magistrate who seems to have consulted only the interest of the capital in which he resided Seven years after this sentence Julian seventy nine allowed the cause to be referred to a superior tribunal and his eloquence was interposed most probably with success in the defence of a city which had been the royal seat of Agamemnon eighty and had given to Macedonia a race of kings and conquerors eighty one Footnote seventy According to some says Aristotle as he is quoted by Julian ad Themist p two hundred sixty one the form of absolute government is contrary to nature Both the prince and the philosopher choose how ever to involve this eternal truth in artful and labored obscurity Footnote seventy one That sentiment is expressed almost in the words of Julian himself Ammian xxii ten Footnote seventy two Libanius Orat Parent c ninety five p three hundred

were obscure and unpopular in Greece When the Achaean league declared against Philip it was thought decent that the deputies of Argos should retire T Liv xxxii twenty two The laborious administration of military and civil affairs which were multiplied in proportion to the extent of the empire exercised the abilities of Julian but he frequently assumed the two characters of Orator eighty two and of Judge eighty three which are almost unknown to the modern sovereigns of Europe The arts of persuasion so diligently cultivated by the first Caesars were neglected by the military ignorance and Asiatic pride of their successors and if they condescended to harangue the soldiers whom they feared they treated with silent disdain the senators whom they despised The assemblies of the senate which Constantius had avoided were considered by Julian as the place where he could exhibit with the most propriety the maxims of a republican and the talents of a rhetorician He alternately practised as in a school of declamation the several modes of praise of censure of exhortation and his friend Libanius has remarked that the study of Homer taught him to imitate the simple concise style of Menelaus the copiousness of Nestor whose words descended like the flakes of a winter s snow or the pathetic and forcible eloquence of Ulysses The functions of a judge which are sometimes incompatible with those of a prince were exercised by Julian not only as a duty but as an amusement and although he might have trusted the integrity and discernment of his Praetorian praefects he often placed himself by their side on the seat of judgment The acute penetration of his mind was agreeably occupied in detecting and defeating the chicanery of the advocates who labored to disguise the truths of facts and to pervert the sense of the laws He sometimes forgot the gravity of his station asked indiscreet or unseasonable questions and betrayed by the loudness of his voice and the agitation of his body the earnest vehemence with which he maintained his opinion against the judges the advocates and their clients But his knowledge of his own temper prompted him to encourage and even to solicit the reproof of his friends and ministers and whenever they ventured to oppose the irregular sallies of his passions the spectators could observe the shame as well as the gratitude of their monarch The decrees of Julian were almost always founded on the principles of justice and he had the firmness to resist the two most dangerous temptations which assault the tribunal of a sovereign under the specious forms of compassion and equity He decided the merits of the cause without weighing the circumstances of the parties and the poor whom he wished to relieve were condemned to satisfy the just demands of a wealthy and noble adversary He carefully distinguished the judge from the legislator eighty four and though he meditated a necessary reformation of the Roman jurisprudence he pronounced sentence according to the strict and literal interpretation of those laws which the magistrates were bound to execute and the subjects to obey Footnote eighty two His eloquence is celebrated by Libanius Orat Parent c seventy five seventy six p three hundred three hundred one who distinctly mentions the orators of Homer Socrates l iii c one has rashly asserted that Julian was the only prince since Julius Caesar who harangued the senate All the predecessors of Nero Tacit Annal xiii three and many of his successors possessed the faculty of speaking in public and it might be proved by various examples

suppresses the virtues and exaggerates even the venial faults of the Apostate triumphantly asks whether such a judge was fit to be seated between Minos and Rhadamanthus in the Elysian Fields Footnote eighty four Of the laws which Julian enacted in a reign of sixteen months fifty four have been admitted into the codes of Theodosius and Justinian Gothofred Chron Legum p sixty four sixty seven The Abbe de la Bleterie tom ii p three hundred twenty nine three hundred thirty six has chosen one of these laws to give an idea of Julian s Latin style which is forcible and elaborate but less pure than his Greek The generality of princes if they were stripped of their purple and cast naked into the world would immediately sink to the lowest rank of society without a hope of emerging from their obscurity But the personal merit of Julian was in some measure independent of his fortune Whatever had been his choice of life by the force of intrepid courage lively wit and intense application he would have obtained or at least he would have deserved the highest honors of his profession and Julian might have raised himself to the rank of minister or general of the state in which he was born a private citizen If the jealous caprice of power had disappointed his expectations if he had prudently declined the paths of greatness the employment of the same talents in studious solitude would have placed beyond the reach of kings his present happiness and his immortal fame When we inspect with minute or perhaps malevolent attention the portrait of Julian something seems wanting to the grace and perfection of the whole figure His genius was less powerful and sublime than that of Caesar nor did he possess the consummate prudence of Augustus The virtues of Trajan appear more steady and natural and the philosophy of Marcus is more simple and consistent Yet Julian sustained adversity with firmness and prosperity with moderation After an interval of one hundred and twenty years from the death of Alexander Severus the Romans beheld an emperor who made no distinction between his duties and his pleasures who labored to relieve the distress and to revive the spirit of his subjects and who endeavored always to connect authority with merit and happiness with virtue Even faction and religious faction was constrained to acknowledge the superiority of his genius in peace as well as in war and to confess with a sigh that the apostate Julian was a lover of his country and that he deserved the empire of the world eighty five Footnote eighty five Ductor fortissimus armis Conditor et legum

consciousness of a generous sentiment seems to have raised the Christian post above his usual mediocrity Chapter XXIII Reign Of Julian Part I The Religion Of Julian Universal Toleration He Attempts To Restore And Reform The Pagan Worship To Rebuild The Temple Of Jerusalem His Artful Persecution Of The Christians Mutual Zeal And Injustice The character of Apostate has injured the reputation of Julian and the enthusiasm which clouded his virtues has exaggerated the real and apparent magnitude of his faults Our partial ignorance may represent him as a philosophic monarch who studied to protect with an equal hand the religious factions of the empire and to allay the theological fever which had inflamed the minds of the people from the edicts of Diocletian to the exile of Athanasius A more accurate view of the character and conduct of Julian will remove this favorable prepossession for a prince who did not escape the general contagion of the times We enjoy the singular advantage of comparing the pictures which have been delineated by his fondest admirers and his implacable enemies The actions of Julian are faithfully related by a judicious and candid historian the impartial spectator of his life and death The unanimous evidence of his contemporaries is confirmed by the public and private declarations of the emperor himself and his various writings express the uniform tenor of his religious sentiments which policy would have prompted him to dissemble rather than to affect A devout and sincere attachment for the gods of Athens and Rome constituted the ruling passion of Julian one the powers of an enlightened understanding were betrayed and corrupted by the influence of superstitious prejudice and the phantoms which existed only in the mind of the emperor had a real and pernicious effect on the government of the empire The vehement zeal of the Christians who despised the worship and overturned the altars of those fabulous deities engaged their votary in a state of irreconcilable hostility with a very numerous party of his subjects and he was sometimes tempted by the desire of victory or the shame of a repulse to violate the laws of prudence and even of justice The triumph of the party which he deserted and opposed has fixed a stain of infamy on the name of Julian and the unsuccessful apostate has been overwhelmed with a torrent of pious invectives of which the signal was given by the sonorous trumpet two of Gregory Nazianzen three The interesting nature of the events which were crowded into the short reign of this active emperor deserve a just and circumstantial narrative His motives his counsels and his actions as far as they are connected with the history of religion will be the subject of the present chapter Footnote one I shall transcribe some of his own expressions from a short religious discourse which the Imperial pontiff composed to censure the bold impiety of a Cynic Orat vii p two hundred twelve The variety and copiousness of the Greek tongue seem inadequate to the fervor of his devotion Footnote two The orator with some eloquence much enthusiasm and more vanity addresses his discourse to heaven and earth to men and angels to the living and the dead and above all to the great Constantius an odd Pagan expression He concludes with a bold assurance that he has erected a monument not less durable and much more portable than the columns of Hercules See Greg Nazianzen Orat iii p fifty iv p one hundred thirty four Footnote three See this long invective which has been injudiciously divided into two orations in Gregory s works tom i p forty nine one hundred thirty four Paris sixteen thirty It was published by Gregory and his friend Basil iv p one hundred thirty three about six months after the death of Julian when his remains had been carried to Tarsus iv p one hundred twenty but while Jovian was still on the throne iii p fifty four iv p one hundred seventeen I have derived much assistance from a French version and remarks printed at Lyons seventeen thirty five The cause of his strange and fatal apostasy may be derived from the early period of his life when he was left an orphan in the hands of the murderers of his family The names of Christ and of Constantius the ideas of slavery and of religion were soon associated in a youthful imagination which was susceptible of the most lively impressions The care of his infancy was intrusted to Eusebius bishop of Nicomedia four who was related to him on the side of his mother and till Julian reached the twentieth year of his age he received from his Christian preceptors the education not of a hero but of a saint The emperor less jealous of a heavenly than of an earthly crown contented himself with the imperfect character of a catechumen while he bestowed the advantages of baptism five on the nephews of Constantine six They were even admitted to the inferior offices of the ecclesiastical order and Julian publicly read the Holy Scriptures in the church of Nicomedia The study of religion which they assiduously cultivated appeared to produce the fairest fruits of faith and devotion seven They prayed they fasted they distributed alms to the poor gifts to the clergy and oblations to the tombs of the martyrs and the splendid monument of saint Mamas at Caesarea was erected or at least was undertaken by the joint labor of Gallus and Julian eight They respectfully conversed with the bishops who were eminent for superior sanctity and solicited the benediction of the monks and hermits who had introduced into Cappadocia the voluntary hardships of the ascetic life nine As the two princes advanced towards the years of manhood they discovered in their religious sentiments the difference of their characters The dull and obstinate understanding of Gallus embraced with implicit zeal the doctrines of Christianity which never influenced his conduct or moderated his passions The mild disposition of the younger brother was less repugnant to the precepts of the gospel and his active curiosity might have been gratified by a theological system which explains the mysterious essence of the Deity and opens the boundless prospect of invisible and future worlds But the independent spirit of Julian refused to yield the passive and unresisting obedience which was required in the name of religion by the haughty ministers of the church Their speculative opinions were imposed as positive laws and guarded by the terrors of eternal punishments but while they prescribed the rigid formulary of the thoughts the words and the actions of the young prince whilst they silenced his objections and severely checked the freedom of his inquiries they secretly provoked his impatient genius to disclaim the authority of his ecclesiastical guides He was educated in the Lesser Asia amidst the scandals of the Arian controversy ten The fierce contests of the Eastern bishops the incessant alterations of their creeds and the profane motives which appeared to actuate their conduct insensibly strengthened the prejudice of Julian that they neither understood nor believed the religion for which they so fiercely contended Instead of listening to the proofs of Christianity with that favorable attention which adds weight to the most respectable evidence he heard with suspicion and disputed with obstinacy and acuteness the doctrines for which he already entertained an invincible aversion Whenever the young princes were directed to compose declamations on the subject of the prevailing controversies Julian always declared himself the advocate of Paganism under the specious excuse that in the defence of the weaker cause his learning and ingenuity might be more advantageously exercised and displayed Footnote four Nicomediae ab Eusebio educatus Episcopo quem genere longius contingebat Ammian xxii nine Julian never expresses any gratitude towards that Arian prelate but he celebrates his preceptor the eunuch Mardonius and describes his mode of education which inspired his pupil with a passionate admiration for the genius and perhaps the religion of Homer Misopogon p three hundred fifty one

two hundred six l viii p two hundred fifty three two hundred sixty two You persecute says he those heretics who do not mourn the dead man precisely in the way which you approve He shows himself a tolerable theologian but he maintains that the Christian Trinity is not derived from the doctrine of Paul of Jesus or of Moses As soon as Gallus was invested with the honors of the purple Julian was permitted to breathe the air of freedom of literature and of Paganism eleven The crowd of sophists who were attracted by the taste and liberality of their royal pupil had formed a strict alliance between the learning and the religion of Greece and the poems of Homer instead of being admired as the original productions of human genius were seriously ascribed to the heavenly inspiration of Apollo and the muses The deities of Olympus as they are painted by the immortal bard imprint themselves on the minds which are the least addicted to superstitious credulity Our familiar knowledge of their names and characters their forms and attributes seems to bestow on those airy beings a real and substantial existence and the pleasing enchantment produces an imperfect and momentary assent of the imagination to those fables which are the most repugnant to our reason and experience In the age of Julian every circumstance contributed to prolong and fortify the illusion the magnificent temples of Greece and Asia the works of those artists who had expressed in painting or in sculpture the divine conceptions of the poet the pomp of festivals and sacrifices the successful arts of divination the popular traditions of oracles and prodigies and the ancient practice of two thousand years The weakness of polytheism was in some measure excused by the moderation of its claims and the devotion of the Pagans was not incompatible with the most licentious scepticism twelve Instead of an indivisible and regular system which occupies the whole extent of the believing mind the mythology of the Greeks was composed of a thousand loose and flexible parts and the servant of the gods was at liberty to define the degree and measure of his religious faith The creed which Julian adopted for his own use was of the largest dimensions and by strange contradiction he disdained the salutary yoke of the gospel whilst he made a voluntary offering of his reason on the altars of Jupiter and Apollo One of the orations of Julian is consecrated to the honor of Cybele the mother of the gods who required from her effeminate priests the bloody sacrifice so rashly performed by the madness of the Phrygian boy The pious emperor condescends to relate without a blush and without a smile the voyage of the goddess from the shores of Pergamus to the mouth of the Tyber and the stupendous miracle which convinced the senate and people of Rome that the lump of clay which their ambassadors had transported over the seas was endowed with life and sentiment and divine power thirteen For the truth of this prodigy he appeals to the public monuments of the city and censures with some acrimony the sickly and affected taste of those men who impertinently derided the sacred traditions of their ancestors fourteen Footnote eleven Libanius Orat Parentalis c nine ten p two hundred thirty two c Greg Nazianzen Orat iii p sixty one Eunap Vit Sophist in Maximo p sixty eight sixty nine seventy edit

blindness of the Christians who preferred the cross to these celestial trophies Apud Cyril l vi p one hundred ninety four But the devout philosopher who sincerely embraced and warmly encouraged the superstition of the people reserved for himself the privilege of a liberal interpretation and silently withdrew from the foot of the altars into the sanctuary of the temple The extravagance of the Grecian mythology proclaimed with a clear and audible voice that the pious inquirer instead of being scandalized or satisfied with the literal sense should diligently explore the occult wisdom which had been disguised by the prudence of antiquity under the mask of folly and of fable fifteen The philosophers of the Platonic school sixteen Plotinus Porphyry and the divine Iamblichus were admired as the most skilful masters of this allegorical science which labored to soften and harmonize the deformed features of Paganism Julian himself who was directed in the mysterious pursuit by Aedesius the venerable successor of Iamblichus aspired to the possession of a treasure which he esteemed if we may credit his solemn asseverations far above the empire of the world seventeen It was indeed a treasure which derived its value only from opinion and every artist who flattered himself that he had extracted the precious ore from the surrounding dross claimed an equal right of stamping the name and figure the most agreeable to his peculiar fancy The fable of Atys and Cybele had been already explained by Porphyry but his labors served only to animate the pious industry of Julian who invented and published his own allegory of that ancient and mystic tale This freedom of interpretation which might gratify the pride of the Platonists exposed the vanity of their art Without a tedious detail the modern reader could not form a just idea of the strange allusions the forced etymologies the solemn trifling and the impenetrable obscurity of these sages who professed to reveal the system of the universe As the traditions of Pagan mythology were variously related the sacred interpreters were at liberty to select the most convenient circumstances and as they translated an arbitrary cipher they could extract from any fable any sense which was adapted to their favorite system of religion and philosophy The lascivious form of a naked Venus was tortured into the discovery of some moral precept or some physical truth and the castration of Atys explained the revolution of the sun between the tropics or the separation of the human soul from vice and error eighteen Footnote fifteen See the principles of allegory in Julian Orat vii p two hundred sixteen two hundred twenty two His reasoning is less absurd than that of some modern theologians who assert that an extravagant or contradictory doctrine must be divine since no man alive could have thought of inventing it Footnote sixteen Eunapius has made these sophists the subject of a partial and fanatical history and the learned Brucker Hist Philosoph tom ii p two hundred seventeen three hundred three has employed much labor to illustrate their obscure lives and incomprehensible doctrines Footnote seventeen Julian Orat vii p two hundred twenty two He swears with the most fervent and enthusiastic devotion and trembles lest he should betray too much of these holy mysteries which the profane might deride with an impious Sardonic laugh Footnote eighteen See the fifth oration of Julian But all the allegories which ever issued from the Platonic school are not worth the short poem of Catullus on the same extraordinary subject The transition of Atys from the wildest enthusiasm to sober pathetic complaint for his irretrievable loss must inspire a man with pity a eunuch with despair The theological system of Julian appears to have contained the sublime and important principles of natural religion But as the faith which is not founded on revelation must remain destitute of any firm assurance the disciple of Plato imprudently relapsed into the habits of vulgar superstition and the popular and philosophic notion of the Deity seems to have been confounded in the practice the writings and even in the mind of Julian nineteen The pious emperor acknowledged and adored the Eternal Cause of the universe to whom he ascribed all the perfections of an infinite nature invisible to the eyes and inaccessible to the understanding of feeble mortals The Supreme God had created or rather in the Platonic language had generated the gradual succession of dependent spirits of gods of daemons of heroes and of men and every being which derived its existence immediately from the First Cause received the inherent gift of immortality That so precious an advantage might be lavished upon unworthy objects the Creator had intrusted to the skill and power of the inferior gods the office of forming the human body and of arranging the beautiful harmony of the animal the vegetable and the mineral kingdoms To the conduct of these divine ministers he delegated the temporal government of this lower world but their imperfect administration is not exempt from discord or error The earth and its inhabitants are divided among them and the characters of Mars or Minerva of Mercury or Venus may be distinctly traced in the laws and manners of their peculiar votaries As long as our immortal souls are confined in a mortal prison it is our interest as well as our duty to solicit the favor and to deprecate the wrath of the powers of heaven whose pride is gratified by the devotion of mankind and whose grosser parts may be supposed to derive some nourishment from the fumes of sacrifice twenty The inferior gods might sometimes condescend to animate the statues and to inhabit the temples which were dedicated to their honor They might occasionally visit the earth but the heavens were the proper throne and symbol of their glory The invariable order of the sun moon and stars was hastily admitted by Julian as a proof of their eternal duration and their eternity was a sufficient evidence that they were the workmanship not of an inferior deity but of the Omnipotent King In the system of Platonists the visible was a type of the invisible world The celestial bodies as they were informed by a divine spirit might be considered as the objects the most worthy of religious worship The Sun whose genial influence pervades and sustains the universe justly claimed the adoration of mankind as the bright representative of the Logos the lively the rational the beneficent image of the intellectual Father twenty one Footnote nineteen The true religion of Julian may be deduced from the Caesars p three hundred eight with Spanheim s notes and illustrations from the fragments in Cyril l ii p fifty seven fifty eight and especially from the theological oration in Solem Regem p one hundred thirty one hundred fifty eight addressed in the confidence of friendship to the praefect Sallust Footnote twenty Julian adopts this gross conception by ascribing to his favorite Marcus Antoninus Caesares p three hundred thirty three The Stoics and Platonists hesitated between the analogy of bodies and the purity of spirits yet the gravest philosophers inclined to the whimsical fancy of Aristophanes and Lucian that an unbelieving age might starve the immortal gods See Observations de Spanheim p two hundred eighty four four hundred forty four c Footnote twenty one Julian Epist li In another place apud Cyril l ii p sixty nine he calls the Sun God and the throne of God Julian believed the Platonician Trinity and only blames the Christians for preferring a mortal to an immortal Logos In every age the absence of genuine inspiration is supplied by the strong illusions of enthusiasm and the mimic arts of imposture If in the time of Julian these arts had been practised only by the pagan priests for the support of an expiring cause some indulgence might perhaps be allowed to the interest and habits of the sacerdotal character But it may appear a subject of surprise and scandal that the philosophers themselves should have contributed to abuse the superstitious credulity of mankind twenty two and that the Grecian mysteries should have been supported by the magic or theurgy of the modern Platonists They arrogantly pretended to control the order of nature to explore the secrets of futurity to command the service of the inferior daemons to enjoy the view and conversation of the superior gods and by disengaging the soul from her material bands to reunite that immortal particle with the Infinite and Divine Spirit Footnote twenty two The sophists of Eunapias perform as many miracles as the saints of the desert and the only circumstance in their favor is that they are of a less gloomy complexion Instead of devils with horns and tails Iamblichus evoked the genii of love Eros and Anteros from two adjacent fountains Two beautiful boys issued from the water fondly embraced him as their father and retired at his command p twenty six twenty seven The devout and fearless curiosity of Julian tempted the philosophers with the hopes of an easy conquest which from the situation of their young proselyte might be productive of the most important consequences twenty three Julian imbibed the first rudiments of the Platonic doctrines from the mouth of Aedesius who had fixed at Pergamus his wandering and persecuted school But as the declining strength of that venerable sage was unequal to the ardor the diligence the rapid conception of his pupil two of his most learned disciples Chrysanthes and Eusebius supplied at his own desire the place of their aged master These philosophers seem to have prepared and distributed their respective parts and they artfully contrived by dark hints and affected disputes to excite the impatient hopes of the aspirant till they delivered him into the hands of their associate Maximus the boldest and most skilful master of the Theurgic science By his hands Julian was secretly initiated at Ephesus in the twentieth year of his age His residence at Athens confirmed this unnatural alliance of philosophy and superstition He obtained the privilege of a solemn initiation into the mysteries of Eleusis which amidst the general decay of the Grecian worship still retained some vestiges of their primaeval sanctity and such was the zeal of Julian that he afterwards invited the Eleusinian pontiff to the court of Gaul for the sole purpose of consummating by mystic rites and sacrifices the great work of his sanctification As these ceremonies were performed in the depth of caverns and in the silence of the night and as the inviolable secret of the mysteries was preserved by the discretion of the initiated I shall not presume to describe the horrid sounds and fiery apparitions which were presented to the senses or the imagination of the credulous aspirant twenty four till the visions of comfort and knowledge broke upon him in a blaze of celestial light twenty five In the caverns of Ephesus and Eleusis the mind of Julian was penetrated with sincere deep and unalterable enthusiasm though he might sometimes exhibit the vicissitudes of pious fraud and hypocrisy which may be observed or at least suspected in the characters of the most conscientious fanatics From that moment he consecrated his life to the service of the gods and while the occupations of war of government and of study seemed to claim the whole measure of his time a stated portion of the hours of the night was invariably reserved for the exercise of private devotion The temperance which adorned the severe manners of the soldier and the philosopher was connected with some strict and frivolous rules of religious abstinence and it was in honor of Pan or Mercury of Hecate or Isis that Julian on particular days denied himself the use of some particular food which might have been offensive to his tutelar deities By these voluntary fasts he prepared his senses and his understanding for the frequent and familiar visits with which he was honored by the celestial powers Notwithstanding the modest silence of Julian himself we may learn from his faithful friend the orator Libanius that he lived in a perpetual intercourse with the gods and goddesses that they descended upon earth to enjoy the conversation of their favorite hero that they gently interrupted his slumbers by touching his hand or his hair that they warned him of every impending danger and conducted him by their infallible wisdom in every action of his life and that he had acquired such an intimate knowledge of his heavenly guests as readily to distinguish the voice of Jupiter from that of Minerva and the form of Apollo from the figure of Hercules twenty six These sleeping or waking visions the ordinary effects of abstinence and fanaticism would almost degrade the emperor to the level of an Egyptian monk But the useless lives of Antony or Pachomius were consumed in these vain occupations Julian could break from the dream of superstition to arm himself for battle and after vanquishing in the field the enemies of Rome he calmly retired into his tent to dictate the wise and salutary laws of an empire or to indulge his genius in the elegant pursuits of literature and philosophy Footnote twenty three The dexterous management of these sophists who played their credulous pupil into each other s hands is fairly told by Eunapius p sixty nine seventy nine with unsuspecting simplicity The Abbe de la Bleterie understands and neatly describes the whole comedy Vie de Julian

were frightened but the priests declared that they were indignant The reader according to the measure of his faith will determine this profound question Footnote twenty five A dark and distant view of the terrors and joys of initiation is shown by Dion Chrysostom Themistius Proclus and Stobaeus The learned author of the Divine Legation has exhibited their words vol i p two hundred thirty nine two

him to obscure and occasional hints but Libanius expiates with pleasure on the facts and visions of the religious hero Legat ad Julian p one hundred fifty seven and Orat Parental c lxxxiii p three hundred nine three hundred ten The important secret of the apostasy of Julian was intrusted to the fidelity of the initiated with whom he was united by the sacred ties of friendship and religion twenty seven The pleasing rumor was cautiously circulated among the adherents of the ancient worship and his future greatness became the object of the hopes the prayers and the predictions of the Pagans in every province of the empire From the zeal and virtues of their royal proselyte they fondly expected the cure of every evil and the restoration of every blessing and instead of disapproving of the ardor of their pious wishes Julian ingenuously confessed that he was ambitious to attain a situation in which he might be useful to his country and to his religion But this religion was viewed with a hostile eye by the successor of Constantine whose capricious passions altercately saved and threatened the life of Julian The arts of magic and divination were strictly prohibited under a despotic government which condescended to fear them and if the Pagans were reluctantly indulged in the exercise of their superstition the rank of Julian would have excepted him from the general toleration The apostate soon became the presumptive heir of the monarchy and his death could alone have appeased the just apprehensions of the Christians twenty eight But the young prince who aspired to the glory of a hero rather than of a martyr consulted his safety by dissembling his religion and the easy temper of polytheism permitted him to join in the public worship of a sect which he inwardly despised Libanius has considered the hypocrisy of his friend as a subject not of censure but of praise As the statues of the gods says that orator which have been defiled with filth are again placed in a magnificent temple so the beauty of truth was seated in the mind of Julian after it had been purified from the errors and follies of his education His sentiments were changed but as it would have been dangerous to have avowed his sentiments his conduct still continued the same Very different from the ass in Aesop who disguised himself with a lion s hide our lion was obliged to conceal himself under the skin of an ass and while he embraced the dictates of reason to obey the laws of prudence and necessity twenty nine The dissimulation of Julian lasted about ten years from his secret initiation at Ephesus to the beginning of the civil war when he declared himself at once the implacable enemy of Christ and of Constantius This state of constraint might contribute to strengthen his devotion and as soon as he had satisfied the obligation of assisting on solemn festivals at the assemblies of the Christians Julian returned with the impatience of a lover to burn his free and voluntary incense on the domestic chapels of Jupiter and Mercury But as every act of dissimulation must be painful to an ingenuous spirit the profession of Christianity increased the aversion of Julian for a religion which oppressed the freedom of his mind and compelled him to hold a conduct repugnant to the noblest attributes of human nature sincerity and courage Footnote twenty seven Libanius Orat Parent c x p two hundred thirty three two hundred thirty four Gallus had some reason to suspect the secret apostasy of his brother and in a letter which may be received as genuine he exhorts Julian to adhere to the religion of their ancestors an argument which as it should seem was not yet perfectly ripe See Julian Op p four hundred fifty four and Hist de Jovien tom ii p one

prefer the gods of Homer and of the Scipios to the new faith which his uncle had established in the Roman empire and in which he himself had been sanctified by the sacrament of baptism But as a philosopher it was incumbent on him to justify his dissent from Christianity which was supported by the number of its converts by the chain of prophecy the splendor of or miracles and the weight of evidence The elaborate work thirty which he composed amidst the preparations of the Persian war contained the substance of those arguments which he had long revolved in his mind Some fragments have been transcribed and preserved by his adversary the vehement Cyril of Alexandria thirty one and they exhibit a very singular mixture of wit and learning of sophistry and fanaticism The elegance of the style and the rank of the author recommended his writings to the public attention thirty two and in the impious list of the enemies of Christianity the celebrated name of Porphyry was effaced by the superior merit or reputation of Julian The minds of the faithful were either seduced or scandalized or alarmed and the pagans who sometimes presumed to engage in the unequal dispute derived from the popular work of their Imperial missionary an inexhaustible supply of fallacious objections But in the assiduous prosecution of these theological studies the emperor of the Romans imbibed the illiberal prejudices and passions of a polemic divine He contracted an irrevocable obligation to maintain and propagate his religious opinions and whilst he secretly applauded the strength and dexterity with which he wielded the weapons of controversy he was tempted to distrust the sincerity or to despise the understandings of his antagonists who could obstinately resist the force of reason and eloquence Footnote thirty Fabricius Biblioth Graec l v c viii p eighty eight ninety and Lardner Heathen Testimonies vol iv p forty four forty seven have accurately compiled all that can now be discovered of Julian s work against the Christians Footnote thirty one About seventy years after the death of Julian he executed a task which had been feebly attempted by Philip of Side a prolix and contemptible

divine vindication Orat ix in necem Julian p two hundred fifty five edit Morel to the writings of Porphyry His judgment may be arraigned Socrates l iii c twenty three but Libanius cannot be accused of flattery to a dead prince The Christians who beheld with horror and indignation the apostasy of Julian had much more to fear from his power than from his arguments The pagans who were conscious of his fervent zeal expected perhaps with impatience that the flames of persecution should be immediately kindled against the enemies of the gods and that the ingenious malice of Julian would invent some cruel refinements of death and torture which had been unknown to the rude and inexperienced fury of his predecessors But the hopes as well as the fears of the religious factions were apparently disappointed by the prudent humanity of a prince thirty three who was careful of his own fame of the public peace and of the rights of mankind Instructed by history and reflection Julian was persuaded that if the diseases of the body may sometimes be cured by salutary violence neither steel nor fire can eradicate the erroneous opinions of the mind The reluctant victim may be dragged to the foot of the altar but the heart still abhors and disclaims the sacrilegious act of the hand Religious obstinacy is hardened and exasperated by oppression and as soon as the persecution subsides those who have yielded are restored as penitents and those who have resisted are honored as saints and martyrs If Julian adopted the unsuccessful cruelty of Diocletian and his colleagues he was sensible that he should stain his memory with the name of a tyrant and add new glories to the Catholic church which had derived strength and increase from the severity of the pagan magistrates Actuated by these motives and apprehensive of disturbing the repose of an unsettled reign Julian surprised the world by an edict which was not unworthy of a statesman or a philosopher He extended to all the inhabitants of the Roman world the benefits of a free and equal toleration and the only hardship which he inflicted on the Christians was to deprive them of the power of tormenting their fellow subjects whom they stigmatized with the odious titles of idolaters and heretics The pagans received a gracious permission or rather an express order to open All their temples thirty four and they were at once delivered from the oppressive laws and arbitrary vexations which they had sustained under the reign of Constantine and of his sons At the same time the bishops and clergy who had been banished by the Arian monarch were recalled from exile and restored to their respective churches the Donatists the Novatians the Macedonians the Eunomians and those who with a more prosperous fortune adhered to the doctrine of the Council of Nice Julian who understood and derided their theological disputes invited to the palace the leaders of the hostile sects that he might enjoy the agreeable spectacle of their furious encounters The clamor of controversy sometimes provoked the emperor to exclaim Hear me the Franks have heard me and the Alemanni but he soon discovered that he was now engaged with more obstinate and implacable enemies and though he exerted the powers of oratory to persuade them to live in concord or at least in peace he was perfectly satisfied before he dismissed them from his presence that he had nothing to dread from the union of the Christians The impartial Ammianus has ascribed this affected clemency to the desire of fomenting the intestine divisions of the church and the insidious design of undermining the foundations of Christianity was inseparably connected with the zeal which Julian professed to restore the ancient religion of the empire thirty five Footnote thirty three Libanius Orat Parent c lviii p two hundred eighty three two hundred eighty four has eloquently explained the tolerating principles and conduct of his Imperial friend In a very remarkable

As soon as he ascended the throne he assumed according to the custom of his predecessors the character of supreme pontiff not only as the most honorable title of Imperial greatness but as a sacred and important office the duties of which he was resolved to execute with pious diligence As the business of the state prevented the emperor from joining every day in the public devotion of his subjects he dedicated a domestic chapel to his tutelar deity the Sun his gardens were filled with statues and altars of the gods and each apartment of the palace displaced the appearance of a magnificent temple Every morning he saluted the parent of light with a sacrifice the blood of another victim was shed at the moment when the Sun sunk below the horizon and the Moon the Stars and the Genii of the night received their respective and seasonable honors from the indefatigable devotion of Julian On solemn festivals he regularly visited the temple of the god or goddess to whom the day was peculiarly consecrated and endeavored to excite the religion of the magistrates and people by the example of his own zeal Instead of maintaining the lofty state of a monarch distinguished by the splendor of his purple and encompassed by the golden shields of his guards Julian solicited with respectful eagerness the meanest offices which contributed to the worship of the gods Amidst the sacred but licentious crowd of priests of inferior ministers and of female dancers who were dedicated to the service of the temple it was the business of the emperor to bring the wood to blow the fire to handle the knife to slaughter the victim and thrusting his bloody hands into the bowels of the expiring animal to draw forth the heart or liver and to read with the consummate skill of an haruspex imaginary signs of future events The wisest of the Pagans censured this extravagant superstition which affected to despise the restraints of prudence and decency Under the reign of a prince who practised the rigid maxims of economy the expense of religious worship consumed a very large portion of the revenue a constant supply of the scarcest and most beautiful birds was transported from distant climates to bleed on the altars of the gods a hundred oxen were frequently sacrificed by Julian on one and the same day and it soon became a popular jest that if he should return with conquest from the Persian war the breed of horned cattle must infallibly be extinguished Yet this expense may appear inconsiderable when it is compared with the splendid presents which were offered either by the hand or by order of the emperor to all the celebrated places of devotion in the Roman world and with the sums allotted to repair and decorate the ancient temples which had suffered the silent decay of time or the recent injuries of Christian rapine Encouraged by the example the exhortations the liberality of their pious sovereign the cities and families resumed the practice of their neglected ceremonies Every part of the world exclaims Libanius with devout transport displayed the triumph of religion and the grateful prospect of flaming altars bleeding victims the smoke of incense and a solemn train of priests and prophets without fear and without danger The sound of prayer and of music was heard on the tops of the highest mountains and the same ox afforded a sacrifice for the gods and a supper for their joyous votaries thirty six Footnote thirty six The restoration of the Pagan worship is described by Julian Misopogon p three hundred forty six Libanius Orat Parent c sixty p two hundred

These writers agree in the essential and even minute facts but the different lights in which they view the extreme devotion of Julian are expressive of the gradations of self applause passionate admiration mild reproof and partial invective But the genius and power of Julian were unequal to the enterprise of restoring a religion which was destitute of theological principles of moral precepts and of ecclesiastical discipline which rapidly hastened to decay and dissolution and was not susceptible of any solid or consistent reformation The jurisdiction of the supreme pontiff more especially after that office had been united with the Imperial dignity comprehended the whole extent of the Roman empire Julian named for his vicars in the several provinces the priests and philosophers whom he esteemed the best qualified to cooperate in the execution of his great design and his pastoral letters thirty seven if we may use that name still represent a very curious sketch of his wishes and intentions He directs that in every city the sacerdotal order should be composed without any distinction of birth and fortune of those persons who were the most conspicuous for the love of the gods and of men If they are guilty continues he of any scandalous offence they should be censured or degraded by the superior pontiff but as long as they retain their rank they are entitled to the respect of the magistrates and people Their humility may be shown in the plainness of their domestic garb their dignity in the pomp of holy vestments When they are summoned in their turn to officiate before the altar they ought not during the appointed number of days to depart from the precincts of the temple nor should a single day be suffered to elapse without the prayers and the sacrifice which they are obliged to offer for the prosperity of the state and of individuals The exercise of their sacred functions requires an immaculate purity both of mind and body and even when they are dismissed from the temple to the occupations of common life it is incumbent on them to excel in decency and virtue the rest of their fellow citizens The priest of the gods should never be seen in theatres or taverns His conversation should be chaste his diet temperate his friends of honorable reputation and if he sometimes visits the Forum or the Palace he should appear only as the advocate of those who have vainly solicited either justice or mercy His studies should be suited to the sanctity of his profession Licentious tales or comedies or satires must be banished from his library which ought solely to consist of historical or philosophical writings of history which is founded in truth and of philosophy which is connected with religion The impious opinions of the Epicureans and sceptics deserve his abhorrence and contempt thirty eight but he should diligently study the systems of Pythagoras of Plato and of the Stoics which unanimously teach that there are gods that the world is governed by their providence that their goodness is the source of every temporal blessing and that they have prepared for the human soul a future state of reward or punishment The Imperial pontiff inculcates in the most persuasive language the duties of benevolence and hospitality exhorts his inferior clergy to recommend the universal practice of those virtues promises to assist their indigence from the public treasury and declares his resolution of establishing hospitals in every city where the poor should be received without any invidious distinction of country or of religion Julian beheld with envy the wise and humane regulations of the church and he very frankly confesses his intention to deprive the Christians of the applause as well as advantage which they had acquired by the exclusive practice of charity and beneficence thirty nine The same spirit of imitation might dispose the emperor to adopt several ecclesiastical institutions the use and importance of which were approved by the success of his enemies But if these imaginary plans of reformation had been realized the forced and imperfect copy would have been less beneficial to Paganism than honorable to Christianity forty The Gentiles who peaceably followed the customs of their ancestors were rather surprised than pleased with the introduction of foreign manners and in the short period of his reign Julian had frequent occasions to complain of the want of fervor of his own party forty one Footnote thirty seven See Julian Epistol xlix lxii lxiii and a long and curious fragment without beginning or end p two hundred eighty eight three hundred five The supreme pontiff derides the Mosaic history and the Christian discipline prefers the Greek poets to the Hebrew prophets and palliates with the skill of a Jesuit the relative worship of images Footnote thirty eight The exultation of Julian p three hundred one that these impious sects and even their writings are extinguished may be consistent enough with the sacerdotal character but it is unworthy of a philosopher to wish that any opinions and arguments the most repugnant to his own should be concealed from the knowledge of mankind Footnote thirty nine Yet he insinuates that the Christians under the pretence of charity inveigled children from their religion and parents conveyed them on shipboard and devoted those victims to a life of poverty or pervitude in a remote country p three hundred five Had the charge been proved it was his duty not to complain but to punish Footnote forty Gregory Nazianzen is facetious ingenious and argumentative Orat iii p one hundred one one hundred two c He ridicules the folly of such vain imitation and amuses himself with inquiring what lessons moral or theological could be extracted from the Grecian fables Footnote forty one He accuses one of his pontiffs of a secret confederacy with the Christian bishops and presbyters Epist lxii c Epist lxiii The enthusiasm of Julian prompted him to embrace the friends of Jupiter as his personal friends and brethren and though he partially overlooked the merit of Christian constancy he admired and rewarded the noble perseverance of those Gentiles who had preferred the favor of the gods to that of the emperor forty two If they cultivated the literature as well as the religion of the Greeks they acquired an additional claim to the friendship of Julian who ranked the Muses in the number of his tutelar deities In the religion which he had adopted piety and learning were almost synonymous forty three and a crowd of poets of rhetoricians and of philosophers hastened to the Imperial court to occupy the vacant places of the bishops who had seduced the credulity of Constantius His successor esteemed the ties of common initiation as far more sacred than those of consanguinity he chose his favorites among the sages who were deeply skilled in the occult sciences of magic and divination and every impostor who pretended to reveal the secrets of futurity was assured of enjoying the present hour in honor and affluence forty four Among the philosophers Maximus obtained the most eminent rank in the friendship of his royal disciple who communicated with unreserved confidence his actions his sentiments and his religious designs during the anxious suspense of the civil war forty five As soon as Julian had taken possession of the palace of Constantinople he despatched an honorable and pressing invitation to Maximus who then resided at Sardes in Lydia with Chrysanthius the associate of his art and studies The prudent and superstitious Chrysanthius refused to undertake a journey which showed itself according to the rules of divination with the most threatening and malignant aspect but his companion whose fanaticism was of a bolder cast persisted in his interrogations till he had extorted from the gods a seeming consent to his own wishes and those of the emperor The journey of Maximus through the cities of Asia displayed the triumph of philosophic vanity and the magistrates vied with each other in the honorable reception which they prepared for the friend of their sovereign Julian was pronouncing an oration before the senate when he was informed of the arrival of Maximus The emperor immediately interrupted his discourse advanced to meet him and after a tender embrace conducted him by the hand into the midst of the assembly where he publicly acknowledged the benefits which he had derived from the instructions of the philosopher Maximus forty six who soon acquired the confidence and influenced the councils of Julian was insensibly corrupted by the temptations of a court His dress became more splendid his demeanor more lofty and he was exposed under a succeeding reign to a disgraceful inquiry into the means by which the disciple of Plato had accumulated in the short duration of his favor a very scandalous proportion of wealth Of the other philosophers and sophists who were invited to the Imperial residence by the choice of Julian or by the success of Maximus few were able to preserve their innocence or their reputation The liberal gifts of money lands and houses were insufficient to satiate their rapacious avarice and the indignation of the people was justly excited by the remembrance of their abject poverty and disinterested professions The penetration of Julian could not always be deceived but he was unwilling to despise the characters of those men whose talents deserved his esteem he desired to escape the double reproach of imprudence and inconstancy and he was apprehensive of degrading in the eyes of the profane the honor of letters and of religion forty eight Footnote forty two He praises the fidelity of Callixene priestess of Ceres who had been twice as constant as

tom iv p nine hundred sixty La Cour de Julien est pleine de philosphes et de gens perdus The favor of Julian was almost equally divided between the Pagans who had firmly adhered to the worship of their ancestors and the Christians who prudently embraced the religion of their sovereign The acquisition of new proselytes forty nine gratified the ruling passions of his soul superstition and vanity and he was heard to declare with the enthusiasm of a missionary that if he could render each individual richer than Midas and every city greater than Babylon he should not esteem himself the benefactor of mankind unless at the same time he could reclaim his subjects from their impious revolt against the immortal gods fifty A prince who had studied human nature and who possessed the treasures of the Roman empire could adapt his arguments his promises and his rewards to every order of Christians fifty one and the merit of a seasonable conversion was allowed to supply the defects of a candidate or even to expiate the guilt of a criminal As the army is the most forcible engine of absolute power Julian applied himself with peculiar diligence to corrupt the religion of his troops without whose hearty concurrence every measure must be dangerous and unsuccessful and the natural temper of soldiers made this conquest as easy as it was important The legions of Gaul devoted themselves to the faith as well as to the fortunes of their victorious leader and even before the death of Constantius he had the satisfaction of announcing to his friends that they assisted with fervent devotion and voracious appetite at the sacrifices which were repeatedly offered in his camp of whole hecatombs of fat oxen fifty two The armies of the East which had been trained under the standard of the cross and of Constantius required a more artful and expensive mode of persuasion On the days of solemn and public festivals the emperor received the homage and rewarded the merit of the troops His throne of state was encircled with the military ensigns of Rome and the republic the holy name of Christ was erased from the Labarum and the symbols of war of majesty and of pagan superstition were so dexterously blended that the faithful subject incurred the guilt of idolatry when he respectfully saluted the person or image of his sovereign The soldiers passed successively in review and each of them before he received from the hand of Julian a liberal donative proportioned to his rank and services was required to cast a few grains of incense into the flame which burnt upon the altar Some Christian confessors might resist and others might repent but the far greater number allured by the prospect of gold and awed by the presence of the emperor contracted the criminal engagement and their future perseverance in the worship of the gods was enforced by every consideration of duty and of interest By the frequent repetition of these arts and at the expense of sums which would have purchased the service of half the nations of Scythia Julian gradually acquired for his troops the imaginary protection of the gods and for himself the firm and effectual support of the Roman legions fifty three It is indeed more than probable that the restoration and encouragement of Paganism revealed a multitude of pretended Christians who from motives of temporal advantage had acquiesced in the religion of the former reign and who afterwards returned with the same flexibility of conscience to the faith which was professed by the successors of Julian Footnote forty nine

protector and expresses a pious hope that after his return from the Persian war he may be permitted to pay his grateful vows to the Almighty in his holy city of Jerusalem The blind superstition and abject slavery of those unfortunate exiles must excite the contempt of a philosophic emperor but they deserved the friendship of Julian by their implacable hatred of the Christian name The barren synagogue abhorred and envied the fecundity of the rebellious church the power of the Jews was not equal to their malice but their gravest rabbis approved the private murder of an apostate fifty five and their seditious clamors had often awakened the indolence of the Pagan magistrates Under the reign of Constantine the Jews became the subjects of their revolted children nor was it long before they experienced the bitterness of domestic tyranny The civil immunities which had been granted or confirmed by Severus were gradually repealed by the Christian princes and a rash tumult excited by the Jews of Palestine fifty six seemed to justify the lucrative modes of oppression which were invented by the bishops and eunuchs of the court of Constantius The Jewish patriarch who was still permitted to exercise a precarious jurisdiction held his residence at Tiberias fifty seven and the neighboring cities of Palestine were filled with the remains of a people who fondly adhered to the promised land But the edict of Hadrian was renewed and enforced and they viewed from afar the walls of the holy city which were profaned in their eyes by the triumph of the cross and the devotion of the

the lower town covered the spacious summit of Mount Acra and a part of the hill distinguished by the name of Moriah and levelled by human industry was crowned with the stately temple of the Jewish nation After the final destruction of the temple by the arms of Titus and Hadrian a ploughshare was drawn over the consecrated ground as a sign of perpetual interdiction Sion was deserted and the vacant space of the lower city was filled with the public and private edifices of the Aelian colony which spread themselves over the adjacent hill of Calvary The holy places were polluted with mountains of idolatry and either from design or accident a chapel was dedicated to Venus on the spot which had been sanctified by the death and resurrection of Christ sixty one sixty onea Almost three hundred years after those stupendous events the profane chapel of Venus was demolished by the order of Constantine and the removal of the earth and stones revealed the holy sepulchre to the eyes of mankind A magnificent church was erected on that mystic ground by the first Christian emperor and the effects of his pious munificence were extended to every spot which had been consecrated by the

appears to have united the credulity of age with the warm feelings of a recent conversion Sages and heroes who have visited the memorable scenes of ancient wisdom or glory have confessed the inspiration of the genius of the place sixty four and the Christian who knelt before the holy sepulchre ascribed his lively faith and his fervent devotion to the more immediate influence of the Divine

Christianity in the banners of the Roman legions sixty five Such miracles as seemed necessary to account for its extraordinary preservation and seasonable discovery were gradually propagated without opposition The custody of the true cross which on Easter Sunday was solemnly exposed to the people was intrusted to the bishop of Jerusalem and he alone might gratify the curious devotion of the pilgrims by the gift of small pieces which they encased in gold or gems and carried away in triumph to their respective countries But as this gainful branch of commerce must soon have been annihilated it was found convenient to suppose that the marvelous wood possessed a secret power of vegetation and that its substance though continually diminished still remained entire and unimpaired sixty six It might perhaps have been expected that the influence of the place and the belief of a perpetual miracle should have produced some salutary effects on the morals as well as on the faith of the people Yet the most respectable of the ecclesiastical writers have been obliged to confess not only that the streets of Jerusalem were filled with the incessant tumult of business and pleasure sixty seven but that every species of vice adultery theft idolatry poisoning murder was familiar to the inhabitants of the holy city sixty eight The wealth and preeminence of the church of Jerusalem excited the ambition of Arian as well as orthodox candidates and the virtues of Cyril who since his death has been honored with the title of Saint were displayed in the exercise rather than in the acquisition of

ancient glory of the temple of Jerusalem seventy As the Christians were firmly persuaded that a sentence of everlasting destruction had been pronounced against the whole fabric of the Mosaic law the Imperial sophist would have converted the success of his undertaking into a specious argument against the faith of prophecy and the truth of revelation seventy one He was displeased with the spiritual worship of the synagogue but he approved the institutions of Moses who had not disdained to adopt many of the rites and ceremonies of Egypt seventy two The local and national deity of the Jews was sincerely adored by a polytheist who desired only to multiply the number of the gods seventy three and such was the appetite of Julian for bloody sacrifice that his emulation might be excited by the piety of Solomon who had offered at the feast of the dedication twenty two thousand oxen and one hundred and twenty thousand sheep seventy four These considerations might influence his designs but the prospect of an immediate and important advantage would not suffer the impatient monarch to expect the remote and uncertain event of the Persian war He resolved to erect without delay on the commanding eminence of Moriah a stately temple which might eclipse the splendor of the church of the resurrection on the adjacent hill of Calvary to establish an order of priests whose interested zeal would detect the arts and resist the ambition of their Christian rivals and to invite a numerous colony of Jews whose stern fanaticism would be always prepared to second and even to anticipate the hostile measures of the Pagan government Among the friends of the emperor if the names of emperor and of friend are not incompatible the first place was assigned by Julian himself to the virtuous and learned Alypius seventy five The humanity of Alypius was tempered by severe justice and manly fortitude and while he exercised his abilities in the civil administration of Britain he imitated in his poetical compositions the harmony and softness of the odes of Sappho

the interruption of an arduous work which was attempted only in the last six months of the life of Julian seventy eight But the Christians entertained a natural and pious expectation that in this memorable contest the honor of religion would be vindicated by some signal miracle An earthquake a whirlwind and a fiery eruption which overturned and scattered the new foundations of the temple are attested with some variations by contemporary and respectable evidence seventy nine This public event is described by Ambrose eighty bishop of Milan in an epistle to the emperor Theodosius which must provoke the severe animadversion of the Jews by the eloquent Chrysostom eighty one who might appeal to the memory of the elder part of his congregation at Antioch and by Gregory Nazianzen eighty two who published his account of the miracle before the expiration of the same year The last of these writers has boldly declared that this preternatural event was not disputed by the infidels and his assertion strange as it may seem is confirmed by the unexceptionable testimony of Ammianus Marcellinus eighty three The philosophic soldier who loved the virtues without adopting the prejudices of his master has recorded in his judicious and candid history of his own times the extraordinary obstacles which interrupted the restoration of the temple of Jerusalem Whilst Alypius assisted by the governor of the province urged with vigor and diligence the execution of the work horrible balls of fire breaking out near the foundations with frequent and reiterated attacks rendered the place from time to time inaccessible to the scorched and blasted workmen and the victorious element continuing in this manner obstinately and resolutely bent as it were to drive them to a distance the undertaking was abandoned eighty threea Such authority should satisfy a believing and must astonish an incredulous mind Yet a philosopher may still require the original evidence of impartial and intelligent spectators At this important crisis any singular accident of nature would assume the appearance and produce the effects of a real prodigy This glorious deliverance would be speedily

Such witnesses can only be received by a very favorable judge Footnote eighty threea Michaelis has given an ingenious and sufficiently probable explanation of this remarkable incident which the positive testimony of Ammianus a contemporary and a pagan will not permit us to call in question It was suggested by a passage in Tacitus That historian speaking of Jerusalem says I omit the first part of the quotation adduced by M Guizot which only by a most extraordinary mistranslation of muri introrsus sinuati by enfoncemens could be made to bear on the question M The Temple itself was a kind of citadel which had its own walls superior in their workmanship and construction to those of the city The porticos themselves which surrounded the temple were an excellent fortification There was a fountain of constantly running water subterranean excavations under the mountain reservoirs and cisterns to collect the rain water Tac Hist v ii twelve These excavations and reservoirs must have been very considerable The latter furnished water during the whole siege of Jerusalem to one million one hundred thousand inhabitants for whom the fountain of Siloe could not have sufficed and who had no fresh rain water the siege having taken place from the month of April to the month of August a period of the year during which it rarely rains in Jerusalem As to the excavations they served after and even before the return of the Jews from Babylon to contain not only magazines of oil wine and corn but also the treasures which were laid up in the Temple Josephus has related several incidents which show their extent When Jerusalem was on the point of being taken by Titus the rebel chiefs placing their last hopes in these vast subterranean cavities formed a design of concealing themselves there and remaining during the conflagration of the city and until the Romans had retired to a distance The greater part had not time to execute their design but one of them Simon the Son of Gioras having provided himself with food and tools to excavate the earth descended into this retreat with some companions he remained there till Titus had set out for Rome under the pressure of famine he issued forth on a sudden in the very place where the Temple had stood and appeared in the midst of the Roman guard He was seized and carried to Rome for the triumph His appearance made it be suspected that other Jews might have chosen the same asylum search was made and a great number discovered Joseph de Bell Jud l vii c two It is probable that the greater part of these excavations were the remains of the time of Solomon when it was the custom to work to a great extent under ground no other date can be assigned to them The Jews on their return from the captivity were too poor to undertake such works and although Herod on rebuilding the Temple made some excavations Joseph Ant Jud xv eleven vii the haste with which that building was completed will not allow us to suppose that they belonged to that period Some were used for sewers and drains others served to conceal the immense treasures of which Crassus a hundred and twenty years before plundered the Jews and which doubtless had been since replaced The Temple was destroyed A C seventy the attempt of Julian to rebuild it and the fact related by Ammianus coincide with the year three hundred sixty three There had then elapsed between these two epochs an interval of near three hundred years during which the excavations choked up with ruins must have become full of inflammable air The workmen employed by Julian as they were digging arrived at the excavations of the Temple they would take torches to explore them sudden flames repelled those who approached explosions were heard and these phenomena were renewed every time that they penetrated into new subterranean passages This explanation is confirmed by the relation of an event nearly similar by Josephus King Herod having heard that immense treasures had been concealed in the sepulchre of David he descended into it with a few confidential persons he found in the first subterranean chamber only jewels and precious stuffs but having wished to penetrate into a second chamber which had been long closed he was repelled when he opened it by flames which killed those who accompanied him Ant Jud xvi seven i As here there is no room for miracle this fact may be considered as a new proof of the veracity of that related by Ammianus and the contemporary writers G To the illustrations of the extent of the subterranean chambers adduced by Michaelis may be added that when John of Gischala during the siege surprised the Temple the party of Eleazar took refuge within them Bell Jud vi three i The sudden sinking of the hill of Sion when Jerusalem was occupied by Barchocab may have been connected with similar excavations Hist of Jews vol iii one hundred twenty two and one hundred eighty six M It is a fact now popularly known that when mines which have been long closed are opened one of two things takes place either the torches are extinguished and the men fall first into a swoor and soon die or if the air is inflammable a little flame is seen to flicker round the lamp which spreads and multiplies till the conflagration becomes general is followed by an explosion and kill all who are in the way G Footnote eighty four doctor Lardner perhaps alone of the Christian critics presumes to doubt the truth of this famous miracle Jewish and Heathen Testimonies vol iv p forty seven seventy one The silence of Jerom would lead to a suspicion that the same story which was celebrated at a distance might be despised on the spot Note Gibbon has forgotten Basnage to whom Warburton replied M Chapter XXIII Reign Of Julian Part IV The restoration of the Jewish temple was secretly connected with the ruin of the Christian church Julian still continued to maintain the freedom of religious worship without distinguishing whether this universal toleration proceeded from his justice or his clemency He affected to pity the unhappy Christians who were mistaken in the most important object of their lives but his pity was degraded by contempt his contempt was embittered by hatred and the sentiments of Julian were expressed in a style of sarcastic wit which inflicts a deep and deadly wound whenever it issues from the mouth of a sovereign As he was sensible that the Christians gloried in the name of their Redeemer he countenanced and perhaps enjoined the use of the less honorable appellation of Galilaeans eighty five He declared that by the folly of the Galilaeans whom he describes as a sect of fanatics contemptible to men and odious to the gods the empire had been reduced to the brink of destruction and he insinuates in a public edict that a frantic patient might sometimes be cured by salutary violence eighty six An ungenerous distinction was admitted into the mind and counsels of Julian that according to the difference of their religious sentiments one part of his subjects deserved his favor and friendship while the other was entitled only to the common benefits that his justice could not refuse to an obedient people According to a principle pregnant with mischief and oppression the emperor transferred to the pontiffs of his own religion the management of the liberal allowances for the public revenue which had been granted to the church by the piety of Constantine and his sons The proud system of clerical honors and immunities which had been constructed with so much art and labor was levelled to the ground the hopes of testamentary donations were intercepted by the rigor of the laws and the priests of the Christian sect were confounded with the last and most ignominious class of the people Such of these regulations as appeared necessary to check the ambition and avarice of the ecclesiastics were soon afterwards imitated by the wisdom of an orthodox prince The peculiar distinctions which policy has bestowed or superstition has lavished on the sacerdotal order must be confined to those priests who profess the religion of the state But the will of the legislator was not exempt from prejudice and passion and it was the object of the insidious policy of Julian to deprive the Christians of all the temporal honors and advantages which rendered them respectable in the eyes of the world eighty eight Footnote eighty five Greg Naz Orat iii p eighty one And this law was confirmed by the invariable practice of Julian himself Warburton has justly observed p thirty five that the Platonists believed in the mysterious virtue of words and Julian s dislike for the name of Christ might proceed from superstition as well as from contempt Footnote eighty six Fragment Julian p two hundred eighty eight He derides the Epist vii and so far loses sight of the principles of toleration as to wish Epist xlii Footnote eighty eight These laws which affected the clergy may be found in the slight hints of Julian himself Epist lii in the vague declamations of Gregory Orat iii p eighty six eighty seven and in the positive assertions of Sozomen l v c five A just and severe censure has been inflicted on the law which prohibited the Christians from teaching the arts of grammar and rhetoric eighty nine The motives alleged by the emperor to justify this partial and oppressive measure might command during his lifetime the silence of slaves and the applause of Gatterers Julian abuses the ambiguous meaning of a word which might be indifferently applied to the language and the religion of the Greeks he contemptuously observes that the men who exalt the merit of implicit faith are unfit to claim or to enjoy the advantages of science and he vainly contends that if they refuse to adore the gods of Homer and Demosthenes they ought to content themselves with expounding Luke and Matthew in the church of the Galilaeans ninety In all the cities of the Roman world the education of the youth was intrusted to masters of grammar and rhetoric who were elected by the magistrates maintained at the public expense and distinguished by many lucrative and honorable privileges The edict of Julian appears to have included the physicians and professors of all the liberal arts and the emperor who reserved to himself the approbation of the candidates was authorized by the laws to corrupt or to punish the religious constancy of the most learned of the Christians ninety one As soon as the resignation of the more obstinate ninety two teachers had established the unrivalled dominion of the Pagan sophists Julian invited the rising generation to resort with freedom to the public schools in a just confidence that their tender minds would receive the impressions of literature and idolatry If the greatest part of the Christian youth should be deterred by their own scruples or by those of their parents from accepting this dangerous mode of instruction they must at the same time relinquish the benefits of a liberal education Julian had reason to expect that in the space of a few years the church would relapse into its primaeval simplicity and that the theologians who possessed an adequate share of the learning and eloquence of the age would be succeeded by a generation of blind and ignorant fanatics incapable of defending the truth of their own principles or of exposing the various follies of Polytheism ninety three Footnote eighty nine Inclemens perenni obruendum silentio Ammian xxii ten ixv five Footnote ninety The edict itself which is still extant among

death of Julian they were contemptuously thrown aside by the Christians Socr Hist iii sixteen M It was undoubtedly the wish and design of Julian to deprive the Christians of the advantages of wealth of knowledge and of power but the injustice of excluding them from all offices of trust and profit seems to have been the result of his general policy rather than the immediate consequence of any positive law ninety four Superior merit might deserve and obtain some extraordinary exceptions but the greater part of the Christian officers were gradually removed from their employments in the state the army and the provinces The hopes of future candidates were extinguished by the declared partiality of a prince who maliciously reminded them that it was unlawful for a Christian to use the sword either of justice or of war and who studiously guarded the camp and the tribunals with the ensigns of idolatry The powers of government were intrusted to the pagans who professed an ardent zeal for the religion of their ancestors and as the choice of the emperor was often directed by the rules of divination the favorites whom he preferred as the most agreeable to the gods did not always obtain the approbation of mankind ninety five Under the administration of their enemies the Christians had much to suffer and more to apprehend The temper of Julian was averse to cruelty and the care of his reputation which was exposed to the eyes of the universe restrained the philosophic monarch from violating the laws of justice and toleration which he himself had so recently established But the provincial ministers of his authority were placed in a less conspicuous station In the exercise of arbitrary power they consulted the wishes rather than the commands of their sovereign and ventured to exercise a secret and vexatious tyranny against the sectaries on whom they were not permitted to confer the honors of martyrdom The emperor who dissembled as long as possible his knowledge of the injustice that was exercised in his name expressed his real sense of the conduct of his officers by gentle reproofs and substantial rewards ninety six Footnote ninety four It was the instruction of Julian to his magistrates Epist vii Sozomen l v c eighteen and Socrates l iii c thirteen must be reduced to the standard of Gregory Orat iii p ninety five not less prone to exaggeration but more

instrument of oppression with which they were armed was the law that obliged the Christians to make full and ample satisfaction for the temples which they had destroyed under the preceding reign The zeal of the triumphant church had not always expected the sanction of the public authority and the bishops who were secure of impunity had often marched at the head of their congregation to attack and demolish the fortresses of the prince of darkness The consecrated lands which had increased the patrimony of the sovereign or of the clergy were clearly defined and easily restored But on these lands and on the ruins of Pagan superstition the Christians had frequently erected their own religious edifices and as it was necessary to remove the church before the temple could be rebuilt the justice and piety of the emperor were applauded by one party while the other deplored and execrated his sacrilegious violence ninety seven After the ground was cleared the restitution of those stately structures which had been levelled with the dust and of the precious ornaments which had been converted to Christian uses swelled into a very large account of damages and debt The authors of the injury had neither the ability nor the inclination to discharge this accumulated demand and the impartial wisdom of a legislator would have been displayed in balancing the adverse claims and complaints by an equitable and temperate arbitration But the whole empire and particularly the East was thrown into confusion by the rash edicts of Julian and the Pagan magistrates inflamed by zeal and revenge abused the rigorous privilege of the Roman law which substitutes in the place of his inadequate property the person of the insolvent debtor Under the preceding reign Mark bishop of Arethusa ninety eight had labored in the conversion of his people with arms more effectual than those of persuasion ninety nine The magistrates required the full value of a temple which had been destroyed by his intolerant zeal but as they were satisfied of his poverty they desired only to bend his inflexible spirit to the promise of the slightest compensation They apprehended the aged prelate they inhumanly scourged him they tore his beard and his naked body annointed with honey was suspended in a net between heaven and earth and exposed to the stings of insects and the rays of a Syrian sun one hundred From this lofty station Mark still persisted to glory in his crime and to insult the impotent rage of his persecutors He was at length rescued from their hands and dismissed to enjoy the honor of his divine triumph The Arians celebrated the virtue of their pious confessor the Catholics ambitiously claimed his alliance one hundred one and the Pagans who might be susceptible of shame or remorse were deterred from the repetition of such unavailing cruelty one hundred two Julian spared his life but if the bishop of Arethusa had saved the infancy of Julian one hundred three

light and his colossal figure one hundred five almost filled the capacious sanctuary which was enriched with gold and gems and adorned by the skill of the Grecian artists The deity was represented in a bending attitude with a golden cup in his hand pouring out a libation on the earth as if he supplicated the venerable mother to give to his arms the cold and beauteous Daphne for the spot was ennobled by fiction and the fancy of the Syrian poets had transported the amorous tale from the banks of the Peneus to those of the Orontes The ancient rites of Greece were imitated by the royal colony of Antioch A stream of prophecy which rivalled the truth and reputation of the Delphic oracle flowed from the Castalian fountain of Daphne one hundred six In the adjacent fields a stadium was built by a special privilege one hundred seven which had been purchased from Elis the Olympic games were celebrated at the expense of the city and a revenue of thirty thousand pounds sterling was annually applied to the public pleasures one hundred eight The perpetual resort of pilgrims and spectators insensibly formed in the neighborhood of the temple the stately and populous village of Daphne which emulated the splendor without acquiring the title of a provincial city The temple and the village were deeply bosomed in a thick grove of laurels and cypresses which reached as far as a circumference of ten miles and formed in the most sultry summers a cool and impenetrable shade A thousand streams of the purest water issuing from every hill preserved the verdure of the earth and the temperature of the air the senses were gratified with harmonious sounds and aromatic odors and the peaceful grove was consecrated to health and joy to luxury and love The vigorous youth pursued like Apollo the object of his desires and the blushing maid was warned by the fate of Daphne to shun the folly of unseasonable coyness The soldier and the philosopher wisely avoided the temptation of this sensual paradise one hundred nine where pleasure assuming the character of religion imperceptibly dissolved the firmness of manly virtue But the groves of Daphne continued for many ages to enjoy the veneration of natives and strangers the privileges of the holy ground were enlarged by the munificence of succeeding emperors and every generation added new ornaments to the splendor of the temple one

of eagerness and impatience His lively imagination anticipated the grateful pomp of victims of libations and of incense a long procession of youths and virgins clothed in white robes the symbol of their innocence and the tumultuous concourse of an innumerable people But the zeal of Antioch was diverted since the reign of Christianity into a different channel Instead of hecatombs of fat oxen sacrificed by the tribes of a wealthy city to their tutelar deity the emperor complains that he found only a single goose provided at the expense of a priest the pale and solitary in habitant of this decayed temple one hundred eleven The altar was deserted the oracle had been reduced to silence and the holy ground was profaned by the introduction of Christian and funereal rites After Babylas one hundred twelve a bishop of Antioch who died in prison in the persecution of Decius had rested near a century in his grave his body by the order of Caesar Gallus was transported into the midst of the grove of Daphne A magnificent church was erected over his remains a portion of the sacred lands was usurped for the maintenance of the clergy and for the burial of the Christians at Antioch who were ambitious of lying at the feet of their bishop and the priests of Apollo retired with their affrighted and indignant votaries As soon as another revolution seemed to restore the fortune of Paganism the church of saint Babylas was demolished and new buildings were added to the mouldering edifice which had been raised by the piety of Syrian kings But the first and most serious care of Julian was to deliver his oppressed deity from the odious presence of the dead and living Christians who had so effectually suppressed the voice of fraud or enthusiasm one hundred thirteen The scene of infection was purified according to the forms of ancient rituals the bodies were decently removed and the ministers of the church were permitted to convey the remains of saint Babylas to their former habitation within the walls of Antioch The modest behavior which might have assuaged the jealousy of a hostile government was neglected on this occasion by the zeal of the Christians The lofty car that transported the relics of Babylas was followed and accompanied and received by an innumerable multitude who chanted with thundering acclamations the Psalms of David the most expressive of their contempt for idols and idolaters The return of the saint was a triumph and the triumph was an insult on the religion of the emperor who exerted his pride to dissemble his resentment During the night which terminated this indiscreet procession the temple of Daphne was in flames the statue of Apollo was consumed and the walls of the edifice were left a naked and awful monument of ruin The Christians of Antioch asserted with religious confidence that the powerful intercession of saint Babylas had pointed the lightnings of heaven against the devoted roof but as Julian was reduced to the alternative of believing either a crime or a miracle he chose without hesitation without evidence but with some color of probability to impute the fire of Daphne to the revenge of the Galilaeans one hundred fourteen Their offence had it been sufficiently proved might have justified the retaliation which was immediately executed by the order of Julian of shutting the doors and confiscating the wealth of the cathedral of Antioch To discover the criminals who were guilty of the tumult of the fire or of secreting the riches of the church several of the ecclesiastics were tortured one hundred fifteen and a Presbyter of the name of Theodoret was beheaded by the sentence of the Count of the East But this hasty act was blamed by the emperor who lamented with real or affected concern that the imprudent zeal of his ministers would tarnish his reign with the disgrace of persecution one hundred sixteen Footnote one hundred eleven Julian Misopogon p three hundred sixty seven three hundred

complaint of Julian gives it an original and authentic air Chapter XXIII Reign Of Julian Part V The zeal of the ministers of Julian was instantly checked by the frown of their sovereign but when the father of his country declares himself the leader of a faction the license of popular fury cannot easily be restrained nor consistently punished Julian in a public composition applauds the devotion and loyalty of the holy cities of Syria whose pious inhabitants had destroyed at the first signal the sepulchres of the Galilaeans and faintly complains that they had revenged the injuries of the gods with less moderation than he should have recommended one hundred seventeen This imperfect and reluctant confession may appear to confirm the ecclesiastical narratives that in the cities of Gaza Ascalon Caesarea Heliopolis c the Pagans abused without prudence or remorse the moment of their prosperity That the unhappy objects of their cruelty were released from torture only by death and as their mangled bodies were dragged through the streets they were pierced such was the universal rage by the spits of cooks and the distaffs of enraged women and that the entrails of Christian priests and virgins after they had been tasted by those bloody fanatics were mixed with barley and contemptuously thrown to the unclean animals of the city one hundred eighteen Such scenes of religious

rendered it infamous He accumulated wealth by the basest arts of fraud and corruption but his malversations were so notorious that George was compelled to escape from the pursuits of justice After this disgrace in which he appears to have saved his fortune at the expense of his honor he embraced with real or affected zeal the profession of Arianism From the love or the ostentation of learning he collected a valuable library of history rhetoric philosophy and theology one hundred twenty and the choice of the prevailing faction promoted George of Cappadocia to the throne of Athanasius The entrance of the new archbishop was that of a Barbarian conqueror and each moment of his reign was polluted by cruelty and avarice The Catholics of Alexandria and Egypt were abandoned to a tyrant qualified by nature and education to exercise the office of persecution but he oppressed with an impartial hand the various inhabitants of his extensive diocese The primate of Egypt assumed the pomp and insolence of his lofty station but he still betrayed the vices of his base and servile extraction The merchants of Alexandria were impoverished by the unjust and almost universal monopoly which he acquired of nitre salt paper funerals c and the spiritual father of a great people condescended to practise the vile and pernicious arts of an informer The Alexandrians could never forget nor forgive the tax which he suggested on all the houses of the city under an obsolete claim that the royal founder had conveyed to his successors the Ptolemies and the Caesars the perpetual property of the soil The Pagans who had been flattered with the hopes of freedom and toleration excited his devout avarice and the rich temples of Alexandria were either pillaged or insulted by the haughty prince who exclaimed in a loud and threatening tone How long will these sepulchres be permitted to stand Under the reign of Constantius he was expelled by the fury or rather by the justice of the people and it was not without a violent struggle that the civil and military powers of the state could restore his authority and gratify his revenge The messenger who proclaimed at Alexandria the accession of Julian announced the downfall of the archbishop George with two of his obsequious ministers Count Diodorus and Dracontius master of the mint were ignominiously dragged in chains to the public prison At the end of twenty four days the prison was forced open by the rage of a superstitious multitude impatient of the tedious forms of judicial proceedings The enemies of gods and men expired under their cruel insults the lifeless bodies of the archbishop and his associates were carried in triumph through the streets on the back of a camel one hundred twenty and the inactivity of the Athanasian party one hundred twenty one was esteemed a shining example of evangelical patience The remains of these guilty wretches were thrown into the sea and the popular leaders of the tumult declared their resolution to disappoint the devotion of the Christians and to intercept the future honors of these martyrs who had been punished like their predecessors by the enemies of their religion one hundred twenty two The fears of the Pagans were just and their precautions ineffectual The meritorious death of the archbishop obliterated the memory of his life The rival of Athanasius was dear and sacred to the Arians and the seeming conversion of those sectaries introduced his worship into the bosom of the Catholic church one hundred twenty three The odious stranger disguising every circumstance of time

Mens April tom iii p one hundred one hundred sixty three His fame and popularity in Europe and especially in England proceeded from the Crusades About the same time that Julian was informed of the tumult of Alexandria he received intelligence from Edessa that the proud and wealthy faction of the Arians had insulted the weakness of the Valentinians and committed such disorders as ought not to be suffered with impunity in a well regulated state Without expecting the slow forms of justice the exasperated prince directed his mandate to the magistrates of Edessa one hundred twenty seven by which he confiscated the whole property of the church the money was distributed among the soldiers the lands were added to the domain and this act of oppression was aggravated by the most ungenerous irony I show myself says Julian the true friend of the Galilaeans Their admirable law has promised the kingdom of heaven to the poor and they will advance with more diligence in the paths of virtue and salvation when they are relieved by my assistance from the load of temporal possessions Take care pursued the monarch in a more serious tone take care how you provoke my patience and humanity If these disorders continue I will revenge on the magistrates the crimes of the people and you will have reason to dread not only confiscation and exile but fire and the sword The tumults of Alexandria were doubtless of a more bloody and dangerous nature but a Christian bishop had fallen by the hands of the Pagans and the public epistle of Julian affords a very lively proof of the partial spirit of his administration His reproaches to the citizens of Alexandria are mingled with expressions of esteem and tenderness and he laments that on this occasion they should have departed from the gentle and generous manners which attested their Grecian extraction He gravely censures the offence which they had committed against the laws of justice and humanity but he recapitulates with visible complacency the intolerable provocations which they had so long endured from the impious tyranny of George of Cappadocia Julian admits the principle that a wise and vigorous government should chastise the insolence of the people yet in consideration of their founder Alexander and of Serapis their tutelar deity he grants a free and gracious pardon to the guilty city for which he again feels the affection of a brother one hundred twenty eight Footnote one hundred twenty seven Julian Epist xliii Footnote one hundred twenty eight Julian Epist x He allowed his friends to assuage his anger Ammian xxii eleven After the tumult of Alexandria had subsided Athanasius amidst the public acclamations seated himself on the throne from whence his unworthy competitor had been precipitated and as the zeal of the archbishop was tempered with discretion the exercise of his authority tended not to inflame but to reconcile the minds of the people His pastoral labors were not confined to the narrow limits of Egypt The state of the Christian world was present to his active and capacious mind and the age the merit the reputation of Athanasius enabled him to assume in a moment of danger the office of Ecclesiastical Dictator one hundred twenty nine Three years were not yet elapsed since the majority of the bishops of the West had ignorantly or reluctantly subscribed the Confession of Rimini They repented they believed but they dreaded the unseasonable rigor of their orthodox brethren and if their pride was stronger than their faith they might throw themselves into the arms of the Arians to escape the indignity of a public penance which must degrade them to the condition of obscure laymen At the same time the domestic differences concerning the union and distinction of the divine persons were agitated with some heat among the Catholic doctors and the progress of this metaphysical controversy seemed to threaten a public and lasting division of the Greek and Latin churches By the wisdom of a select synod to which the name and presence of Athanasius gave the authority of a general council the bishops who had unwarily deviated into error were admitted to the communion of the church on the easy condition of subscribing the Nicene Creed without any formal acknowledgment of their past fault or any minute definition of their scholastic opinions The advice of the primate of Egypt had already prepared the clergy of Gaul and Spain of Italy and Greece for the reception of this salutary measure and notwithstanding the opposition of some ardent spirits one hundred thirty the fear of

The skill and diligence of the primate of Egypt had improved the season of tranquillity before it was interrupted by the hostile edicts of the emperor one hundred thirty two Julian who despised the Christians honored Athanasius with his sincere and peculiar hatred For his sake alone he introduced an arbitrary distinction repugnant at least to the spirit of his former declarations He maintained that the Galilaeans whom he had recalled from exile were not restored by that general indulgence to the possession of their respective churches and he expressed his astonishment that a criminal who had been repeatedly condemned by the judgment of the emperors should dare to insult the majesty of the laws and insolently usurp the archiepiscopal throne of Alexandria without expecting the orders of his sovereign As a punishment for the imaginary offence he again banished Athanasius from the city and he was pleased to suppose that this act of justice would be highly agreeable to his pious subjects The pressing solicitations of the people soon convinced him that the majority of the Alexandrians were Christians and that the greatest part of the Christians were firmly attached to the cause of their oppressed primate But the knowledge of their sentiments instead of persuading him to recall his decree provoked him to extend to all Egypt the term of the exile of Athanasius The zeal of the multitude rendered Julian still more inexorable he was alarmed by the danger of leaving at the head of a tumultuous city a daring and popular leader and the language of his resentment discovers the opinion which he entertained of the courage and abilities of Athanasius The execution of the sentence was still delayed by the caution or negligence of Ecdicius praefect of Egypt who was at length awakened from his lethargy by a severe reprimand Though you neglect says Julian to write to me on any other subject at least it is your duty to inform me of your conduct towards Athanasius the enemy of the gods My intentions have been long since communicated to you I swear by the great Serapis that unless on the calends of December Athanasius has departed from Alexandria nay from Egypt the officers of your government shall pay a fine of one hundred pounds of gold You know my temper I am slow to condemn but I am still slower to forgive This epistle was enforced by a short postscript written with the emperor s own hand The contempt that is shown for all the gods fills me with grief and indignation There is nothing that I should see nothing that I should hear with more pleasure than the expulsion of Athanasius from all Egypt The abominable wretch Under my reign the baptism of several Grecian ladies of the highest rank has been the effect of his persecutions one hundred thirty three The death of Athanasius was not expressly commanded but the praefect of Egypt understood that it was safer for him to exceed than to neglect the orders of an irritated master The archbishop prudently retired to the monasteries of the Desert eluded with his usual dexterity the snares of the enemy and lived to triumph over the ashes of a prince who in words of formidable import

at the same time be confessed that the real sufferings of the Christians were inflamed and magnified by human passions and religious enthusiasm The meekness and resignation which had distinguished the primitive disciples of the gospel was the object of the applause rather than of the imitation of their successors The Christians who had now possessed above forty years the civil and ecclesiastical government of the empire had contracted the insolent vices of prosperity one hundred thirty five and the habit of believing that the saints alone were entitled to reign over the earth As soon as the enmity of Julian deprived the clergy of the privileges which had been conferred by the favor of Constantine they complained of the most cruel oppression and the free toleration of idolaters and heretics was a subject of grief and scandal to the orthodox party one hundred thirty six The acts of violence which were no longer countenanced by the magistrates were still committed by the zeal of the people At Pessinus the altar of Cybele was overturned almost in the presence of the emperor and in the city of Caesarea in Cappadocia the temple of Fortune the sole place of worship which had been left to the Pagans was destroyed by the rage of a popular tumult On these occasions a prince who felt for the honor of the gods was not disposed to interrupt the course of justice and his mind was still more deeply exasperated when he found that the fanatics who had deserved and suffered the punishment of incendiaries were rewarded with the honors of martyrdom one hundred thirty seven The Christian subjects of Julian were assured of the hostile designs of their sovereign and to their jealous apprehension every circumstance of his government might afford some grounds of discontent and suspicion In the ordinary administration of the laws the Christians who formed so large a part of the people must frequently be condemned but their indulgent brethren without examining the merits of the cause presumed their innocence allowed their claims and imputed the severity of their judge to the partial malice of religious persecution one hundred thirty eight These present hardships intolerable as they might appear were represented as a slight prelude of the impending calamities The Christians considered Julian as a cruel and crafty tyrant who suspended the execution of his revenge till he should return victorious from the Persian war They expected that as soon as he had triumphed over the foreign enemies of Rome he would lay aside the irksome mask of dissimulation that the amphitheatre would stream with the blood of hermits and bishops and that the Christians who still persevered in the profession of the faith would be deprived of the common benefits of nature and society one hundred thirty nine Every calumny one hundred forty that could wound the reputation of the Apostate was credulously embraced by the fears and hatred of his adversaries and their indiscreet clamors provoked the temper of a sovereign whom it was their duty to respect and their interest to flatter They still protested that prayers and tears were their only weapons against the impious tyrant whose head they devoted to the justice of offended Heaven But they insinuated with sullen resolution that their submission was no longer the effect of weakness and that in the imperfect state of human virtue the patience which is founded on principle may be exhausted by persecution It is impossible to determine how far the zeal of Julian would have prevailed over his good sense and humanity but if we seriously reflect on the strength and spirit of the church we shall be convinced that before the emperor could have extinguished the religion of Christ he must have involved his country in the horrors of a civil war one hundred forty one Footnote one hundred thirty five See the fair confession of Gregory Orat iii p sixty one sixty two Footnote one hundred thirty six Hear the

Death Of Julian Election Of Jovian He Saves The Roman Army By A Disgraceful Treaty The philosophical fable which Julian composed under the name of the Caesars one is one of the most agreeable and instructive productions of ancient wit two During the freedom and equality of the days of the Saturnalia Romulus prepared a feast for the deities of Olympus who had adopted him as a worthy associate and for the Roman princes who had reigned over his martial people and the vanquished nations of the earth The immortals were placed in just order on their thrones of state and the table of the Caesars was spread below the Moon in the upper region of the air The tyrants who would have disgraced the society of gods and men were thrown headlong by the inexorable Nemesis into the Tartarean abyss The rest of the Caesars successively advanced to their seats and as they passed the vices the defects the blemishes of their respective characters were maliciously noticed by old Silenus a laughing moralist who disguised the wisdom of a philosopher under the mask of a Bacchanal three As soon as the feast was ended the voice of Mercury proclaimed the will of Jupiter that a celestial crown should be the reward of superior merit Julius Caesar Augustus Trajan and Marcus Antoninus were selected as the most illustrious candidates the effeminate Constantine four was not excluded from this honorable competition and the great Alexander was invited to dispute the prize of glory with the Roman heroes Each of the candidates was allowed to display the merit of his own exploits but in the judgment of the gods the modest silence of Marcus pleaded more powerfully than the elaborate orations of his haughty rivals When the judges of this awful contest proceeded to examine the heart and to scrutinize the springs of action the superiority of the Imperial Stoic appeared still more decisive and conspicuous five Alexander and Caesar Augustus Trajan and Constantine acknowledged with a blush that fame or power or pleasure had been the important object of their labors but the gods themselves beheld with reverence and love a virtuous mortal who had practised on the throne the lessons of philosophy and who in a state of human imperfection had aspired to imitate the moral attributes of the Deity The value of this agreeable composition the Caesars of Julian is enhanced by the rank of the author A prince who delineates with freedom the vices and virtues of his predecessors subscribes in every line the censure or approbation of his own conduct Footnote one See this fable or satire p three

learnedly discussed the etymology origin resemblance and disagreement of the Greek satyrs a dramatic piece which was acted after the tragedy and the Latin satires from Satura a miscellaneous

Rambach s observations M Footnote three This mixed character of Silenus is finely painted in the sixth eclogue of Virgil Footnote four Every impartial reader must perceive and condemn the partiality of Julian against his uncle Constantine and the Christian religion On this occasion the interpreters are compelled by a most sacred interest to renounce their allegiance and to desert the cause of their author Footnote five Julian was secretly inclined to prefer a Greek to a Roman But when he seriously compared a hero with a philosopher he was sensible that mankind had much greater obligations to Socrates than to Alexander Orat ad Themistium p two hundred sixty four In the cool moments of reflection Julian preferred the useful and benevolent virtues of Antoninus but his ambitious spirit was inflamed by the glory of Alexander and he solicited with equal ardor the esteem of the wise and the applause of the multitude In the season of life when the powers of the mind and body enjoy the most active vigor the emperor who was instructed by the experience and animated by the success of the German war resolved to signalize his reign by some more splendid and memorable achievement The ambassadors of the East from the continent of India and the Isle of Ceylon six had respectfully saluted the Roman purple seven The nations of the West esteemed and dreaded the personal virtues of Julian both in peace and war He despised the trophies of a Gothic victory and was satisfied that the rapacious Barbarians of the Danube would be restrained from any future violation of the faith of treaties by the terror of his name and the additional fortifications with which he strengthened the Thracian and Illyrian frontiers The successor of Cyrus and Artaxerxes was the only rival whom he deemed worthy of his arms and he resolved by the final conquest of Persia to chastise the naughty nation which had so long resisted and insulted the majesty of Rome nine As soon as the Persian monarch was informed that the throne of Constantius was filed by a prince of a very different character he condescended to make some artful or perhaps sincere overtures towards a negotiation of peace But the pride of Sapor was astonished by the firmness of Julian who sternly declared that he would never consent to hold a peaceful conference among the flames and ruins of the cities of Mesopotamia and who added with a smile of contempt that it was needless to treat by ambassadors as he himself had determined to visit speedily the court of Persia The impatience of the emperor urged the diligence of the military preparations The generals were named and Julian marching from Constantinople through the provinces of Asia Minor arrived at Antioch about eight months after the death of his predecessor His ardent desire to march into the heart of Persia was checked by the indispensable duty of regulating the state of the empire by his zeal to revive the worship of the gods and by the advice of his wisest friends who represented the necessity of allowing the salutary interval of winter quarters to restore the exhausted strength of the legions of Gaul and the discipline and spirit of the Eastern troops Julian was persuaded to fix till the ensuing spring his residence at Antioch among a people maliciously disposed to deride the haste and to censure the delays of their sovereign ten Footnote

Parent c seventy nine eighty p three hundred five three hundred six Zosimus l iii p one hundred fifty eight and Socrates l iii c nineteen If Julian had flattered himself that his personal connection with the capital of the East would be productive of mutual satisfaction to the prince and people he made a very false estimate of his own character and of the manners of Antioch eleven The warmth of the climate disposed the natives to the most intemperate enjoyment of tranquillity and opulence and the lively licentiousness of the Greeks was blended with the hereditary softness of the Syrians Fashion was the only law pleasure the only pursuit and the splendor of dress and furniture was the only distinction of the citizens of Antioch The arts of luxury were honored the serious and manly virtues were the subject of ridicule and the contempt for female modesty and reverent age announced the universal corruption of the capital of the East The love of spectacles was the taste or rather passion of the Syrians the most skilful artists were procured from the adjacent cities twelve a considerable share of the revenue was devoted to the public amusements and the magnificence of the games of the theatre and circus was considered as the happiness and as the glory of Antioch The rustic manners of a prince who disdained such glory and was insensible of such happiness soon disgusted the delicacy of his subjects and the effeminate Orientals could neither imitate nor admire the severe simplicity which Julian always maintained and sometimes affected The days of festivity consecrated by ancient custom to the honor of the gods were the only occasions in which Julian relaxed his philosophic severity and those festivals were the only days in which the Syrians of Antioch could reject the allurements of pleasure The majority of the people supported the glory of the Christian name which had been first invented by their ancestors thirteen they contended themselves with disobeying the moral precepts but they were scrupulously attached to the speculative doctrines of their religion The church of Antioch was distracted by heresy and schism but the Arians and the Athanasians the followers of Meletius and those of Paulinus fourteen were actuated by the same pious hatred of their common adversary Footnote eleven The Satire of Julian and the Homilies of saint Chrysostom exhibit the same picture of Antioch The miniature which the Abbe de la Bleterie has copied from thence Vie de Julian p three hundred thirty two is elegant and correct Footnote twelve Laodicea furnished

Paulinus See Tillemont Mem Eccles tom iii p eight hundred three of the quarto edition Paris seventeen oh one c which henceforward I shall quote The strongest prejudice was entertained against the character of an apostate the enemy and successor of a prince who had engaged the affections of a very numerous sect and the removal of saint Babylas excited an implacable opposition to the person of Julian His subjects complained with superstitious indignation that famine had pursued the emperor s steps from Constantinople to Antioch and the discontent of a hungry people was exasperated by the injudicious attempt to relieve their distress The inclemency of the season had affected the harvests of Syria and the price of bread fifteen in the markets of Antioch had naturally risen in proportion to the scarcity of corn But the fair and reasonable proportion was soon violated by the rapacious arts of monopoly In this unequal contest in which the produce of the land is claimed by one party as his exclusive property is used by another as a lucrative object of trade and is required by a third for the daily and necessary support of life all the profits of the intermediate agents are accumulated on the head of the defenceless customers The hardships of their situation were exaggerated and increased by their own impatience and anxiety and the apprehension of a scarcity gradually produced the appearances of a famine When the luxurious citizens of Antioch complained of the high price of poultry and fish Julian publicly declared that a frugal city ought to be satisfied with a regular supply of wine oil and bread but he acknowledged that it was the duty of a sovereign to provide for the subsistence of his people With this salutary view the emperor ventured on a very dangerous and doubtful step of fixing by legal authority the value of corn He enacted that in a time of scarcity it should be sold at a price which had seldom been known in the most plentiful years and that his own example might strengthen his laws he sent into the market four hundred and twenty two thousand modii or measures which were drawn by his order from the granaries of Hierapolis of Chalcis and even of Egypt The consequences might have been foreseen and were soon felt The Imperial wheat was purchased by the rich merchants the proprietors of land or of corn withheld from the city the accustomed supply and the small quantities that appeared in the market were secretly sold at an advanced and illegal price Julian still continued to applaud his own policy treated the complaints of the people as a vain and ungrateful murmur and convinced Antioch that he had inherited the obstinacy though not the cruelty of his brother Gallus sixteen The remonstrances of the municipal senate served only to exasperate his inflexible mind He was persuaded perhaps with truth that the senators of Antioch who possessed lands or were concerned in trade had themselves contributed to the calamities of their country and he imputed the disrespectful boldness which they assumed to the sense not of public duty but of private interest The whole body consisting of two hundred of the most noble and wealthy citizens were sent under a guard from the palace to the prison and though they were permitted before the close of evening to return to their respective houses seventeen the emperor himself could not obtain the forgiveness which he had so easily granted The same grievances were still the subject of the same complaints which were industriously circulated by the wit and levity of the Syrian Greeks During the licentious days of the Saturnalia the streets of the city resounded with insolent songs which derided the laws the religion the personal conduct and even the beard of the emperor the spirit of Antioch was manifested by the connivance of the magistrates and the applause of the multitude eighteen The disciple of Socrates was too deeply affected by these popular insults but the monarch endowed with a quick sensibility and possessed of absolute power refused his passions the gratification of revenge A tyrant might have proscribed without distinction the lives and fortunes of the citizens of Antioch and the unwarlike Syrians must have patiently submitted to the lust the rapaciousness and the cruelty of the faithful legions of Gaul A milder sentence might have deprived the capital of the East of its honors and privileges and the courtiers perhaps the subjects of Julian would have applauded an act of justice which asserted the dignity of the supreme magistrate of the republic nineteen But instead of abusing or exerting the authority of the state to revenge his personal injuries Julian contented himself with an inoffensive mode of retaliation which it would be in the power of few princes to employ He had been insulted by satires and libels in his turn he composed under the title of the Enemy of the Beard an ironical confession of his own faults and a severe satire on the licentious and effeminate manners of Antioch This Imperial reply was publicly exposed before the gates of the palace and the Misopogon twenty still remains a singular monument of the resentment the wit the humanity and the indiscretion of Julian Though he affected to laugh he could not forgive twenty one His contempt was expressed and his revenge might be gratified by the nomination of a governor twenty two worthy only of such subjects and the emperor forever renouncing the ungrateful city proclaimed his resolution to pass the ensuing winter at Tarsus in Cilicia twenty three Footnote fifteen Julian states three different proportions of five ten or fifteen medii of wheat for one piece of gold according to the degrees of plenty and scarcity in Misopogon p three hundred sixty nine From this fact and from some collateral examples I conclude that under the successors of Constantine the moderate price of wheat was about thirty two shillings the English quarter

loc Libanius in a professed oration invites him to return to his loyal and penitent city of Antioch Yet Antioch possessed one citizen whose genius and virtues might atone in the opinion of Julian for the vice and folly of his country The sophist Libanius was born in the capital of the East he publicly professed the arts of rhetoric and declamation at Nice Nicomedia Constantinople Athens and during the remainder of his life at Antioch His school was assiduously frequented by the Grecian youth his disciples who sometimes exceeded the number of eighty celebrated their incomparable master and the jealousy of his rivals who persecuted him from one city to another confirmed the favorable opinion which Libanius ostentatiously displayed of his superior merit The preceptors of Julian had extorted a rash but solemn assurance that he would never attend the lectures of their adversary the curiosity of the royal youth was checked and inflamed he secretly procured the writings of this dangerous sophist and gradually surpassed in the perfect imitation of his style the most laborious of his domestic pupils twenty four When Julian ascended the throne he declared his impatience to embrace and reward the Syrian sophist who had preserved in a degenerate age the Grecian purity of taste of manners and of religion The emperor s prepossession was increased and justified by the discreet pride of his favorite Instead of pressing with the foremost of the crowd into the palace of Constantinople Libanius calmly expected his arrival at Antioch withdrew from court on the first symptoms of coldness and indifference required a formal invitation for each visit and taught his sovereign an important lesson that he might command the obedience of a subject but that he must deserve the attachment of a friend The sophists of every age despising or affecting to despise the accidental distinctions of birth and fortune twenty five reserve their esteem for the superior qualities of the mind with which they themselves are so plentifully endowed Julian might disdain the acclamations of a venal court who adored the Imperial purple but he was deeply flattered by the praise the admonition the freedom and the envy of an independent philosopher who refused his favors loved his person celebrated his fame and protected his memory The voluminous writings of Libanius still exist for the most part they are the vain and idle compositions of an orator who cultivated the science of words the productions of a recluse student whose mind regardless of his contemporaries was incessantly fixed on the Trojan war and the Athenian commonwealth Yet the sophist of Antioch sometimes descended from this imaginary elevation he entertained a various and elaborate correspondence twenty six he praised the virtues of his own times he boldly arraigned the abuse of public and private life and he eloquently pleaded the cause of Antioch against the just resentment of Julian and Theodosius It is the common calamity of old age twenty seven to lose whatever might have rendered it desirable but Libanius experienced the peculiar misfortune of surviving the religion and the sciences to which he had consecrated his genius The friend of Julian was an indignant spectator of the triumph of Christianity and his bigotry which darkened the prospect of the visible world did not inspire Libanius with any lively hopes of celestial glory and happiness twenty eight Footnote twenty four Libanius Orat Parent c vii p two hundred thirty two hundred thirty one Footnote twenty five Eunapius reports that Libanius refused the

illustrated the character and writings of this famous sophist Chapter XXIV The Retreat And Death Of Julian Part II The martial impatience of Julian urged him to take the field in the beginning of the spring and he dismissed with contempt and reproach the senate of Antioch who accompanied the emperor beyond the limits of their own territory to which he was resolved never to return After a laborious march of two days twenty nine he halted on the third at Beraea or Aleppo where he had the mortification of finding a senate almost entirely Christian who received with cold and formal demonstrations of respect the eloquent sermon of the apostle of paganism The son of one of the most illustrious citizens of Beraea who had embraced either from interest or conscience the religion of the emperor was disinherited by his angry parent The father and the son were invited to the Imperial table Julian placing himself between them attempted without success to inculcate the lesson and example of toleration supported with affected calmness the indiscreet zeal of the aged Christian who seemed to forget the sentiments of nature and the duty of a subject and at length turning towards the afflicted youth Since you have lost a father said he for my sake it is incumbent on me to supply his place thirty The emperor was received in a manner much more agreeable to his wishes at Batnae thirtya a small town pleasantly seated in a grove of cypresses about twenty miles from the city of Hierapolis The solemn rites of sacrifice were decently prepared by the inhabitants of Batnae who seemed attached to the worship of their tutelar deities Apollo and Jupiter but the serious piety of Julian was offended by the tumult of their applause and he too clearly discerned that the smoke which arose from their altars was the incense of flattery rather than of devotion The ancient and magnificent temple which had sanctified for so many ages the city of Hierapolis thirty one no longer subsisted and the consecrated wealth which afforded a liberal maintenance to more than three hundred priests might hasten its downfall Yet Julian enjoyed the satisfaction of embracing a philosopher and a friend whose religious firmness had withstood the pressing and repeated solicitations of Constantius and Gallus as often as those princes lodged at his house in their passage through Hierapolis In the hurry of military preparation and the careless confidence of a familiar correspondence the zeal of Julian appears to have been lively and uniform He had now undertaken an important and difficult war and the anxiety of the event rendered him still more attentive to observe and register the most trifling presages from which according to the rules of divination any knowledge of futurity could be derived thirty two He informed Libanius of his progress as far as Hierapolis by an elegant epistle thirty three which displays the facility of his genius and his tender friendship for the sophist of Antioch Footnote twenty nine From Antioch to Litarbe on the territory of Chalcis the road over hills and through morasses was extremely bad and the loose stones were cemented only

Julian epist xxvii p three hundred ninety nine four hundred two Hierapolis thirty threea situate almost on the banks of the Euphrates thirty four had been appointed for the general rendezvous of the Roman troops who immediately passed the great river on a bridge of boats which was previously constructed thirty five If the inclinations of Julian had been similar to those of his predecessor he might have wasted the active and important season of the year in the circus of Samosata or in the churches of Edessa But as the warlike emperor instead of Constantius had chosen Alexander for his model he advanced without delay to Carrhae thirty six a very ancient city of Mesopotamia at the distance of fourscore miles from Hierapolis The temple of the Moon attracted the devotion of Julian but the halt of a few days was principally employed in completing the immense preparations of the Persian war The secret of the expedition had hitherto remained in his own breast but as Carrhae is the point of separation of the two great roads he could no longer conceal whether it was his design to attack the dominions of Sapor on the side of the Tigris or on that of the Euphrates The emperor detached an army of thirty thousand men under the command of his kinsman Procopius and of Sebastian who had been duke of Egypt They were ordered to direct their march towards Nisibis and to secure the frontier from the desultory incursions of the enemy before they attempted the passage of the Tigris Their subsequent operations were left to the discretion of the generals but Julian expected that after wasting with fire and sword the fertile districts of Media and Adiabene they might arrive under the walls of Ctesiphon at the same time that he himself advancing with equal steps along the banks of the Euphrates should besiege the capital of the Persian monarchy The success of this well concerted plan depended in a great measure on the powerful and ready assistance of the king of Armenia who without exposing the safety of his own dominions might detach an army of four thousand horse and twenty thousand foot to the assistance of the Romans thirty seven But the feeble Arsaces Tiranus thirty eight king of Armenia had degenerated still more shamefully than his father Chosroes from the manly virtues of the great Tiridates and as the pusillanimous monarch was averse to any enterprise of danger and glory he could disguise his timid indolence by the more decent excuses of religion and gratitude He expressed a pious attachment to the memory of Constantius from whose hands he had received in marriage Olympias the daughter of the praefect Ablavius and the alliance of a female who had been educated as the destined wife of the emperor Constans exalted the dignity of a Barbarian king thirty nine Tiranus professed the Christian religion he reigned over a nation of Christians and he was restrained by every principle of conscience and interest from contributing to the victory which would consummate the ruin of the church The alienated mind of Tiranus was exasperated by the indiscretion of Julian who treated the king of Armenia as his slave and as the enemy of the gods The haughty and threatening style of the Imperial mandates forty awakened the secret indignation of a prince who in the humiliating state of dependence was still conscious of his royal descent from the

dispositions of Julian were skilfully contrived to deceive the spies and to divert the attention of Sapor The legions appeared to direct their march towards Nisibis and the Tigris On a sudden they wheeled to the right traversed the level and naked plain of Carrhae and reached on the third day the banks of the Euphrates where the strong town of Nicephorium or Callinicum had been founded by the Macedonian kings From thence the emperor pursued his march above ninety miles along the winding stream of the Euphrates till at length about one month after his departure from Antioch he discovered the towers of Circesium fortyb the extreme limit of the Roman dominions The army of Julian the most numerous that any of the Caesars had ever led against Persia consisted of sixty five thousand effective and well disciplined soldiers The veteran bands of cavalry and infantry of Romans and Barbarians had been selected from the different provinces and a just preeminence of loyalty and valor was claimed by the hardy Gauls who guarded the throne and person of their beloved prince A formidable body of Scythian auxiliaries had been transported from another climate and almost from another world to invade a distant country of whose name and situation they were ignorant The love of rapine and war allured to the Imperial standard several tribes of Saracens or roving Arabs whose service Julian had commanded while he sternly refuse the payment of the accustomed subsidies The broad channel of the Euphrates forty one was crowded by a fleet of eleven hundred ships destined to attend the motions and to satisfy the wants of the Roman army The military strength of the fleet was composed of fifty armed galleys and these were accompanied by an equal number of flat bottomed boats which might occasionally be connected into the form of temporary bridges The rest of the ships partly constructed of timber and partly covered with raw hides were laden with an almost inexhaustible supply of arms and engines of utensils and provisions The vigilant humanity of Julian had embarked a very large magazine of vinegar and biscuit for the use of the soldiers but he prohibited the indulgence of wine and rigorously stopped a long string of superfluous camels that attempted to follow the rear of the army The River Chaboras falls into the Euphrates at Circesium forty two and as soon as the trumpet gave the signal of march the Romans passed the little stream which separated two mighty and hostile empires The custom of ancient discipline required a military oration and Julian embraced every opportunity of displaying his eloquence He animated the impatient and attentive legions by the example of the inflexible courage and glorious triumphs of their ancestors He excited their resentment by a lively picture of the insolence of the Persians and he exhorted them to imitate his firm resolution either to extirpate that perfidious nation or to devote his life in the cause of the republic The eloquence of Julian was enforced by a donative of one hundred and thirty pieces of silver to every soldier and the bridge of the Chaboras was instantly cut away to convince the troops that they must place their hopes of safety in the success of their arms Yet the prudence of the emperor induced him to secure a remote frontier perpetually exposed to the inroads of the hostile Arabs

whole army was placed in the centre under the peculiar command of their master general Victor On the right the brave Nevitta led a column of several legions along the banks of the Euphrates and almost always in sight of the fleet The left flank of the army was protected by the column of cavalry Hormisdas and Arinthaeus were appointed generals of the horse and the singular adventures of Hormisdas forty six are not undeserving of our notice He was a Persian prince of the royal race of the Sassanides who in the troubles of the minority of Sapor had escaped from prison to the hospitable court of the great Constantine Hormisdas at first excited the compassion and at length acquired the esteem of his new masters his valor and fidelity raised him to the military honors of the Roman service and though a Christian he might indulge the secret satisfaction of convincing his ungrateful country than at oppressed subject may prove the most dangerous enemy Such was the disposition of the three principal columns The front and flanks of the army were covered by Lucilianus with a flying detachment of fifteen hundred light armed soldiers whose active vigilance observed the most distant signs and conveyed the earliest notice of any hostile approach Dagalaiphus and Secundinus duke of Osrhoene conducted the troops of the rear guard the baggage securely proceeded in the intervals of the columns and the ranks from a motive either of use or ostentation were formed in such open order that the whole line of march extended almost ten miles The ordinary post of Julian was at the head of the centre column but as he preferred the duties of a general to the state of a monarch he rapidly moved with a small escort of light cavalry to the front the rear the flanks wherever his presence could animate or protect the march of the Roman army The country which they traversed from the Chaboras to the cultivated lands of Assyria may be considered as a part of the desert of Arabia a dry and barren waste which could never be improved by the most powerful arts of human industry Julian marched over the same ground which had been trod above seven hundred years before by the footsteps of the younger Cyrus and which is described by one of the companions of his expedition the sage and heroic Xenophon forty seven The country was a plain throughout as even as the sea and full of wormwood and if any other kind of shrubs or reeds grew there they had all an aromatic smell but no trees could be seen Bustards and ostriches antelopes and wild asses forty eight appeared to be the only inhabitants of the desert and the fatigues of the march were alleviated by the amusements of the chase The loose sand of the desert was frequently raised by the wind into clouds of dust and a great

populous towns and villages were pleasantly situated on the banks of the Euphrates and in the islands which are occasionally formed by that river The city of Annah or Anatho forty nine the actual residence of an Arabian emir is composed of two long streets which enclose within a natural fortification a small island in the midst and two fruitful spots on either side of the Euphrates The warlike inhabitants of Anatho showed a disposition to stop the march of a Roman emperor till they were diverted from such fatal presumption by the mild exhortations of Prince Hormisdas and the approaching terrors of the fleet and army They implored and experienced the clemency of Julian who transplanted the people to an advantageous settlement near Chalcis in Syria and admitted Pusaeus the governor to an honorable rank in his service and friendship But the impregnable fortress of Thilutha could scorn the menace of a siege and the emperor was obliged to content himself with an insulting promise that when he had subdued the interior provinces of Persia Thilutha would no longer refuse to grace the triumph of the emperor The inhabitants of the open towns unable to resist and unwilling to yield fled with precipitation and their houses filled with spoil and provisions were occupied by the soldiers of Julian who massacred without remorse and without punishment some defenceless women During the march the Surenas forty ninea or Persian general and Malek Rodosaces the renowned emir of the tribe of Gassan fifty incessantly hovered round the army every straggler was intercepted every detachment was attacked and the valiant Hormisdas escaped with some difficulty from their hands But the Barbarians were finally repulsed the country became every day less favorable to the operations of cavalry and when the Romans arrived at Macepracta they perceived the ruins of the wall which had been constructed by the ancient kings of Assyria to secure their dominions from the incursions of the Medes

more distant than fifty approach between Bagdad and Babylon within twenty five miles of each other A multitude of artificial canals dug without much labor in a soft and yielding soil connected the rivers and intersected the plain of Assyria The uses of these artificial canals were various and important They served to discharge the superfluous waters from one river into the other at the season of their respective inundations Subdividing themselves into smaller and smaller branches they refreshed the dry lands and supplied the deficiency of rain They facilitated the intercourse of peace and commerce and as the dams could be speedily broke down they armed the despair of the Assyrians with the means of opposing a sudden deluge to the progress of an invading army To the soil and climate of Assyria nature had denied some of her choicest gifts the vine the olive and the fig tree fifty foura but the food which supports the life of man and particularly wheat and barley were produced with inexhaustible fertility and the husbandman who committed his seed to the earth was frequently rewarded with an increase of two or even of three hundred The face of the country was interspersed with

fruit were skilfully applied Several manufactures especially those of leather and linen employed the industry of a numerous people and afforded valuable materials for foreign trade which appears

gross and the net revenue of Persia the sums paid by the province and the gold or silver deposited in the royal treasure The monarch might annually save three millions six hundred thousand pounds of the seventeen or eighteen millions raised upon the people Chapter XXIV The Retreat And Death Of Julian Part III The fields of Assyria were devoted by Julian to the calamities of war and the philosopher retaliated on a guiltless people the acts of rapine and cruelty which had been committed by their haughty master in the Roman provinces The trembling Assyrians summoned the rivers to their assistance and completed with their own hands the ruin of their country The roads were rendered impracticable a flood of waters was poured into the camp and during several days the troops of Julian were obliged to contend with the most discouraging hardships But every obstacle was surmounted by the perseverance of the legionaries who were inured to toil as well as to danger and who felt themselves animated by the spirit of their leader The damage was gradually repaired the waters were restored to their proper channels whole groves of palm trees were cut down and placed along the broken parts of the road and the army passed over the broad and deeper canals on bridges of floating rafts which were supported by the help of bladders Two cities of Assyria presumed to resist the arms of a Roman emperor and they both paid the severe penalty of their rashness At the distance of fifty miles from the royal residence of Ctesiphon Perisabor fifty sevena or Anbar held the second rank in the province a city large populous and well fortified surrounded with a double wall almost encompassed by a branch of the Euphrates and defended by the valor of a numerous garrison The exhortations of Hormisdas were repulsed with contempt and the ears of the Persian prince were wounded by a just reproach that unmindful of his royal birth he conducted an army of strangers against his king and country The Assyrians maintained their loyalty by a skilful as well as vigorous defence till the lucky stroke of a battering ram having opened a large breach by shattering one of the angles of the wall they hastily retired into the fortifications of the interior citadel The soldiers of Julian rushed impetuously into the town and after the full gratification of every military appetite Perisabor was reduced to ashes and the engines which assaulted the citadel were planted on the ruins of the smoking houses The contest was continued by an incessant and mutual discharge of missile weapons and the superiority which the Romans might derive from the mechanical powers of their balistae and catapultae was counterbalanced by the advantage of the ground on the side of the besieged But as soon as an Helepolis had been constructed which could engage on equal terms with the loftiest ramparts the tremendous aspect of a moving turret that would leave no hope of resistance or mercy terrified the defenders of the citadel into an humble submission and the place was surrendered only two days after Julian first appeared under the walls of Perisabor Two thousand five hundred persons of both sexes the feeble remnant of a flourishing people were permitted to retire the plentiful magazines of corn of arms and of splendid furniture were partly distributed among the troops and partly reserved for the public service the useless stores were destroyed by fire or thrown into the stream of the Euphrates and the fate of Amida was revenged by the total ruin of Perisabor Footnote fifty sevena Libanius says that it was a great city of Assyria called after the name of the reigning king The orator of Antioch is not mistaken The Persians and Syrians called it Fyrouz Schapour or Fyrouz Schahbour in Persian the victory of Schahpour It owed that name to Sapor the First It was before called Anbar saint Martin iii eighty five M The city or rather fortress of Maogamalcha which was defended by sixteen large towers a deep ditch and two strong and solid walls of brick and bitumen appears to have been constructed at the distance of eleven miles as the safeguard of the capital of Persia The emperor apprehensive of leaving such an important fortress in his rear immediately formed the siege of Maogamalcha and the Roman army was distributed for that purpose into three divisions Victor at the head of the cavalry and of a detachment of heavy armed foot was ordered to clear the country as far as the banks of the Tigris and the suburbs of Ctesiphon The conduct of the attack was assumed by Julian himself who seemed to place his whole dependence in the military engines which he erected against the walls while he secretly contrived a more efficacious method of introducing his troops into the heart of the city Under the direction of Nevitta and Dagalaiphus the trenches were opened at a considerable distance and gradually prolonged as far as the edge of the ditch The ditch was speedily filled with earth and by the incessant labor of the troops a mine was carried under the foundations of the walls and sustained at sufficient intervals by props of timber Three chosen cohorts advancing in a single file silently explored the dark and dangerous passage till their intrepid leader whispered back the intelligence that he was ready to issue from his confinement into the streets of the hostile city Julian checked their ardor that he might insure their success and immediately diverted the attention of the garrison by the tumult and clamor of a general assault The Persians who from their walls contemptuously beheld the progress of an impotent attack celebrated with songs of triumph the glory of Sapor and ventured to assure the emperor that he might ascend the starry mansion of Ormusd before he could hope to take the impregnable city of Maogamalcha The city was already taken History has recorded the name of a private soldier the first who ascended from the mine into a deserted tower The passage was widened by his companions who pressed forwards with impatient valor Fifteen hundred enemies were already in the midst of the city The astonished garrison abandoned the walls and their only hope of safety the gates were instantly burst open and the revenge of the soldier unless it were suspended by lust or avarice was satiated by an undistinguishing massacre The governor who had yielded on a promise of mercy was burnt alive a few days afterwards on a charge of having uttered some disrespectful words against the honor of Prince Hormisdas The fortifications were razed to the ground and not a vestige was left that the city of Maogamalcha had ever existed The neighborhood of the capital of Persia was adorned with three stately palaces laboriously enriched with every production that could gratify the luxury and pride of an Eastern monarch The pleasant situation of the gardens along the banks of the Tigris was improved according to the Persian taste by the symmetry of flowers fountains and shady walks and spacious parks were enclosed for the reception of the bears lions and wild boars which were maintained at a considerable expense for the pleasure of the royal chase The park walls were broken down the savage game was abandoned to the darts of the soldiers and the palaces of Sapor were reduced to ashes by the command of the Roman emperor Julian on this occasion showed himself ignorant or careless of the laws of civility which the prudence and refinement of polished ages have established between hostile princes Yet these wanton ravages need not excite in our breasts any vehement emotions of pity or resentment A simple naked statue finished by the hand of a Grecian artist is of more genuine value than all these rude and costly monuments of Barbaric labor and if we are more deeply affected by the ruin of a palace than by the conflagration of a cottage our humanity must have formed a very erroneous estimate of the miseries of human life fifty seven Footnote fifty sevena And as guilty of a double treachery having first engaged to surrender the city and afterwards valiantly defended it Gibbon perhaps should

To his friends and soldiers the philosophic hero appeared in a more amiable light and his virtues were never more conspicuously displayed than in the last and most active period of his life He practised without effort and almost without merit the habitual qualities of temperance and sobriety According to the dictates of that artificial wisdom which assumes an absolute dominion over the mind and body he sternly refused himself the indulgence of the most natural appetites fifty nine In the warm climate of Assyria which solicited a luxurious people to the gratification of every sensual desire sixty a youthful conqueror preserved his chastity pure and inviolate nor was Julian ever tempted even by a motive of curiosity to visit his female captives of exquisite beauty sixty one who instead of resisting his power would have disputed with each other the honor of his embraces With the same firmness that he resisted the allurements of love he sustained the hardships of war When the Romans marched through the flat and flooded country their sovereign on foot at the head of his legions shared their fatigues and animated their diligence In every useful labor the hand of Julian was prompt and strenuous and the Imperial purple was wet and dirty as the coarse garment of the meanest soldier The two sieges allowed him some remarkable opportunities of signalizing his personal valor which in the improved state of the military art can seldom be exerted by a prudent general The emperor stood before the citadel before the citadel of Perisabor insensible of his extreme danger and encouraged his troops to burst open the gates of iron till he was almost overwhelmed under a cloud of missile weapons and huge stones that were directed against his person As he examined the exterior fortifications of Maogamalcha two Persians devoting themselves for their country suddenly rushed upon him with drawn cimeters the emperor dexterously received their blows on his uplifted shield and with a steady and well aimed thrust laid one of his adversaries dead at his feet The esteem of a prince who possesses the virtues which he approves is the noblest recompense of a deserving subject and the authority which Julian derived from his personal merit enabled him to revive and enforce the rigor of ancient discipline He punished with death or ignominy the misbehavior of three troops of horse who in a skirmish with the Surenas had lost their honor and one of their standards and he distinguished with obsidional sixty two crowns the valor of the foremost soldiers who had ascended into the city of Maogamalcha After the siege of Perisabor the firmness of the emperor was exercised by the insolent avarice of the army who loudly complained that their services were rewarded by a trifling donative of one hundred pieces of silver His just indignation was expressed in the grave and manly language of a Roman Riches are the object of your desires those riches are in the hands of the Persians and the spoils of this fruitful country are proposed as the prize of your valor and discipline Believe me added Julian the Roman republic which formerly possessed such immense treasures is now reduced to want and wretchedness once our princes have been persuaded by weak and interested ministers to purchase with gold the tranquillity of the Barbarians The revenue is exhausted the cities are ruined the provinces are dispeopled For myself the only inheritance that I have received from my royal ancestors is a soul incapable of fear and as long as I am convinced that every real advantage is seated in the mind I shall not blush to acknowledge an honorable poverty which in the days of ancient virtue was considered as the glory of Fabricius That glory and that virtue may be your own if you will listen to the voice of Heaven and of your leader But if you will rashly persist if you are determined to renew the shameful and mischievous examples of old seditions proceed As it becomes an emperor who has filled the first rank among men I am prepared to die standing and to despise a precarious life which every hour may depend on an accidental fever If I have been found unworthy of the command there are now among you I speak it with pride and pleasure there are many chiefs whose merit and experience are equal to the conduct of the most important war Such has been the temper of my reign that I can retire without regret and without apprehension to the obscurity of a private station sixty three The modest resolution of Julian was answered by the unanimous applause and cheerful obedience of the Romans who declared their confidence of victory while they fought under the banners of their heroic prince Their courage was kindled by his frequent and familiar asseverations for such wishes were the oaths of Julian So may I reduce the Persians under the yoke Thus may I restore the strength and splendor of the republic The love of fame was the ardent passion of his soul but it was not before he trampled on the ruins of Maogamalcha that he allowed himself to say We have now provided some materials for the sophist of Antioch sixty four Footnote fifty eight Libanius de

military conduct of the emperor be clearly apprehended without a knowledge of the country which was the theatre of his bold and skilful operations sixty five Twenty miles to the south of Bagdad and on the eastern bank of the Tigris the curiosity of travellers has observed some ruins of the palaces of Ctesiphon which in the time of Julian was a great and populous city The name and glory of the adjacent Seleucia were forever extinguished and the only remaining quarter of that Greek colony had resumed with the Assyrian language and manners the primitive appellation of Coche Coche was situate on the western side of the Tigris but it was naturally considered as a suburb of Ctesiphon with which we may suppose it to have been connected by a permanent bridge of boats The united parts contribute to form the common epithet of Al Modain the cities which the Orientals have bestowed on the winter residence of the Sassinadees and the whole circumference of the Persian capital was strongly fortified by the waters of the river by lofty walls and by impracticable morasses Near the ruins of Seleucia the camp of Julian was fixed and secured by a ditch and rampart against the sallies of the numerous and enterprising garrison of Coche In this fruitful and pleasant country the Romans were plentifully supplied with water and forage and several forts which might have embarrassed the motions of the army submitted after some resistance to the efforts of their valor The fleet passed from the Euphrates into an artificial derivation of that river which pours a copious and navigable stream into the Tigris at a small distance below the great city If they had followed this royal canal which bore the name of Nahar Malcha sixty six the intermediate situation of Coche would have separated the fleet and army of Julian and the rash attempt of steering against the current of the Tigris and forcing their way through the midst of a hostile capital must have been attended with the total destruction of the Roman navy The prudence of the emperor foresaw the danger and provided the remedy As he had minutely studied the operations of Trajan in the same country he soon recollected that his warlike predecessor had dug a new and navigable canal which leaving Coche on the right hand conveyed the waters of the Nahar Malcha into the river Tigris at some distance above the cities From the information of the peasants Julian ascertained the vestiges of this ancient work which were almost obliterated by design or accident By the indefatigable labor of the soldiers a broad and deep channel was speedily prepared for the reception of the Euphrates A strong dike was constructed to interrupt the ordinary current of the Nahar Malcha a flood of waters rushed impetuously into their new bed and the Roman fleet steering their triumphant course into the Tigris derided the vain and ineffectual barriers which the Persians of Ctesiphon had erected to oppose

the intrenchments which had been formed on the ridge of the opposite bank were lined with a numerous army of heavy cuirrasiers dexterous archers and huge elephants who according to the extravagant hyperbole of Libanius could trample with the same ease a field of corn or a legion of Romans sixty seven In the presence of such an enemy the construction of a bridge was impracticable and the intrepid prince who instantly seized the only possible expedient concealed his design till the moment of execution from the knowledge of the Barbarians of his own troops and even of his generals themselves Under the specious pretence of examining the state of the magazines fourscore vessels sixty sevena were gradually unladen and a select detachment apparently destined for some secret expedition was ordered to stand to their arms on the first signal Julian disguised the silent anxiety of his own mind with smiles of confidence and joy and amused the hostile nations with the spectacle of military games which he insultingly celebrated under the walls of Coche The day was consecrated to pleasure but as soon as the hour of supper was passed the emperor summoned the generals to his tent and acquainted them that he had fixed that night for the passage of the Tigris They stood in silent and respectful astonishment but when the venerable Sallust assumed the privilege of his age and experience the rest of the chiefs supported with freedom the weight of his prudent remonstrances sixty eight Julian contented himself with observing that conquest and safety depended on the attempt that instead of diminishing the number of their enemies would be increased by successive reenforcements and that a longer delay would neither contract the breadth of the stream nor level the height of the bank The signal was instantly given and obeyed the most impatient of the legionaries leaped into five vessels that lay nearest to the bank and as they plied their oars with intrepid diligence they were lost after a few moments in the darkness of the night A flame arose on the opposite side and Julian who too clearly understood that his foremost vessels in attempting to land had been fired by the enemy dexterously converted their extreme danger into a presage of victory Our fellow soldiers he eagerly exclaimed are already masters of the bank see they make the appointed signal let us hasten to emulate and assist their courage The united and rapid motion of a great fleet broke the violence of the current and they reached the eastern shore of the Tigris with sufficient speed to extinguish the flames and rescue their adventurous companions The difficulties of a steep and lofty ascent were increased by the weight of armor and the darkness of the night A shower of stones darts and fire was incessantly discharged on the heads of the assailants who after an arduous struggle climbed the bank and stood victorious upon the rampart As soon as they possessed a more equal field Julian who with his light infantry had led the attack sixty nine darted through the ranks a skilful and experienced eye his bravest soldiers according to the precepts of Homer seventy were distributed in the front and rear and all the trumpets of the Imperial army sounded to battle The Romans after sending up a military shout advanced in measured steps to the animating notes of martial music launched their formidable javelins and rushed forwards with drawn swords to deprive the Barbarians by a closer onset of the advantage of their missile weapons The whole engagement lasted above twelve hours till the gradual retreat of the Persians was changed into a disorderly flight of which the shameful example was given by the principal leader and the Surenas himself They were pursued to the gates of Ctesiphon and the conquerors might have entered the dismayed city seventy one if their general Victor who was dangerously wounded with an arrow had not conjured them to desist from a rash attempt which must be fatal if it were not successful On their side the Romans acknowledged the loss of only seventy five men while they affirmed that the Barbarians had left on the field of battle two thousand five hundred or even six thousand of their bravest soldiers The spoil was such as might be expected from the riches and luxury of an Oriental camp large quantities of silver and gold splendid arms and trappings and beds and tables of massy silver seventy onea The victorious emperor distributed as the rewards of valor some honorable gifts civic and mural and naval crowns which he and perhaps he alone esteemed more precious than the wealth of Asia A solemn sacrifice was offered to the god of war but the appearances of the victims threatened the most inauspicious events and Julian soon discovered by less ambiguous signs that he had now reached the term of his prosperity seventy two Footnote sixty seven Rien n est beau que le vrai a maxim which should be inscribed on the

remaining troops which composed near two thirds of the whole army were securely wafted over the Tigris seventy three While the Persians beheld from the walls of Ctesiphon the desolation of the adjacent country Julian cast many an anxious look towards the North in full expectation that as he himself had victoriously penetrated to the capital of Sapor the march and junction of his lieutenants Sebastian and Procopius would be executed with the same courage and diligence His expectations were disappointed by the treachery of the Armenian king who permitted and most probably directed the desertion of his auxiliary troops from the camp of the Romans seventy four and by the dissensions of the two generals who were incapable of forming or executing any plan for the public service When the emperor had relinquished the hope of this important reenforcement he condescended to hold a council of war and approved after a full debate the sentiment of those generals who dissuaded the siege of Ctesiphon as a fruitless and pernicious undertaking It is not easy for us to conceive by what arts of fortification a city thrice besieged and taken by the predecessors of Julian could be rendered impregnable against an army of sixty thousand Romans commanded by a brave and experienced general and abundantly supplied with ships provisions battering engines and military stores But we may rest assured from the love of glory and contempt of danger which formed the character of Julian that he was not discouraged by any trivial or imaginary obstacles seventy five At the very time when he declined the siege of Ctesiphon he rejected with obstinacy and disdain the most flattering offers of a negotiation of peace Sapor who had been so long accustomed to the tardy ostentation of Constantius was surprised by the intrepid diligence of his successor As far as the confines of India and Scythia the satraps of the distant provinces were ordered to assemble their troops and to march without delay to the assistance of their monarch But their preparations were dilatory their motions slow and before Sapor could lead an army into the field he received the melancholy intelligence of the devastation of Assyria the ruin of his palaces and the slaughter of his bravest troops who defended the passage of the Tigris The pride of royalty was humbled in the dust he took his repasts on the ground and the disorder of his hair expressed the grief and anxiety of his mind Perhaps he would not have refused to purchase with one half of his kingdom the safety of the remainder and he would have gladly subscribed himself in a treaty of peace the faithful and dependent ally of the Roman conqueror Under the pretence of private business a minister of rank and confidence was secretly despatched to embrace the knees of Hormisdas and to request in the language of a suppliant that he might be introduced into the presence of the emperor The Sassanian prince whether he listened to the voice of pride or humanity whether he consulted the sentiments of his birth or the duties of his situation was equally inclined to promote a salutary measure which would terminate the calamities of Persia and secure the triumph of Rome He was astonished by the inflexible firmness of a hero who remembered most unfortunately for himself and for his country that Alexander had uniformly rejected the propositions of Darius But as Julian was sensible that the hope of a safe and honorable peace might cool the ardor of his troops he earnestly requested that Hormisdas would privately dismiss the minister of Sapor and conceal this dangerous temptation from the knowledge of the camp seventy six Footnote seventy three The fleet and army were formed in three divisions of which the first only had

flattered the hopes and passions of his master Chapter XXIV The Retreat And Death Of Julian Part IV The honor as well as interest of Julian forbade him to consume his time under the impregnable walls of Ctesiphon and as often as he defied the Barbarians who defended the city to meet him on the open plain they prudently replied that if he desired to exercise his valor he might seek the army of the Great King He felt the insult and he accepted the advice Instead of confining his servile march to the banks of the Euphrates and Tigris he resolved to imitate the adventurous spirit of Alexander and boldly to advance into the inland provinces till he forced his rival to contend with him perhaps in the plains of Arbela for the empire of Asia The magnanimity of Julian was applauded and betrayed by the arts of a noble Persian who in the cause of his country had generously submitted to act a part full of danger of falsehood and of shame seventy seven With a train of faithful followers he deserted to the Imperial camp exposed in a specious tale the injuries which he had sustained exaggerated the cruelty of Sapor the discontent of the people and the weakness of the monarchy and confidently offered himself as the hostage and guide of the Roman march The most rational grounds of suspicion were urged without effect by the wisdom and experience of Hormisdas and the credulous Julian receiving the traitor into his bosom was persuaded to issue a hasty order which in the opinion of mankind appeared to arraign his prudence and to endanger his safety He destroyed in a single hour the whole navy which had been transported above five hundred miles at so great an expense of toil of treasure and of blood Twelve or at the most twenty two small vessels were saved to accompany on carriages the march of the army and to form occasional bridges for the passage of the rivers A supply of twenty days provisions was reserved for the use of the soldiers and the rest of the magazines with a fleet of eleven hundred vessels which rode at anchor in the Tigris were abandoned to the flames by the absolute command of the emperor The Christian bishops Gregory and Augustin insult the madness of the Apostate who executed with his own hands the sentence of divine justice Their authority of less weight perhaps in a military question is confirmed by the cool judgment of an experienced soldier who was himself spectator of the conflagration and who could not disapprove the reluctant murmurs of the troops seventy eight Yet there are not wanting some specious and perhaps solid reasons which might justify the resolution of Julian The navigation of the Euphrates never ascended above Babylon nor that of the Tigris above Opis seventy nine The distance of the last mentioned city from the Roman camp was not very considerable and Julian must soon have renounced the vain and impracticable attempt of forcing upwards a great fleet against the stream of a rapid river eighty which in several places was embarrassed by natural or artificial cataracts eighty one The power of sails and oars was insufficient it became necessary to tow the ships against the current of the river the strength of twenty thousand soldiers was exhausted in this tedious and servile labor and if the Romans continued to march along the banks of the Tigris they could only expect to return home without achieving any enterprise worthy of the genius or fortune of their leader If on the contrary it was advisable to advance into the inland country the destruction of the fleet and magazines was the only measure which could save that valuable prize from the hands of the numerous and active troops which might suddenly be poured from the gates of Ctesiphon Had the arms of Julian been victorious we should now admire the conduct as well as the courage of a hero who by depriving his soldiers of the hopes of a retreat left them only the alternative of death or conquest eighty two Footnote seventy

Recollect the successful and applauded rashness of Agathocles and Cortez who burnt their ships on the coast of Africa and Mexico The cumbersome train of artillery and wagons which retards the operations of a modern army were in a great measure unknown in the camps of the Romans eighty three Yet in every age the subsistence of sixty thousand men must have been one of the most important cares of a prudent general and that subsistence could only be drawn from his own or from the enemy s country Had it been possible for Julian to maintain a bridge of communication on the Tigris and to preserve the conquered places of Assyria a desolated province could not afford any large or regular supplies in a season of the year when the lands were covered by the inundation of the Euphrates eighty four and the unwholesome air was darkened with swarms of innumerable insects eighty five The appearance of the hostile country was far more inviting The extensive region that lies between the River Tigris and the mountains of Media was filled with villages and towns and the fertile soil for the most part was in a very improved state of cultivation Julian might expect that a conqueror who possessed the two forcible instruments of persuasion steel and gold would easily procure a plentiful subsistence from the fears or avarice of the natives But on the approach of the Romans the rich and smiling prospect was instantly blasted Wherever they moved the inhabitants deserted the open villages and took shelter in the fortified towns the cattle was driven away the grass and ripe corn were consumed with fire and as soon as the flames had subsided which interrupted the march of Julian he beheld the melancholy face of a smoking and naked desert This desperate but effectual method of defence can only be executed by the enthusiasm of a people who prefer their independence to their property or by the rigor of an arbitrary government which consults the public safety without submitting to their inclinations the liberty of choice On the present occasion the zeal and obedience of the Persians seconded the commands of Sapor and the emperor was soon reduced to the scanty stock of provisions which continually wasted in his hands Before they were entirely consumed he might still have reached the wealthy and unwarlike cities of Ecbatana or Susa by the effort of a rapid and well directed march eighty six but he was deprived of this last resource by his ignorance of the roads and by the perfidy of his guides The Romans wandered several days in the country to the eastward of Bagdad the Persian deserter who had artfully led them into the spare escaped from their resentment and his followers as soon as they were put to the torture confessed the secret of the conspiracy The visionary conquests of Hyrcania and India which had so long amused now tormented the mind of Julian Conscious that his own imprudence was the cause of the public distress he anxiously balanced the hopes of safety or success without obtaining a satisfactory answer either from gods or men At length as the only practicable measure he embraced the resolution of directing his steps towards the banks of the Tigris with the design of saving the army by a hasty march to the confines of Corduene a fertile and friendly province which acknowledged the sovereignty of Rome The desponding troops obeyed the signal of the retreat only seventy days after they had passed the Chaboras with the sanguine expectation of subverting the throne of Persia eighty seven Footnote eighty

and Zosimus l iii p one hundred eighty three The two last seem ignorant that their conqueror was retreating and Libanius absurdly confines him to the banks of the Tigris As long as the Romans seemed to advance into the country their march was observed and insulted from a distance by several bodies of Persian cavalry who showing themselves sometimes in loose and sometimes in close order faintly skirmished with the advanced guards These detachments were however supported by a much greater force and the heads of the columns were no sooner pointed towards the Tigris than a cloud of dust arose on the plain The Romans who now aspired only to the permission of a safe and speedy retreat endeavored to persuade themselves that this formidable appearance was occasioned by a troop of wild asses or perhaps by the approach of some friendly Arabs They halted pitched their tents fortified their camp passed the whole night in continual alarms and discovered at the dawn of day that they were surrounded by an army of Persians This army which might be considered only as the van of the Barbarians was soon followed by the main body of cuirassiers archers and elephants commanded by Meranes a general of rank and reputation He was accompanied by two of the king s sons and many of the principal satraps and fame and expectation exaggerated the strength of the remaining powers which slowly advanced under the conduct of Sapor himself As the Romans continued their march their long array which was forced to bend or divide according to the varieties of the ground afforded frequent and favorable opportunities to their vigilant enemies The Persians repeatedly charged with fury they were repeatedly repulsed with firmness and the action at Maronga which almost deserved the name of a battle was marked by a considerable loss of satraps and elephants perhaps of equal value in the eyes of their monarch These splendid advantages were not obtained without an adequate slaughter on the side of the Romans several officers of distinction were either killed or wounded and the emperor himself who on all occasions of danger inspired and guided the valor of his troops was obliged to expose his person and exert his abilities The weight of offensive and defensive arms which still constituted the strength and safety of the Romans disabled them from making any long or effectual pursuit and as the horsemen of the East were trained to dart their javelins and shoot their arrows at full speed and in every possible direction eighty eight the cavalry of Persia was never more formidable than in the moment of a rapid and disorderly flight But the most certain and irreparable loss of the Romans was that of time The hardy veterans accustomed to the cold climate of Gaul and Germany fainted under the sultry heat of an Assyrian summer their vigor was exhausted by the incessant repetition of march and combat and the progress of the army was suspended by the precautions of a slow and dangerous retreat in the presence of an active enemy Every day every hour as the supply diminished the value and price of subsistence increased in the Roman camp eighty nine Julian who always contented himself with such food as a hungry soldier would have disdained distributed for the use of the troops the provisions of the Imperial household and whatever could be spared from the sumpter horses of the tribunes and generals But this feeble relief served only to aggravate the sense of the public distress and the Romans began to entertain the most gloomy apprehensions that before they could reach the frontiers of the empire they should all perish either by famine or by the sword of the Barbarians ninety Footnote eighty eight Chardin the most judicious of modern travellers describes

hungry While Julian struggled with the almost insuperable difficulties of his situation the silent hours of the night were still devoted to study and contemplation Whenever he closed his eyes in short and interrupted slumbers his mind was agitated with painful anxiety nor can it be thought surprising that the Genius of the empire should once more appear before him covering with a funeral veil his head and his horn of abundance and slowly retiring from the Imperial tent The monarch started from his couch and stepping forth to refresh his wearied spirits with the coolness of the midnight air he beheld a fiery meteor which shot athwart the sky and suddenly vanished Julian was convinced that he had seen the menacing countenance of the god of war ninety one the council which he summoned of Tuscan Haruspices ninety two unanimously pronounced that he should abstain from action but on this occasion necessity and reason were more prevalent than superstition and the trumpets sounded at the break of day The army marched through a hilly country and the hills had been secretly occupied by the Persians Julian led the van with the skill and attention of a consummate general he was alarmed by the intelligence that his rear was suddenly attacked The heat of the weather had tempted him to lay aside his cuirass but he snatched a shield from one of his attendants and hastened with a sufficient reenforcement to the relief of the rear guard A similar danger recalled the intrepid prince to the defence of the front and as he galloped through the columns the centre of the left was attacked and almost overpowered by the furious charge of the Persian cavalry and elephants This huge body was soon defeated by the well timed evolution of the light infantry who aimed their weapons with dexterity and effect against the backs of the horsemen and the legs of the elephants The Barbarians fled and Julian who was foremost in every danger animated the pursuit with his voice and gestures His trembling guards scattered and oppressed by the disorderly throng of friends and enemies reminded their fearless sovereign that he was without armor and conjured him to decline the fall of the impending ruin As they exclaimed ninety three a cloud of darts and arrows was discharged from the flying squadrons and a javelin after razing the skin of his arm transpierced the ribs and fixed in the inferior part of the liver Julian attempted to draw the deadly weapon from his side but his fingers were cut by the sharpness of the steel and he fell senseless from his horse His guards flew to his relief and the wounded emperor was gently raised from the ground and conveyed out of the tumult of the battle into an adjacent tent The report of the melancholy event passed from rank to rank but the grief of the Romans inspired them with invincible valor and the desire of revenge The bloody and obstinate conflict was maintained by the two armies till they were separated by the total darkness of the night The Persians derived some honor from the advantage which they obtained against the left wing where Anatolius master of the offices was slain and the praefect Sallust very narrowly escaped But the event of the day was adverse to the Barbarians They abandoned the field their two generals Meranes and Nohordates ninety four fifty nobles or satraps and a multitude of their bravest soldiers

horse and arms and was impatient to rush into the battle His remaining strength was exhausted by the painful effort and the surgeons who examined his wound discovered the symptoms of approaching death He employed the awful moments with the firm temper of a hero and a sage the philosophers who had accompanied him in this fatal expedition compared the tent of Julian with the prison of Socrates and the spectators whom duty or friendship or curiosity had assembled round his couch listened with respectful grief to the funeral oration of their dying emperor ninety five Friends and fellow soldiers the seasonable period of my departure is now arrived and I discharge with the cheerfulness of a ready debtor the demands of nature I have learned from philosophy how much the soul is more excellent than the body and that the separation of the nobler substance should be the subject of joy rather than of affliction I have learned from religion that an early death has often been the reward of piety ninety six and I accept as a favor of the gods the mortal stroke that secures me from the danger of disgracing a character which has hitherto been supported by virtue and fortitude I die without remorse as I have lived without guilt I am pleased to reflect on the innocence of my private life and I can affirm with confidence that the supreme authority that emanation of the Divine Power has been preserved in my hands pure and immaculate Detesting the corrupt and destructive maxims of despotism I have considered the happiness of the people as the end of government Submitting my actions to the laws of prudence of justice and of moderation I have trusted the event to the care of Providence Peace was the object of my counsels as long as peace was consistent with the public welfare but when the imperious voice of my country summoned me to arms I exposed my person to the dangers of war with the clear foreknowledge which I had acquired from the art of divination that I was destined to fall by the sword I now offer my tribute of gratitude to the Eternal Being who has not suffered me to perish by the cruelty of a tyrant by the secret dagger of conspiracy or by the slow tortures of lingering disease He has given me in the midst of an honorable career a splendid and glorious departure from this world and I hold it equally absurd equally base to solicit or to decline the stroke of fate This much I have attempted to say but my strength fails me and I feel the approach of death I shall cautiously refrain from any word that may tend to influence your suffrages in the election of an emperor My choice might be imprudent or injudicious and if it should not be ratified by the consent of the army it might be fatal to the person whom I should recommend I shall only as a good citizen express my hopes that the Romans may be blessed with the government of a virtuous sovereign After this discourse which Julian pronounced in a firm and gentle tone of voice he distributed by a military testament ninety seven the remains of his private fortune and making some inquiry why Anatolius was not present he understood from the answer of Sallust that Anatolius was killed and bewailed with amiable inconsistency the loss of his friend At the same time he reproved the immoderate grief of the spectators and conjured them not to disgrace by unmanly tears the fate of a prince who in a few moments would be united with heaven and with the stars ninety eight The spectators were silent and Julian entered into a metaphysical argument with the philosophers Priscus and Maximus on the nature of the soul The efforts which he made of mind as well as body most probably hastened his death His wound began to bleed with fresh violence his respiration was embarrassed by the swelling of the veins he called for a draught of cold water and as soon as he had drank it expired without pain about the hour of midnight Such was the end of that extraordinary man in the thirty second year of his age after a reign of one year and about eight months from the death of Constantius In his last moments he displayed perhaps with some ostentation the love of virtue and of fame which had been the ruling passions of his life ninety nine Footnote ninety five The character and situation of Julian might countenance the suspicion that he had previously composed the elaborate oration which Ammianus

account of their perilous situation and their grief for the death of Julian Even the vulgar felt that they would soon provide a general but such a general as Julian they would never find even though a god in the form of man Julian who with a mind equal to the divinity triumphed over the evil propensities of human nature who held commerce with immaterial beings while yet in the material body who condescended to rule because a ruler was necessary to the welfare of mankind Mai Nov Coll ii two hundred sixty one Eunapius in Niebuhr sixty nine The triumph of Christianity and the calamities of the empire may in some measure be ascribed to Julian himself who had neglected to secure the future execution of his designs by the timely and judicious nomination of an associate and successor But the royal race of Constantius Chlorus was reduced to his own person and if he entertained any serious thoughts of investing with the purple the most worthy among the Romans he was diverted from his resolution by the difficulty of the choice the jealousy of power the fear of ingratitude and the natural presumption of health of youth and of prosperity His unexpected death left the empire without a master and without an heir in a state of perplexity and danger which in the space of fourscore years had never been experienced since the election of Diocletian In a government which had almost forgotten the distinction of pure and noble blood the superiority of birth was of little moment the claims of official rank were accidental and precarious and the candidates who might aspire to ascend the vacant throne could be supported only by the consciousness of personal merit or by the hopes of popular favor But the situation of a famished army encompassed on all sides by a host of Barbarians shortened the moments of grief and deliberation In this scene of terror and distress the body of the deceased prince according to his own directions was decently embalmed and at the dawn of day the generals convened a military senate at which the commanders of the legions and the officers both of cavalry and infantry were invited to assist Three or four hours of the night had not passed away without some secret cabals and when the election of an emperor was proposed the spirit of faction began to agitate the assembly Victor and Arinthaeus collected the remains of the court of Constantius the friends of Julian attached themselves to the Gallic chiefs Dagalaiphus and Nevitta and the most fatal consequences might be apprehended from the discord of two factions so opposite in their character and interest in their maxims of government and perhaps in their religious principles The superior virtues of Sallust could alone reconcile their divisions and unite their suffrages and the venerable praefect would immediately have been declared the successor of Julian if he himself with sincere and modest firmness had not alleged his age and infirmities so unequal to the weight of the diadem The generals who were surprised and perplexed by his refusal showed some disposition to adopt the salutary advice of an inferior officer one hundred that they should act as they would have acted in the absence of the emperor that they should exert their abilities to extricate the army from the present distress and if they were fortunate enough to reach the confines of Mesopotamia they should proceed with united and deliberate counsels in the election of a lawful sovereign While they debated a few voices saluted Jovian who was no more than first one hundred one of the domestics with the names of Emperor and Augustus The tumultuary acclamation one hundred onea was instantly repeated by the guards who surrounded the tent and passed in a few minutes to the extremities of the line The new prince astonished with his own fortune was hastily invested with the Imperial ornaments and received an oath of fidelity from the generals whose favor and protection he so lately solicited The strongest recommendation of Jovian was the merit of his father Count Varronian who enjoyed in honorable retirement the fruit of his long services In the obscure freedom of a private station the son indulged his taste for wine and women yet he supported with credit the character of a Christian one hundred two and a soldier Without being conspicuous for any of the ambitious qualifications which excite the admiration and envy of mankind the comely person of Jovian his cheerful temper and familiar wit had gained the affection of his fellow soldiers and the generals of both parties acquiesced in a popular election which had not been conducted by the arts of their enemies The pride of this unexpected elevation was moderated by the just apprehension that the same day might terminate the life and reign of the new emperor The pressing voice of necessity was obeyed without delay and the first orders issued by Jovian a few hours after his predecessor had expired were to prosecute a march which could alone extricate the Romans from their actual distress one hundred three Footnote one hundred Honoratior aliquis miles perhaps Ammianus himself The modest and judicious historian describes

the life an impartial portrait of Jovian to which the younger Victor has added some remarkable strokes The Abbe de la Bleterie Histoire de Jovien tom i p one two hundred thirty eight has composed an elaborate history of his short reign a work remarkably distinguished by elegance of style critical disquisition and religious prejudice Chapter XXIV The Retreat And Death Of Julian Part V The esteem of an enemy is most sincerely expressed by his fears and the degree of fear may be accurately measured by the joy with which he celebrates his deliverance The welcome news of the death of Julian which a deserter revealed to the camp of Sapor inspired the desponding monarch with a sudden confidence of victory He immediately detached the royal cavalry perhaps the ten thousand Immortals one hundred four to second and support the pursuit and discharged the whole weight of his united forces on the rear guard of the Romans The rear guard was thrown into disorder the renowned legions which derived their titles from Diocletian and his warlike colleague were broke and trampled down by the elephants and three tribunes lost their lives in attempting to stop the flight of their soldiers The battle was at length restored by the persevering valor of the Romans the Persians were repulsed with a great slaughter of men and elephants and the army after marching and fighting a long summer s day arrived in the evening at Samara on the banks of the Tigris about one hundred miles above Ctesiphon one hundred five On the ensuing day the Barbarians instead of harassing the march attacked the camp of Jovian which had been seated in a deep and sequestered valley From the hills the archers of Persia insulted and annoyed the wearied legionaries and a body of cavalry which had penetrated with desperate courage through the Praetorian gate was cut in pieces after a doubtful conflict near the Imperial tent In the succeeding night the camp of Carche was protected by the lofty dikes of the river and the Roman army though incessantly exposed to the vexatious pursuit of the Saracens pitched their tents near the city of Dura one hundred six four days after the death of Julian The Tigris was still on their left their hopes and provisions were almost consumed and the impatient soldiers who had fondly persuaded themselves that the frontiers of the empire were not far distant requested their new sovereign that they might be permitted to hazard the passage of the river With the assistance of his wisest officers Jovian endeavored to check their rashness by representing that if they possessed sufficient skill and vigor to stem the torrent of a deep and rapid stream they would only deliver themselves naked and defenceless to the Barbarians who had occupied the opposite banks Yielding at length to their clamorous importunities he consented with reluctance that five hundred Gauls and Germans accustomed from their infancy to the waters of the Rhine and Danube should attempt the bold adventure which might serve either as an encouragement or as a warning for the rest of the army In the silence of the night they swam the Tigris surprised an unguarded post of the enemy and displayed at the dawn of day the signal of their resolution and fortune The success of this trial disposed the emperor to listen to the promises of his architects who propose to construct a floating bridge of the inflated skins of sheep oxen and goats covered with a floor of earth and fascines one hundred seven Two important days were spent in the ineffectual labor and the Romans who already endured the miseries of famine cast a look of despair on the Tigris and upon the Barbarians whose numbers and obstinacy increased with the distress of the Imperial army one hundred eight Footnote one

Though we may distrust the fairness of Libanius the ocular testimony of Eutropius uno a Persis atque altero proelio victus x seventeen must incline us to suspect that Ammianus had been too jealous of the honor of the Roman arms In this hopeless condition the fainting spirits of the Romans were revived by the sound of peace The transient presumption of Sapor had vanished he observed with serious concern that in the repetition of doubtful combats he had lost his most faithful and intrepid nobles his bravest troops and the greatest part of his train of elephants and the experienced monarch feared to provoke the resistance of despair the vicissitudes of fortune and the unexhausted powers of the Roman empire which might soon advance to elieve or to revenge the successor of Julian The Surenas himself accompanied by another satrap appeared in the camp of Jovian one hundred nine and declared that the clemency of his sovereign was not averse to signify the conditions on which he would consent to spare and to dismiss the Caesar with the relics of his captive army one hundred ninea The hopes of safety subdued the firmness of the Romans the emperor was compelled by the advice of his council and the cries of his soldiers to embrace the offer of peace one hundred nineb and the praefect Sallust was immediately sent with the general Arinthaeus to understand the pleasure of the Great King The crafty Persian delayed under various pretenses the conclusion of the agreement started difficulties required explanations suggested expedients receded from his concessions increased his demands and wasted four days in the arts of negotiation till he had consumed the stock of provisions which yet remained in the camp of the Romans Had Jovian been capable of executing a bold and prudent measure he would have continued his march with unremitting diligence the progress of the treaty would have suspended the attacks of the Barbarians and before the expiration of the fourth day he might have safely reached the fruitful province of Corduene at the distance only of one hundred miles one hundred ten The irresolute emperor instead of breaking through the toils of the enemy expected his fate with patient resignation and accepted the humiliating conditions of peace which it was no longer in his power to refuse The five provinces beyond the Tigris which had been ceded by the grandfather of Sapor were restored to the Persian monarchy He acquired by a single article the impregnable city of Nisibis which had sustained in three successive sieges the effort of his arms Singara and the castle of the Moors one of the strongest places of Mesopotamia were likewise dismembered from the empire It was considered as an indulgence that the inhabitants of those fortresses were permitted to retire with their effects but the conqueror rigorously insisted that the Romans should forever abandon the king and kingdom of Armenia one hundred tena A peace or rather a long truce of thirty years was stipulated between the hostile nations the faith of the treaty was ratified by solemn oaths and religious ceremonies and hostages of distinguished rank were reciprocally delivered

peace necessarium quidem sed ignoblem The sophist of Antioch who saw with indignation the sceptre of his hero in the feeble hand of a Christian successor professes to admire the moderation of Sapor in contenting himself with so small a portion of the Roman empire If he had stretched as far as the Euphrates the claims of his ambition he might have been secure says Libanius of not meeting with a refusal If he had fixed as the boundary of Persia the Orontes the Cydnus the Sangarius or even the Thracian Bosphorus flatterers would not have been wanting in the court of Jovian to convince the timid monarch that his remaining provinces would still afford the most ample gratifications of power and luxury one hundred twelve Without adopting in its full force this malicious insinuation we must acknowledge that the conclusion of so ignominious a treaty was facilitated by the private ambition of Jovian The obscure domestic exalted to the throne by fortune rather than by merit was impatient to escape from the hands of the Persians that he might prevent the designs of Procopius who commanded the army of Mesopotamia and establish his doubtful reign over the legions and provinces which were still ignorant of the hasty and tumultuous choice of the camp beyond the Tigris one hundred thirteen In the neighborhood of the same river at no very considerable distance from the fatal station of Dura one hundred fourteen the ten thousand Greeks without generals or guides or provisions were abandoned above twelve hundred miles from their native country to the resentment of a victorious monarch The difference of their conduct and success depended much more on their character than on their situation Instead of tamely resigning themselves to the secret deliberations and private views of a single person the united councils of the Greeks were inspired by the generous enthusiasm of a popular assembly where the mind of each citizen is filled with the love of glory the pride of freedom and the contempt of death Conscious of their superiority over the Barbarians in arms and discipline they disdained to yield they refused to capitulate every obstacle was surmounted by their patience

They created these animals to attend the Tiger of the East Footnote one hundred fifteen The Cyropoedia is vague and languid the Anabasis circumstance and animated Such is the eternal difference between fiction and truth As the price of his disgraceful concessions the emperor might perhaps have stipulated that the camp of the hungry Romans should be plentifully supplied one hundred sixteen and that they should be permitted to pass the Tigris on the bridge which was constructed by the hands of the Persians But if Jovian presumed to solicit those equitable terms they were sternly refused by the haughty tyrant of the East whose clemency had pardoned the invaders of his country The Saracens sometimes intercepted the stragglers of the march but the generals and troops of Sapor respected the cessation of arms and Jovian was suffered to explore the most convenient place for the passage of the river The small vessels which had been saved from the conflagration of the fleet performed the most essential service They first conveyed the emperor and his favorites and afterwards transported in many successive voyages a great part of the army But as every man was anxious for his personal safety and apprehensive of being left on the hostile shore the soldiers who were too impatient to wait the slow returns of the boats boldly ventured themselves on light hurdles or inflated skins and drawing after them their horses attempted with various success to swim across the river Many of these daring adventurers were swallowed by the waves many others who were carried along by the violence of the stream fell an easy prey to the avarice or cruelty of the wild Arabs and the loss which the army sustained in the passage of the Tigris was not inferior to the carnage of a day of battle As soon as the Romans were landed on the western bank they were delivered from the hostile pursuit of the Barbarians but in a laborious march of two hundred miles over the plains of Mesopotamia they endured the last extremities of thirst and hunger They were obliged to traverse the sandy desert which in the extent of seventy miles did not afford a single blade of sweet grass nor a single spring of fresh water and the rest of the inhospitable waste was untrod by the footsteps either of friends or enemies Whenever a small measure of flour could be discovered in the camp twenty pounds weight were greedily purchased with ten pieces of gold one hundred seventeen the beasts of burden were slaughtered and devoured and the desert was strewed with the arms and baggage of the Roman soldiers whose tattered garments and meagre countenances displayed their past sufferings and actual misery A small convoy of provisions advanced to meet the army as far as the castle of Ur and the supply was the more grateful since it declared the fidelity of Sebastian and Procopius At Thilsaphata one hundred eighteen the emperor most graciously received the generals of Mesopotamia and the remains of a once flourishing army at length reposed themselves under the walls of Nisibis The messengers of Jovian had already proclaimed in the language of flattery his election his treaty and his return and the new prince had taken the most effectual measures to secure the allegiance of the armies and provinces of Europe by placing the military command in the hands of those officers who from motives of interest or inclination would firmly support the cause of their benefactor one hundred nineteen Footnote one hundred sixteen According to Rufinus an immediate supply of provisions was stipulated by the treaty and Theodoret affirms that the obligation was faithfully discharged by the Persians Such a fact is probable but undoubtedly false See Tillemont Hist des Empereurs tom iv p seven hundred two

Ammianus xxv nine Libanius Orat Parent c one hundred forty three p three hundred sixty five and Zosimus l iii p one hundred ninety four The friends of Julian had confidently announced the success of his expedition They entertained a fond persuasion that the temples of the gods would be enriched with the spoils of the East that Persia would be reduced to the humble state of a tributary province governed by the laws and magistrates of Rome that the Barbarians would adopt the dress and manners and language of their conquerors and that the youth of Ecbatana and Susa would study the art of rhetoric under Grecian masters one hundred twenty The progress of the arms of Julian interrupted his communication with the empire and from the moment that he passed the Tigris his affectionate subjects were ignorant of the fate and fortunes of their prince Their contemplation of fancied triumphs was disturbed by the melancholy rumor of his death and they persisted to doubt after they could no longer deny the truth of that fatal event one hundred twenty one The messengers of Jovian promulgated the specious tale of a prudent and necessary peace the voice of fame louder and more sincere revealed the disgrace of the emperor and the conditions of the ignominious treaty The minds of the people were filled with astonishment and grief with indignation and terror when they were informed that the unworthy successor of Julian relinquished the five provinces which had been acquired by the victory of Galerius and that he shamefully surrendered to the Barbarians the important city of Nisibis the firmest bulwark of the provinces of the East one hundred twenty two The deep and dangerous question how far the public faith should be observed when it becomes incompatible with the public safety was freely agitated in popular conversation and some hopes were entertained that the emperor would redeem his pusillanimous behavior by a splendid act of patriotic perfidy The inflexible spirit of the Roman senate had always disclaimed the unequal conditions which were extorted from the distress of their captive armies and if it were necessary to satisfy the national honor by delivering the guilty general into the hands of the Barbarians the greatest part of the subjects of Jovian would have cheerfully acquiesced in the precedent of ancient times one hundred twenty three Footnote one

twenty seven though a severe casuist has pronounced that Jovian was not bound to execute his promise since he could not dismember the empire nor alienate without their consent the allegiance of his people I have never found much delight or instruction in such political metaphysics But the emperor whatever might be the limits of his constitutional authority was the absolute master of the laws and arms of the state and the same motives which had forced him to subscribe now pressed him to execute the treaty of peace He was impatient to secure an empire at the expense of a few provinces and the respectable names of religion and honor concealed the personal fears and ambition of Jovian Notwithstanding the dutiful solicitations of the inhabitants decency as well as prudence forbade the emperor to lodge in the palace of Nisibis but the next morning after his arrival Bineses the ambassador of Persia entered the place displayed from the citadel the standard of the Great King and proclaimed in his name the cruel alternative of exile or servitude The principal citizens of Nisibis who till that fatal moment had confided in the protection of their sovereign threw themselves at his feet They conjured him not to abandon or at least not to deliver a faithful colony to the rage of a Barbarian tyrant exasperated by the three successive defeats which he had experienced under the walls of Nisibis They still possessed arms and courage to repel the invaders of their country they requested only the permission of using them in their own defence and as soon as they had asserted their independence they should implore the favor of being again admitted into the ranks of his subjects Their arguments their eloquence their tears were ineffectual Jovian alleged with some confusion the sanctity of oaths and as the reluctance with which he accepted the present of a crown of gold convinced the citizens of their hopeless condition the advocate Sylvanus was provoked to exclaim O emperor may you thus be crowned by all the cities of your dominions Jovian who in a few weeks had assumed the habits of a prince one hundred twenty four was displeased with freedom and offended with truth and as he reasonably supposed that the discontent of the people might incline them to submit to the Persian government he published an edict under pain of death that they should leave the city within the term of three days Ammianus has delineated in lively colors the scene of universal despair which he seems to have viewed with an eye of compassion one hundred twenty five The martial youth deserted with indignant grief the walls which they had so gloriously defended the disconsolate mourner dropped a last tear over the tomb of a son or husband which must soon be profaned by the rude hand of a Barbarian master and the aged citizen kissed the threshold and clung to the doors of the house where he had passed the cheerful and careless hours of infancy The highways were crowded with a trembling multitude the distinctions of rank and sex and age were lost in the general calamity Every one strove to bear away some fragment from the wreck of his fortunes and as they could not command the immediate service of an adequate number of horses or wagons they were obliged to leave behind them the greatest part of their valuable effects The savage insensibility of Jovian appears to have aggravated the hardships of these unhappy fugitives They were seated however in a new built quarter of Amida and that rising city with the reenforcement of a very considerable colony soon recovered its former splendor and became the capital of Mesopotamia one hundred twenty six Similar orders were despatched by the emperor for the evacuation of Singara and the castle of the Moors and for the restitution of the five provinces beyond the Tigris Sapor enjoyed the glory and the fruits of his victory and this ignominious peace has justly been considered as a memorable aera in the decline and fall of the Roman empire The predecessors of Jovian had sometimes relinquished the dominion of distant and unprofitable provinces but since the foundation of the city the genius of Rome the god Terminus who guarded the boundaries of the republic had never retired before the sword of a victorious enemy one hundred twenty seven Footnote one hundred twenty four At Nisibis he performed a royal

hastened away from the scene of his disgrace and proceeded with his whole court to enjoy the luxury of Antioch one hundred twenty eight Without consulting the dictates of religious zeal he was prompted by humanity and gratitude to bestow the last honors on the remains of his deceased sovereign one hundred twenty nine and Procopius who sincerely bewailed the loss of his kinsman was removed from the command of the army under the decent pretence of conducting the funeral The corpse of Julian was transported from Nisibis to Tarsus in a slow march of fifteen days and as it passed through the cities of the East was saluted by the hostile factions with mournful lamentations and clamorous insults The Pagans already placed their beloved hero in the rank of those gods whose worship he had restored while the invectives of the Christians pursued the soul of the Apostate to hell and his body to the grave one hundred thirty One party lamented the approaching ruin of their altars the other celebrated the marvellous deliverance of their church The Christians applauded in lofty and ambiguous strains the stroke of divine vengeance which had been so long suspended over the guilty head of Julian They acknowledge that the death of the tyrant at the instant he expired beyond the Tigris was revealed to the saints of Egypt Syria and Cappadocia one hundred thirty one and instead of suffering him to fall by the Persian darts their indiscretion ascribed the heroic deed to the obscure hand of some mortal or immortal champion of the faith one hundred thirty two Such imprudent declarations were eagerly adopted by the malice or credulity of their adversaries one hundred thirty three who darkly insinuated or confidently asserted that the governors of the church had instigated and directed the fanaticism of a domestic assassin one hundred thirty four Above sixteen years after the death of Julian the charge was solemnly and vehemently urged in a public oration addressed by

midst of the splendid pageants which displayed the glory of the living or of the dead their imperfections should not be concealed from the eyes of the world one hundred thirty six This custom was practised in the funeral of Julian The comedians who resented his contempt and aversion for the theatre exhibited with the applause of a Christian audience the lively and exaggerated representation of the faults and follies of the deceased emperor His various character and singular manners afforded an ample scope for pleasantry and ridicule one hundred thirty seven In the exercise of his uncommon talents he often descended below the majesty of his rank Alexander was transformed into Diogenes the philosopher was degraded into a priest The purity of his virtue was sullied by excessive vanity his superstition disturbed the peace and endangered the safety of a mighty empire and his irregular sallies were the less entitled to indulgence as they appeared to be the laborious efforts of art or even of affectation The remains of Julian were interred at Tarsus in Cilicia but his stately tomb which arose in that city on the banks of the cold and limpid Cydnus one hundred thirty eight was displeasing to the faithful friends who loved and revered the memory of that extraordinary man The philosopher expressed a very reasonable wish that the disciple of Plato might have reposed amidst the

Administration Germany Britain Africa The East The Danube Death Of Valentinian His Two Sons Gratian And Valentinian II Succeed To The Western Empire The death of Julian had left the public affairs of the empire in a very doubtful and dangerous situation The Roman army was saved by an inglorious perhaps a necessary treaty one and the first moments of peace were consecrated by the pious Jovian to restore the domestic tranquility of the church and state The indiscretion of his predecessor instead of reconciling had artfully fomented the religious war and the balance which he affected to preserve between the hostile factions served only to perpetuate the contest by the vicissitudes of hope and fear by the rival claims of ancient possession and actual favor The Christians had forgotten the spirit of the gospel and the Pagans had imbibed the spirit of the church In private families the sentiments of nature were extinguished by the blind fury of zeal and revenge the majesty of the laws was violated or abused the cities of the East were stained with blood and the most implacable enemies of the Romans were in the bosom of their country Jovian was educated in the profession of Christianity and as he marched from Nisibis to Antioch the banner of the Cross the Labarum of Constantine which was again displayed at the head of the legions announced to the people the faith of their new emperor As soon as he ascended the throne he transmitted a circular epistle to all the governors of provinces in which he confessed the divine truth and secured the legal establishment of the Christian religion The insidious edicts of Julian were abolished the ecclesiastical immunities were restored and enlarged and Jovian condescended to lament that the distress of the times obliged him to diminish the measure of charitable distributions two The Christians were unanimous in the loud and sincere applause which they bestowed on the pious successor of Julian But they were still ignorant what creed or what synod he would choose for the standard of orthodoxy and the peace of the church immediately revived those eager disputes which had been suspended during the season of persecution The episcopal leaders of the contending sects convinced from experience how much their fate would depend on the earliest impressions that were made on the mind of an untutored soldier hastened to the court of Edessa or Antioch The highways of the East were crowded with Homoousian and Arian and Semi Arian and Eunomian bishops who struggled to outstrip each other in the holy race the apartments of the palace resounded with their clamors and the ears of the prince were assaulted and perhaps astonished by the singular mixture of metaphysical argument and passionate invective three The moderation of Jovian who recommended concord and charity and referred the disputants to the sentence of a future council was interpreted as a symptom of indifference but his attachment to the Nicene creed was at length discovered and declared by the reverence which he expressed for the celestial four virtues of the great Athanasius The intrepid veteran of the faith at the age of seventy had issued from his retreat on the first intelligence of the tyrant s death The acclamations of the people seated him once more on the archiepiscopal throne and he wisely accepted or anticipated the invitation of Jovian The venerable figure of Athanasius his calm courage and insinuating eloquence sustained the reputation which he had already acquired in the courts of four successive princes five As soon as he had gained the confidence and secured the faith of the Christian emperor he returned in triumph to his diocese and continued with mature counsels and undiminished vigor to direct ten years longer six the ecclesiastical government of Alexandria Egypt and the Catholic church Before his departure from Antioch he assured Jovian that his orthodox devotion would be rewarded with a long and peaceful reign Athanasius had reason to hope that he should be allowed either the merit of a successful prediction or the excuse of a grateful though ineffectual prayer seven Footnote one The

jealous of the prophetic fame of their leader The slightest force when it is applied to assist and guide the natural descent of its object operates with irresistible weight and Jovian had the good fortune to embrace the religious opinions which were supported by the spirit of the times and the zeal and numbers of the most powerful sect eight Under his reign Christianity obtained an easy and lasting victory and as soon as the smile of royal patronage was withdrawn the genius of Paganism which had been fondly raised and cherished by the arts of Julian sunk irrecoverably in the In many cities the temples were shut or deserted the philosophers who had abused their transient favor thought it prudent to shave their beards and disguise their profession and the Christians rejoiced that they were now in a condition to forgive or to revenge the injuries which they had suffered under the preceding reign nine The consternation of the Pagan world was dispelled by a wise and gracious edict of toleration in which Jovian explicitly declared that although he should severely punish the sacrilegious rites of magic his subjects might exercise with freedom and safety the ceremonies of the ancient worship The memory of this law has been preserved by the orator Themistius who was deputed by the senate of Constantinople to express their royal devotion for the new emperor Themistius expatiates on the clemency of the Divine Nature the facility of human error the rights of conscience and the independence of the mind and with some eloquence inculcates the principles of philosophical toleration whose aid Superstition herself in the hour of her distress is not ashamed to implore He justly observes that in the recent changes both religions had been alternately disgraced by the seeming acquisition of worthless proselytes of those votaries of the reigning purple who could pass without a reason and without a blush from the church to the temple and from the altars of Jupiter to

remarks Hist de Jovien tom i p one hundred ninety nine that Sozomen has forgot the general toleration and Themistius the establishment of the Catholic religion Each of them turned away from the object which he disliked and wished to suppress the part of the edict the least honorable in his opinion to the emperor In the space of seven months the Roman troops who were now returned to Antioch had performed a march of fifteen hundred miles in which they had endured all the hardships of war of famine and of climate Notwithstanding their services their fatigues and the approach of winter the timid and impatient Jovian allowed only to the men and horses a respite of six weeks The emperor could not sustain the indiscreet and malicious raillery of the people of Antioch eleven He was impatient to possess the palace of Constantinople and to prevent the ambition of some competitor who might occupy the vacant allegiance of Europe But he soon received the grateful intelligence that his authority was acknowledged from the Thracian Bosphorus to the Atlantic Ocean By the first letters which he despatched from the camp of Mesopotamia he had delegated the military command of Gaul and Illyricum to Malarich a brave and faithful officer of the nation of the Franks and to his father in law Count Lucillian who had formerly distinguished his courage and conduct in the defence of Nisibis Malarich had declined an office to which he thought himself unequal and Lucillian was massacred at Rheims in an accidental mutiny of the Batavian cohorts twelve But the moderation of Jovinus master general of the cavalry who forgave the intention of his disgrace soon appeased the tumult and confirmed the uncertain minds of the soldiers The oath of fidelity was administered and taken with loyal acclamations and the deputies of the Western armies thirteen saluted their new sovereign as he descended from Mount Taurus to the city of Tyana in Cappadocia From Tyana he continued his hasty march to Ancyra capital of the province of Galatia where Jovian assumed with his infant son the name and ensigns of the consulship fourteen Dadastana fifteen an obscure town almost at an equal distance between Ancyra and Nice was marked for the fatal term of his journey and life After indulging himself with a plentiful perhaps an intemperate supper he retired to rest and the next morning the emperor Jovian was found dead in his bed The cause of this sudden death was variously understood By some it was ascribed to the consequences of an indigestion occasioned either by the quantity of the wine or the quality of the mushrooms which he had swallowed in the evening According to others he was suffocated in his sleep by the vapor of charcoal which extracted from the walls of the apartment the unwholesome moisture of the fresh plaster sixteen But the want of a regular inquiry into the death of a prince whose reign and person were soon forgotten appears to have been the only circumstance which countenanced the malicious whispers of poison and domestic guilt seventeen The body of Jovian was sent to Constantinople to be interred with his predecessors and the sad procession was met on the road by his wife Charito the daughter of Count Lucillian who still wept the recent death of her father and was hastening to dry her tears in the embraces of an Imperial husband Her disappointment and grief were imbittered by the anxiety of maternal tenderness Six weeks before the death of Jovian his infant son had been placed in the curule chair adorned with the title of Nobilissimus and the vain ensigns of the consulship Unconscious of his fortune the royal youth who from his grandfather assumed the name of Varronian was reminded only by the jealousy of the government that he was the son of an emperor Sixteen years afterwards he was still alive but he had already been deprived of an eye and his afflicted mother expected every hour that the innocent victim would be torn from her arms

have never wiped away a single tear After the death of Jovian the throne of the Roman world remained ten days nineteen without a master The ministers and generals still continued to meet in council to exercise their respective functions to maintain the public order and peaceably to conduct the army to the city of Nice in Bithynia which was chosen for the place of the election twenty In a solemn assembly of the civil and military powers of the empire the diadem was again unanimously offered to the praefect Sallust He enjoyed the glory of a second refusal and when the virtues of the father were alleged in favor of his son the praefect with the firmness of a disinterested patriot declared to the electors that the feeble age of the one and the unexperienced youth of the other were equally incapable of the laborious duties of government Several candidates were proposed and after weighing the objections of character or situation they were successively rejected but as soon as the name of Valentinian was pronounced the merit of that officer united the suffrages of the whole assembly and obtained the sincere approbation of Sallust himself Valentinian twenty one was the son of Count Gratian a native of Cibalis in Pannonia who from an obscure condition had raised himself by matchless strength and dexterity to the military commands of Africa and Britain from which he retired with an ample fortune and suspicious integrity The rank and services of Gratian contributed however to smooth the first steps of the promotion of his son and afforded him an early opportunity of displaying those solid and useful qualifications which raised his character above the ordinary level of his fellow soldiers The person of Valentinian was tall graceful and majestic His manly countenance deeply marked with the impression of sense and spirit inspired his friends with awe and his enemies with fear and to second the efforts of his undaunted courage the son of Gratian had inherited the advantages of a strong and healthy constitution By the habits of chastity and temperance which restrain the appetites and invigorate the faculties Valentinian preserved his own and the public esteem The avocations of a military life had diverted his youth from the elegant pursuits of literature twenty onea he was ignorant of the Greek language and the arts of rhetoric but as the mind of the orator was never disconcerted by timid perplexity he was able as often as the occasion prompted him to deliver his decided sentiments with bold and ready elocution The laws of martial discipline were the only laws that he had studied and he was soon distinguished by the laborious diligence and inflexible severity with which he discharged and enforced the duties of the camp In the time of Julian he provoked the danger of disgrace by the contempt which he publicly expressed for the reigning religion twenty two and it should seem from his subsequent conduct that the indiscreet and unseasonable freedom of Valentinian was the effect of military spirit rather than of Christian zeal He was pardoned however and still employed by a prince who esteemed his merit twenty three and in the various events of the Persian war he improved the reputation which he had already acquired on the banks of the Rhine The celerity and success with which he executed an important commission recommended him to the favor of Jovian and to the honorable command of the second school or company of Targetiers of the domestic guards In the march from Antioch he had reached his quarters at Ancyra when he was unexpectedly summoned without guilt and without intrigue to assume in the forty third year of his age the absolute government of the Roman empire Footnote nineteen Ten days appear scarcely sufficient for the march and election But it may be observed one That the generals might command the expeditious use of the public posts for themselves their attendants and messengers two That the troops for the ease of the cities marched in many divisions and that the head of the column might arrive at Nice when the rear halted at Ancyra Footnote twenty Ammianus xxvi one Zosimus l iii p one hundred ninety

election Footnote twenty one Ammianus xxx seven nine and the younger Victor have furnished the portrait of Valentinian which naturally precedes and illustrates the history of his reign Note Symmachus

Godefroy s Dissertations p two hundred ninety three The invitation of the ministers and generals at Nice was of little moment unless it were confirmed by the voice of the army The aged Sallust who had long observed the irregular fluctuations of popular assemblies proposed under pain of death that none of those persons whose rank in the service might excite a party in their favor should appear in public on the day of the inauguration Yet such was the prevalence of ancient superstition that a whole day was voluntarily added to this dangerous interval because it happened to be the intercalation of the Bissextile twenty four At length when the hour was supposed to be propitious Valentinian showed himself from a lofty tribunal the judicious choice was applauded and the new prince was solemnly invested with the diadem and the purple amidst the acclamation of the troops who were disposed in martial order round the tribunal But when he stretched forth his hand to address the armed multitude a busy whisper was accidentally started in the ranks and insensibly swelled into a loud and imperious clamor that he should name without delay a colleague in the empire The intrepid calmness of Valentinian obtained silence and commanded respect and he thus addressed the assembly A few minutes since it was in your power fellow soldiers to have left me in the obscurity of a private station Judging from the testimony of my past life that I deserved to reign you have placed me on the throne It is now my duty to consult the safety and interest of the republic The weight of the universe is undoubtedly too great for the hands of a feeble mortal I am conscious of the limits of my abilities and the uncertainty of my life and far from declining I am anxious to solicit the assistance of a worthy colleague But where discord may be fatal the choice of a faithful friend requires mature and serious deliberation That deliberation shall be my care Let your conduct be dutiful and consistent Retire to your quarters refresh your minds and bodies and expect the accustomed donative on the accession of a new emperor twenty five The astonished troops with a mixture of pride of satisfaction and of terror confessed the voice of their master Their angry clamors subsided into silent reverence and Valentinian encompassed with the eagles of the legions and the various banners of the cavalry and infantry was conducted in warlike pomp to the palace of Nice As he was sensible however of the importance of preventing some rash declaration of the soldiers he consulted the assembly of the chiefs and their real sentiments were concisely expressed by the generous freedom of Dagalaiphus Most excellent prince said that officer if you consider only your family you have a brother if you love the republic look round for the most deserving of the Romans twenty six The emperor who suppressed his displeasure without altering his intention slowly proceeded from Nice to Nicomedia and Constantinople In one of the suburbs of that capital twenty seven thirty days after his own elevation he bestowed the title of Augustus on his brother Valens twenty sevena and as the boldest patriots were convinced that their opposition without being serviceable to their country would be fatal to themselves the declaration of his absolute will was received with silent submission Valens was now in the thirty sixth year of his age but his abilities had never been exercised in any employment military or civil and his character had not inspired the world with any sanguine expectations He possessed however one quality which recommended him to Valentinian and preserved the domestic peace of the empire devout and grateful attachment to his benefactor whose superiority of genius as well as of authority

Empire Part II Before Valentinian divided the provinces he reformed the administration of the empire All ranks of subjects who had been injured or oppressed under the reign of Julian were invited to support their public accusations The silence of mankind attested the spotless integrity of the praefect Sallust twenty nine and his own pressing solicitations that he might be permitted to retire from the business of the state were rejected by Valentinian with the most honorable expressions of friendship and esteem But among the favorites of the late emperor there were many who had abused his credulity or superstition and who could no longer hope to be protected either by favor or justice thirty The greater part of the ministers of the palace and the governors of the provinces were removed from their respective stations yet the eminent merit of some officers was distinguished from the obnoxious crowd and notwithstanding the opposite clamors of zeal and resentment the whole proceedings of this delicate inquiry appear to have been conducted with a reasonable share of wisdom and moderation thirty one The festivity of a new reign received a short and suspicious interruption from the sudden illness of the two princes but as soon as their health was restored they left Constantinople in the beginning of the spring In the castle or palace of Mediana only three miles from Naissus they executed the solemn and final division of the Roman empire thirty two Valentinian bestowed on his brother the rich praefecture of the East from the Lower Danube to the confines of Persia whilst he reserved for his immediate government the warlike threea praefectures of Illyricum Italy and Gaul from the extremity of Greece to the Caledonian rampart and from the rampart of Caledonia to the foot of Mount Atlas The provincial administration remained on its former basis but a double supply of generals and magistrates was required for two councils and two courts the division was made with a just regard to their peculiar merit and situation and seven master generals were soon created either of the cavalry or infantry When this important business had been amicably transacted Valentinian and Valens embraced for the last time The emperor of the West established his temporary residence at Milan and the emperor of the East returned to Constantinople to assume the dominion of fifty provinces

vi p seventy one The tranquility of the East was soon disturbed by rebellion and the throne of Valens was threatened by the daring attempts of a rival whose affinity to the emperor Julian thirty four was his sole merit and had been his only crime Procopius had been hastily promoted from the obscure station of a tribune and a notary to the joint command of the army of Mesopotamia the public opinion already named him as the successor of a prince who was destitute of natural heirs and a vain rumor was propagated by his friends or his enemies that Julian before the altar of the Moon at Carrhae had privately invested Procopius with the Imperial purple thirty five He endeavored by his dutiful and submissive behavior to disarm the jealousy of Jovian resigned without a contest his military command and retired with his wife and family to cultivate the ample patrimony which he possessed in the province of Cappadocia These useful and innocent occupations were interrupted by the appearance of an officer with a band of soldiers who in the name of his new sovereigns Valentinian and Valens was despatched to conduct the unfortunate Procopius either to a perpetual prison or an ignominious death His presence of mind procured him a longer respite and a more splendid fate Without presuming to dispute the royal mandate he requested the indulgence of a few moments to embrace his weeping family and while the vigilance of his guards was relaxed by a plentiful entertainment he dexterously escaped to the sea coast of the Euxine from whence he passed over to the country of Bosphorus In that sequestered region he remained many months exposed to the hardships of exile of solitude and of want his melancholy temper brooding over his misfortunes and his mind agitated by the just apprehension that if any accident should discover his name the faithless Barbarians would violate without much scruple the laws of hospitality In a moment of impatience and despair Procopius embarked in a merchant vessel which made sail for Constantinople and boldly aspired to the rank of a sovereign because he was not allowed to enjoy the security of a subject At first he lurked in the villages of Bithynia continually changing his habitation and his disguise thirty six By degrees he ventured into the capital trusted his life and fortune to the fidelity of two friends a senator and a eunuch and conceived some hopes of success from the intelligence which he obtained of the actual state of public affairs The body of the people was infected with a spirit of discontent they regretted the justice and the abilities of Sallust who had been imprudently dismissed from the praefecture of the East They despised the character of Valens which was rude without vigor and feeble without mildness They dreaded the influence of his father in law the patrician Petronius a cruel and rapacious minister who rigorously exacted all the arrears of tribute that might remain unpaid since the reign of the emperor Aurelian The circumstances were propitious to the designs of a usurper The hostile measures of the Persians required the presence of Valens in Syria from the Danube to the Euphrates the troops were in motion and the capital was occasionally filled with the soldiers who passed or repassed the Thracian Bosphorus Two cohorts of Gaul were persuaded to listen to the secret proposals of the conspirators which were recommended by the promise of a liberal donative and as they still revered the memory of Julian they easily consented to support the hereditary claim of his proscribed kinsman At the dawn of day they were drawn up near the baths of Anastasia and Procopius clothed in a purple garment more suitable to a player than to a monarch appeared as if he rose from the dead in the midst of Constantinople The soldiers who were prepared for his reception saluted their trembling prince with shouts of joy and vows of fidelity Their numbers were soon increased by a band of sturdy peasants collected from the adjacent country and Procopius shielded by the arms of his adherents was successively conducted to the tribunal the senate and the palace During the first moments of his tumultuous reign he was astonished and terrified by the gloomy silence of the people who were either ignorant of the cause or apprehensive of the event But his military strength was superior to any actual resistance the malecontents flocked to the standard of rebellion the poor were excited by the hopes and the rich were intimidated by the fear of a general pillage and the obstinate credulity of the multitude was once more deceived by the promised advantages of a revolution The magistrates were seized the prisons and arsenals broke open the gates and the entrance of the harbor were diligently occupied and in a few hours Procopius became the absolute though precarious master of the Imperial city thirty sixa The usurper improved this unexpected success with some degree of courage and dexterity He artfully propagated the rumors and opinions the most favorable to his interest while he deluded the populace by giving audience to the frequent but imaginary ambassadors of distant nations The large bodies of troops stationed in the cities of Thrace and the fortresses of the Lower Danube were gradually involved in the guilt of rebellion and the Gothic princes consented to supply the sovereign of Constantinople with the formidable strength of several thousand auxiliaries His generals passed the Bosphorus and subdued without an effort the unarmed but wealthy provinces of Bithynia and Asia After an honorable defence the city and island of Cyzicus yielded to his power the renowned legions of the Jovians and Herculeans embraced the cause of the usurper whom they were ordered to crush and as the veterans were continually augmented with new levies he soon appeared at the head of an army whose valor as well as numbers were not unequal to the greatness of the contest The son of Hormisdas thirty seven a youth of spirit and ability condescended to draw his sword against the lawful emperor of the East and the Persian prince was immediately invested with the ancient and extraordinary powers of a Roman Proconsul The alliance of Faustina the widow of the emperor Constantius who intrusted herself and her daughter to the hands of the usurper added dignity and reputation to his cause The princess Constantia who was then about five years of age accompanied in a litter the march of the army She was shown to the multitude in the arms of her adopted father and as often as she passed through the ranks the tenderness of the soldiers was inflamed into martial fury thirty eight they recollected the glories of the house of Constantine and they declared with loyal acclamation that they would shed the last drop of their blood in the defence of the royal infant thirty nine Footnote thirty four The uncertain degree of alliance or consanguinity is expressed by the words cognatus consobrinus see

communication was stopped or corrupted he listened with doubtful anxiety to the rumors which were industriously spread that the defeat and death of Valens had left Procopius sole master of the Eastern provinces Valens was not dead but on the news of the rebellion which he received at Caesarea he basely despaired of his life and fortune proposed to negotiate with the usurper and discovered his secret inclination to abdicate the Imperial purple The timid monarch was saved from disgrace and ruin by the firmness of his ministers and their abilities soon decided in his favor the event of the civil war In a season of tranquillity Sallust had resigned without a murmur but as soon as the public safety was attacked he ambitiously solicited the preeminence of toil and danger and the restoration of that virtuous minister to the praefecture of the East was the first step which indicated the repentance of Valens and satisfied the minds of the people The reign of Procopius was apparently supported by powerful armies and obedient provinces But many of the principal officers military as well as civil had been urged either by motives of duty or interest to withdraw themselves from the guilty scene or to watch the moment of betraying and deserting the cause of the usurper Lupicinus advanced by hasty marches to bring the legions of Syria to the aid of Valens Arintheus who in strength beauty and valor excelled all the heroes of the age attacked with a small troop a superior body of the rebels When he beheld the faces of the soldiers who had served under his banner he commanded them with a loud voice to seize and deliver up their pretended leader and such was the ascendant of his genius that this extraordinary order was instantly obeyed forty Arbetio a respectable veteran of the great Constantine who had been distinguished by the honors of the consulship was persuaded to leave his retirement and once more to conduct an army into the field In the heat of action calmly taking off his helmet he showed his gray hairs and venerable countenance saluted the soldiers of Procopius by the endearing names of children and companions and exhorted them no longer to support the desperate cause of a contemptible tyrant but to follow their old commander who had so often led them to honor and victory In the two engagements of Thyatira forty one and Nacolia the unfortunate Procopius was deserted by his troops who were seduced by the instructions and example of their perfidious officers After wandering some time among the woods and mountains of Phyrgia he was betrayed by his desponding followers conducted to the Imperial camp and immediately beheaded He suffered the ordinary fate of an unsuccessful usurper but the acts of cruelty which were exercised by

part of Europe has abolished forty four a cruel and odious prejudice which reigned in every climate of the globe and adhered to every system of religious opinions forty five The nations and the sects of the Roman world admitted with equal credulity and similar abhorrence the reality of that infernal art forty six which was able to control the eternal order of the planets and the voluntary operations of the human mind They dreaded the mysterious power of spells and incantations of potent herbs and execrable rites which could extinguish or recall life inflame the passions of the soul blast the works of creation and extort from the reluctant daemons the secrets of futurity They believed with the wildest inconsistency that this preternatural dominion of the air of earth and of hell was exercised from the vilest motives of malice or gain by some wrinkled hags and itinerant sorcerers who passed their obscure lives in penury and contempt forty seven The arts of magic were equally condemned by the public opinion and by the laws of Rome but as they tended to gratify the most imperious passions of the heart of man they were continually proscribed and continually practised forty eight An imaginary cause as capable of producing the most serious and mischievous effects The dark predictions of the death of an emperor or the success of a conspiracy were calculated only to stimulate the hopes of ambition and to dissolve the ties of fidelity and the intentional guilt of magic was aggravated by the actual crimes of treason and sacrilege forty nine Such vain terrors disturbed the peace of society and the happiness of individuals and the harmless flame which insensibly melted a waxen image might derive a powerful and pernicious energy from the affrighted fancy of the person whom it was maliciously designed to represent fifty From the infusion of those herbs which were supposed to possess a supernatural influence it was an easy step to the use of more substantial poison and the folly of mankind sometimes became the instrument and the mask of the most atrocious crimes As soon as the zeal of informers was encouraged by the ministers of Valens and Valentinian they could not refuse to listen to another charge too frequently mingled in the scenes of domestic guilt a charge of a softer and less malignant nature for which the pious though excessive rigor of Constantine had recently decreed the punishment of death fifty one This deadly and incoherent mixture of treason and magic of poison and adultery afforded infinite gradations of guilt and innocence of excuse and aggravation which in these proceedings appear to have been confounded by the angry or corrupt passions of the judges They easily discovered that the degree of their industry and discernment was estimated by the Imperial court according to the number of executions that were furnished from the respective tribunals It was not without extreme reluctance that they pronounced a sentence of acquittal but they eagerly admitted such evidence as was stained with perjury or procured by torture to prove the most improbable charges against the most respectable characters The progress of the inquiry continually opened new subjects of criminal prosecution the audacious informer whose falsehood was detected retired with impunity but the wretched victim who discovered his real or pretended accomplices were seldom permitted to receive the price of his infamy From the extremity of Italy and Asia the young and the aged were dragged in chains to the tribunals of Rome and Antioch Senators matrons and philosophers expired in ignominious and cruel tortures The soldiers who were appointed to guard the prisons declared with a murmur of pity and indignation that their numbers were insufficient to oppose the flight or resistance of the multitude of captives The wealthiest families were ruined by fines and confiscations the most innocent citizens trembled for their safety and we may form some notion of the magnitude of the evil from the extravagant assertion of an ancient writer that in the obnoxious provinces the prisoners the exiles and the fugitives formed the greatest part of the inhabitants fifty two Footnote forty twoa This infamous inquisition into sorcery and witchcraft has been of greater influence on human affairs than is commonly supposed The

admiration and of pity The coarse and undistinguishing pencil of Ammianus has delineated his bloody figures with tedious and disgusting accuracy But as our attention is no longer engaged by the contrast of freedom and servitude of recent greatness and of actual misery we should turn with horror from the frequent executions which disgraced both at Rome and Antioch the reign of the two brothers fifty three Valens was of a timid fifty four and Valentinian of a choleric disposition fifty five An anxious regard to his personal safety was the ruling principle of the administration of Valens In the condition of a subject he had kissed with trembling awe the hand of the oppressor and when he ascended the throne he reasonably expected that the same fears which had subdued his own mind would secure the patient submission of his people The favorites of Valens obtained by the privilege of rapine and confiscation the wealth which his economy would have refused fifty six They urged with persuasive eloquence that in all cases of treason suspicion is equivalent to proof that the power supposes the intention of mischief that the intention is not less criminal than the act and that a subject no longer deserves to live if his life may threaten the safety or disturb the repose of his sovereign The judgment of Valentinian was sometimes deceived and his confidence abused but he would have silenced the informers with a contemptuous smile had they presumed to alarm his fortitude by the sound of danger They praised his inflexible love of justice and in the pursuit of justice the emperor was easily tempted to consider clemency as a weakness and passion as a virtue As long as he wrestled with his equals in the bold competition of an active and ambitious life Valentinian was seldom injured and never insulted with impunity if his prudence was arraigned his spirit was applauded and the proudest and most powerful generals were apprehensive of provoking the resentment of a fearless soldier After he became master of the world he unfortunately forgot that where no resistance can be made no courage can be exerted and instead of consulting the dictates of reason and magnanimity he indulged the furious emotions of his temper at a time when they were disgraceful to himself and fatal to the defenceless objects of his displeasure In the government of his household or of his empire slight or even imaginary offences a hasty word a casual omission an involuntary delay were chastised by a sentence of immediate death The expressions which issued the most readily from the mouth of the emperor of the West were Strike off his head Burn him alive Let him be beaten with clubs till he expires fifty seven and his most favored ministers soon understood that by a rash attempt to dispute or suspend the execution of his sanguinary commands they might involve themselves in the guilt and punishment of disobedience The repeated gratification of this savage justice hardened the mind of Valentinian against pity and remorse and the sallies of passion were confirmed by the habits of cruelty fifty eight He could behold with calm satisfaction the convulsive agonies of torture and death he reserved his friendship for those faithful servants whose temper was the most congenial to his own The merit of Maximin who had slaughtered the noblest families of Rome was rewarded with the royal approbation and the praefecture of Gaul Two fierce and enormous bears distinguished by the appellations of Innocence and Mica Aurea could alone deserve to share the favor of Maximin The cages of those trusty guards were always placed near the bed chamber of Valentinian who frequently amused his eyes with the grateful spectacle of seeing them tear and devour the bleeding limbs of the malefactors who were abandoned to their rage Their diet and exercises were carefully inspected by the Roman emperor and when Innocence had earned her discharge by a long course of meritorious service the faithful animal was again restored to the freedom of her native woods fifty nine Footnote fifty three Consult the six last books of Ammianus and more particularly the portraits

with a tone of pleasantry Abi Comes et muta ei caput qui sibi mutari provinciam cupit A boy who had slipped too hastily a Spartan bound an armorer who had made a polished cuirass that wanted some grains of the legitimate weight c were the victims of his fury Footnote fifty eight The innocents of Milan were an agent and three apparitors whom Valentinian condemned for signifying a legal summons Ammianus xxvii seven strangely supposes that all who had been unjustly executed were worshipped as martyrs by the Christians His impartial silence does not allow us to believe that the great chamberlain Rhodanus was burnt alive for an act of oppression Chron Paschal p three hundred ninety two Note Ammianus does not say that they were worshipped as martyrs Onorum memoriam apud Mediolanum

Footnote fifty nine Ut bene meritam in sylvas jussit abire Innoxiam Ammian xxix and Valesius ad locum Chapter XXV Reigns Of Jovian And Valentinian Division Of The Empire Part III But in the calmer moments of reflection when the mind of Valens was not agitated by fear or that of Valentinian by rage the tyrant resumed the sentiments or at least the conduct of the father of his country The dispassionate judgment of the Western emperor could clearly perceive and accurately pursue his own and the public interest and the sovereign of the East who imitated with equal docility the various examples which he received from his elder brother was sometimes guided by the wisdom and virtue of the praefect Sallust Both princes invariably retained in the purple the chaste and temperate simplicity which had adorned their private life and under their reign the pleasures of the court never cost the people a blush or a sigh They gradually reformed many of the abuses of the times of Constantius judiciously adopted and improved the designs of Julian and his successor and displayed a style and spirit of legislation which might inspire posterity with the most favorable opinion of their character and government It is not from the master of Innocence that we should expect the tender regard for the welfare of his subjects which prompted Valentinian to condemn the exposition of new born infants sixty and to establish fourteen skilful physicians with stipends and privileges in the fourteen quarters of Rome The good sense of an illiterate soldier founded a useful and liberal institution for the education of youth and the support of declining science sixty one It was his intention that the arts of rhetoric and grammar should be taught in the Greek and Latin languages in the metropolis of every province and as the size and dignity of the school was usually proportioned to the importance of the city the academies of Rome and Constantinople claimed a just and singular preeminence The fragments of the literary edicts of Valentinian imperfectly represent the school of Constantinople which was gradually improved by subsequent regulations That school consisted of thirty one professors in different branches of learning One philosopher and two lawyers five sophists and ten grammarians for the Greek and three orators and ten grammarians for the Latin tongue besides seven scribes or as they were then styled antiquarians whose laborious pens supplied the public library with fair and correct copies of the classic writers The rule of conduct which was prescribed to the students is the more curious as it affords the first outlines of the form and discipline of a modern university It was required that they should bring proper certificates from the magistrates of their native province Their names professions and places of abode were regularly entered in a public register The studious youth were severely prohibited from wasting their time in feasts or in the theatre and the term of their education was limited to the age of twenty The praefect of the city was empowered to chastise the idle and refractory by stripes or expulsion and he was directed to make an annual report to the master of the offices that the knowledge and abilities of the scholars might be usefully applied to the public service The institutions of Valentinian contributed to secure the benefits of peace and plenty and the cities were guarded by the establishment of the Defensors sixty two freely elected as the tribunes and advocates of the people to support their rights and to expose their grievances before the tribunals of the civil magistrates or even at the foot of the Imperial throne The finances were diligently administered by two princes who had been so long accustomed to the rigid economy of a private fortune but in the receipt and application of the revenue a discerning eye might observe some difference between the government of the East and of the West Valens was persuaded that royal liberality can be supplied only by public oppression and his ambition never aspired to secure by their actual distress the future strength and prosperity of his people Instead of increasing the weight of taxes which in the space of forty years had been gradually doubled he reduced in the first years of his reign one fourth of the tribute of the East sixty three Valentinian appears to have been less attentive and less anxious to relieve the burdens of his people He might reform the abuses of the fiscal administration but he exacted without scruple a very large share of the private property as he was convinced that the revenues which supported the luxury of individuals would be much more advantageously employed for the defence and improvement of the state The subjects of the East who enjoyed the present benefit applauded the indulgence of their prince The solid but less splendid merit of Valentinian was felt and acknowledged by the subsequent generation sixty four Footnote sixty See the Code of Justinian l viii tit lii leg two Unusquisque sabolem suam nutriat Quod si exponendam putaverit animadversioni quae

sixty four Zosimus l iv p two hundred two Ammian xxx nine His reformation of costly abuses might entitle him to the praise of in provinciales admodum parcus tributorum ubique molliens sarcinas By some his frugality was styled avarice Jerom Chron p one hundred eighty six But the most honorable circumstance of the character of Valentinian is the firm and temperate impartiality which he uniformly preserved in an age of religious contention His strong sense unenlightened but uncorrupted by study declined with respectful indifference the subtle questions of theological debate The government of the Earth claimed his vigilance and satisfied his ambition and while he remembered that he was the disciple of the church he never forgot that he was the sovereign of the clergy Under the reign of an apostate he had signalized his zeal for the honor of Christianity he allowed to his subjects the privilege which he had assumed for himself and they might accept with gratitude and confidence the general toleration which was granted by a prince addicted to passion but incapable of fear or of disguise sixty five The Pagans the Jews and all the various sects which acknowledged the divine authority of Christ were protected by the laws from arbitrary power or popular insult nor was any mode of worship prohibited by Valentinian except those secret and criminal practices which abused the name of religion for the dark purposes of vice and disorder The art of magic as it was more cruelly punished was more strictly proscribed but the emperor admitted a formal distinction to protect the ancient methods of divination which were approved by the senate and exercised by the Tuscan haruspices He had condemned with the consent of the most rational Pagans the license of nocturnal sacrifices but he immediately admitted the petition of Praetextatus proconsul of Achaia who represented that the life of the Greeks would become dreary and comfortless if they were deprived of the invaluable blessing of the Eleusinian mysteries Philosophy alone can boast and perhaps it is no more than the boast of philosophy that her gentle hand is able to eradicate from the human mind the latent and deadly principle of fanaticism But this truce of twelve years which was enforced by the wise and vigorous government of Valentinian by suspending the repetition of mutual injuries contributed to soften the manners and abate the prejudices of the religious factions Footnote sixty five Testes sunt leges a me in exordio Imperii mei datae quibus unicuique quod animo imbibisset colendi libera facultas tributa est Cod Theodos l ix tit xvi leg nine To this declaration of Valentinian we may add the various testimonies of Ammianus xxx nine Zosimus l iv p two hundred four and Sozomen l vi c

four Comme il s etait prescrit pour regle de ne point se meler de disputes de religion son histoire est presque entierement degagee des affaires ecclesiastiques Le Beau iii two hundred fourteen M The friend of toleration was unfortunately placed at a distance from the scene of the fiercest controversies As soon as the Christians of the West had extricated themselves from the snares of the creed of Rimini they happily relapsed into the slumber of orthodoxy and the small remains of the Arian party that still subsisted at Sirmium or Milan might be considered rather as objects of contempt than of resentment But in the provinces of the East from the Euxine to the extremity of Thebais the strength and numbers of the hostile factions were more equally balanced and this equality instead of recommending the counsels of peace served only to perpetuate the horrors of religious war The monks and bishops supported their arguments by invectives and their invectives were sometimes followed by blows Athanasius still reigned at Alexandria the thrones of Constantinople and Antioch were occupied by Arian prelates and every episcopal vacancy was the occasion of a popular tumult The Homoousians were fortified by the reconciliation of fifty nine Macelonian or Semi Arian bishops but their secret reluctance to embrace the divinity of the Holy Ghost clouded the splendor of the triumph and the declaration of Valens who in the first years of his reign had imitated the impartial conduct of his brother was an important victory on the side of Arianism The two brothers had passed their private life in the condition of catechumens but the piety of Valens prompted him to solicit the sacrament of baptism before he exposed his person to the dangers of a Gothic war He naturally addressed himself to Eudoxus sixty six sixty sixa bishop of the Imperial city and if the ignorant monarch was instructed by that Arian pastor in the principles of heterodox theology his misfortune rather than his guilt was the inevitable consequence of his erroneous choice Whatever had been the determination of the emperor he must have offended a numerous party of his Christian subjects as the leaders both of the Homoousians and of the Arians believed that if they were not suffered to reign they were most cruelly injured and oppressed After he had taken this decisive step it was extremely difficult for him to preserve either the virtue or the reputation of impartiality He never aspired like Constantius to the fame of a profound theologian but as he had received with simplicity and respect the tenets of Euxodus Valens resigned his conscience to the direction of his ecclesiastical guides and promoted by the influence of his authority the reunion of the Athanasian heretics to the body of the Catholic church At first he pitied their blindness by degrees he was provoked at their obstinacy and he insensibly hated those sectaries to whom he was an object of hatred sixty seven The feeble mind of Valens was always swayed by the persons with whom he familiarly conversed and the exile or imprisonment of a private citizen are the favors the most readily granted in a despotic court Such punishments were frequently inflicted on the leaders of the Homoousian party and the misfortune of fourscore ecclesiastics of Constantinople who perhaps accidentally were burned on shipboard was imputed to the cruel and premeditated malice of the emperor and his Arian ministers In every contest the Catholics if we may anticipate that name were obliged to pay the penalty of their own faults and of those of their adversaries In every election the claims of the Arian candidate obtained the preference and if they were opposed by the majority of the people he was usually supported by the authority of the civil magistrate or even by the terrors of a military force The enemies of Athanasius attempted to disturb the last years of his venerable age and his temporary retreat to his father s sepulchre has been celebrated as a fifth exile But the zeal of a great people who instantly flew to arms intimidated the praefect and the archbishop was permitted to end his life in peace and in glory after a reign of forty seven years The death of Athanasius was the signal of the persecution of Egypt and the Pagan minister of Valens who forcibly seated the worthless Lucius on the archiepiscopal throne purchased the favor of the reigning party by the blood and sufferings of their Christian brethren The free toleration of the heathen and Jewish worship was bitterly lamented as a circumstance which aggravated the misery of the Catholics and the guilt of the impious tyrant of the East sixty eight Footnote sixty six Eudoxus was of a mild and timid disposition When he baptized Valens A D three hundred sixty

Footnote sixty seven Gregory Nazianzen Orat xxv p four hundred thirty two insults the persecuting spirit of the Arians as an infallible symptom of error and heresy Footnote sixty eight This sketch of the ecclesiastical government of Valens is drawn from Socrates l iv Sozomen l vi Theodoret l iv and the immense compilations of Tillemont particularly tom vi viii and ix The triumph of the orthodox party has left a deep stain of persecution on the memory of Valens and the character of a prince who derived his virtues as well as his vices from a feeble understanding and a pusillanimous temper scarcely deserves the labor of an apology Yet candor may discover some reasons to suspect that the ecclesiastical ministers of Valens often exceeded the orders or even the intentions of their master and that the real measure of facts has been very liberally magnified by the vehement declamation and easy credulity of his antagonists sixty nine one The silence of Valentinian may suggest a probable argument that the partial severities which were exercised in the name and provinces of his colleague amounted only to some obscure and inconsiderable deviations from the established system of religious toleration and the judicious historian who has praised the equal temper of the elder brother has not thought himself obliged to contrast the tranquillity of the West with the cruel persecution of the East seventy two Whatever credit may be allowed to vague and distant reports the character or at least the behavior of Valens may be most distinctly seen in his personal transactions with the eloquent Basil archbishop of Caesarea who had succeeded Athanasius in the management of the Trinitarian cause seventy one The circumstantial narrative has been composed by the friends and admirers of Basil and as soon as we have stripped away a thick coat of rhetoric and miracle we shall be astonished by the unexpected mildness of the Arian tyrant who admired the firmness of his character or was apprehensive if he employed violence of a general revolt in the province of Cappadocia The archbishop who asserted with inflexible pride seventy two the truth of his opinions and the dignity of his rank was left in the free possession of his conscience and his throne The emperor devoutly assisted at the solemn service of the cathedral and instead of a sentence of banishment subscribed the donation of a valuable estate for the use of a hospital which Basil had lately founded in the neighborhood of Caesarea seventy three three I am not able to discover that any law such as Theodosius afterwards enacted against the Arians was published by Valens against the Athanasian sectaries and the edict which excited the most violent clamors may not appear so extremely reprehensible The emperor had observed that several of his subjects gratifying their lazy disposition under the pretence of religion had associated themselves with the monks of Egypt and he directed the count of the East to drag them from their solitude and to compel these deserters of society to accept the fair alternative of renouncing their temporal possessions or of discharging the public duties of men and citizens seventy four The ministers of Valens seem to have extended the sense of this penal statute since they claimed a right of enlisting the young and ablebodied monks in the Imperial armies A detachment of cavalry and infantry consisting of three thousand men marched from Alexandria into the adjacent desert of Nitria seventy five which was peopled by five thousand monks The soldiers were conducted by Arian priests and it is reported that a considerable slaughter was made in the monasteries which disobeyed the commands of their sovereign seventy six Footnote sixty

truth of their faith Right says Jortin Remarks vol iv p seventy nine but what proves the truth of those miracles The strict regulations which have been framed by the wisdom of modern legislators to restrain the wealth and avarice of the clergy may be originally deduced from the example of the emperor Valentinian His edict seventy seven addressed to Damasus bishop of Rome was publicly read in the churches of the city He admonished the ecclesiastics and monks not to frequent the houses of widows and virgins and menaced their disobedience with the animadversion of the civil judge The director was no longer permitted to receive any gift or legacy or inheritance from the liberality of his spiritual daughter every testament contrary to this edict was declared null and void and the illegal donation was confiscated for the use of the treasury By a subsequent regulation it should seem that the same provisions were extended to nuns and bishops and that all persons of the ecclesiastical order were rendered incapable of receiving any testamentary gifts and strictly confined to the natural and legal rights of inheritance As the guardian of domestic happiness and virtue Valentinian applied this severe remedy to the growing evil In the capital of the empire the females of noble and opulent houses possessed a very ample share of independent property and many of those devout females had embraced the doctrines of Christianity not only with the cold assent of the understanding but with the warmth of affection and perhaps with the eagerness of fashion They sacrificed the pleasures of dress and luxury and renounced for the praise of chastity the soft endearments of conjugal society Some ecclesiastic of real or apparent sanctity was chosen to direct their timorous conscience and to amuse the vacant tenderness of their heart and the unbounded confidence which they hastily bestowed was often abused by knaves and enthusiasts who hastened from the extremities of the East to enjoy on a splendid theatre the privileges of the monastic profession By their contempt of the world they insensibly acquired its most desirable advantages the lively attachment perhaps of a young and beautiful woman the delicate plenty of an opulent household and the respectful homage of the slaves the freedmen and the clients of a senatorial family The immense fortunes of the Roman ladies were gradually consumed in lavish alms and expensive pilgrimages and the artful monk who had assigned himself the first or possibly the sole place in the testament of his spiritual daughter still presumed to declare with the smooth face of hypocrisy that he was only the instrument of charity and the steward of the poor The lucrative but disgraceful trade seventy eight which was exercised by the clergy to defraud the expectations of the natural heirs had provoked the indignation of a superstitious age and two of the most respectable of the Latin fathers very honestly confess that the ignominious edict of Valentinian was just and necessary and that the Christian priests had deserved to lose a privilege which was still enjoyed by comedians charioteers and the ministers of idols But the wisdom and authority of the legislator are seldom victorious in a contest with the vigilant dexterity of private interest and Jerom or Ambrose might patiently acquiesce in the justice of an ineffectual or salutary law If the ecclesiastics were checked in the pursuit of personal emolument they would exert a more laudable industry to increase the wealth of the church and dignify their covetousness with the specious names of piety and patriotism seventy nine Footnote seventy seven Cod Theodos l xvi tit ii leg twenty Godefroy tom vi p forty nine after the example of Baronius

curiously observed by the historian Ammianus who delivers his impartial sense in these expressive words The praefecture of Juventius was accompanied with peace and plenty but the tranquillity of his government was soon disturbed by a bloody sedition of the distracted people The ardor of Damasus and Ursinus to seize the episcopal seat surpassed the ordinary measure of human ambition They contended

temperance and sobriety whose mean apparel and downcast looks recommend their pure and modest virtue to the Deity and his true worshippers eighty five The schism of Damasus and Ursinus was extinguished by the exile of the latter and the wisdom of the praefect Praetextatus eighty six restored the tranquillity of the city Praetextatus was a philosophic Pagan a man of learning of taste and politeness who disguised a reproach in the form of a jest when he assured Damasus that if he could obtain the bishopric of Rome he himself would immediately embrace the Christian religion eighty seven

the Roman empire to the hands of Valentinian his reputation in arms his military skill and experience and his rigid attachment to the forms as well as spirit of ancient discipline were the principal motives of their judicious choice The eagerness of the troops who pressed him to nominate his colleague was justified by the dangerous situation of public affairs and Valentinian himself was conscious that the abilities of the most active mind were unequal to the defence of the distant frontiers of an invaded monarchy As soon as the death of Julian had relieved the Barbarians from the terror of his name the most sanguine hopes of rapine and conquest excited the nations of the East of the North and of the South Their inroads were often vexatious and sometimes formidable but during the twelve years of the reign of Valentinian his firmness and vigilance protected his own dominions and his powerful genius seemed to inspire and direct the feeble counsels of his brother Perhaps the method of annals would more forcibly express the urgent and divided cares of the two emperors but the attention of the reader likewise would be distracted by a tedious and desultory narrative A separate view of the five great theatres of war I Germany II Britain III Africa IV The East and V The Danube will impress a more distinct image of the military state of the empire under the reigns of Valentinian and Valens I The ambassadors of the Alemanni had been offended by the harsh and haughty behavior of Ursacius master of the offices eighty eight who by an act of unseasonable parsimony had diminished the value as well as the quantity of the presents to which they were entitled either from custom or treaty on the accession of a new emperor They expressed and they communicated to their countrymen their strong sense of the national affront The irascible minds of the chiefs were exasperated by the suspicion of contempt and the martial youth crowded to their standard Before Valentinian could pass the Alps the villages of Gaul were in flames before his general Degalaiphus could encounter the Alemanni they had secured the captives and the spoil in the forests of Germany In the beginning of the ensuing year the military force of the whole nation in deep and solid columns broke through the barrier of the Rhine during the severity of a northern winter Two Roman counts were defeated and mortally wounded and the standard of the Heruli and Batavians fell into the hands of the Heruli and Batavians fell into the hands of the conquerors who displayed with insulting shouts and menaces the trophy of their victory The standard was recovered but the Batavians had not redeemed the shame of their disgrace and flight in the eyes of their severe judge It was the opinion of Valentinian that his soldiers must learn to fear their commander before they could cease to fear the enemy The troops were solemnly assembled and the trembling Batavians were enclosed within the circle of the Imperial army Valentinian then ascended his tribunal and as if he disdained to punish cowardice with death he inflicted a stain of indelible ignominy on the officers whose misconduct and pusillanimity were found to be the first occasion of the defeat The Batavians were degraded from their rank stripped of their arms and condemned to be sold for slaves to the highest bidder At this tremendous sentence the troops fell prostrate on the ground deprecated the indignation of their sovereign and protested that if he would indulge them in another trial they would approve themselves not unworthy of the name of Romans and of his soldiers Valentinian with affected reluctance yielded to their entreaties the Batavians resumed their arms and with their arms the invincible resolution of wiping away their disgrace in the blood of the Alemanni eighty nine The principal command was declined by Dagalaiphus and that experienced general who had represented perhaps with too much prudence the extreme difficulties of the undertaking had the mortification before the end of the campaign of seeing his rival Jovinus convert those difficulties into a decisive advantage over the scattered forces of the Barbarians At the head of a well disciplined army of cavalry infantry and light troops Jovinus advanced with cautious and rapid steps to Scarponna ninety ninetya in the territory of Metz where he surprised a large division of the Alemanni before they had time to run to their arms and flushed his soldiers with the confidence of an easy and bloodless victory Another division or rather army of the enemy after the cruel and wanton devastation of the adjacent country reposed themselves on the shady banks of the Moselle Jovinus who had viewed the ground with the eye of a general made a silent approach through a deep and woody vale till he could distinctly perceive the indolent security of the Germans Some were bathing their huge limbs in the river others were combing their long and flaxen hair others again were swallowing large draughts of rich and delicious wine On a sudden they heard the sound of the Roman trumpet they saw the enemy in their camp Astonishment produced disorder disorder was followed by flight and dismay and the confused multitude of the bravest warriors was pierced by the swords and javelins of the legionaries and auxiliaries The fugitives escaped to the third and most considerable camp in the Catalonian plains near Chalons in Champagne the straggling detachments were hastily recalled to their standard and the Barbarian chiefs alarmed and admonished by the fate of their companions prepared to encounter in a decisive battle the victorious forces of the lieutenant of Valentinian The bloody and obstinate conflict lasted a whole summer s day with equal valor and with alternate success The Romans at length prevailed with the loss of about twelve hundred men Six thousand of the Alemanni were slain four thousand were wounded and the brave Jovinus after chasing the flying remnant of their host as far as the banks of the Rhine returned to Paris to receive the applause of his sovereign and the ensigns of the consulship for the ensuing year ninety one The triumph of the Romans was indeed sullied by their treatment of the captive king whom they hung on a gibbet without the knowledge of their indignant general This disgraceful act of cruelty which might be imputed to the fury of the troops was followed by the deliberate murder of Withicab the son of Vadomair a German prince of a weak and sickly constitution but of a daring and formidable spirit The domestic assassin was instigated and protected by the Romans ninety two and the violation of the laws of humanity and justice betrayed their secret apprehension of the weakness of the

moment of a Christian festival ninety twoa Rando a bold and artful chieftain who had long meditated his attempt suddenly passed the Rhine entered the defenceless town and retired with a multitude of captives of either sex Valentinian resolved to execute severe vengeance on the whole body of the nation Count Sebastian with the bands of Italy and Illyricum was ordered to invade their country most probably on the side of Rhaetia The emperor in person accompanied by his son Gratian passed the Rhine at the head of a formidable army which was supported on both flanks by Jovinus and Severus the two masters general of the cavalry and infantry of the West The Alemanni unable to prevent the devastation of their villages fixed their camp on a lofty and almost inaccessible mountain in the modern duchy of Wirtemberg and resolutely expected the approach of the Romans The life of Valentinian was exposed to imminent danger by the intrepid curiosity with which he persisted to explore some secret and unguarded path A troop of Barbarians suddenly rose from their ambuscade and the emperor who vigorously spurred his horse down a steep and slippery descent was obliged to leave behind him his armor bearer and his helmet magnificently enriched with gold and precious stones At the signal of the general assault the Roman troops encompassed and ascended the mountain of Solicinium on three different sides ninety twob Every step which they gained increased their ardor and abated the resistance of the enemy and after their united forces had occupied the summit of the hill they impetuously urged the Barbarians down the northern descent where Count Sebastian was posted to intercept their retreat After this signal victory Valentinian returned to his winter quarters at Treves where he indulged the public joy by the exhibition of splendid and triumphal games ninety three But the wise monarch instead of aspiring to the conquest of Germany confined his attention to the important and laborious defence of the Gallic frontier against an enemy whose strength was renewed by a stream of daring volunteers which incessantly flowed from the most distant tribes of the North ninety four The banks of the Rhine ninety foura from its source to the straits of the ocean were closely planted with strong castles and convenient towers new works and new arms were invented by the ingenuity of a prince who

hundred seventy ascribes the fecundity of the Alemanni to their easy adoption of strangers Note This explanation says mister Malthus only removes the difficulty a little farther off It makes the earth rest upon the tortoise but does not tell us on what the tortoise rests We may still ask what northern reservoir supplied this incessant stream of daring adventurers Montesquieu s solution of the problem will I think hardly be admitted Grandeur et Decadence des Romains c sixteen p one hundred eighty seven The whole difficulty however is at once removed if we apply to the German nations at that time a fact which is so generally known to have occurred in America and suppose that when not checked by wars and famine they increased at a rate that would double their numbers in twenty five or thirty years The propriety and even the necessity of applying this rate of increase to the inhabitants of ancient Germany will strikingly appear from that most valuable picture of their manners which has been left us by Tacitus Tac de Mor Germ sixteen to twenty With these manners and a habit of enterprise and emigration which would naturally remove all fears about providing for a family it is difficult to conceive a society with a stronger principle of increase in it and we see at once that prolific source of armies and colonies against which the force of the Roman empire so long struggled with difficulty and under which it ultimately sunk It is not probable that for two periods together or even for one the population within the confines of Germany ever doubled itself in twenty five years Their perpetual wars the rude state of agriculture and particularly the very strange custom adopted by most of the tribes of marking their barriers by extensive deserts would prevent any very great actual increase of numbers At no one period could the country be called well peopled though it was often redundant in population Instead of clearing their forests draining their swamps and rendering their soil fit to support an extended population they found it more congenial to their martial habits and impatient dispositions to go in quest of food of plunder or of glory into other countries Malthus on Population i p one hundred twenty eight G Footnote ninety foura The course of the Neckar was likewise strongly guarded The hyperbolical eulogy of Symmachus asserts that the Neckar

Footnote ninety five Ammian xxviii two Zosimus l iv p two hundred fourteen The younger Victor mentions the mechanical genius of Valentinian nova arma meditari fingere terra seu limo simulacra That prudent emperor who diligently practised the wise maxims of Diocletian was studious to foment and excite the intestine divisions of the tribes of Germany About the middle of the fourth century the countries perhaps of Lusace and Thuringia on either side of the Elbe were occupied by the vague dominion of the Burgundians a warlike and numerous people ninety fivea of the Vandal race ninety six whose obscure name insensibly swelled into a powerful kingdom and has finally settled on a flourishing province The most remarkable circumstance in the ancient manners of the Burgundians appears to have been the difference of their civil and ecclesiastical constitution The appellation of Hendinos was given to the king or general and the title of Sinistus to the high priest of the nation The person of the priest was sacred and his dignity perpetual but the temporal government was held by a very precarious tenure If the events of war accuses the courage or conduct of the king he was immediately deposed and the injustice of his subjects made him responsible for the fertility of the earth and the regularity of the seasons which seemed to fall more properly within the sacerdotal department ninety seven The disputed possession of some salt pits ninety eight engaged the Alemanni and the Burgundians in frequent contests the latter were easily tempted by the secret solicitations and liberal offers of the emperor and their fabulous descent from the Roman soldiers who had formerly been left to garrison the fortresses of Drusus was admitted with mutual credulity as it was conducive to mutual interest ninety nine An army of fourscore thousand Burgundians soon appeared on the banks of the Rhine and impatiently required the support and subsidies which Valentinian had promised but they were amused with excuses and delays till at length after a fruitless expectation they were compelled to retire The arms and fortifications of the Gallic frontier checked the fury of their just resentment and their massacre of the captives served to imbitter the hereditary feud of the Burgundians and the Alemanni The inconstancy of a wise prince may perhaps be explained by some alteration of circumstances and perhaps it was the original design of Valentinian to intimidate rather than to destroy as the balance of power would have been equally overturned by the extirpation of either of the German nations Among the princes of the Alemanni Macrianus who with a Roman name had assumed the arts of a soldier and a statesman deserved his hatred and esteem The emperor himself with a light and unencumbered band condescended to pass the Rhine marched fifty miles into the country and would infallibly have seized the object of his pursuit if his judicious measures had not been defeated by the impatience of the troops Macrianus was afterwards admitted to the honor of a personal conference with the emperor and the favors which he received fixed him till the hour of his death a steady and sincere friend of the republic one hundred Footnote ninety fivea According to the general opinion the Burgundians formed a Gothic o Vandalic tribe who from the banks of the Lower Vistula made incursions on one side towards Transylvania on the other towards the centre of Germany All that remains of the Burgundian language is Gothic Nothing in their customs indicates a different origin

and the Chronicles of Jerom and Cassiodorus fix some dates and add some circumstances The land was covered by the fortifications of Valentinian but the sea coast of Gaul and Britain was exposed to the depredations of the Saxons That celebrated name in which we have a dear and domestic interest escaped the notice of Tacitus and in the maps of Ptolemy it faintly marks the narrow neck of the Cimbric peninsula and three small islands towards the mouth of the Elbe one hundred one This contracted territory the present duchy of Sleswig or perhaps of Holstein was incapable of pouring forth the inexhaustible swarms of Saxons who reigned over the ocean who filled the British island with their language their laws and their colonies and who so long defended the liberty of the North against the arms of Charlemagne one hundred two The solution of this difficulty is easily derived from the similar manners and loose constitution of the tribes of Germany which were blended with each other by the slightest accidents of war or friendship The situation of the native Saxons disposed them to embrace the hazardous professions of fishermen and pirates and the success of their first adventures would naturally excite the emulation of their bravest countrymen who were impatient of the gloomy solitude of their woods and mountains Every tide might float down the Elbe whole fleets of canoes filled with hardy and intrepid associates who aspired to behold the unbounded prospect of the ocean and to taste the wealth and luxury of unknown worlds It should seem probable however that the most numerous auxiliaries of the Saxons were furnished by the nations who dwelt along the shores of the Baltic They possessed arms and ships the art of navigation and the habits of naval war but the difficulty of issuing through the northern columns of Hercules one hundred three which during several months of the year are obstructed with ice confined their skill and courage within the limits of a spacious lake The rumor of the successful armaments which sailed from the mouth of the Elbe would soon provoke them to cross the narrow isthmus of Sleswig and to launch their vessels on the great sea The various troops of pirates and adventurers who fought under the same standard were insensibly united in a permanent society at first of rapine and afterwards of government A military confederation was gradually moulded into a national body by the gentle operation of marriage and consanguinity and the adjacent tribes who solicited the alliance accepted the name and laws of the Saxons If the fact were not established by the most unquestionable evidence we should appear to abuse the credulity of our readers by the description of the vessels in which the Saxon pirates ventured to sport in the waves of the German Ocean the British Channel and the Bay of Biscay The keel of their large flat bottomed boats were framed of light timber but the sides and upper works consisted only of wicker with a covering of strong hides one hundred four In the course of their slow and distant navigations they must always have been exposed to the danger and very frequently to the misfortune of shipwreck and the naval annals of the Saxons were undoubtedly filled with the accounts of the losses which they sustained on the coasts of Britain and Gaul But the daring spirit of the pirates braved the perils both of the sea and of the shore their skill was confirmed by the habits of enterprise the meanest of their mariners was alike capable of handling an oar of rearing a sail or of conducting a vessel and the Saxons rejoiced in the appearance of a tempest which concealed their design and dispersed the fleets of the enemy one hundred five After they had acquired an accurate knowledge of the maritime provinces of the West they extended the scene of their depredations and the most sequestered places had no reason to presume on their security The Saxon boats drew so little water that they could easily proceed fourscore or a hundred miles up the great rivers their weight was so inconsiderable that they were transported on wagons from one river to another and the pirates who had entered the mouth of the Seine or of the Rhine might descend with the rapid stream of the Rhone into the Mediterranean Under the reign of Valentinian the maritime provinces of Gaul were afflicted by the Saxons a military count was stationed for the defence of the sea coast or Armorican limit and that officer who found his strength or his abilities unequal to the task implored the assistance of Severus master general of the infantry The Saxons surrounded and outnumbered were forced to relinquish their spoil and to yield a select band of their tall and robust youth to serve in the Imperial armies They stipulated only a safe and honorable retreat and the condition was readily granted by the Roman general who meditated an act of perfidy one hundred six imprudent as it was inhuman while a Saxon remained alive and in arms to revenge the fate of their countrymen The premature eagerness of the infantry who were secretly posted in a deep valley betrayed the ambuscade and they would perhaps have fallen the victims of their own treachery if a large body of cuirassiers alarmed by the noise of the combat had not hastily advanced to extricate their companions and to overwhelm the undaunted valor of the Saxons Some of the prisoners were saved from the edge of the sword to shed their blood in the amphitheatre and the orator Symmachus complains that twenty nine of those desperate savages by strangling themselves with their own hands had disappointed the amusement of the public Yet the polite and philosophic citizens of Rome were impressed with the deepest horror when they were informed that the Saxons consecrated to the gods the tithe of their human spoil and that they ascertained by lot the objects of the barbarous sacrifice one hundred seven Footnote one hundred one At the

rude ancestors have insensibly vanished in the light of science and philosophy one hundred eight The present age is satisfied with the simple and rational opinion that the islands of Great Britain and Ireland were gradually peopled from the adjacent continent of Gaul From the coast of Kent to the extremity of Caithness and Ulster the memory of a Celtic origin was distinctly preserved in the perpetual resemblance of language of religion and of manners and the peculiar characters of the British tribes might be naturally ascribed to the influence of accidental and local circumstances one hundred nine The Roman Province was reduced to the state of civilized and peaceful servitude the rights of savage freedom were contracted to the narrow limits of Caledonia The inhabitants of that northern region were divided as early as the reign of Constantine between the two great tribes of the Scots and of the Picts one hundred ten who have since experienced a very different fortune The power and almost the memory of the Picts have been extinguished by their successful rivals and the Scots after maintaining for ages the dignity of an independent kingdom have multiplied by an equal and voluntary union the honors of the English name The hand of nature had contributed to mark the ancient distinctions of the Scots and Picts The former were the men of the hills and the latter those of the plain The eastern coast of Caledonia may be considered as a level and fertile country which even in a rude state of tillage was capable of producing a considerable quantity of corn and the epithet of cruitnich or wheat eaters expressed the contempt or envy of the carnivorous highlander The cultivation of the earth might introduce a more accurate separation of property and the habits of a sedentary life but the love of arms and rapine was still the ruling passion of the Picts and their warriors who stripped themselves for a day of battle were distinguished in the eyes of the Romans by the strange fashion of painting their naked bodies with gaudy colors and fantastic figures The western part of Caledonia irregularly rises into wild and barren hills which scarcely repay the toil of the husbandman and are most profitably used for the pasture of cattle The highlanders were condemned to the occupations of shepherds and hunters and as they seldom were fixed to any permanent habitation they acquired the expressive name of Scots which in the Celtic tongue is said to be equivalent to that of wanderers or vagrants The inhabitants of a barren land were urged to seek a fresh supply of food in the waters The deep lakes and bays which intersect their country are plentifully supplied with fish and they gradually ventured to cast their nets in the waves of the ocean The vicinity of the Hebrides so profusely scattered along the western coast of Scotland tempted their curiosity and improved their skill and they acquired by slow degrees the art or rather the habit of managing their boats in a tempestuous sea and of steering their nocturnal course by the light of the well known stars The two bold headlands of Caledonia almost touch the shores of a spacious island which obtained from its luxuriant vegetation the epithet of Green and has preserved with a slight alteration the name of Erin or Ierne or Ireland It is probable that in some remote period of antiquity the fertile plains of Ulster received a colony of hungry Scots and that the strangers of the North who had dared to encounter the arms of the legions spread their conquests over the savage and unwarlike natives of a solitary island It is certain that in the declining age of the Roman empire Caledonia Ireland and the Isle of Man were inhabited by the Scots and that the kindred tribes who were often associated in military enterprise were deeply affected by the various accidents of their mutual fortunes They long cherished the lively tradition of their common name and origin and the missionaries of the Isle of Saints who diffused the light of Christianity over North Britain established the vain opinion that their Irish countrymen were the natural as well as spiritual fathers of the Scottish race The loose and obscure tradition has been preserved by the venerable Bede who scattered some rays of light over the darkness of the eighth century On this slight foundation a huge superstructure of fable was gradually reared by the bards and the monks two orders of men who equally abused the privilege of fiction The Scottish nation with mistaken pride adopted their Irish

was transplanted A D three hundred twenty from Ireland to Caledonia is built on a conjectural supplement to the Erse poetry and the feeble evidence of Richard of Cirencester a monk of the fourteenth century The lively spirit of the learned and ingenious antiquarian has tempted him to forget the nature of a question which he so vehemently debates and so absolutely decides Note This controversy has not slumbered since the days of Gibbon We have strenuous advocates of the Phoenician origin of the Irish and each of the old theories with several new ones maintains its partisans It would require several pages fairly to bring down the dispute to our own days and perhaps we should be no nearer to any satisfactory theory than Gibbon was Chapter XXV Reigns Of Jovian And Valentinian Division Of The Empire Part V Six years after the death of Constantine the destructive inroads of the Scots and Picts required the presence of his youngest son who reigned in the Western empire Constans visited his British dominions but we may form some estimate of the importance of his achievements by the language of panegyric which celebrates only his triumph over the elements or in other words the good fortune of a safe and easy passage from the port of Boulogne to the harbor of Sandwich one hundred twelve The calamities which the afflicted provincials continued to experience from foreign war and domestic tyranny were aggravated by the feeble and corrupt administration of the eunuchs of Constantius and the transient relief which they might obtain from the virtues of Julian was soon lost by the absence and death of their benefactor The sums of gold and silver which had been painfully collected or liberally transmitted for the payment of the troops were intercepted by the avarice of the commanders discharges or at least exemptions from the military service were publicly sold the distress of the soldiers who were injuriously deprived of their legal and scanty subsistence provoked them to frequent desertion the nerves of discipline were relaxed and the highways were infested with robbers one hundred thirteen The oppression of the good and the impunity of the wicked equally contributed to diffuse through the island a spirit of discontent and revolt and every ambitious subject every desperate exile might entertain a reasonable hope of subverting the weak and distracted government of Britain The hostile tribes of the North who detested the pride and power of the King of the World suspended their domestic feuds and the Barbarians of the land and sea the Scots the Picts and the Saxons spread themselves with rapid and irresistible fury from the wall of Antoninus to the shores of Kent Every production of art and nature every object of convenience and luxury which they were incapable of creating by labor or procuring by trade was accumulated in the rich and fruitful province of Britain one hundred fourteen A philosopher may deplore the eternal discords of the human race but he will confess that the desire of spoil is a more rational provocation than the vanity of conquest From the age of Constantine to the Plantagenets this rapacious spirit continued to instigate the poor and hardy Caledonians but the same people whose generous humanity seems to inspire the songs of Ossian was disgraced by a savage ignorance of the virtues of peace and of the laws of war Their southern neighbors have felt and perhaps exaggerated the cruel depredations of the Scots and Picts one hundred fifteen and a valiant tribe of Caledonia the Attacotti one hundred sixteen the enemies and afterwards the soldiers of Valentinian are accused by an eye witness of delighting in the taste of human flesh When they hunted the woods for prey it is said that they attacked the shepherd rather than his flock and that they curiously selected the most delicate and brawny parts both of males and females which they prepared for their horrid repasts one hundred seventeen If in the neighborhood of the commercial and literary town of Glasgow a race of cannibals has really existed we may contemplate in the period of the Scottish history the opposite extremes of savage and civilized life Such reflections tend to enlarge the circle of our ideas and to encourage the pleasing hope that New Zealand may produce in some future age the Hume of the Southern Hemisphere Footnote

expeditions If he did not how could he be an eye witness of this practice The Attacotti in Gaul must have been in the service of Rome Were they permitted to indulge these cannibal propensities at the expense not of the flocks but of the shepherds of the provinces These sanguinary trophies of plunder would scarce y have been publicly exhibited in a Roman city or a Roman camp I must leave the hereditary pride of our northern neighbors at issue with the veracity of saint Jerom Every messenger who escaped across the British Channel conveyed the most melancholy and alarming tidings to the ears of Valentinian and the emperor was soon informed that the two military commanders of the province had been surprised and cut off by the Barbarians Severus count of the domestics was hastily despatched and as suddenly recalled by the court of Treves The representations of Jovinus served only to indicate the greatness of the evil and after a long and serious consultation the defence or rather the recovery of Britain was intrusted to the abilities of the brave Theodosius The exploits of that general the father of a line of emperors have been celebrated with peculiar complacency by the writers of the age but his real merit deserved their applause and his nomination was received by the army and province as a sure presage of approaching victory He seized the favorable moment of navigation and securely landed the numerous and veteran bands of the Heruli and Batavians the Jovians and the Victors In his march from Sandwich to London Theodosius defeated several parties of the Barbarians released a multitude of captives and after distributing to his soldiers a small portion of the spoil established the fame of disinterested justice by the restitution of the remainder to the rightful proprietors The citizens of London who had almost despaired of their safety threw open their gates and as soon as Theodosius had obtained from the court of Treves the important aid of a military lieutenant and a civil governor he executed with wisdom and vigor the laborious task of the deliverance of Britain The vagrant soldiers were recalled to their standard an edict of amnesty dispelled the public apprehensions and his cheerful example alleviated the rigor of martial discipline The scattered and desultory warfare of the Barbarians who infested the land and sea deprived him of the glory of a signal victory but the prudent spirit and consummate art of the Roman general were displayed in the operations of two campaigns which successively rescued every part of the province from the hands of a cruel and rapacious enemy The splendor of the cities and the security of the fortifications were diligently restored by the paternal care of Theodosius who with a strong hand confined the trembling Caledonians to the northern angle of the island and perpetuated by the name and settlement of the new province of Valentia the glories of the reign of Valentinian one hundred eighteen The voice of poetry and panegyric may add perhaps with some degree of truth that the unknown regions of Thule were stained with the blood of the Picts that the oars of Theodosius dashed the waves of the Hyperborean ocean and that the distant Orkneys were the scene of his naval victory over the Saxon pirates one hundred nineteen He left the province with a fair as well as splendid reputation and was immediately promoted to the rank of master general of the cavalry by a prince who could applaud without envy the merit of his servants In the important station of the Upper Danube

Statius Silv v two with his real character Tacit in Vit Agricol c sixteen III The prince who refuses to be the judge instructs the people to consider him as the accomplice of his ministers The military command of Africa had been long exercised by Count Romanus and his abilities were not inadequate to his station but as sordid interest was the sole motive of his conduct he acted on most occasions as if he had been the enemy of the province and the friend of the Barbarians of the desert The three flourishing cities of Oea Leptis and Sobrata which under the name of Tripoli had long constituted a federal union one hundred twenty were obliged for the first time to shut their gates against a hostile invasion several of their most honorable citizens were surprised and massacred the villages and even the suburbs were pillaged and the vines and fruit trees of that rich territory were extirpated by the malicious savages of Getulia The unhappy provincials implored the protection of Romanus but they soon found that their military governor was not less cruel and rapacious than the Barbarians As they were incapable of furnishing the four thousand camels and the exorbitant present which he required before he would march to the assistance of Tripoli his demand was equivalent to a refusal and he might justly be accused as the author of the public calamity In the annual assembly of the three cities they nominated two deputies to lay at the feet of Valentinian the customary offering of a gold victory and to accompany this tribute of duty rather than of gratitude with their humble complaint that they were ruined by the enemy and betrayed by their governor If the severity of Valentinian had been rightly directed it would have fallen on the guilty head of Romanus But the count long exercised in the arts of corruption had despatched a swift and trusty messenger to secure the venal friendship of Remigius master of the offices The wisdom of the Imperial council was deceived by artifice and their honest indignation was cooled by delay At length when the repetition of complaint had been justified by the repetition of public misfortunes the notary Palladius was sent from the court of Treves to examine the state of Africa and the conduct of Romanus The rigid impartiality of Palladius was easily disarmed he was tempted to reserve for himself a part of the public treasure which he brought with him for the payment of the troops and from the moment that he was conscious of his own guilt he could no longer refuse to attest the innocence and merit of the count The charge of the Tripolitans was declared to be false and frivolous and Palladius himself was sent back from Treves to Africa with a special commission to discover and prosecute the authors of this impious conspiracy against the representatives of the sovereign His inquiries were managed with so much dexterity and success that he compelled the citizens of Leptis who had sustained a recent siege of eight days to contradict the truth of their own decrees and to censure the behavior of their own deputies A bloody sentence was pronounced without hesitation by the rash and headstrong cruelty of Valentinian The president of Tripoli who had presumed to pity the distress of the province was publicly executed at Utica four distinguished citizens were put to death as the accomplices of the imaginary fraud and the tongues of two others were cut out by the express order of the emperor Romanus elated by impunity and irritated by resistance was still continued in the military command till the Africans were provoked by his avarice to join the rebellious standard of Firmus the Moor one hundred twenty one Footnote one hundred twenty Ammianus frequently mentions their concilium annuum legitimum c Leptis and Sabrata are long since ruined but the city of Oea the native country of Apuleius still flourishes under the provincial denomination of Tripoli See Cellarius Geograph Antiqua tom ii part ii p eighty one D Anville Geographie Ancienne tom iii p seventy one seventy two and Marmol Arrique tom ii p five hundred sixty two Footnote one hundred twenty one Ammian xviii six Tillemont Hist des Empereurs tom v p twenty five six hundred seventy six has discussed the chronological difficulties of the history of Count Romanus His father Nabal was one of the richest and most powerful of the Moorish princes who acknowledged the supremacy of Rome But as he left either by his wives or concubines a very numerous posterity the wealthy inheritance was eagerly disputed and Zamma one of his sons was slain in a domestic quarrel by his brother Firmus The implacable zeal with which Romanus prosecuted the legal revenge of this murder could be ascribed only to a motive of avarice or personal hatred but on this occasion his claims were just his influence was weighty and Firmus clearly understood that he must either present his neck to the executioner or appeal from the sentence of the Imperial consistory to his sword and to the people one hundred twenty two He was received as the deliverer of his country and as soon as it appeared that Romanus was formidable only to a submissive province the tyrant of Africa became the object of universal contempt The ruin of Caesarea which was plundered and burnt by the licentious Barbarians convinced the refractory cities of the danger of resistance the power of Firmus was established at least in the provinces of Mauritania and Numidia and it seemed to be his only doubt whether he should assume the diadem of a Moorish king or the purple of a Roman emperor But the imprudent and unhappy Africans soon discovered that in this rash insurrection they had not sufficiently consulted their own strength or the abilities of their leader Before he could procure any certain intelligence that the emperor of the West had fixed the choice of a general or that a fleet of transports was collected at the mouth of the Rhone he was suddenly informed that the great Theodosius with a small band of veterans had landed near Igilgilis or Gigeri on the African coast and the timid usurper sunk under the ascendant of virtue and military genius Though Firmus possessed arms and treasures his despair of victory immediately reduced him to the use of those arts which in the same country and in a similar situation had formerly been practised by the crafty Jugurtha He attempted to deceive by an apparent submission the vigilance of the Roman general to seduce the fidelity of his troops and to protract the duration of the war by successively engaging the independent tribes of Africa to espouse his quarrel or to protect his flight Theodosius imitated the example and obtained the success of his predecessor Metellus When Firmus in the character of a suppliant accused his own rashness and humbly solicited the clemency of the emperor the lieutenant of Valentinian received and dismissed him with a friendly embrace but he diligently required the useful and substantial pledges of a sincere repentance nor could he be persuaded by the assurances of peace to suspend for an instant the operations of an active war A dark conspiracy was detected by the penetration of Theodosius and he satisfied without much reluctance the public indignation which he had secretly excited Several of the guilty accomplices of Firmus were abandoned according to ancient custom to the tumult of a military execution many more by the amputation of both their hands continued to exhibit an instructive spectacle of horror the hatred of the rebels was accompanied with fear and the fear of the Roman soldiers was mingled with respectful admiration Amidst the boundless plains of Getulia and the innumerable valleys of Mount Atlas it was impossible to prevent the escape of Firmus and if the usurper could have tired the patience of his antagonist he would have secured his person in the depth of some remote solitude and expected the hopes of a future revolution He was subdued by the perseverance of Theodosius who had formed an inflexible determination that the war should end only by the death of the tyrant and that every nation of Africa which presumed to support his cause should be involved in his ruin At the head of a small body of troops which seldom exceeded three thousand five hundred men the Roman general advanced with a steady prudence devoid of rashness or of fear into the heart of a country where he was sometimes attacked by armies of twenty thousand Moors The boldness of his charge dismayed the irregular Barbarians they were disconcerted by his seasonable and orderly retreats they were continually baffled by the unknown resources of the military art and they felt and confessed the just superiority which was assumed by the leader of a civilized nation When Theodosius entered the extensive dominions of Igmazen king of the Isaflenses the haughty savage required in words of defiance his name and the object of his expedition I am replied the stern and disdainful count I am the general of Valentinian the lord of the world who has sent me hither to pursue and punish a desperate robber Deliver him instantly into my hands and be assured that if thou dost not obey the commands of my invincible sovereign thou and the people over whom thou reignest shall be utterly extirpated one hundred twenty twoa As soon as Igmazen was satisfied that his enemy had strength and resolution to execute the fatal menace he consented to purchase a necessary peace by the sacrifice of a guilty fugitive The guards that were placed to secure the person of Firmus deprived him of the hopes of escape and the Moorish tyrant after wine had extinguished the sense of danger disappointed the insulting triumph of the Romans by strangling himself in the night His dead body the only present which Igmazen could offer to the conqueror was carelessly thrown upon a camel and Theodosius leading back his victorious troops to Sitifi was saluted by the warmest acclamations of joy and loyalty one hundred twenty three Footnote one hundred twenty two The Chronology of Ammianus is loose and obscure and Orosius i vii c thirty three p

narrative is perplexed by the want of chronological and geographical landmarks Africa had been lost by the vices of Romanus it was restored by the virtues of Theodosius and our curiosity may be usefully directed to the inquiry of the respective treatment which the two generals received from the Imperial court The authority of Count Romanus had been suspended by the master general of the cavalry and he was committed to safe and honorable custody till the end of the war His crimes were proved by the most authentic evidence and the public expected with some impatience the decree of severe justice But the partial and powerful favor of Mellobaudes encouraged him to challenge his legal judges to obtain repeated delays for the purpose of procuring a crowd of friendly witnesses and finally to cover his guilty conduct by the additional guilt of fraud and forgery About the same time the restorer of Britain and Africa on a vague suspicion that his name and services were superior to the rank of a subject was ignominiously beheaded at Carthage Valentinian no longer reigned and the death of Theodosius as well as the impunity of Romanus may justly be imputed to the arts of the ministers who abused the confidence and deceived the inexperienced youth of his sons one hundred twenty four Footnote one hundred twenty four Ammian xxviii four Orosius l vii c thirty three p five hundred fifty one five hundred fifty two Jerom in Chron p one hundred eighty seven If the geographical accuracy of Ammianus had been fortunately bestowed on the British exploits of Theodosius we should have traced with eager curiosity the distinct and domestic footsteps of his march But the tedious enumeration of the unknown and uninteresting tribes of Africa may be reduced to the general remark that they were all of the swarthy race of the Moors that they inhabited the back settlements of the Mauritanian and Numidian province the country as they have since been termed by the Arabs of dates and of locusts one hundred twenty five and that as the Roman power declined in Africa the boundary of civilized manners and cultivated land was insensibly contracted Beyond the utmost limits of the Moors the vast and inhospitable desert of the South extends above a thousand miles to the banks of the Niger The ancients who had a very faint and imperfect knowledge of the great peninsula of Africa were sometimes tempted to believe that the torrid zone must ever remain destitute of inhabitants one hundred twenty six and they sometimes amused their fancy by filling the vacant space with headless men or rather monsters one hundred twenty seven with horned and cloven footed satyrs one hundred twenty eight with fabulous centaurs one hundred twenty nine and with human pygmies who waged a bold and doubtful warfare against the cranes one hundred thirty Carthage would have trembled at the strange intelligence that the countries on either side of the equator were filled with innumerable nations who differed only in their color from the ordinary appearance of the human species and the subjects of the Roman empire might have anxiously expected that the swarms of Barbarians which issued from the North would soon be encountered from the South by new swarms of Barbarians equally fierce and equally formidable These gloomy terrors would indeed have been dispelled by a more intimate acquaintance with the character of their African enemies The inaction of the negroes does not seem to be the effect either of their virtue or of their pusillanimity They indulge like the rest of mankind their passions and appetites and the adjacent tribes are engaged in frequent acts of hostility one hundred thirty one But their rude ignorance has never invented any effectual weapons of defence or of destruction they appear incapable of forming any extensive plans of government or conquest and the obvious inferiority of their mental faculties has been discovered and abused by the nations of the temperate zone Sixty thousand blacks are annually embarked from the coast of Guinea never to return to their native country but they are embarked in chains one hundred thirty two and

treaty which saved the army of Jovian had been faithfully executed on the side of the Romans and as they had solemnly renounced the sovereignty and alliance of Armenia and Iberia those tributary kingdoms were exposed without protection to the arms of the Persian monarch one hundred thirty three Sapor entered the Armenian territories at the head of a formidable host of cuirassiers of archers and of mercenary foot but it was the invariable practice of Sapor to mix war and negotiation and to consider falsehood and perjury as the most powerful instruments of regal policy He affected to praise the prudent and moderate conduct of the king of Armenia and the unsuspicious Tiranus was persuaded by the repeated assurances of insidious friendship to deliver his person into the hands of a faithless and cruel enemy In the midst of a splendid entertainment he was bound in chains of silver as an honor due to the blood of the Arsacides and after a short confinement in the Tower of Oblivion at Ecbatana he was released from the miseries of life either by his own dagger or by that of an assassin one hundred thirty threea The kingdom of Armenia was reduced to the state of a Persian province the administration was shared between a distinguished satrap and a favorite eunuch and Sapor marched without delay to subdue the martial spirit of the Iberians Sauromaces who reigned in that country by the permission of the emperors was expelled by a superior force and as an insult on the majesty of Rome the king of kings placed a diadem on the head of his abject vassal Aspacuras The city of Artogerassa one hundred thirty four was the only place of Armenia one hundred thirty foura which presumed to resist the efforts of his arms The treasure deposited in that strong fortress tempted the avarice of Sapor but the danger of Olympias the wife or widow of the Armenian king excited the public compassion and animated the desperate valor of her subjects and soldiers one hundred thirty fourb The Persians were surprised and repulsed under the walls of Artogerassa by a bold and well concerted sally of the besieged But the forces of Sapor were continually renewed and increased the hopeless courage of the garrison was exhausted the strength of the walls yielded to the assault and the proud conqueror after wasting the rebellious city with fire and sword led away captive an unfortunate queen who in a more auspicious hour had been the destined bride of the son of Constantine one hundred thirty five Yet if Sapor already triumphed in the easy conquest of two dependent kingdoms he soon felt that a country is unsubdued as long as the minds of the people are actuated by a hostile and contumacious spirit The satraps whom he was obliged to trust embraced the first opportunity of regaining the affection of their countrymen and of signalizing their immortal hatred to the Persian name Since the conversion of the Armenians and Iberians these nations considered the Christians as the favorites and the Magians as the adversaries of the Supreme Being the influence of the clergy over a superstitious people was uniformly exerted in the cause of Rome and as long as the successors of Constantine disputed with those of Artaxerxes the sovereignty of the intermediate provinces the religious connection always threw a decisive advantage into the scale of the empire A numerous and active party acknowledged Para the son of Tiranus as the lawful sovereign of Armenia and his title to the throne was deeply rooted in the hereditary succession of five hundred years By the unanimous consent of the Iberians the country was equally divided between the rival princes and Aspacuras who owed his diadem to the choice of Sapor was obliged to declare that his regard for his children who were detained as hostages by the tyrant was the only consideration which prevented him from openly renouncing the alliance of Persia The emperor Valens who respected the obligations of the treaty and who was apprehensive of involving the East in a dangerous war ventured with slow and cautious measures to support the Roman party in the kingdoms of Iberia and Armenia one hundred thirty fivea Twelve legions established the authority of Sauromaces on the banks of the Cyrus The Euphrates was protected by the valor of Arintheus A powerful army under the command of Count Trajan and of Vadomair king of the Alemanni fixed their camp on the confines of Armenia But they were strictly enjoined not to commit the first hostilities which might be understood as a breach of the treaty and such was the implicit obedience of the Roman general that they retreated with exemplary patience under a shower of Persian arrows till they had clearly acquired a just title to an honorable and legitimate victory Yet these appearances of war insensibly subsided in a vain and tedious negotiation The contending parties supported their claims by mutual reproaches of perfidy and ambition and it should seem that the original treaty was expressed in very obscure terms since they were reduced to the necessity of making their inconclusive appeal to the partial testimony of the generals of the two nations who had assisted at the negotiations one hundred thirty six The invasion of the Goths and Huns which soon afterwards shook the foundations of the Roman empire exposed the provinces of Asia to the arms of Sapor But the declining age and perhaps the infirmities of the monarch suggested new maxims of tranquillity and moderation His death which happened in the full maturity of a reign of seventy years changed in a moment the court and councils of Persia and their attention was most probably engaged by domestic troubles and the distant efforts of a Carmanian war one hundred thirty seven The remembrance of ancient injuries was lost in the enjoyment of peace The kingdoms of Armenia and Iberia were permitted by the mutual though tacit consent of both empires to resume their doubtful neutrality In the first years of the reign of Theodosius a Persian embassy arrived at Constantinople to excuse the unjustifiable measures of the former reign and to offer as the tribute of friendship

disgraceful correspondence with the assassin of his father and the enemy of his country Under the specious pretence of consulting with the emperor on the subject of their common interest Para was persuaded to descend from the mountains of Armenia where his party was in arms and to trust his independence and safety to the discretion of a perfidious court The king of Armenia for such he appeared in his own eyes and in those of his nation was received with due honors by the governors of the provinces through which he passed but when he arrived at Tarsus in Cilicia his progress was stopped under various pretences his motions were watched with respectful vigilance and he gradually discovered that he was a prisoner in the hands of the Romans Para suppressed his indignation dissembled his fears and after secretly preparing his escape mounted on horseback with three hundred of his faithful followers The officer stationed at the door of his apartment immediately communicated his flight to the consular of Cilicia who overtook him in the suburbs and endeavored without success to dissuade him from prosecuting his rash and dangerous design A legion was ordered to pursue the royal fugitive but the pursuit of infantry could not be very alarming to a body of light cavalry and upon the first cloud of arrows that was discharged into the air they retreated with precipitation to the gates of Tarsus After an incessant march of two days and two nights Para and his Armenians reached the banks of the Euphrates but the passage of the river which they were obliged to swim one hundred thirty eightb was attended with some delay and some loss The country was alarmed and the two roads which were only separated by an interval of three miles had been occupied by a thousand archers on horseback under the command of a count and a tribune Para must have yielded to superior force if the accidental arrival of a friendly traveller had not revealed the danger and the means of escape A dark and almost impervious path securely conveyed the Armenian troop through the thicket and Para had left behind him the count and the tribune while they patiently expected his approach along the public highways They returned to the Imperial court to excuse their want of diligence or success and seriously alleged that the king of Armenia who was a skilful magician had transformed himself and his followers and passed before their eyes under a borrowed shape one hundred thirty eightc After his return to his native kingdom Para still continued to profess himself the friend and ally of the Romans but the Romans had injured him too deeply ever to forgive and the secret sentence of his death was signed in the council of Valens The execution of the bloody deed was committed to the subtle prudence of Count Trajan and he had the merit of insinuating himself into the confidence of the credulous prince that he might find an opportunity of stabbing him to the heart Para was invited to a Roman banquet which had been prepared with all the pomp and sensuality of the East the hall resounded with cheerful music and the company was already heated with wine when the count retired for an instant drew his sword and gave the signal of the murder A robust and desperate Barbarian instantly rushed on the king of Armenia and though he bravely defended his life with the first weapon that chance offered to his hand the table of the Imperial general was stained with the royal blood of a guest and an ally Such were the weak and wicked maxims of the Roman administration that to attain a doubtful object of political interest the laws of nations and the sacred rights of hospitality were inhumanly violated in the face of the world one hundred thirty nine Footnote one hundred thirty

peaceful interval of thirty years the Romans secured their frontiers and the Goths extended their dominions The victories of the great Hermanric one hundred forty king of the Ostrogoths and the most noble of the race of the Amali have been compared by the enthusiasm of his countrymen to the exploits of Alexander with this singular and almost incredible difference that the martial spirit of the Gothic hero instead of being supported by the vigor of youth was displayed with glory and success in the extreme period of human life between the age of fourscore and one hundred and ten years The independent tribes were persuaded or compelled to acknowledge the king of the Ostrogoths as the sovereign of the Gothic nation the chiefs of the Visigoths or Thervingi renounced the royal title and assumed the more humble appellation of Judges and among those judges Athanaric Fritigern and Alavivus were the most illustrious by their personal merit as well as by their vicinity to the Roman provinces These domestic conquests which increased the military power of Hermanric enlarged his ambitious designs He invaded the adjacent countries of the North and twelve considerable nations whose names and limits cannot be accurately defined successively yielded to the superiority of the Gothic arms one hundred forty one The Heruli who inhabited the marshy lands near the lake Maeotis were renowned for their strength and agility and the assistance of their light infantry was eagerly solicited and highly esteemed in all the wars of the Barbarians But the active spirit of the Heruli was subdued by the slow and steady perseverance of the Goths and after a bloody action in which the king was slain the remains of that warlike tribe became a useful accession to the camp of Hermanric He then marched against the Venedi unskilled in the use of arms and formidable only by their numbers which filled the wide extent of the plains of modern Poland The victorious Goths who were not inferior in numbers prevailed in the contest by the decisive advantages of exercise and discipline After the submission of the Venedi the conqueror advanced without resistance as far as the confines of the Aestii one hundred forty two an ancient people whose name is still preserved in the province of Esthonia Those distant inhabitants of the Baltic coast were supported by the labors of agriculture enriched by the trade of amber and consecrated by the peculiar worship of the Mother of the Gods But the scarcity of iron obliged the Aestian warriors to content themselves with wooden clubs and the reduction of that wealthy country is ascribed to the prudence rather than to the arms of Hermanric His dominions which extended from the Danube to the Baltic included the native seats and the recent acquisitions of the Goths and he reigned over the greatest part of Germany and Scythia with the authority of a conqueror and sometimes with the cruelty of a tyrant But he reigned over a part of the globe incapable of perpetuating and adorning the glory of its heroes The name of Hermanric is almost buried in oblivion his exploits are imperfectly known and the Romans themselves appeared unconscious of the progress of an aspiring power which threatened the liberty of the North and the peace of the empire one hundred forty three Footnote one hundred forty The concise account of the reign and conquests of Hermanric seems to be one of the valuable fragments which Jornandes c twenty eight borrowed from the Gothic histories of Ablavius or Cassiodorus Footnote one hundred forty one M

peace and if a hostile band sometimes presumed to pass the Roman limit their irregular conduct was candidly ascribed to the ungovernable spirit of the Barbarian youth Their contempt for two new and obscure princes who had been raised to the throne by a popular election inspired the Goths with bolder hopes and while they agitated some design of marching their confederate force under the national standard one hundred forty four they were easily tempted to embrace the party of Procopius and to foment by their dangerous aid the civil discord of the Romans The public treaty might stipulate no more than ten thousand auxiliaries but the design was so zealously adopted by the chiefs of the Visigoths that the army which passed the Danube amounted to the number of thirty thousand men one hundred forty five They marched with the proud confidence that their invincible valor would decide the fate of the Roman empire and the provinces of Thrace groaned under the weight of the Barbarians who displayed the insolence of masters and the licentiousness of enemies But the intemperance which gratified their appetites retarded their progress and before the Goths could receive any certain intelligence of the defeat and death of Procopius they perceived by the hostile state of the country that the civil and military powers were resumed by his successful rival A chain of posts and fortifications skilfully disposed by Valens or the generals of Valens resisted their march prevented their retreat and intercepted their subsistence The fierceness of the Barbarians was tamed and suspended by hunger they indignantly threw down their arms at the feet of the conqueror who offered them food and chains the numerous captives were distributed in all the cities of the East and the provincials who were soon familiarized with their savage appearance ventured by degrees to measure their own strength with these formidable adversaries whose name had so long been the object of their terror The king of Scythia and Hermanric alone could deserve so lofty a title was grieved and exasperated by this national calamity His ambassadors loudly complained at the court of Valens of the infraction of the ancient and solemn alliance which had so long subsisted between the Romans and the Goths They alleged that they had fulfilled the duty of allies by assisting the kinsman and successor of the emperor Julian they required the immediate restitution of the noble captives and they urged a very singular claim that the Gothic generals marching in arms and in hostile array were entitled to the sacred character and privileges of ambassadors The decent but peremptory refusal of these extravagant demands was signified to the Barbarians by Victor master general of the cavalry who expressed with force and dignity the just complaints of the emperor of the East one hundred forty six The negotiation was interrupted and the manly exhortations of Valentinian encouraged his timid brother to vindicate the insulted majesty of the empire one hundred forty seven Footnote one hundred forty four Valens docetur relationibus Ducum gentem Gothorum ea tempestate intactam ideoque

proceeds to describe not the country of the Goths but the peaceful and obedient province of Thrace which was not affected by the war The splendor and magnitude of this Gothic war are celebrated by a contemporary historian one hundred forty eight but the events scarcely deserve the attention of posterity except as the preliminary steps of the approaching decline and fall of the empire Instead of leading the nations of Germany and Scythia to the banks of the Danube or even to the gates of Constantinople the aged monarch of the Goths resigned to the brave Athanaric the danger and glory of a defensive war against an enemy who wielded with a feeble hand the powers of a mighty state A bridge of boats was established upon the Danube the presence of Valens animated his troops and his ignorance of the art of war was compensated by personal bravery and a wise deference to the advice of Victor and Arintheus his masters general of the cavalry and infantry The operations of the campaign were conducted by their skill and experience but they found it impossible to drive the Visigoths from their strong posts in the mountains and the devastation of the plains obliged the Romans themselves to repass the Danube on the approach of winter The incessant rains which swelled the waters of the river produced a tacit suspension of arms and confined the emperor Valens during the whole course of the ensuing summer to his camp of Marcianopolis The third year of the war was more favorable to the Romans and more pernicious to the Goths The interruption of trade deprived the Barbarians of the objects of luxury which they already confounded with the necessaries of life and the desolation of a very extensive tract of country threatened them with the horrors of famine Athanaric was provoked or compelled to risk a battle which he lost in the plains and the pursuit was rendered more bloody by the cruel precaution of the victorious generals who had promised a large reward for the head of every Goth that was brought into the Imperial camp The submission of the Barbarians appeased the resentment of Valens and his council the emperor listened with satisfaction to the flattering and eloquent remonstrance of the senate of Constantinople which assumed for the first time a share in the public deliberations and the same generals Victor and Arintheus who had successfully directed the conduct of the war were empowered to regulate the conditions of peace The freedom of trade which the Goths had hitherto enjoyed was restricted to two cities on the Danube the rashness of their leaders was severely punished by the suppression of their pensions and subsidies and the exception which was stipulated in favor of Athanaric alone was more advantageous than honorable to the Judge of the Visigoths Athanaric who on this occasion appears to have consulted his private interest without expecting the orders of his sovereign supported his own dignity and that of his tribe in the personal interview which was proposed by the ministers of Valens He persisted in his declaration that it was impossible for him without incurring the guilt of perjury ever to set his foot on the territory of the empire and it is more than probable that his regard for the sanctity of an oath was confirmed by the recent and fatal examples of Roman treachery The Danube which separated the dominions of the two independent nations was chosen for the scene of the conference The emperor of the East and the Judge of the Visigoths accompanied by an equal number of armed followers advanced in their respective barges to the middle of the stream After the ratification of the treaty and the delivery of hostages Valens returned in triumph to Constantinople and the Goths remained in a state of tranquillity about six years till they were violently impelled against the Roman empire by an innumerable host of Scythians who appeared to issue from the frozen regions of the North one hundred forty

brother the command of the Lower Danube reserved for his immediate care the defence of the Rhaetian and Illyrian provinces which spread so many hundred miles along the greatest of the European rivers The active policy of Valentinian was continually employed in adding new fortifications to the security of the frontier but the abuse of this policy provoked the just resentment of the Barbarians The Quadi complained that the ground for an intended fortress had been marked out on their territories and their complaints were urged with so much reason and moderation that Equitius master general of Illyricum consented to suspend the prosecution of the work till he should be more clearly informed of the will of his sovereign This fair occasion of injuring a rival and of advancing the fortune of his son was eagerly embraced by the inhuman Maximin the praefect or rather tyrant of Gaul The passions of Valentinian were impatient of control and he credulously listened to the assurances of his favorite that if the government of Valeria and the direction of the work were intrusted to the zeal of his son Marcellinus the emperor should no longer be importuned with the audacious remonstrances of the Barbarians The subjects of Rome and the natives of Germany were insulted by the arrogance of a young and worthless minister who considered his rapid elevation as the proof and reward of his superior merit He affected however to receive the modest application of Gabinius king of the Quadi with some attention and regard but this artful civility concealed a dark and bloody design and the credulous prince was persuaded to accept the pressing invitation of Marcellinus I am at a loss how to vary the narrative of similar crimes or how to relate that in the course of the same year but in remote parts of the empire the inhospitable table of two Imperial generals was stained with the royal blood of two guests and allies inhumanly murdered by their order and in their presence The fate of Gabinius and of Para was the same but the cruel death of their sovereign was resented in a very different manner by the servile temper of the Armenians and the free and daring spirit of the Germans The Quadi were much declined from that formidable power which in the time of Marcus Antoninus had spread terror to the gates of Rome But they still possessed arms and courage their courage was animated by despair and they obtained the usual reenforcement of the cavalry of their Sarmatian allies So improvident was the assassin Marcellinus that he chose the moment when the bravest veterans had been drawn away to suppress the revolt of Firmus and the whole province was exposed with a very feeble defence to the rage of the exasperated Barbarians They invaded Pannonia in the season of harvest unmercifully destroyed every object of plunder which they could not easily transport and either disregarded or demolished the empty fortifications The princess Constantia the daughter of the emperor Constantius and the granddaughter of the great Constantine very narrowly escaped That royal maid who had innocently supported the revolt of Procopius was now the destined wife of the heir of the Western empire She traversed the peaceful province with a splendid and unarmed train Her person was saved from danger and the republic from disgrace by the active zeal of Messala governor of the provinces As soon as he was informed that the village where she stopped only to dine was almost encompassed by the Barbarians he hastily placed her in his own chariot and drove full speed till he reached the gates of Sirmium which were at the distance of six and twenty miles Even Sirmium might not have been secure if the Quadi and Sarmatians had diligently advanced during the general consternation of the magistrates and people Their delay allowed Probus the Praetorian praefect sufficient time to recover his own spirits and to revive the courage of the citizens He skilfully directed their strenuous efforts to repair and strengthen the decayed fortifications and procured the seasonable and effectual assistance of a company of archers to protect the capital of the Illyrian provinces Disappointed in their attempts against the walls of Sirmium the indignant Barbarians turned their arms against the master general of the frontier to whom they unjustly attributed the murder of their king Equitius could bring into the field no more than two legions but they contained the veteran strength of the Maesian and Pannonian bands The obstinacy with which they disputed the vain honors of rank and precedency was the cause of their destruction and while they acted with separate forces and divided councils they were surprised and slaughtered by the active vigor of the Sarmatian horse The success of this invasion provoked the emulation of the bordering tribes and the province of Maesia would infallibly have been lost if young Theodosius the duke or military commander of the frontier had not signalized in the defeat of the public enemy an intrepid genius worthy of his illustrious father and of his future greatness one hundred fifty Footnote one hundred fifty Ammianus xxix

ensuing spring He marched in person with a considerable part of the forces of Gaul from the banks of the Moselle and to the suppliant ambassadors of the Sarmatians who met him on the way he returned a

attested by an ecclesiastical historian one hundred fifty five The empress Severa I relate the fable admitted into her familiar society the lovely Justina the daughter of an Italian governor her admiration of those naked charms which she had often seen in the bath was expressed with such lavish and imprudent praise that the emperor was tempted to introduce a second wife into his bed and his public edict extended to all the subjects of the empire the same domestic privilege which he had assumed for himself But we may be assured from the evidence of reason as well as history that the two marriages of Valentinian with Severa and with Justina were successively contracted and that he used the ancient permission of divorce which was still allowed by the laws though it was condemned by the church Severa was the mother of Gratian who seemed to unite every claim which could entitle him to the undoubted succession of the Western empire He was the eldest son of a monarch whose glorious reign had confirmed the free and honorable choice of his fellow soldiers Before he had attained the ninth year of his age the royal youth received from the hands of his indulgent father the purple robe and diadem with the title of Augustus the election was solemnly ratified by the consent and applause of the armies of Gaul one hundred fifty six and the name of Gratian was added to the names of Valentinian and Valens in all the legal transactions of the Roman government By his marriage with the granddaughter of Constantine the son of Valentinian acquired all the hereditary rights of the Flavian family which in a series of three Imperial generations were sanctified by time religion and the reverence of the people At the death of his father the royal youth was in the seventeenth year of his age and his virtues already justified the favorable opinion of the army and the people But Gratian resided without apprehension in the palace of Treves whilst at the distance of many hundred miles Valentinian suddenly expired in the camp of Bregetio The passions which had been so long suppressed by the presence of a master immediately revived in the Imperial council and the ambitious design of reigning in the name of an infant was artfully executed by Mellobaudes and Equitius who commanded the attachment of the Illyrian and Italian bands They contrived the most honorable pretences to remove the popular leaders and the troops of Gaul who might have asserted the claims of the lawful successor they suggested the necessity of extinguishing the hopes of foreign and domestic enemies by a bold and decisive measure The empress Justina who had been left in a palace about one hundred miles from Bregetio was respectively invited to appear in the camp with the son of the deceased emperor On the sixth day after the death of Valentinian the infant prince of the same name who was only four years old was shown in the arms of his mother to the legions and solemnly invested by military acclamation with the titles and ensigns of supreme power The impending dangers of a civil war were seasonably prevented by the wise and moderate conduct of the emperor Gratian He cheerfully accepted the choice of the army declared that he should always consider the son of Justina as a brother not as a rival and advised the empress with her son Valentinian to fix their residence at Milan in the fair and peaceful province of Italy while he assumed the more arduous command of the countries beyond the Alps Gratian dissembled his resentment till he could safely punish or disgrace the authors of the conspiracy and though he uniformly behaved with tenderness and regard to his infant colleague he gradually confounded in the administration of the Western empire the office of a guardian with the authority of a sovereign The government of the Roman world was exercised in the united names of Valens and his two nephews but the feeble emperor of the East who succeeded to the rank of his elder brother never obtained any weight or influence in the councils of the West one hundred fifty seven Footnote one hundred fifty five Socrates l iv c thirty one is the only original

Character And Success Peace And Settlement Of The Goths In the second year of the reign of Valentinian and Valens on the morning of the twenty first day of July the greatest part of the Roman world was shaken by a violent and destructive earthquake The impression was communicated to the waters the shores of the Mediterranean were left dry by the sudden retreat of the sea great quantities of fish were caught with the hand large vessels were stranded on the mud and a curious spectator one amused his eye or rather his fancy by contemplating the various appearance of valleys and mountains which had never since the formation of the globe been exposed to the sun But the tide soon returned with the weight of an immense and irresistible deluge which was severely felt on the coasts of Sicily of Dalmatia of Greece and of Egypt large boats were transported and lodged on the roofs of houses or at the distance of two miles from the shore the people with their habitations were swept away by the waters and the city of Alexandria annually commemorated the fatal day on which fifty thousand persons had lost their lives in the inundation This calamity the report of which was magnified from one province to another astonished and terrified the subjects of Rome and their affrighted imagination enlarged the real extent of a momentary evil They recollected the preceding earthquakes which had subverted the cities of Palestine and Bithynia they considered these alarming strokes as the prelude only of still more dreadful calamities and their fearful vanity was disposed to confound the symptoms of a declining empire and a sinking world two It was the fashion of the times to attribute every remarkable event to the particular will of the Deity the alterations of nature were connected by an invisible chain with the moral and metaphysical opinions of the human mind and the most sagacious divines could distinguish according to the color of their respective prejudices that the establishment of heresy tended to produce an earthquake or that a deluge was the inevitable consequence of the progress of sin and error Without presuming to discuss the truth or propriety of these lofty speculations the historian may content himself with an observation which seems to be justified by experience that man has much more to fear from the passions of his fellow creatures than from the convulsions of the elements three The mischievous effects of an earthquake or deluge a hurricane or the eruption of a volcano bear a very inconsiderable portion to the ordinary calamities of war as they are now moderated by the prudence or humanity of the princes of Europe who amuse their own leisure and exercise the courage of their subjects in the practice of the military art But the laws and manners of modern nations protect the safety and freedom of the vanquished soldier and the peaceful citizen has seldom reason to complain that his life or even his fortune is exposed to the rage of war In the disastrous period of the fall of the Roman empire which may justly be dated from the reign of Valens the happiness and security of each individual were personally attacked and the arts and labors of ages were rudely defaced by the Barbarians of Scythia and Germany The invasion of the Huns precipitated on the provinces of the West the Gothic nation which advanced in less than forty years from the Danube to the Atlantic and opened a way by the success of their arms to the inroads of so many hostile tribes more savage than themselves The original principle of motion was concealed in the remote countries of the North and the curious observation of the pastoral life of the Scythians four or Tartars five will illustrate the latent cause of these destructive emigrations Footnote

ascertain the appetites of a quadruped than the speculations of a philosopher and the savage tribes of mankind as they approach nearer to the condition of animals preserve a stronger resemblance to themselves and to each other The uniform stability of their manners is the natural consequence of the imperfection of their faculties Reduced to a similar situation their wants their desires their enjoyments still continue the same and the influence of food or climate which in a more improved state of society is suspended or subdued by so many moral causes most powerfully contributes to form and to maintain the national character of Barbarians In every age the immense plains of Scythia or Tartary have been inhabited by vagrant tribes of hunters and shepherds whose indolence refuses to cultivate the earth and whose restless spirit disdains the confinement of a sedentary life In every age the Scythians and Tartars have been renowned for their invincible courage and rapid conquests The thrones of Asia have been repeatedly overturned by the shepherds of the North and their arms have spread terror and devastation over the most fertile and warlike countries of Europe six On this occasion as well as on many others the sober historian is forcibly awakened from a pleasing vision and is compelled with some reluctance to confess that the pastoral manners which have been adorned with the fairest attributes of peace and innocence are much better adapted to the fierce and cruel habits of a military life To illustrate this observation I shall now proceed to consider a nation of shepherds and of warriors in the three important articles of I Their diet II Their habitations and III Their exercises The narratives of antiquity are justified by the experience of modern times seven and the banks of the Borysthenes of the Volga or of the Selinga will indifferently present the same uniform spectacle of similar and native manners eight Footnote six Imperium Asiae ter quaesivere

two volumes in fourto Glasgow seventeen sixty three Note Of the various works published since the time of Gibbon which throw fight on the nomadic population of Central Asia may be particularly remarked the Travels and Dissertations of Pallas and above all the very curious work of Bergman Nomadische Streifereyen Riga eighteen oh five M Footnote eight The Uzbecks are the most altered from their primitive manners one By the profession of the Mahometan religion and two By the possession of the cities and harvests of the great Bucharia I The corn or even the rice which constitutes the ordinary and wholesome food of a civilized people can be obtained only by the patient toil of the husbandman Some of the happy savages who dwell between the tropics are plentifully nourished by the liberality of nature but in the climates of the North a nation of shepherds is reduced to their flocks and herds The skilful practitioners of the medical art will determine if they are able to determine how far the temper of the human mind may be affected by the use of animal or of vegetable food and whether the common association of carniverous and cruel deserves to be considered in any other light than that of an innocent perhaps a salutary prejudice of humanity nine Yet if it be true that the sentiment of compassion is imperceptibly weakened by the sight and practice of domestic cruelty we may observe that the horrid objects which are disguised by the arts of European refinement are exhibited in their naked and most disgusting simplicity in the tent of a Tartarian shepherd The ox or the sheep are slaughtered by the same hand from which they were accustomed to receive their daily food and the bleeding limbs are served with very little preparation on the table of their unfeeling murderer In the military profession and especially in the conduct of a numerous army the exclusive use of animal food appears to be productive of the most solid advantages Corn is a bulky and perishable commodity and the large magazines which are indispensably necessary for the subsistence of our troops must be slowly transported by the labor of men or horses But the flocks and herds which accompany the march of the Tartars afford a sure and increasing supply of flesh and milk in the far greater part of the uncultivated waste the vegetation of the grass is quick and luxuriant and there are few places so extremely barren that the hardy cattle of the North cannot find some tolerable pasture The supply is multiplied and prolonged by the undistinguishing appetite and patient abstinence of the Tartars They indifferently feed on the flesh of those animals that have been killed for the table or have died of disease Horseflesh which in every age and country has been proscribed by the civilized nations of Europe and Asia they devour with peculiar greediness and this singular taste facilitates the success of their military operations The active cavalry of Scythia is always followed in their most distant and rapid incursions by an adequate number of spare horses who may be occasionally used either to redouble the speed or to satisfy the hunger of the Barbarians Many are the resources of courage and poverty When the forage round a camp of Tartars is almost consumed they slaughter the greatest part of their cattle and preserve the flesh either smoked or dried in the sun On the sudden emergency of a hasty march they provide themselves with a sufficient quantity of little balls of cheese or rather of hard curd which they occasionally dissolve in water and this unsubstantial diet will support for many days the life and even the spirits of the patient warrior But this extraordinary abstinence which the Stoic would approve and the hermit might envy is commonly succeeded by the most voracious indulgence of appetite The wines of a happier climate are the most grateful present or the most valuable commodity that can be offered to the Tartars and the only example of their industry seems to consist in the art of extracting from mare s milk a fermented liquor which possesses a very strong power of intoxication Like the animals of prey the savages both of the old and new world experience the alternate vicissitudes of famine and plenty and their stomach is inured to sustain without much inconvenience the opposite extremes of hunger and of intemperance Footnote nine Il est certain que les grands mangeurs de viande sont en general cruels et feroces plus que les autres hommes Cette observation est de tous les lieux et de tous les temps la barbarie Angloise est connue c Emile de Rousseau tom i p two hundred seventy four Whatever we may think of the general observation we shall not easily allow the truth of his example The good natured complaints of Plutarch and the pathetic lamentations of Ovid seduce our reason by exciting our sensibility II In the ages of rustic and martial simplicity a people of soldiers and husbandmen are dispersed over the face of an extensive and cultivated country and some time must elapse before the warlike youth of Greece or Italy could be assembled under the same standard either to defend their own confines or to invade the territories of the adjacent tribes The progress of manufactures and commerce insensibly collects a large multitude within the walls of a city but these citizens are no longer soldiers and the arts which adorn and improve the state of civil society corrupt the habits of the military life The pastoral manners of the Scythians seem to unite the different advantages of simplicity and refinement The individuals of the same tribe are constantly assembled but they are assembled in a camp and the native spirit of these dauntless shepherds is animated by mutual support and emulation The houses of the Tartars are no more than small tents of an oval form which afford a cold and dirty habitation for the promiscuous youth of both sexes The palaces of the rich consist of wooden huts of such a size that they may be conveniently fixed on large wagons and drawn by a team perhaps of twenty or thirty oxen The flocks and herds after grazing all day in the adjacent pastures retire on the approach of night within the protection of the camp The necessity of preventing the most mischievous confusion in such a perpetual concourse of men and animals must gradually introduce in the distribution the order and the guard of the encampment the rudiments of the military art As soon as the forage of a certain district is consumed the tribe or rather army of shepherds makes a regular march to some fresh pastures and thus acquires in the ordinary occupations of the pastoral life the practical knowledge of one of the most important and difficult operations of war The choice of stations is regulated by the difference of the seasons in the summer the Tartars advance towards the North and pitch their tents on the banks of a river or at least in the neighborhood of a running stream But in the winter they return to the South and shelter their camp behind some convenient eminence against the winds which are chilled in their passage over the bleak and icy regions of Siberia These manners are admirably adapted to diffuse among the wandering tribes the spirit of emigration and conquest The connection between the people and their territory is of so frail a texture that it may be broken by the slightest accident The camp and not the soil is the native country of the genuine Tartar Within the precincts of that camp his family his companions his property are always included and in the most distant marches he is still surrounded by the objects which are dear or valuable or familiar in his eyes The thirst of rapine the fear or the resentment of injury the impatience of servitude have in every age been sufficient causes to urge the tribes of Scythia boldly to advance into some unknown countries where they might hope to find a more plentiful subsistence or a less formidable enemy The revolutions of the North have frequently determined the fate of the South and in the conflict of hostile nations the victor and the vanquished have alternately drove and been driven from the confines of China to those of Germany ten These great emigrations which have been sometimes executed with almost incredible diligence were rendered more easy by the peculiar nature of the climate It is well known that the cold of Tartary is much more severe than in the midst of the temperate zone might reasonably be expected this uncommon rigor is attributed to the height of the plains which rise especially towards the East more than half a mile above the level of the sea and to the quantity of saltpetre with which the soil is deeply impregnated eleven In the winter season the broad and rapid rivers that discharge their waters into the Euxine the Caspian or the Icy Sea are strongly frozen the fields are covered with a bed of snow and the fugitive or victorious tribes may securely traverse with their families their wagons and their cattle the smooth and hard surface of an immense plain Footnote ten These Tartar emigrations have been discovered by M de Guignes Histoire des Huns tom i ii a skilful and laborious interpreter of the Chinese language who has thus laid open new and important scenes in the history of mankind Footnote eleven A plain in the Chinese Tartary only eighty leagues from the great wall was found by the missionaries to be three thousand geometrical paces above the level of the sea Montesquieu who has used and abused the relations of travellers deduces the revolutions of Asia from this important circumstance that heat and cold weakness and strength touch each other without any temperate zone Esprit des Loix l xvii c three III The pastoral life compared with the labors of agriculture and manufactures is undoubtedly a life of idleness and as the most honorable shepherds of the Tartar race devolve on their captives the domestic management of the cattle their own leisure is seldom disturbed by any servile and assiduous cares But this leisure instead of being devoted to the soft enjoyments of love and harmony is use fully spent in the violent and sanguinary exercise of the chase The plains of Tartary are filled with a strong and serviceable breed of horses which are easily trained for the purposes of war and hunting The Scythians of every age have been celebrated as bold and skilful riders and constant practice had seated them so firmly on horseback that they were supposed by strangers to perform the ordinary duties of civil life to eat to drink and even to sleep without dismounting from their steeds They excel in the dexterous management of the lance the long Tartar bow is drawn with a nervous arm and the weighty arrow is directed to its object with unerring aim and irresistible force These arrows are often pointed against the harmless animals of the desert which increase and multiply in the absence of their most formidable enemy the hare the goat the roebuck the fallow deer the stag the elk and the antelope The vigor and patience both of the men and horses are continually exercised by the fatigues of the chase and the plentiful supply of game contributes to the subsistence and even luxury of a Tartar camp But the exploits of the hunters of Scythia are not confined to the destruction of timid or innoxious beasts they boldly encounter the angry wild boar when he turns against his pursuers excite the sluggish courage of the bear and provoke the fury of the tiger as he slumbers in the thicket Where there is danger there may be glory and the mode of hunting which opens the fairest field to the exertions of valor may justly be considered as the image and as the school of war The general hunting matches the pride and delight of the Tartar princes compose an instructive exercise for their numerous cavalry A circle is drawn of many miles in circumference to encompass the game of an extensive district and the troops that form the circle regularly advance towards a common centre where the captive animals surrounded on every side are abandoned to the darts of the hunters In this march which frequently continues many days the cavalry are obliged to climb the hills to swim the rivers and to wind through the valleys without interrupting the prescribed order of their gradual progress They acquire the habit of directing their eye and their steps to a remote object of preserving their intervals of suspending or accelerating their pace according to the motions of the troops on their right and left and of watching and repeating the signals of their leaders Their leaders study in this practical school the most important lesson of the military art the prompt and accurate judgment of ground of distance and of time To employ against a human enemy the same patience and valor the same skill and discipline is the only alteration which is required in real war and the amusements of the chase serve as a prelude to the conquest of an empire twelve Footnote twelve Petit de la Croix Vie de Gengiscan l iii c six represents the full glory and extent of the Mogul

who unites the Tartar discipline with the laws and learning of China describes Eloge de Moukden p two hundred seventy three two hundred eighty five as a poet the pleasures which he had often enjoyed as a sportsman The political society of the ancient Germans has the appearance of a voluntary alliance of independent warriors The tribes of Scythia distinguished by the modern appellation of Hords assume the form of a numerous and increasing family which in the course of successive generations has been propagated from the same original stock The meanest and most ignorant of the Tartars preserve with conscious pride the inestimable treasure of their genealogy and whatever distinctions of rank may have been introduced by the unequal distribution of pastoral wealth they mutually respect themselves and each other as the descendants of the first founder of the tribe The custom which still prevails of adopting the bravest and most faithful of the captives may countenance the very probable suspicion that this extensive consanguinity is in a great measure legal and fictitious But the useful prejudice which has obtained the sanction of time and opinion produces the effects of truth the haughty Barbarians yield a cheerful and voluntary obedience to the head of their blood and their chief or mursa as the representative of their great father exercises the authority of a judge in peace and of a leader in war In the original state of the pastoral world each of the mursas if we may continue to use a modern appellation acted as the independent chief of a large and separate family and the limits of their peculiar territories were gradually fixed by superior force or mutual consent But the constant operation of various and permanent causes contributed to unite the vagrant Hords into national communities under the command of a supreme head The weak were desirous of support and the strong were ambitious of dominion the power which is the result of union oppressed and collected the divided force of the adjacent tribes and as the vanquished were freely admitted to share the advantages of victory the most valiant chiefs hastened to range themselves and their followers under the formidable standard of a confederate nation The most successful of the Tartar princes assumed the military command to which he was entitled by the superiority either of merit or of power He was raised to the throne by the acclamations of his equals and the title of Khan expresses in the language of the North of Asia the full extent of the regal dignity The right of hereditary succession was long confined to the blood of the founder of the monarchy and at this moment all the Khans who reign from Crimea to the wall of China are the lineal descendants of the renowned Zingis thirteen But as it is the indispensable duty of a Tartar sovereign to lead his warlike subjects into the field the claims of an infant are often disregarded and some royal kinsman distinguished by his age and valor is intrusted with the sword and sceptre of his predecessor Two distinct and regular taxes are levied on the tribes to support the dignity of the national monarch and of their peculiar chief and each of those contributions amounts to the tithe both of their property and of their spoil A Tartar sovereign enjoys the tenth part of the wealth of his people and as his own domestic riches of flocks and herds increase in a much larger proportion he is able plentifully to maintain the rustic splendor of his court to reward the most deserving or the most favored of his followers and to obtain from the gentle influence of corruption the obedience which might be sometimes refused to the stern mandates of authority The manners of his subjects accustomed like himself to blood and rapine might excuse in their eyes such partial acts of tyranny as would excite the horror of a civilized people but the power of a despot has never been acknowledged in the deserts of Scythia The immediate jurisdiction of the khan is confined within the limits of his own tribe and the exercise of his royal prerogative has been moderated by the ancient institution of a national council The Coroulai fourteen or Diet of the Tartars was regularly held in the spring and autumn in the midst of a plain where the princes of the reigning family and the mursas of the respective tribes may conveniently assemble on horseback with their martial and numerous trains and the ambitious monarch who reviewed the strength must consult the inclination of an armed people The rudiments of a feudal government may be discovered in the constitution of the Scythian or Tartar nations but the perpetual conflict of those hostile nations has sometimes terminated in the establishment of a powerful and despotic empire The victor enriched by the tribute and fortified by the arms of dependent kings has spread his conquests over Europe or Asia the successful shepherds of the North have submitted to the confinement of arts of laws and of cities and the introduction of luxury after destroying the freedom of the people has undermined the foundations of the throne fifteen Footnote thirteen See the

the gradual and imperfect discovery of Scythia from the Danube and the confines of Thrace as far as the frozen Maeotis the seat of eternal winter and Mount Caucasus which in the language of poetry was described as the utmost boundary of the earth They celebrated with simple credulity the virtues of the pastoral life seventeen they entertained a more rational apprehension of the strength and numbers of the warlike Barbarians eighteen who contemptuously baffled the immense armament of Darius the son of Hystaspes nineteen The Persian monarchs had extended their western conquests to the banks of the Danube and the limits of European Scythia The eastern provinces of their empire were exposed to the Scythians of Asia the wild inhabitants of the plains beyond the Oxus and the Jaxartes two mighty rivers which direct their course towards the Caspian Sea The long and memorable quarrel of Iran and Touran is still the theme of history or romance the famous perhaps the fabulous valor of the Persian heroes Rustan and Asfendiar was signalized in the defence of their country against the Afrasiabs of the North twenty and the invincible spirit of the same Barbarians resisted on the same ground the victorious arms of Cyrus and Alexander twenty one In the eyes of the Greeks and Persians the real geography of Scythia was bounded on the East by the mountains of Imaus or Caf and their distant prospect of the extreme and inaccessible parts of Asia was clouded by ignorance or perplexed by fiction But those inaccessible regions are the ancient residence of a powerful and civilized nation twenty two which ascends by a probable tradition above forty centuries twenty three and which is able to verify a series of near two thousand years by the perpetual testimony of accurate and contemporary historians twenty four The annals of China twenty five illustrate the state and revolutions of the pastoral tribes which may still be distinguished by the vague appellation of Scythians or Tartars the vassals the enemies and sometimes the conquerors of a great empire whose policy has uniformly opposed the blind and impetuous valor of the Barbarians of the North From the mouth of the Danube to the Sea of Japan the whole longitude of Scythia is about one hundred and ten degrees which in that parallel are equal to more than five thousand miles The latitude of these extensive deserts cannot be so easily or so accurately measured but from the fortieth degree which touches the wall of China we may securely advance above a thousand miles to the northward till our progress is stopped by the excessive cold of Siberia In that dreary climate instead of the animated picture of a Tartar camp the smoke that issues from the earth or rather from the snow betrays the subterraneous dwellings of the Tongouses and the Samoides the want of horses and oxen is imperfectly supplied by the use of reindeer and of large dogs and the conquerors of the earth insensibly degenerate into a race of deformed and diminutive savages who tremble at the sound of arms twenty six Footnote sixteen Abulghasi Khan in the two first parts of his Genealogical History relates the miserable tales and traditions of the Uzbek Tartars concerning the times which preceded the reign of Zingis Note The differences between the various pastoral tribes and nations comprehended by the ancients under the

still a movable camp the villages were thinly scattered more land was employed in pasture than in tillage the exercise of hunting was ordained to clear the country from wild beasts Petcheli where Pekin stands was a desert and the Southern provinces were peopled with Indian savages The dynasty of the Han before Christ two hundred six gave the empire its actual form and extent Footnote twenty three The aera of the Chinese monarchy has been variously fixed from twenty nine fifty two to twenty one thirty two years before Christ and the year twenty six thirty seven has been chosen for the lawful epoch by the authority of the present emperor The difference arises from the uncertain duration of the two first dynasties and the vacant space that lies beyond them as far as the real or fabulous times of Fohi or Hoangti Sematsien dates his authentic chronology from the year eight hundred forty one the thirty six eclipses of Confucius thirty one of which have been verified were

threatened the empire of Rome had been formidable in a much earlier period to the empire of China twenty seven Their ancient perhaps their original seat was an extensive though dry and barren tract of country immediately on the north side of the great wall Their place is at present occupied by the forty nine Hords or Banners of the Mongous a pastoral nation which consists of about two hundred thousand families twenty eight But the valor of the Huns had extended the narrow limits of their dominions and their rustic chiefs who assumed the appellation of Tanjou gradually became the conquerors and the sovereigns of a formidable empire Towards the East their victorious arms were stopped only by the ocean and the tribes which are thinly scattered between the Amoor and the extreme peninsula of Corea adhered with reluctance to the standard of the Huns On the West near the head of the Irtish in the valleys of Imaus they found a more ample space and more numerous enemies One of the lieutenants of the Tanjou subdued in a single expedition twenty six nations the Igours twenty nine distinguished above the Tartar race by the use of letters were in the number of his vassals and by the strange connection of human events the flight of one of those vagrant tribes recalled the victorious Parthians from the invasion of Syria thirty On the side of the North the ocean was assigned as the limit of the power of the Huns Without enemies to resist their progress or witnesses to contradict their vanity they might securely achieve a real or imaginary conquest of the frozen regions of Siberia The Northren Sea was fixed as the remote boundary of their empire But the name of that sea on whose shores the patriot Sovou embraced the life of a shepherd and an exile thirty one may be transferred with much more probability to the Baikal a capacious basin above three hundred miles in length which disdains the modest appellation of a lake thirty two and which actually communicates with the seas of the North by the long course of the Angara the Tongusha and the Jenissea The submission of so many distant nations might flatter the pride of the Tanjou but the valor of the Huns could be rewarded only by the enjoyment of the wealth and luxury of the empire of the South In the third century thirty twoa before the Christian aera a wall of fifteen hundred miles in length was constructed to defend the frontiers of China against the inroads of the Huns thirty three but this stupendous work which holds a conspicuous place in the map of the world has never contributed to the safety of an unwarlike people The cavalry of the Tanjou frequently consisted of two or three hundred thousand men formidable by the matchless dexterity with which they managed their bows and their horses by their hardy patience in supporting the inclemency of the weather and by the incredible speed of their march which was seldom checked by torrents or precipices by the deepest rivers or by the most lofty mountains They spread themselves at once over the face of the country and their rapid impetuosity surprised astonished and disconcerted the grave and elaborate tactics of a Chinese army The emperor Kaoti thirty four a soldier of fortune whose personal merit had raised him to the throne marched against the Huns with those veteran troops which had been trained in the civil wars of China But he was soon surrounded by the Barbarians and after a siege of seven days the monarch hopeless of relief was reduced to purchase his deliverance by an ignominious capitulation The successors of Kaoti whose lives were dedicated to the arts of peace or the luxury of the palace submitted to a more permanent disgrace They too hastily confessed the insufficiency of arms and fortifications They were too easily convinced that while the blazing signals announced on every side the approach of the Huns the Chinese troops who slept with the helmet on their head and the cuirass on their back were destroyed by the incessant labor of ineffectual marches thirty five A regular payment of money and silk was stipulated as the condition of a temporary and precarious peace and the wretched expedient of disguising a real tribute under the names of a gift or subsidy was practised by the emperors of China as well as by those of Rome But there still remained a more disgraceful article of tribute which violated the sacred feelings of humanity and nature The hardships of the savage life which destroy in their infancy the children who are born with a less healthy and robust constitution introduced a remarkable disproportion between the numbers of the two sexes The Tartars are an ugly and even deformed race and while they consider their own women as the instruments of domestic labor their desires or rather their appetites are directed to the enjoyment of more elegant beauty A select band of the fairest maidens of China was annually devoted to the rude embraces of the Huns thirty six and the alliance of the haughty Tanjous was secured by their marriage with the genuine or adopted daughters of the Imperial family which vainly attempted to escape the sacrilegious pollution The situation of these unhappy victims is described in the verses of a Chinese princess who laments that she had been condemned by her parents to a distant exile under a Barbarian husband who complains that sour milk was her only drink raw flesh her only food a tent her only palace and who expresses in a strain of pathetic simplicity the natural wish that she were transformed into a bird to fly back to her dear country the object of her tender and perpetual regret thirty seven Footnote twenty seven M de Guignes tom ii p one one hundred twenty four has given the original history of the ancient Hiong nou or

forces of the Huns were not inferior to those of the Moguls or of the Mantcheoux and their ambition might entertain the most sanguine hopes of success But their pride was humbled and their progress was checked by the arms and policy of Vouti thirty eight the fifth emperor of the powerful dynasty of the Han In his long reign of fifty four years the Barbarians of the southern provinces submitted to the laws and manners of China and the ancient limits of the monarchy were enlarged from the great river of Kiang to the port of Canton Instead of confining himself to the timid operations of a defensive war his lieutenants penetrated many hundred miles into the country of the Huns In those boundless deserts where it is impossible to form magazines and difficult to transport a sufficient supply of provisions the armies of Vouti were repeatedly exposed to intolerable hardships and of one hundred and forty thousand soldiers who marched against the Barbarians thirty thousand only returned in safety to the feet of their master These losses however were compensated by splendid and decisive success The Chinese generals improved the superiority which they derived from the temper of their arms their chariots of war and the service of their Tartar auxiliaries The camp of the Tanjou was surprised in the midst of sleep and intemperance and though the monarch of the Huns bravely cut his way through the ranks of the enemy he left above fifteen thousand of his subjects on the field of battle Yet this signal victory which was preceded and followed by many bloody engagements contributed much less to the destruction of the power of the Huns than the effectual policy which was employed to detach the tributary nations from their obedience Intimidated by the arms or allured by the promises of Vouti and his successors the most considerable tribes both of the East and of the West disclaimed the authority of the Tanjou While some acknowledged themselves the allies or vassals of the empire they all became the implacable enemies of the Huns and the numbers of that haughty people as soon as they were reduced to their native strength might perhaps have been contained within the walls of one of the great and populous cities of China thirty nine The desertion of his subjects and the perplexity of a civil war at length compelled the Tanjou himself to renounce the dignity of an independent sovereign and the freedom of a warlike and high spirited nation He was received at Sigan the capital of the monarchy by the troops the mandarins and the emperor himself with all the honors that could adorn and disguise the triumph of Chinese vanity forty A magnificent palace was prepared for his reception his place was assigned above all the princes of the royal family and the patience of the Barbarian king was exhausted by the ceremonies of a banquet which consisted of eight courses of meat and of nine solemn pieces of music But he performed on his knees the duty of a respectful homage to the emperor of China pronounced in his own name and in the name of his successors a perpetual oath of fidelity and gratefully accepted a seal which was bestowed as the emblem of his regal dependence After this humiliating submission the Tanjous sometimes departed from their allegiance and seized the favorable moments of war and rapine but the monarchy of the Huns gradually declined till it was broken by civil dissension into two hostile and separate kingdoms One of the princes of the nation was urged by fear and ambition to retire towards the South with eight hords which composed between forty and fifty thousand families He obtained with the title of Tanjou a convenient territory on the verge of the Chinese provinces and his constant attachment to the service of the empire was secured by weakness and the desire of revenge From the time of this fatal schism the Huns of the North continued to languish about fifty years till they were oppressed on every side by their foreign and domestic enemies The proud inscription forty one of a column erected on a lofty mountain announced to posterity that a Chinese army had marched seven hundred miles into the heart of

the poorest indeed and the most pusillanimous of the people were contented to remain in their native country to renounce their peculiar name and origin and to mingle with the victorious nation of the Sienpi Fifty eight hords about two hundred thousand men ambitious of a more honorable servitude retired towards the South implored the protection of the emperors of China and were permitted to inhabit and to guard the extreme frontiers of the province of Chansi and the territory of Ortous But the most warlike and powerful tribes of the Huns maintained in their adverse fortune the undaunted spirit of their ancestors The Western world was open to their valor and they resolved under the conduct of their hereditary chieftains to conquer and subdue some remote country which was still inaccessible to the arms of the Sienpi and to the laws of China forty five The course of their emigration soon carried them beyond the mountains of Imaus and the limits of the Chinese geography but we are able to distinguish the two great divisions of these formidable exiles which directed their march towards the Oxus and towards the Volga The first of these colonies established their dominion in the fruitful and extensive plains of Sogdiana on the eastern side of the Caspian where they preserved the name of Huns with the epithet of Euthalites or Nepthalites forty fivea Their manners were softened and even their features were insensibly improved by the mildness of the climate and their long residence in a flourishing province forty six which might still retain a faint impression of the arts of Greece forty seven The white Huns a name which they derived from the change of their complexions soon abandoned the pastoral life of Scythia Gorgo which under the appellation of Carizme has since enjoyed a temporary splendor was the residence of the king who exercised a legal authority over an obedient people Their luxury was maintained by the labor of the Sogdians and the only vestige of their ancient barbarism was the custom which obliged all the companions perhaps to the number of twenty who had shared the liberality of a wealthy lord to be buried alive in the same grave forty eight The vicinity of the Huns to the provinces of Persia involved them in frequent and bloody contests with the power of that monarchy But they respected in peace the faith of treaties in war she dictates of humanity and their memorable victory over Peroses or Firuz displayed the moderation as well as the valor of the Barbarians The second division of their countrymen the Huns who gradually advanced towards the North west were exercised by the hardships of a colder climate and a more laborious march Necessity compelled them to exchange the silks of China for the furs of Siberia the imperfect rudiments of civilized life were obliterated and the native fierceness of the Huns was exasperated by their intercourse with the savage tribes who were compared with some propriety to the wild beasts of the desert Their independent spirit soon rejected the hereditary succession of the Tanjous and while each horde was governed by its peculiar mursa their tumultuary council directed the public measures of the whole nation As late as the thirteenth century their transient residence on the eastern banks of the Volga was attested by the name of Great Hungary forty nine In the winter they descended with their flocks and herds towards the mouth of that mighty river and their summer excursions reached as high as the latitude of Saratoff or perhaps the conflux of the Kama Such at least were the recent limits of the black Calmucks fifty who remained about a century under the protection of Russia and who have since returned to their native seats on the frontiers of the Chinese empire The march and the

the Son of Heaven and the Father of his People It is impossible to fill the dark interval of time which elapsed after the Huns of the Volga were lost in the eyes of the Chinese and before they showed themselves to those of the Romans There is some reason however to apprehend that the same force which had driven them from their native seats still continued to impel their march towards the frontiers of Europe The power of the Sienpi their implacable enemies which extended above three thousand miles from East to West fifty two must have gradually oppressed them by the weight and terror of a formidable neighborhood and the flight of the tribes of Scythia would inevitably tend to increase the strength or to contract the territories of the Huns The harsh and obscure appellations of those tribes would offend the ear without informing the understanding of the reader but I cannot suppress the very natural suspicion that the Huns of the North derived a considerable reenforcement from the ruin of the dynasty of the South which in the course of the third century submitted to the dominion of China that the bravest warriors marched away in search of their free and adventurous countrymen and that as they had been divided by prosperity they were easily reunited by the common hardships of their adverse fortune fifty three The Huns with their flocks and herds their wives and children their dependents and allies were transported to the west of the Volga and they boldly advanced to invade the country of the Alani a pastoral people who occupied or wasted an extensive tract of the deserts of Scythia The plains between the Volga and the Tanais were covered with the tents of the Alani but their name and manners were diffused over the wide extent of their conquests and the painted tribes of the Agathyrsi and Geloni were confounded among their vassals Towards the North they penetrated into the frozen regions of Siberia among the savages who were accustomed in their rage or hunger to the taste of human flesh and their Southern inroads were pushed as far as the confines of Persia and India The mixture of Samartic and German blood had contributed to improve the features of the Alani fifty threea to whiten their swarthy complexions and to tinge their hair with a yellowish cast which is seldom found in the Tartar race They were less deformed in their persons less brutish in their manners than the Huns but they did not yield to those formidable Barbarians in their martial and independent spirit in the love of freedom which rejected even the use of domestic slaves and in the love of arms which considered war and rapine as the pleasure and the glory of mankind A naked cimeter fixed in the ground was the only object of their religious worship the scalps of their enemies formed the costly trappings of their horses and they viewed with pity and contempt the pusillanimous warriors who patiently expected the infirmities of age and the tortures of lingering disease fifty four On the banks of the Tanais the military power of the Huns and the Alani encountered each other with equal valor but with unequal success The Huns prevailed in the bloody contest the king of the Alani was slain and the remains of the vanquished nation were dispersed by the ordinary alternative of flight or submission fifty five A colony of exiles found a secure refuge in the mountains of Caucasus between the Euxine and the Caspian where they still preserve their name and their independence Another colony advanced with more intrepid courage towards the shores of the Baltic associated themselves with the Northern tribes of Germany and shared the spoil of the Roman provinces of Gaul and Spain But the greatest part of the nation of the Alani embraced the offers of an honorable and advantageous union and the Huns who esteemed the valor of their less fortunate enemies proceeded with an increase of numbers and confidence to invade the limits of the Gothic empire

the Baltic to the Euxine enjoyed in the full maturity of age and reputation the fruit of his victories when he was alarmed by the formidable approach of a host of unknown enemies fifty six on whom his barbarous subjects might without injustice bestow the epithet of Barbarians The numbers the strength the rapid motions and the implacable cruelty of the Huns were felt and dreaded and magnified by the astonished Goths who beheld their fields and villages consumed with flames and deluged with indiscriminate slaughter To these real terrors they added the surprise and abhorrence which were excited by the shrill voice the uncouth gestures and the strange deformity of the Huns fifty sixa These savages of Scythia were compared and the picture had some resemblance to the animals who walk very awkwardly on two legs and to the misshapen figures the Termini which were often placed on the bridges of antiquity They were distinguished from the rest of the human species by their broad shoulders flat noses and small black eyes deeply buried in the head and as they were almost destitute of beards they never enjoyed either the manly grace of youth or the venerable aspect of age fifty seven A fabulous origin was assigned worthy of their form and manners that the witches of Scythia who for their foul and deadly practices had been driven from society had copulated in the desert with infernal spirits and that the Huns were the offspring of this execrable conjunction fifty eight The tale so full of horror and absurdity was greedily embraced by the credulous hatred of the Goths but while it gratified their hatred it increased their fear since the posterity of daemons and witches might be supposed to inherit some share of the praeternatural powers as well as of the malignant temper of their parents Against these enemies Hermanric prepared to exert the united forces of the Gothic state but he soon discovered that his vassal tribes provoked by oppression were much more inclined to second than to repel the invasion of the Huns One of the chiefs of the Roxolani fifty nine had formerly deserted the standard of Hermanric and the cruel tyrant had condemned the innocent wife of the traitor to be torn asunder by wild horses The brothers of that unfortunate woman seized the favorable moment of revenge The aged king of the Goths languished some time after the dangerous wound which he received from their daggers but the conduct of the war was retarded by his infirmities and the public councils of the nation were distracted by a spirit of jealousy and discord His death which has been imputed to his own despair left the reins of government in the hands of Withimer who with the doubtful aid of some Scythian mercenaries maintained the unequal contest against the arms of the Huns and the Alani till he was defeated and slain in a decisive battle The Ostrogoths submitted to their fate and the royal race of the Amali will hereafter be found among the subjects of the haughty Attila But the person of Witheric the infant king was saved by the diligence of Alatheus and Saphrax two warriors of approved valor and fiedlity who by cautious marches conducted the independent remains of the nation of the Ostrogoths towards the Danastus or Niester a considerable river which now separates the Turkish dominions from the empire of Russia On the banks of the Niester the prudent Athanaric more attentive to his own than to the general safety had fixed the camp of the Visigoths with the firm resolution of opposing the victorious Barbarians whom he thought it less advisable to provoke The ordinary speed of the Huns was checked by the weight of baggage and the encumbrance of captives but their military skill deceived and almost destroyed the army of Athanaric While the Judge of the Visigoths defended the banks of the Niester he was encompassed and attacked by a numerous detachment of cavalry who by the light of the moon had passed the river in a fordable place and it was not without the utmost efforts of courage and conduct that he was able to effect his retreat towards the hilly country The undaunted general had already formed a new and judicious plan of defensive war and the strong lines which he was preparing to construct between the mountains the Pruth and the Danube would have secured the extensive and fertile territory that bears the modern name of Walachia from the destructive inroads of the Huns sixty But the hopes and measures of the Judge of the Visigoths was soon disappointed by the trembling impatience of his dismayed countrymen who were persuaded by their fears that the interposition of the Danube was the only barrier that could save them from the rapid pursuit and invincible valor of the Barbarians of Scythia Under the command of Fritigern and Alavivus sixty one the body of the nation hastily advanced to the banks of the great river and implored the protection of the Roman emperor of the East Athanaric himself still anxious to avoid the guilt of perjury retired with a band of faithful followers into the mountainous country of Caucaland which appears to have been guarded and almost concealed by the impenetrable forests of Transylvania sixty two sixty twoa Footnote fifty six As we are possessed of the authentic history of the Huns it would be impertinent to repeat or to refute the fables which misrepresent their origin

Mountains on the side of the present Transylvania and therefore the canton of Cacava to the south of Hermanstadt the capital of the principality Caucaland it is evident is the Gothic form of these different names saint Martin iv one hundred three M Chapter XXVI Progress of The Huns Part III After Valens had terminated the Gothic war with some appearance of glory and success he made a progress through his dominions of Asia and at length fixed his residence in the capital of Syria The five years sixty three which he spent at Antioch was employed to watch from a secure distance the hostile designs of the Persian monarch to check the depredations of the Saracens and Isaurians sixty four to enforce by arguments more prevalent than those of reason and eloquence the belief of the Arian theology and to satisfy his anxious suspicions by the promiscuous execution of the innocent and the guilty But the attention of the emperor was most seriously engaged by the important intelligence which he received from the civil and military officers who were intrusted with the defence of the Danube He was informed that the North was agitated by a furious tempest that the irruption of the Huns an unknown and monstrous race of savages had subverted the power of the Goths and that the suppliant multitudes of that warlike nation whose pride was now humbled in the dust covered a space of many miles along the banks of the river With outstretched arms and pathetic lamentations they loudly deplored their past misfortunes and their present danger acknowledged that their only hope of safety was in the clemency of the Roman government and most solemnly protested that if the gracious liberality of the emperor would permit them to cultivate the waste lands of Thrace they should ever hold themselves bound by the strongest obligations of duty and gratitude to obey the laws and to guard the limits of the republic These assurances were confirmed by the ambassadors of the Goths sixty foura who impatiently expected from the mouth of Valens an answer that must finally determine the fate of their unhappy countrymen The emperor of the East was no longer guided by the wisdom and authority of his elder brother whose death happened towards the end of the preceding year and as the distressful situation of the Goths required an instant and peremptory decision he was deprived of the favorite resources of feeble and timid minds who consider the use of dilatory and ambiguous measures as the most admirable efforts of consummate prudence As long as the same passions and interests subsist among mankind the questions of war and peace of justice and policy which were debated in the councils of antiquity will frequently present themselves as the subject of modern deliberation But the most experienced statesman of Europe has never been summoned to consider the propriety or the danger of admitting or rejecting an innumerable multitude of Barbarians who are driven by despair and hunger to solicit a settlement on the territories of a civilized nation When that important proposition so essentially connected with the public safety was referred to the ministers of Valens they were perplexed and divided but they soon acquiesced in the flattering sentiment which seemed the most favorable to the pride the indolence and the avarice of their sovereign The slaves who were decorated with the titles of praefects and generals dissembled or disregarded the terrors of this national emigration so extremely different from the partial and accidental colonies which had been received on the extreme limits of the empire But they applauded the liberality of fortune which had conducted from the most distant countries of the globe a numerous and invincible army of strangers to defend the throne of Valens who might now add to the royal treasures the immense sums of gold supplied by the provincials to compensate their annual proportion of recruits The prayers of the Goths were granted and their service was accepted by the Imperial court and orders were immediately despatched to the civil and military governors of the Thracian diocese to make the necessary preparations for the passage and subsistence of a great people till a proper and sufficient territory could be allotted for their future residence The liberality of the emperor was accompanied however with two harsh and rigorous conditions which prudence might justify on the side of the Romans but which distress alone could extort from the indignant Goths Before they passed the Danube they were required to deliver their arms and it was insisted that their children should be taken from them and dispersed through the provinces of Asia where they might be civilized by the arts of education and serve as hostages to secure the fidelity of their parents Footnote sixty three The Chronology of Ammianus is obscure and imperfect Tillemont has labored to clear and settle the annals of Valens Footnote sixty four Zosimus

des Empereurs tom v p one hundred six Footnote sixty foura Sozomen and Philostorgius say that the bishop Ulphilas was one of these ambassadors M During the suspense of a doubtful and distant negotiation the impatient Goths made some rash attempts to pass the Danube without the permission of the government whose protection they had implored Their motions were strictly observed by the vigilance of the troops which were stationed along the river and their foremost detachments were defeated with considerable slaughter yet such were the timid councils of the reign of Valens that the brave officers who had served their country in the execution of their duty were punished by the loss of their employments and narrowly escaped the loss of their heads The Imperial mandate was at length received for transporting over the Danube the whole body of the Gothic nation sixty five but the execution of this order was a task of labor and difficulty The stream of the Danube which in those parts is above a mile broad sixty six had been swelled by incessant rains and in this tumultuous passage many were swept away and drowned by the rapid violence of the current A large fleet of vessels of boats and of canoes was provided many days and nights they passed and repassed with indefatigable toil and the most strenuous diligence was exerted by the officers of Valens that not a single Barbarian of those who were reserved to subvert the foundations of Rome should be left on the opposite shore It was thought expedient that an accurate account should be taken of their numbers but the persons who were employed soon desisted with amazement and dismay from the prosecution of the endless and impracticable task sixty seven and the principal historian of the age most seriously affirms that the prodigious armies of Darius and Xerxes which had so long been considered as the fables of vain and credulous antiquity were now justified in the eyes of mankind by the evidence of fact and experience A probable testimony has fixed the number of the Gothic warriors at two hundred thousand men and if we can venture to add the just proportion of women of children and of slaves the whole mass of people which composed this formidable emigration must have amounted to near a million of persons of both sexes and of all ages The children of the Goths those at least of a distinguished rank were separated from the multitude They were conducted without delay to the distant seats assigned for their residence and education and as the numerous train of hostages or captives passed through the cities their gay and splendid apparel their robust and martial figure excited the surprise and envy of the Provincials sixty sevena But the stipulation the most offensive to the Goths and the most important to the Romans was shamefully eluded The Barbarians who considered their arms as the ensigns of honor and the pledges of safety were disposed to offer a price which the lust or avarice of the Imperial officers was easily tempted to accept To preserve their arms the haughty warriors consented with some reluctance to prostitute their wives or their daughters the charms of a beauteous maid or a comely boy secured the connivance of the inspectors who sometimes cast an eye of covetousness on the fringed carpets and linen garments of their new allies sixty eight or who sacrificed their duty to the mean consideration of filling their farms with cattle and their houses with slaves The Goths with arms in their hands were permitted to enter the boats and when their strength was collected on the other side of the river the immense camp which was spread over the plains and the hills of the Lower Maesia assumed a threatening and even hostile aspect The leaders of the Ostrogoths Alatheus and Saphrax the guardians of their infant king appeared soon afterwards on the Northern banks of the Danube and immediately despatched their ambassadors to the court of Antioch to solicit with the same professions of allegiance and gratitude the same favor which had been granted to the suppliant Visigoths The absolute refusal of Valens suspended their progress and discovered

express the impossibility of numbering the different sorts of vines See Plin Hist Natur l xiv Footnote sixty sevena A very curious but obscure passage of Eunapius appears to me to have been misunderstood by M Mai to whom we owe its discovery The substance is as follows The Goths transported over the river their native deities with their priests of both sexes but concerning their rites they maintained a deep and adamantine silence To the Romans they pretended to be generally Christians and placed certain persons to represent bishops in a conspicuous manner on their wagons There was even among them a sort of what are called monks persons whom it was not difficult to mimic it was enough to wear black raiment to be wicked and held in respect Eunapius hated the black robed monks as appears in another passage with the cordial detestation of a heathen philosopher Thus while they faithfully but secretly adhered to their own religion the Romans were weak enough to suppose them perfect Christians Mai two hundred seventy seven Eunapius in Niebuhr eighty two M Footnote sixty eight Eunapius and Zosimus curiously specify these articles of Gothic wealth and luxury Yet it must be presumed that they were the manufactures of the provinces which the Barbarians had acquired as the spoils of war or as the gifts or merchandise of peace An undisciplined and unsettled nation of Barbarians required the firmest temper and the most dexterous management The daily subsistence of near a million of extraordinary subjects could be supplied only by constant and skilful diligence and might continually be interrupted by mistake or accident The insolence or the indignation of the Goths if they conceived themselves to be the objects either of fear or of contempt might urge them to the most desperate extremities and the fortune of the state seemed to depend on the prudence as well as the integrity of the generals of Valens At this important crisis the military government of Thrace was exercised by Lupicinus and Maximus in whose venal minds the slightest hope of private emolument outweighed every consideration of public advantage and whose guilt was only alleviated by their incapacity of discerning the pernicious effects of their rash and criminal administration Instead of obeying the orders of their sovereign and satisfying with decent liberality the demands of the Goths they levied an ungenerous and oppressive tax on the wants of the hungry Barbarians The vilest food was sold at an extravagant price and in the room of wholesome and substantial provisions the markets were filled with the flesh of dogs and of unclean animals who had died of disease To obtain the valuable acquisition of a pound of bread the Goths resigned the possession of an expensive though serviceable slave and a small quantity of meat was greedily purchased with ten pounds of a precious but useless metal sixty nine when their property was exhausted they continued this necessary traffic by the sale of their sons and daughters and notwithstanding the love of freedom which animated every Gothic breast they submitted to the humiliating maxim that it was better for their children to be maintained in a servile condition than to perish in a state of wretched and helpless independence The most lively resentment is excited by the tyranny of pretended benefactors who sternly exact the debt of gratitude which they have cancelled by subsequent injuries a spirit of discontent insensibly arose in the camp of the Barbarians who pleaded without success the merit of their patient and dutiful behavior and loudly complained of the inhospitable treatment which they had received from their new allies They beheld around them the wealth and plenty of a fertile province in the midst of which they suffered the intolerable hardships of artificial famine But the means of relief and even of revenge were in their hands since the rapaciousness of their tyrants had left to an injured people the possession and the use of arms The clamors of a multitude untaught to disguise their sentiments announced the first symptoms of resistance and alarmed the timid and guilty minds of Lupicinus and Maximus Those crafty ministers who substituted the cunning of temporary expedients to the wise and salutary counsels of general policy attempted to remove the Goths from their dangerous station on the frontiers of the empire and to disperse them in separate quarters of cantonment through the interior provinces As they were conscious how ill they had deserved the respect or confidence of the Barbarians they diligently collected from every side a military force that might urge the tardy and reluctant march of a people who had not yet renounced the title or the duties of Roman subjects But the generals of Valens while their attention was solely directed to the discontented Visigoths imprudently disarmed the ships and the fortifications which constituted the defence of the Danube The fatal oversight was observed and improved by Alatheus and Saphrax who anxiously watched the favorable moment of escaping from the pursuit of the Huns By the help of such rafts and vessels as could be hastily procured the leaders of the Ostrogoths transported without opposition their king and their army and boldly fixed a hostile and independent camp on the territories of the empire

which they derived from their birth was ratified by the free consent of the nation In a season of tranquility their power might have been equal as well as their rank but as soon as their countrymen were exasperated by hunger and oppression the superior abilities of Fritigern assumed the military command which he was qualified to exercise for the public welfare He restrained the impatient spirit of the Visigoths till the injuries and the insults of their tyrants should justify their resistance in the opinion of mankind but he was not disposed to sacrifice any solid advantages for the empty praise of justice and moderation Sensible of the benefits which would result from the union of the Gothic powers under the same standard he secretly cultivated the friendship of the Ostrogoths and while he professed an implicit obedience to the orders of the Roman generals he proceeded by slow marches towards Marcianopolis the capital of the Lower Maesia about seventy miles from the banks of the Danube On that fatal spot the flames of discord and mutual hatred burst forth into a dreadful conflagration Lupicinus had invited the Gothic chiefs to a splendid entertainment and their martial train remained under arms at the entrance of the palace But the gates of the city were strictly guarded and the Barbarians were sternly excluded from the use of a plentiful market to which they asserted their equal claim of subjects and allies Their humble prayers were rejected with insolence and derision and as their patience was now exhausted the townsmen the soldiers and the Goths were soon involved in a conflict of passionate altercation and angry reproaches A blow was imprudently given a sword was hastily drawn and the first blood that was spilt in this accidental quarrel became the signal of a long and destructive war In the midst of noise and brutal intemperance Lupicinus was informed by a secret messenger that many of his soldiers were slain and despoiled of their arms and as he was already inflamed by wine and oppressed by sleep he issued a rash command that their death should be revenged by the massacre of the guards of Fritigern and Alavivus The clamorous shouts and dying groans apprised Fritigern of his extreme danger and as he possessed the calm and intrepid spirit of a hero he saw that he was lost if he allowed a moment of deliberation to the man who had so deeply injured him A trifling dispute said the Gothic leader with a firm but gentle tone of voice appears to have arisen between the two nations but it may be productive of the most dangerous consequences unless the tumult is immediately pacified by the assurance of our safety and the authority of our presence At these words Fritigern and his companions drew their swords opened their passage through the unresisting crowd which filled the palace the streets and the gates of Marcianopolis and mounting their horses hastily vanished from the eyes of the astonished Romans The generals of the Goths were saluted by the fierce and joyful acclamations of the camp war was instantly resolved and the resolution was executed without delay the banners of the nation were displayed according to the custom of their ancestors and the air resounded with the harsh and mournful music of the Barbarian trumpet seventy one The weak and guilty Lupicinus who had dared to provoke who had neglected to destroy and who still presumed to despise his formidable enemy marched against the Goths at the head of such a military force as could be collected on this sudden emergency The Barbarians expected his approach about nine miles from Marcianopolis and on this occasion the talents of the general were found to be of more prevailing efficacy than the weapons and discipline of the troops The valor of the Goths was so ably directed by the genius of Fritigern that they broke by a close and vigorous attack the ranks of the Roman legions Lupicinus left his arms and standards his tribunes and his bravest soldiers on the field of battle and their useless courage served only to protect the ignominious flight of their leader That successful day put an end to the distress of the Barbarians and the security of the Romans from that day the Goths renouncing the precarious condition of strangers and exiles assumed the character of citizens and masters claimed an absolute dominion over the possessors of land and held in their own right the northern provinces of the empire which are bounded by the Danube Such are the words of the Gothic historian seventy two who celebrates with rude eloquence the glory of his countrymen But the dominion of the Barbarians was exercised only for the purposes of rapine and destruction As they had been deprived by the ministers of the emperor of the common benefits of nature and the fair intercourse of social life they retaliated the injustice on the subjects of the empire and the crimes of Lupicinus were expiated by the ruin of the peaceful husbandmen of Thrace the conflagration of their villages and the massacre or captivity of their innocent families The report of the Gothic victory was soon diffused over the adjacent country and while it filled the minds of the Romans with terror and dismay their own hasty imprudence contributed to increase the forces of Fritigern and the calamities of the province Some time before the great emigration a numerous body of Goths under the command of Suerid and Colias had been received into the protection and service of the empire seventy three They were encamped under the walls of Hadrianople but the ministers of Valens were anxious to remove them beyond the Hellespont at a distance from the dangerous temptation which might so easily be communicated by the neighborhood and the success of their countrymen The respectful submission with which they yielded to the order of their march might be considered as a proof of their fidelity and their moderate request of a sufficient allowance of provisions and of a delay of only two days was expressed in the most dutiful terms But the first magistrate of Hadrianople incensed by some disorders which had been committed at his country house refused this indulgence and arming against them the inhabitants and manufacturers of a populous city he urged with hostile threats their instant departure The Barbarians stood silent and amazed till they were exasperated by the insulting clamors and missile weapons of the populace but when patience or contempt was fatigued they crushed the undisciplined multitude inflicted many a shameful wound on the backs of their flying enemies and despoiled them of the splendid armor seventy four which they were unworthy to bear The resemblance of their sufferings and their actions soon united this victorious detachment to the nation of the Visigoths the troops of Colias and Suerid expected the approach of the great Fritigern ranged themselves under his standard and signalized their ardor in the siege of Hadrianople But the resistance of the garrison informed the Barbarians that in the attack of regular fortifications the efforts of unskillful courage are seldom effectual Their general acknowledged his error raised the siege declared that he was at peace with stone walls seventy five and revenged his disappointment on the adjacent country He accepted with pleasure the useful reenforcement of hardy workmen who labored in the gold mines of Thrace seventy six for the emolument and under the lash of an unfeeling master seventy seven and these new associates conducted the Barbarians through the secret paths to the most sequestered places which had been chosen to secure the inhabitants the cattle and the magazines of corn With the assistance of such guides nothing could remain impervious or inaccessible resistance was fatal flight was impracticable and the patient submission of helpless innocence seldom found mercy from the Barbarian conqueror In the course of these depredations a great number of the children of the Goths who had been sold into captivity were restored to the embraces of their afflicted parents but these tender interviews which might have revived and cherished in their minds some sentiments of humanity tended only to stimulate their native fierceness by the desire of revenge They listened with eager attention to the complaints of their captive children who had suffered the most cruel indignities from the lustful or angry passions of their masters and the same cruelties the same indignities were severely retaliated on the sons and daughters of the Romans seventy eight Footnote seventy one Vexillis de more sublatis auditisque trisie sonantibus classicis Ammian xxxi five These are the rauca cornua of Claudian in Rufin ii fifty seven the

The historian of the Gothic war loses time and space by an unseasonable recapitulation of the ancient inroads of the Barbarians The imprudence of Valens and his ministers had introduced into the heart of the empire a nation of enemies but the Visigoths might even yet have been reconciled by the manly confession of past errors and the sincere performance of former engagements These healing and temperate measures seemed to concur with the timorous disposition of the sovereign of the East but on this occasion alone Valens was brave and his unseasonable bravery was fatal to himself and to his subjects He declared his intention of marching from Antioch to Constantinople to subdue this dangerous rebellion and as he was not ignorant of the difficulties of the enterprise he solicited the assistance of his nephew the emperor Gratian who commanded all the forces of the West The veteran troops were hastily recalled from the defence of Armenia that important frontier was abandoned to the discretion of Sapor and the immediate conduct of the Gothic war was intrusted during the absence of Valens to his lieutenants Trajan and Profuturus two generals who indulged themselves in a very false and favorable opinion of their own abilities On their arrival in Thrace they were joined by Richomer count of the domestics and the auxiliaries of the West that marched under his banner were composed of the Gallic legions reduced indeed by a spirit of desertion to the vain appearances of strength and numbers In a council of war which was influenced by pride rather than by reason it was resolved to seek and to encounter the Barbarians who lay encamped in the spacious and fertile meadows near the most southern of the six mouths of the Danube seventy nine Their camp was surrounded by the usual fortification of wagons eighty and the Barbarians secure within the vast circle of the enclosure enjoyed the fruits of their valor and the spoils of the province In the midst of riotous intemperance the watchful Fritigern observed the motions and penetrated the designs of the Romans He perceived that the numbers of the enemy were continually increasing and as he understood their intention of attacking his rear as soon as the scarcity of forage should oblige him to remove his camp he recalled to their standard his predatory detachments which covered the adjacent country As soon as they descried the flaming beacons eighty one they obeyed with incredible speed the signal of their leader the camp was filled with the martial crowd of Barbarians their impatient clamors demanded the battle and their tumultuous zeal was approved and animated by the spirit of their chiefs The evening was already far advanced and the two armies prepared themselves for the approaching combat which was deferred only till the dawn of day While the trumpets sounded to arms the undaunted courage of the Goths was confirmed by the mutual obligation of a solemn oath and as they advanced to meet the enemy the rude songs which celebrated the glory of their forefathers were mingled with their fierce and dissonant outcries and opposed to the artificial harmony of the Roman shout Some military skill was displayed by Fritigern to gain the advantage of a commanding eminence but the bloody conflict which began and ended with the light was maintained on either side by the personal and obstinate efforts of strength valor and agility The legions of Armenia supported their fame in arms but they were oppressed by the irresistible weight of the hostile multitude the left wing of the Romans was thrown into disorder and the field was strewed with their mangled carcasses This partial defeat was balanced however by partial success and when the two armies at a late hour of the evening retreated to their respective camps neither of them could claim the honors or the effects of a decisive victory The real loss was more severely felt by the Romans in proportion to the smallness of their numbers but the Goths were so deeply confounded and dismayed by this vigorous and perhaps unexpected resistance that they remained seven days within the circle of their fortifications Such funeral rites as the circumstances of time and place would admit were piously discharged to some officers of distinguished rank but the indiscriminate vulgar was left unburied on the plain Their flesh was greedily devoured by the birds of prey who in that age enjoyed very frequent and delicious feasts and several years afterwards the white and naked bones which covered the wide extent of the fields presented to the eyes of Ammianus a dreadful monument of the battle of Salices eighty two Footnote seventy nine The Itinerary of Antoninus p two hundred twenty six two hundred twenty seven edit Wesseling marks the

Constantius and Julian We are ignorant of the time when he quitted the service and retired to Rome where he appears to have composed his History of his Own Times The progress of the Goths had been checked by the doubtful event of that bloody day and the Imperial generals whose army would have been consumed by the repetition of such a contest embraced the more rational plan of destroying the Barbarians by the wants and pressure of their own multitudes They prepared to confine the Visigoths in the narrow angle of land between the Danube the desert of Scythia and the mountains of Haemus till their strength and spirit should be insensibly wasted by the inevitable operation of famine The design was prosecuted with some conduct and success the Barbarians had almost exhausted their own magazines and the harvests of the country and the diligence of Saturninus the master general of the cavalry was employed to improve the strength and to contract the extent of the Roman fortifications His labors were interrupted by the alarming intelligence that new swarms of Barbarians had passed the unguarded Danube either to support the cause or to imitate the example of Fritigern The just apprehension that he himself might be surrounded and overwhelmed by the arms of hostile and unknown nations compelled Saturninus to relinquish the siege of the Gothic camp and the indignant Visigoths breaking from their confinement satiated their hunger and revenge by the repeated devastation of the fruitful country which extends above three hundred miles from the banks of the Danube to the straits of the Hellespont eighty three The sagacious Fritigern had successfully appealed to the passions as well as to the interest of his Barbarian allies and the love of rapine and the hatred of Rome seconded or even prevented the eloquence of his ambassadors He cemented a strict and useful alliance with the great body of his countrymen who obeyed Alatheus and Saphrax as the guardians of their infant king the long animosity of rival tribes was suspended by the sense of their common interest the independent part of the nation was associated under one standard and the chiefs of the Ostrogoths appear to have yielded to the superior genius of the general of the Visigoths He obtained the formidable aid of the Taifalae eighty threea whose military renown was disgraced and polluted by the public infamy of their domestic manners Every youth on his entrance into the world was united by the ties of honorable friendship and brutal love to some warrior of the tribe nor could he hope to be released from this unnatural connection till he had approved his manhood by slaying in single combat a huge bear or a wild boar of the forest eighty four But the most powerful auxiliaries of the Goths were drawn from the camp of those enemies who had expelled them from their native seats The loose subordination and extensive possessions of the Huns and the Alani delayed the conquests and distracted the councils of that victorious people Several of the hords were allured by the liberal promises of Fritigern and the rapid cavalry of Scythia added weight and energy to the steady and strenuous efforts of the Gothic infantry The Sarmatians who could never forgive the successor of Valentinian enjoyed and increased the general confusion and a seasonable irruption of the Alemanni into the provinces of Gaul engaged the attention and diverted the forces of the emperor of the West eighty five Footnote eighty three Ammian xxxi eight Footnote eighty threea The Taifalae who at this period inhabited the country which now forms the principality of Wallachia were in my opinion the last remains of the great and powerful nation of the Dacians Daci or Dahae which has given its name to

provinces They are mentioned in the Notitia Imperii There was a considerable body in the country of the Pictavi now Poithou They long retained their manners and language and caused the name of the

The Huns Part IV One of the most dangerous inconveniences of the introduction of the Barbarians into the army and the palace was sensibly felt in their correspondence with their hostile countrymen to whom they imprudently or maliciously revealed the weakness of the Roman empire A soldier of the lifeguards of Gratian was of the nation of the Alemanni and of the tribe of the Lentienses who dwelt beyond the Lake of Constance Some domestic business obliged him to request a leave of absence In a short visit to his family and friends he was exposed to their curious inquiries and the vanity of the loquacious soldier tempted him to display his intimate acquaintance with the secrets of the state and the designs of his master The intelligence that Gratian was preparing to lead the military force of Gaul and of the West to the assistance of his uncle Valens pointed out to the restless spirit of the Alemanni the moment and the mode of a successful invasion The enterprise of some light detachments who in the month of February passed the Rhine upon the ice was the prelude of a more important war The boldest hopes of rapine perhaps of conquest outweighed the considerations of timid prudence or national faith Every forest and every village poured forth a band of hardy adventurers and the great army of the Alemanni which on their approach was estimated at forty thousand men by the fears of the people was afterwards magnified to the number of seventy thousand by the vain and credulous flattery of the Imperial court The legions which had been ordered to march into Pannonia were immediately recalled or detained for the defence of Gaul the military command was divided between Nanienus and Mellobaudes and the youthful emperor though he respected the long experience and sober wisdom of the former was much more inclined to admire and to follow the martial ardor of his colleague who was allowed to unite the incompatible characters of count of the domestics and of king of the Franks His rival Priarius king of the Alemanni was guided or rather impelled by the same headstrong valor and as their troops were animated by the spirit of their leaders they met they saw they encountered each other near the town of Argentaria or Colmar eighty six in the plains of Alsace The glory of the day was justly ascribed to the missile weapons and well practised evolutions of the Roman soldiers the Alemanni who long maintained their ground were slaughtered with unrelenting fury five thousand only of the Barbarians escaped to the woods and mountains and the glorious death of their king on the field of battle saved him from the reproaches of the people who are always disposed to accuse the justice or policy of an unsuccessful war After this signal victory which secured the peace of Gaul and asserted the honor of the Roman arms the emperor Gratian appeared to proceed without delay on his Eastern expedition but as he approached the confines of the Alemanni he suddenly inclined to the left surprised them by his unexpected passage of the Rhine and boldly advanced into the heart of their country The Barbarians opposed to his progress the obstacles of nature and of courage and still continued to retreat from one hill to another till they were satisfied by repeated trials of the power and perseverance of their enemies Their submission was accepted as a proof not indeed of their sincere repentance but of their actual distress and a select number of their brave and robust youth was exacted from the faithless nation as the most substantial pledge of their future moderation The subjects of the empire who had so often experienced that the Alemanni could neither be subdued by arms nor restrained by treaties might not promise themselves any solid or lasting tranquillity but they discovered in the virtues of their young sovereign the prospect of a long and auspicious reign When the legions climbed the mountains and scaled the fortifications of the Barbarians the valor of Gratian was distinguished in the foremost ranks and the gilt and variegated armor of his guards was pierced and shattered by the blows which they had received in their constant attachment to the person of their sovereign At the age of nineteen the son of Valentinian seemed to possess the talents of peace and war and his personal success against the Alemanni was interpreted as a sure presage of his Gothic triumphs eighty seven Footnote eighty six The field of battle Argentaria or Argentovaria is accurately fixed by M D Anville Notice de l Ancienne Gaule p ninety six

derive some additional light from the Epitome of Victor the Chronicle of Jerom and the History of Orosius l vii c thirty three p five hundred fifty two edit Havercamp While Gratian deserved and enjoyed the applause of his subjects the emperor Valens who at length had removed his court and army from Antioch was received by the people of Constantinople as the author of the public calamity Before he had reposed himself ten days in the capital he was urged by the licentious clamors of the Hippodrome to march against the Barbarians whom he had invited into his dominions and the citizens who are always brave at a distance from any real danger declared with confidence that if they were supplied with arms they alone would undertake to deliver the province from the ravages of an insulting foe eighty eight The vain reproaches of an ignorant multitude hastened the downfall of the Roman empire they provoked the desperate rashness of Valens who did not find either in his reputation or in his mind any motives to support with firmness the public contempt He was soon persuaded by the successful achievements of his lieutenants to despise the power of the Goths who by the diligence of Fritigern were now collected in the neighborhood of Hadrianople The march of the Taifalae had been intercepted by the valiant Frigeric the king of those licentious Barbarians was slain in battle and the suppliant captives were sent into distant exile to cultivate the lands of Italy which were assigned for their settlement in the vacant territories of Modena and Parma eighty nine The exploits of Sebastian ninety who was recently engaged in the service of Valens and promoted to the rank of master general of the infantry were still more honorable to himself and useful to the republic He obtained the permission of selecting three hundred soldiers from each of the legions and this separate detachment soon acquired the spirit of discipline and the exercise of arms which were almost forgotten under the reign of Valens By the vigor and conduct of Sebastian a large body of the Goths were surprised in their camp and the immense spoil which was recovered from their hands filled the city of Hadrianople and the adjacent plain The splendid narratives which the general transmitted of his own exploits alarmed the Imperial court by the appearance of superior merit and though he cautiously insisted on the difficulties of the Gothic war his valor was praised his advice was rejected and Valens who listened with pride and pleasure to the flattering suggestions of the eunuchs of the palace was impatient to seize the glory of an easy and assured conquest His army was strengthened by a numerous reenforcement of veterans and his march from Constantinople to Hadrianople was conducted with so much military skill that he prevented the activity of the Barbarians who designed to occupy the intermediate defiles and to intercept either the troops themselves or their convoys of provisions The camp of Valens which he pitched under the walls of Hadrianople was fortified according to the practice of the Romans with a ditch and rampart and a most important council was summoned to decide the fate of the emperor and of the empire The party of reason and of delay was strenuously maintained by Victor who had corrected by the lessons of experience the native fierceness of the Sarmatian character while Sebastian with the flexible and obsequious eloquence of a courtier represented every precaution and every measure that implied a doubt of immediate victory as unworthy of the courage and majesty of their invincible monarch The ruin of Valens was precipitated by the deceitful arts of Fritigern and the prudent admonitions of the emperor of the West The advantages of negotiating in the midst of war were perfectly understood by the general of the Barbarians and a Christian ecclesiastic was despatched as the holy minister of peace to penetrate and to perplex the councils of the enemy The misfortunes as well as the provocations of the Gothic nation were forcibly and truly described by their ambassador who protested in the name of Fritigern that he was still disposed to lay down his arms or to employ them only in the defence of the empire if he could secure for his wandering countrymen a tranquil settlement on the waste lands of Thrace and a sufficient allowance of corn and cattle But he added in a whisper of confidential friendship that the exasperated Barbarians were averse to these reasonable conditions and that Fritigern was doubtful whether he could accomplish the conclusion of the treaty unless he found himself supported by the presence and terrors of an Imperial army About the same time Count Richomer returned from the West to announce the defeat and submission of the Alemanni to inform Valens that his nephew advanced by rapid marches at the head of the veteran and victorious legions of Gaul and to request in the name of Gratian and of the republic that every dangerous and decisive measure might be suspended till the junction of the two emperors should insure the success of the Gothic war But the feeble sovereign of the East was actuated only by the fatal illusions of pride and jealousy He disdained the importunate advice he rejected the humiliating aid he secretly compared the ignominious at least the inglorious period of his own reign with the fame of a beardless youth and Valens rushed into the field to erect his imaginary trophy before the diligence of his colleague could usurp any share of the triumphs of the day Footnote eighty eight Moratus paucissimos dies seditione popularium levium pulsus Ammian xxxi eleven Socrates l iv c thirty eight supplies the dates and some circumstances Note Compare

prejudice and ignorance undoubtedly render him a very questionable judge of merit On the ninth of August a day which has deserved to be marked among the most inauspicious of the Roman Calendar ninety one the emperor Valens leaving under a strong guard his baggage and military treasure marched from Hadrianople to attack the Goths who were encamped about twelve miles from the city ninety two By some mistake of the orders or some ignorance of the ground the right wing or column of cavalry arrived in sight of the enemy whilst the left was still at a considerable distance the soldiers were compelled in the sultry heat of summer to precipitate their pace and the line of battle was formed with tedious confusion and irregular delay The Gothic cavalry had been detached to forage in the adjacent country and Fritigern still continued to practise his customary arts He despatched messengers of peace made proposals required hostages and wasted the hours till the Romans exposed without shelter to the burning rays of the sun were exhausted by thirst hunger and intolerable fatigue The emperor was persuaded to send an ambassador to the Gothic camp the zeal of Richomer who alone had courage to accept the dangerous commission was applauded and the count of the domestics adorned with the splendid ensigns of his dignity had proceeded some way in the space between the two armies when he was suddenly recalled by the alarm of battle The hasty and imprudent attack was made by Bacurius the Iberian who commanded a body of archers and targeteers and as they advanced with rashness they retreated with loss and disgrace In the same moment the flying squadrons of Alatheus and Saphrax whose return was anxiously expected by the general of the Goths descended like a whirlwind from the hills swept across the plain and added new terrors to the tumultuous but irresistible charge of the Barbarian host The event of the battle of Hadrianople so fatal to Valens and to the empire may be described in a few words the Roman cavalry fled the infantry was abandoned surrounded and cut in pieces The most skilful evolutions the firmest courage are scarcely sufficient to extricate a body of foot encompassed on an open plain by superior numbers of horse but the troops of Valens oppressed by the weight of the enemy and their own fears were crowded into a narrow space where it was impossible for them to extend their ranks or even to use with effect their swords and javelins In the midst of tumult of slaughter and of dismay the emperor deserted by his guards and wounded as it was supposed with an arrow sought protection among the Lancearii and the Mattiarii who still maintained their ground with some appearance of order and firmness His faithful generals Trajan and Victor who perceived his danger loudly exclaimed that all was lost unless the person of the emperor could be saved Some troops animated by their exhortation advanced to his relief they found only a bloody spot covered with a heap of broken arms and mangled bodies without being able to discover their unfortunate prince either among the living or the dead Their search could not indeed be successful if there is any truth in the circumstances with which some historians have related the death of the emperor By the care of his attendants Valens was removed from the field of battle to a neighboring cottage where they attempted to dress his wound and to provide for his future safety But this humble retreat was instantly surrounded by the enemy they tried to force the door they were provoked by a discharge of arrows from the roof till at length impatient of delay they set fire to a pile of dry magots and consumed the cottage with the Roman emperor and his train Valens perished in the flames and a youth who dropped from the window alone escaped to attest the melancholy tale and to inform the Goths of the inestimable prize which they had lost by their own rashness A great number of brave and distinguished officers perished in the battle of Hadrianople which equalled in the actual loss and far surpassed in the fatal consequences the misfortune which Rome had formerly sustained in the fields of Cannae ninety three Two master generals of the cavalry and infantry two great officers of the palace and thirty five tribunes were found among the slain and the death of Sebastian might satisfy the world that he was the victim as well as the author of the public calamity Above two thirds of the Roman army were destroyed and the darkness of the night was esteemed a very favorable circumstance as it served to conceal the flight of the multitude and to protect the more orderly retreat of Victor and Richomer who alone amidst the general consternation maintained the advantage of calm courage and regular discipline ninety four Footnote ninety one Ammianus xxxi twelve thirteen almost alone describes the councils and actions which were terminated by the fatal battle of Hadrianople We might censure the vices of his style the disorder and perplexity of his narrative but we must now take leave of this impartial historian and reproach is silenced by our regret for such an irreparable loss Footnote ninety two The difference of the eight miles of Ammianus and the twelve of Idatius can only embarrass those critics Valesius ad loc who suppose a great army to be a mathematical point without space or dimensions Footnote ninety three Nec ulla annalibus praeter Cannensem pugnam ita ad internecionem res legitur gesta Ammian xxxi thirteen According to the grave

thirty eight Sozomen l vi c forty Idatius in Chron But their united evidence if weighed against Ammianus alone is light and unsubstantial While the impressions of grief and terror were still recent in the minds of men the most celebrated rhetorician of the age composed the funeral oration of a vanquished army and of an unpopular prince whose throne was already occupied by a stranger There are not wanting says the candid Libanius those who arraign the prudence of the emperor or who impute the public misfortune to the want of courage and discipline in the troops For my own part I reverence the memory of their former exploits I reverence the glorious death which they bravely received standing and fighting in their ranks I reverence the field of battle stained with their blood and the blood of the Barbarians Those honorable marks have been already washed away by the rains but the lofty monuments of their bones the bones of generals of centurions and of valiant warriors claim a longer period of duration The king himself fought and fell in the foremost ranks of the battle His attendants presented him with the fleetest horses of the Imperial stable that would soon have carried him beyond the pursuit of the enemy They vainly pressed him to reserve his important life for the future service of the republic He still declared that he was unworthy to survive so many of the bravest and most faithful of his subjects and the monarch was nobly buried under a mountain of the slain Let none therefore presume to ascribe the victory of the Barbarians to the fear the weakness or the imprudence of the Roman troops The chiefs and the soldiers were animated by the virtue of their ancestors whom they equalled in discipline and the arts of war Their generous emulation was supported by the love of glory which prompted them to contend at the same time with heat and thirst with fire and the sword and cheerfully to embrace an honorable death as their refuge against flight and infamy The indignation of the gods has been the only cause of the success of our enemies The truth of history may disclaim some parts of this panegyric which cannot strictly be reconciled with the character of Valens or the circumstances of the battle but the fairest commendation is due to the eloquence and still more to the generosity of the sophist of Antioch ninety five Footnote ninety five Libanius de ulciscend Julian nece c three in Fabricius Bibliot Graec tom vii p one hundred forty six one hundred forty eight The pride of the Goths was elated by this memorable victory but their avarice was disappointed by the mortifying discovery that the richest part of the Imperial spoil had been within the walls of Hadrianople They hastened to possess the reward of their valor but they were encountered by the remains of a vanquished army with an intrepid resolution which was the effect of their despair and the only hope of their safety The walls of the city and the ramparts of the adjacent camp were lined with military engines that threw stones of an enormous weight and astonished the ignorant Barbarians by the noise and velocity still more than by the real effects of the discharge The soldiers the citizens the provincials the domestics of the palace were united in the danger and in the defence the furious assault of the Goths was repulsed their secret arts of treachery and treason were discovered and after an obstinate conflict of many hours they retired to their tents convinced by experience that it would be far more advisable to observe the treaty which their sagacious leader had tacitly stipulated with the fortifications of great and populous cities After the hasty and impolitic massacre of three hundred deserters an act of justice extremely useful to the discipline of the Roman armies the Goths indignantly raised the siege of Hadrianople The scene of war and tumult was instantly converted into a silent solitude the multitude suddenly disappeared the secret paths of the woods and mountains were marked with the footsteps of the trembling fugitives who sought a refuge in the distant cities of Illyricum and Macedonia and the faithful officers of the household and the treasury cautiously proceeded in search of the emperor of whose death they were still ignorant The tide of the Gothic inundation rolled from the walls of Hadrianople to the suburbs of Constantinople The Barbarians were surprised with the splendid appearance of the capital of the East the height and extent of the walls the myriads of wealthy and affrighted citizens who crowded the ramparts and the various prospect of the sea and land While they gazed with hopeless desire on the inaccessible beauties of Constantinople a sally was made from one of the gates by a party of Saracens ninety six who had been fortunately engaged in the service of Valens The cavalry of Scythia was forced to yield to the admirable swiftness and spirit of the Arabian horses their riders were skilled in the evolutions of irregular war and the Northern Barbarians were astonished and dismayed by the inhuman ferocity of the Barbarians of the South A Gothic soldier was slain by the dagger of an Arab and the hairy naked savage applying his lips to the wound expressed a horrid delight while he sucked the blood of his vanquished enemy ninety seven The army of the Goths laden with the spoils of the wealthy suburbs and the adjacent territory slowly moved from the Bosphorus to the mountains which form the western boundary of Thrace The important pass of Succi was betrayed by the fear or the misconduct of Maurus and the Barbarians who no longer had any resistance to apprehend from the scattered and vanquished troops of the East spread themselves over the face of a fertile and cultivated country as far as the confines of Italy and the Hadriatic Sea ninety eight Footnote ninety six Valens had gained or rather purchased the friendship of the Saracens whose vexatious inroads were felt on the borders of Phoenicia Palestine and Egypt The Christian faith had been lately introduced among a people reserved in a future age to propagate another religion Tillemont Hist des

simple circumstantial narrative did such a narrative exist of the ruin of a single town of the misfortunes of a single family one hundred might exhibit an interesting and instructive picture of human manners but the tedious repetition of vague and declamatory complaints would fatigue the attention of the most patient reader The same censure may be applied though not perhaps in an equal degree to the profane and the ecclesiastical writers of this unhappy period that their minds were inflamed by popular and religious animosity and that the true size and color of every object is falsified by the exaggerations of their corrupt eloquence The vehement Jerom one hundred one might justly deplore the calamities inflicted by the Goths and their barbarous allies on his native country of Pannonia and the wide extent of the provinces from the walls of Constantinople to the foot of the Julian Alps the rapes the massacres the conflagrations and above all the profanation of the churches that were turned into stables and the contemptuous treatment of the relics of holy martyrs But the Saint is surely transported beyond the limits of nature and history when he affirms that in those desert countries nothing was left except the sky and the earth that after the destruction of the cities and the extirpation of the human race the land was overgrown with thick forests and inextricable brambles and that the universal desolation announced by the prophet Zephaniah was accomplished in the scarcity of the beasts the birds and even of the fish These complaints were pronounced about twenty years after the death of Valens and the Illyrian provinces which were constantly exposed to the invasion and passage of the Barbarians still continued after a calamitous period of ten centuries to supply new materials for rapine and destruction Could it even be supposed that a large tract of country had been left without cultivation and without inhabitants the consequences might not have been so fatal to the inferior productions of animated nature The useful and feeble animals which are nourished by the hand of man might suffer and perish if they were deprived of his protection but the beasts of the forest his enemies or his victims would multiply in the free and undisturbed possession of their solitary domain The various tribes that people the air or the waters are still less connected with the fate of the human species and it is highly probable that the fish of the Danube would have felt more terror and distress from the approach of a voracious pike than from the hostile inroad of a Gothic army Footnote ninety nine Observe with how much indifference Caesar relates in the Commentaries of the Gallic war that he put to death the whole senate of the Veneti who had yielded

of Europe there was reason to fear that the same calamities would soon extend to the peaceful countries of Asia The sons of the Goths had been judiciously distributed through the cities of the East and the arts of education were employed to polish and subdue the native fierceness of their temper In the space of about twelve years their numbers had continually increased and the children who in the first emigration were sent over the Hellespont had attained with rapid growth the strength and spirit of perfect manhood one hundred two It was impossible to conceal from their knowledge the events of the Gothic war and as those daring youths had not studied the language of dissimulation they betrayed their wish their desire perhaps their intention to emulate the glorious example of their fathers The danger of the times seemed to justify the jealous suspicions of the provincials and these suspicions were admitted as unquestionable evidence that the Goths of Asia had formed a secret and dangerous conspiracy against the public safety The death of Valens had left the East without a sovereign and Julius who filled the important station of master general of the troops with a high reputation of diligence and ability thought it his duty to consult the senate of Constantinople which he considered during the vacancy of the throne as the representative council of the nation As soon as he had obtained the discretionary power of acting as he should judge most expedient for the good of the republic he assembled the principal officers and privately concerted effectual measures for the execution of his bloody design An order was immediately promulgated that on a stated day the Gothic youth should assemble in the capital cities of their respective provinces and as a report was industriously circulated that they were summoned to receive a liberal gift of lands and money the pleasing hope allayed the fury of their resentment and perhaps suspended the motions of the conspiracy On the appointed day the unarmed crowd of the Gothic youth was carefully collected in the square or Forum the streets and avenues were occupied by the Roman troops and the roofs of the houses were covered with archers and slingers At the same hour in all the cities of the East the signal was given of indiscriminate slaughter and the provinces of Asia were delivered by the cruel prudence of Julius from a domestic enemy who in a few months might have carried fire and sword from the Hellespont to the Euphrates one hundred three The urgent consideration of the public safety may undoubtedly authorize the violation of every positive law How far that or any other consideration may operate to dissolve the natural obligations of humanity and justice is a doctrine of which I still desire to remain ignorant Footnote one hundred two Eunapius in Excerpt Legat p twenty foolishly supposes a praeternatural growth of the young Goths that he may introduce Cadmus s armed men who sprang from the

Zosimus who is curious and copious l iv p two hundred thirty three two hundred thirty six mistakes the date and labors to find the reason why Julius did not consult the emperor Theodosius who had not yet ascended the throne of the East The emperor Gratian was far advanced on his march towards the plains of Hadrianople when he was informed at first by the confused voice of fame and afterwards by the more accurate reports of Victor and Richomer that his impatient colleague had been slain in battle and that two thirds of the Roman army were exterminated by the sword of the victorious Goths Whatever resentment the rash and jealous vanity of his uncle might deserve the resentment of a generous mind is easily subdued by the softer emotions of grief and compassion and even the sense of pity was soon lost in the serious and alarming consideration of the state of the republic Gratian was too late to assist he was too weak to revenge his unfortunate colleague and the valiant and modest youth felt himself unequal to the support of a sinking world A formidable tempest of the Barbarians of Germany seemed ready to burst over the provinces of Gaul and the mind of Gratian was oppressed and distracted by the administration of the Western empire In this important crisis the government of the East and the conduct of the Gothic war required the undivided attention of a hero and a statesman A subject invested with such ample command would not long have preserved his fidelity to a distant benefactor and the Imperial council embraced the wise and manly resolution of conferring an obligation rather than of yielding to an insult It was the wish of Gratian to bestow the purple as the reward of virtue but at the age of nineteen it is not easy for a prince educated in the supreme rank to understand the true characters of his ministers and generals He attempted to weigh with an impartial hand their various merits and defects and whilst he checked the rash confidence of ambition he distrusted the cautious wisdom which despaired of the republic As each moment of delay diminished something of the power and resources of the future sovereign of the East the situation of the times would not allow a tedious debate The choice of Gratian was soon declared in favor of an exile whose father only three years before had suffered under the sanction of his authority an unjust and ignominious death The great Theodosius a name celebrated in history and dear to the Catholic church one hundred four was summoned to the Imperial court which had gradually retreated from the confines of Thrace to the more secure station of Sirmium Five months after the death of Valens the emperor Gratian produced before the assembled troops his colleague and their master who after a modest perhaps a sincere resistance was compelled to accept amidst the general acclamations the diadem the purple and the equal title of Augustus one hundred five The provinces of Thrace Asia and Egypt over which Valens had reigned were resigned to the administration of the new emperor but as he was specially intrusted with the conduct of the Gothic war the Illyrian praefecture was dismembered and the two great dioceses of Dacia and Macedonia were added to the dominions of the Eastern empire one hundred six Footnote one hundred four A life of Theodosius the Great was composed in the last century Paris

and the talents of Hadrian was the orignal seat of another family of Spaniards who in a less fortunate age possessed near fourscore years the declining empire of Rome one hundred eight They emerged from the obscurity of municipal honors by the active spirit of the elder Theodosius a general whose exploits in Britain and Africa have formed one of the most splendid parts of the annals of Valentinian The son of that general who likewise bore the name of Theodosius was educated by skilful preceptors in the liberal studies of youth but he was instructed in the art of war by the tender care and severe discipline of his father one hundred nine Under the standard of such a leader young Theodosius sought glory and knowledge in the most distant scenes of military action inured his constitution to the difference of seasons and climates distinguished his valor by sea and land and observed the various warfare of the Scots the Saxons and the Moors His own merit and the recommendation of the conqueror of Africa soon raised him to a separate command and in the station of Duke of Misaea he vanquished an army of Sarmatians saved the province deserved the love of the soldiers and provoked the envy of the court one hundred ten His rising fortunes were soon blasted by the disgrace and execution of his illustrious father and Theodosius obtained as a favor the permission of retiring to a private life in his native province of Spain He displayed a firm and temperate character in the ease with which he adapted himself to this new situation His time was almost equally divided between the town and country the spirit which had animated his public conduct was shown in the active and affectionate performance of every social duty and the diligence of the soldier was profitably converted to the improvement of his ample patrimony one hundred eleven which lay between Valladolid and Segovia in the midst of a fruitful district still famous for a most exquisite breed of sheep one hundred twelve From the innocent but humble labors of his farm Theodosius was transported in less than four months to the throne of the Eastern empire and the whole period of the history of the world will not perhaps afford a similar example of an elevation at the same time so pure and so honorable The princes who peaceably inherit the sceptre of their fathers claim and enjoy a legal right the more secure as it is absolutely distinct from the merits of their personal characters The subjects who in a monarchy or a popular state acquire the possession of supreme power may have raised themselves by the superiority either of genius or virtue above the heads of their equals but their virtue is seldom exempt from ambition and the cause of the successful candidate is frequently stained by the guilt of conspiracy or civil war Even in those governments which allow the reigning monarch to declare a colleague or a successor his partial choice which may be influenced by the blindest passions is often directed to an unworthy object But the most suspicious malignity cannot ascribe to Theodosius in his obscure solitude of Caucha the arts the desires or even the hopes of an ambitious statesman and the name of the Exile would long since have been forgotten if his genuine and distinguished virtues had not left a deep impression in the Imperial court During the season of prosperity he had been neglected but in the public distress his superior merit was universally felt and acknowledged What confidence must have been reposed in his integrity since Gratian could trust that a pious son would forgive for the sake of the republic the murder of his father What expectations must have been formed of his abilities to encourage the hope that a single man could save and restore the empire of the East Theodosius was invested with the purple in the thirty third year of his age The vulgar gazed with admiration on the manly beauty of his face and the graceful majesty of his person which they were pleased to compare with the pictures and medals of the emperor Trajan whilst intelligent observers discovered in the qualities of his heart and understanding a more important resemblance to the best and greatest of the Roman princes Footnote one hundred seven Italica founded by Scipio Africanus for his wounded veterans of Italy The ruins still appear about a

consequently prefers the youth of Theodosius to the military education of Alexander Hannibal and the second Africanus who like him had served under their fathers xii eight Footnote one hundred ten Ammianus xxix six mentions this victory of Theodosius Junior Dux Maesiae prima etiam tum lanugine juvenis princeps postea perspectissimus The same fact is attested by Themistius and Zosimus but Theodoret l v c five who adds some curious circumstances strangely applies it to the time of the interregnum Footnote one hundred eleven Pacatus in Panegyr Vet xii nine prefers the rustic life of

Caucha or Coca in the old province of Gallicia where Zosimus and Idatius have placed the birth or patrimony of Theodosius It is not without the most sincere regret that I must now take leave of an accurate and faithful guide who has composed the history of his own times without indulging the prejudices and passions which usually affect the mind of a contemporary Ammianus Marcellinus who terminates his useful work with the defeat and death of Valens recommends the more glorious subject of the ensuing reign to the youthful vigor and eloquence of the rising generation one hundred thirteen The rising generation was not disposed to accept his advice or to imitate his example one hundred fourteen and in the study of the reign of Theodosius we are reduced to illustrate the partial narrative of Zosimus by the obscure hints of fragments and chronicles by the figurative style of poetry or panegyric and by the precarious assistance of the ecclesiastical writers who in the heat of religious faction are apt to despise the profane virtues of sincerity and moderation Conscious of these disadvantages which will continue to involve a considerable portion of the decline and fall of the Roman empire I shall proceed with doubtful and timorous steps Yet I may boldly pronounce that the battle of Hadrianople was never revenged by any signal or decisive victory of Theodosius over the Barbarians and the expressive silence of his venal orators may be confirmed by the observation of the condition and circumstances of the times The fabric of a mighty state which has been reared by the labors of successive ages could not be overturned by the misfortune of a single day if the fatal power of the imagination did not exaggerate the real measure of the calamity The loss of forty thousand Romans who fell in the plains of Hadrianople might have been soon recruited in the populous provinces of the East which contained so many millions of inhabitants The courage of a soldier is found to be the cheapest and most common quality of human nature and sufficient skill to encounter an undisciplined foe might have been speedily taught by the care of the surviving centurions If the Barbarians were mounted on the horses and equipped with the armor of their vanquished enemies the numerous studs of Cappadocia and Spain would have supplied new squadrons of cavalry the thirty four arsenals of the empire were plentifully stored with magazines of offensive and defensive arms and the wealth of Asia might still have yielded an ample fund for the expenses of the war But the effects which were produced by the battle of Hadrianople on the minds of the Barbarians and of the Romans extended the victory of the former and the defeat of the latter far beyond the limits of a single day A Gothic chief was heard to declare with insolent moderation that for his own part he was fatigued with slaughter but that he was astonished how a people who fled before him like a flock of sheep could still presume to dispute the possession of their treasures and provinces one hundred fifteen The same terrors which the name of the Huns had spread among the Gothic tribes were inspired by the formidable name of the Goths among the subjects and soldiers of the Roman empire one hundred sixteen If Theodosius hastily collecting his scattered forces had led them into the field to encounter a victorious enemy his army would have been vanquished by their own fears and his rashness could not have been excused by the chance of success But the great Theodosius an epithet which he honorably deserved on this momentous occasion conducted himself as the firm and faithful guardian of the republic He fixed his head quarters at Thessalonica the capital of the Macedonian diocese one hundred seventeen from whence he could watch the irregular motions of the Barbarians and direct the operations of his lieutenants from the gates of Constantinople to the shores of the Hadriatic The fortifications and garrisons of the cities were strengthened and the troops among whom a sense of order and discipline was revived were insensibly emboldened by the confidence of their own safety From these secure stations they were encouraged to make frequent sallies on the Barbarians who infested the adjacent country and as they were seldom allowed to engage without some decisive superiority either of ground or of numbers their enterprises were for the most part successful and they were soon convinced by their own experience of the possibility of vanquishing their invincible enemies The detachments of these separate garrisons were generally united into small armies the same cautious measures were pursued according to an extensive and well concerted plan of operations the events of each day added strength and spirit to the Roman arms and the artful diligence of the emperor who circulated the most favorable reports of the success of the war contributed to subdue the pride of the Barbarians and to animate the hopes and courage of his subjects If instead of this faint and imperfect outline we could accurately represent the counsels and actions of Theodosius in four successive campaigns there is reason to believe that his consummate skill would deserve the applause of every military reader The republic had formerly been saved by the delays of Fabius and while the splendid trophies of Scipio in the field of Zama attract the eyes of posterity the camps and marches of the dictator among the hills of the Campania may claim a juster proportion of the solid and independent fame which the general is not compelled to share either with fortune or with his troops Such was likewise the merit of Theodosius and the infirmities of his body which most unseasonably languished under a long and dangerous disease could not oppress the vigor of his mind or divert his attention from the public service one hundred eighteen Footnote one hundred thirteen Let us hear Ammianus himself Haec ut

valor the prudence of Theodosius was seconded by fortune and the emperor never failed to seize and to improve every favorable circumstance As long as the superior genius of Fritigern preserved the union and directed the motions of the Barbarians their power was not inadequate to the conquest of a great empire The death of that hero the predecessor and master of the renowned Alaric relieved an impatient multitude from the intolerable yoke of discipline and discretion The Barbarians who had been restrained by his authority abandoned themselves to the dictates of their passions and their passions were seldom uniform or consistent An army of conquerors was broken into many disorderly bands of savage robbers and their blind and irregular fury was not less pernicious to themselves than to their enemies Their mischievous disposition was shown in the destruction of every object which they wanted strength to remove or taste to enjoy and they often consumed with improvident rage the harvests or the granaries which soon afterwards became necessary for their own subsistence A spirit of discord arose among the independent tribes and nations which had been united only by the bands of a loose and voluntary alliance The troops of the Huns and the Alani would naturally upbraid the flight of the Goths who were not disposed to use with moderation the advantages of their fortune the ancient jealousy of the Ostrogoths and the Visigoths could not long be suspended and the haughty chiefs still remembered the insults and injuries which they had reciprocally offered or sustained while the nation was seated in the countries beyond the Danube The progress of domestic faction abated the more diffusive sentiment of national animosity and the officers of Theodosius were instructed to purchase with liberal gifts and promises the retreat or service of the discontented party The acquisition of Modar a prince of the royal blood of the Amali gave a bold and faithful champion to the cause of Rome The illustrious deserter soon obtained the rank of master general with an important command surprised an army of his countrymen who were immersed in wine and sleep and after a cruel slaughter of the astonished Goths returned with an immense spoil and four thousand wagons to the Imperial camp one hundred twenty In the hands of a skilful politician the most different means may be successfully applied to the same ends and the peace of the empire which had been forwarded by the divisions was accomplished by the reunion of the Gothic nation Athanaric who had been a patient spectator of these extraordinary events was at length driven by the chance of arms from the dark recesses of the woods of Caucaland He no longer hesitated to pass the Danube and a very considerable part of the subjects of Fritigern who already felt the inconveniences of anarchy were easily persuaded to acknowledge for their king a Gothic Judge whose birth they respected and whose abilities they had frequently experienced But age had chilled the daring spirit of Athanaric and instead of leading his people to the field of battle and victory he wisely listened to the fair proposal of an honorable and advantageous treaty Theodosius who was acquainted with the merit and power of his new ally condescended to meet him at the distance of several miles from Constantinople and entertained him in the Imperial city with the confidence of a friend and the magnificence of a monarch The Barbarian prince observed with curious attention the variety of objects which attracted his notice and at last broke out into a sincere and passionate exclamation of wonder I now behold said he what I never could believe the glories of this stupendous capital And as he cast his eyes around he viewed and he admired the commanding situation of the city the strength and beauty of the walls and public edifices the capacious harbor crowded with innumerable vessels the perpetual concourse of distant nations and the arms and discipline of the troops Indeed continued Athanaric the emperor of the Romans is a god upon earth and the presumptuous man who dares to lift his hand against him is guilty of his own blood one hundred twenty one The Gothic king did not long enjoy this splendid and honorable reception and as temperance was not the virtue of his nation it may justly be suspected that his mortal disease was contracted amidst the pleasures of the Imperial banquets But the policy of Theodosius derived more solid benefit from the death than he could have expected from the most faithful services of his ally The funeral of Athanaric was performed with solemn rites in the capital of the East a stately monument was erected to his memory and his whole army won by the liberal courtesy and decent grief of Theodosius enlisted under the standard of the Roman empire one hundred twenty two The submission of so great a body of the Visigoths was productive of the most salutary consequences and the mixed influence of force of reason and of corruption became every day more powerful and more extensive Each independent chieftain hastened to obtain a separate treaty from the apprehension that an obstinate delay might expose him alone and unprotected to the revenge or justice of the conqueror The general or rather the final capitulation of the Goths may be dated four years one month

inquit sine dubio est terrenus Imperator et quisquis adversus eum manum moverit ipse sui sanguinis reus existit Jornandes c xxviii p six hundred fifty proceeds to mention his death and funeral Footnote one hundred twenty two Jornandes c xxviii p six hundred fifty Even Zosimus l v p two hundred forty six is compelled to approve the generosity of Theodosius so honorable to himself and so beneficial to the public Footnote one hundred twenty three The short but authentic hints in the Fasti of Idatius Chron Scaliger p fifty two are stained with contemporary passion The fourteenth oration of Themistius is a compliment to Peace and the consul Saturninus A D three hundred eighty three The provinces of the Danube had been already relieved from the oppressive weight of the Gruthungi or Ostrogoths by the voluntary retreat of Alatheus and Saphrax whose restless spirit had prompted them to seek new scenes of rapine and glory Their destructive course was pointed towards the West but we must be satisfied with a very obscure and imperfect knowledge of their various adventures The Ostrogoths impelled several of the German tribes on the provinces of Gaul concluded and soon violated a treaty with the emperor Gratian advanced into the unknown countries of the North and after an interval of more than four years returned with accumulated force to the banks of the Lower Danube Their troops were recruited with the fiercest warriors of Germany and Scythia and the soldiers or at least the historians of the empire no longer recognized the name and countenances of their former enemies one hundred twenty four The general who commanded the military and naval powers of the Thracian frontier soon perceived that his superiority would be disadvantageous to the public service and that the Barbarians awed by the presence of his fleet and legions would probably defer the passage of the river till the approaching winter The dexterity of the spies whom he sent into the Gothic camp allured the Barbarians into a fatal snare They were persuaded that by a bold attempt they might surprise in the silence and darkness of the night the sleeping army of the Romans and the whole multitude was hastily embarked in a fleet of three thousand canoes one hundred twenty five The bravest of the Ostrogoths led the van the main body consisted of the remainder of their subjects and soldiers and the women and children securely followed in the rear One of the nights without a moon had been selected for the execution of their design and they had almost reached the southern bank of the Danube in the firm confidence that they should find an easy landing and an unguarded camp But the progress of the Barbarians was suddenly stopped by an unexpected obstacle a triple line of vessels strongly connected with each other and which formed an impenetrable chain of two miles and a half along the river While they struggled to force their way in the unequal conflict their right flank was overwhelmed by the irresistible attack of a fleet of galleys which were urged down the stream by the united impulse of oars and of the tide The weight and velocity of those ships of war broke and sunk and dispersed the rude and feeble canoes of the Barbarians their valor was ineffectual and Alatheus the king or general of the Ostrogoths perished with his bravest troops either by the sword of the Romans or in the waves of the Danube The last division of this unfortunate fleet might regain the opposite shore but the distress and disorder of the multitude rendered them alike incapable either of action or counsel and they soon implored the clemency of the victorious enemy On this occasion as well as on many others it is a difficult task to reconcile the passions and prejudices of the writers of the age of Theodosius The partial and malignant historian who misrepresents every action of his reign affirms that the emperor did not appear in the field of battle till the Barbarians had been vanquished by the valor and conduct of his lieutenant Promotus one hundred twenty six The flattering poet who celebrated in the court of Honorius the glory of the father and of the son ascribes the victory to the personal prowess of Theodosius and almost insinuates that the king of the Ostrogoths was slain by the hand of the emperor one hundred twenty seven The truth of history might perhaps be found in a just medium between these extreme and contradictory assertions Footnote one hundred twenty four Zosimus l iv p two hundred fifty two Footnote one hundred twenty five I am justified by reason and example in applying this Indian name to the the Barbarians the single trees hollowed into the shape of a boat Zosimus l iv p two hundred fifty three Ausi Danubium quondam tranare Gruthungi In lintres fregere nemus ter mille ruebant Per fluvium plenae cuneis immanibus alni Claudian in iv Cols honorable six hundred twenty three Footnote one hundred twenty six Zosimus l iv p two hundred fifty two two hundred fifty five He too frequently betrays his poverty of judgment by disgracing the most serious narratives with trifling and incredible circumstances Footnote one hundred twenty seven Odothaei Regis opima Retulit Ver six hundred thirty two The opima were the spoils which a Roman general could only win from the king or general of the enemy whom he had slain with his own hands and no more than three such examples are celebrated in the victorious ages of Rome The original treaty which fixed the settlement of the Goths ascertained their privileges and stipulated their obligations would illustrate the history of Theodosius and his successors The series of their history has imperfectly preserved the spirit and substance of this single agreement one hundred twenty eight The ravages of war and tyranny had provided many large tracts of fertile but uncultivated land for the use of those Barbarians who might not disdain the practice of agriculture A numerous colony of the Visigoths was seated in Thrace the remains of the Ostrogoths were planted in Phrygia and Lydia their immediate wants were supplied by a distribution of corn and cattle and their future industry was encouraged by an exemption from tribute during a certain term of years The Barbarians would have deserved to feel the cruel and perfidious policy of the Imperial court if they had suffered themselves to be dispersed through the provinces They required and they obtained the sole possession of the villages and districts assigned for their residence they still cherished and propagated their native manners and language asserted in the bosom of despotism the freedom of their domestic government and acknowledged the sovereignty of the emperor without submitting to the inferior jurisdiction of the laws and magistrates of Rome The hereditary chiefs of the tribes and families were still permitted to command their followers in peace and war but the royal dignity was abolished and the generals of the Goths were appointed and removed at the pleasure of the emperor An army of forty thousand Goths was maintained for the perpetual service of the empire of the East and those haughty troops who assumed the title of Foederati or allies were distinguished by their gold collars liberal pay and licentious privileges Their native courage was improved by the use of arms and the knowledge of discipline and while the republic was guarded or threatened by the doubtful sword of the Barbarians the last sparks of the military flame were finally extinguished in the minds of the Romans one hundred twenty nine Theodosius had the address to persuade his allies that the conditions of peace which had been extorted from him by prudence and necessity were the voluntary expressions of his sincere friendship for the Gothic nation one hundred thirty A different mode of vindication or apology was opposed to the complaints of the people who loudly censured these shameful and dangerous concessions one hundred thirty one The calamities of the war were painted in the most lively colors and the first symptoms of the return of order of plenty and security were diligently exaggerated The advocates of Theodosius could affirm with some appearance of truth and reason that it was impossible to extirpate so many warlike tribes who were rendered desperate by the loss of their native country and that the exhausted provinces would be revived by a fresh supply of soldiers and husbandmen The Barbarians still wore an angry and hostile aspect but the experience of past times might encourage the hope that they would acquire the habits of industry and obedience that their manners would be polished by time education and the influence of Christianity and that their posterity would insensibly blend with the great body of the Roman people one hundred thirty two Footnote one hundred twenty eight See Themistius Orat xvi p two hundred eleven Claudian in Eutrop l ii one hundred twelve mentions the Phrygian colony Ostrogothis colitur mistisque Gruthungis Phyrx ager and then proceeds to name the rivers of Lydia the Pactolus and Herreus Footnote one hundred twenty nine Compare Jornandes c xx twenty seven who marks the condition and number of the Gothic Foederati with Zosimus l iv p two hundred fifty eight who mentions their golden collars and Pacatus in Panegyr Vet xii thirty seven who applauds with false or foolish joy their bravery and discipline Footnote one hundred thirty Amator pacis generisque Gothorum is the praise bestowed by the Gothic historian c xxix who represents his nation as innocent peaceable men slow to anger and patient of injuries According to Livy the Romans conquered the world in their own defence Footnote one hundred thirty one Besides the partial invectives of Zosimus always discontented with the Christian reigns see the grave representations which Synesius addresses to the emperor Arcadius de Regno p twenty five twenty six edit Petav The philosophic bishop of Cyrene was near enough to judge and he was sufficiently removed from the temptation of fear or flattery Footnote one hundred thirty two Themistius Orat xvi p two hundred eleven two hundred twelve composes an elaborate and rational apology which is not however exempt from the puerilities of Greek rhetoric Orpheus could only charm the wild beasts of Thrace but Theodosius enchanted the men and women whose predecessors in the same country had torn Orpheus in pieces c Notwithstanding these specious arguments and these sanguine expectations it was apparent to every discerning eye that the Goths would long remain the enemies and might soon become the conquerors of the Roman empire Their rude and insolent behavior expressed their contempt of the citizens and provincials whom they insulted with impunity one hundred thirty three To the zeal and valor of the Barbarians Theodosius was indebted for the success of his arms but their assistance was precarious and they were sometimes seduced by a treacherous and inconstant disposition to abandon his standard at the moment when their service was the most essential During the civil war against Maximus a great number of Gothic deserters retired into the morasses of Macedonia wasted the adjacent provinces and obliged the intrepid monarch to expose his person and exert his power to suppress the rising flame of rebellion one hundred thirty four The public apprehensions were fortified by the strong suspicion that these tumults were not the effect of accidental passion but the result of deep and premeditated design It was generally believed that the Goths had signed the treaty of peace with a hostile and insidious spirit and that their chiefs had previously bound themselves by a solemn and secret oath never to keep faith with the Romans to maintain the fairest show of loyalty and friendship and to watch the favorable moment of rapine of conquest and of revenge But as the minds of the Barbarians were not insensible to the power of gratitude several of the Gothic leaders sincerely devoted themselves to the service of the empire or at least of the emperor the whole nation was insensibly divided into two opposite factions and much sophistry was employed in conversation and dispute to compare the obligations of their first and second engagements The Goths who considered themselves as the friends of peace of justice and of Rome were directed by the authority of Fravitta a valiant and honorable youth distinguished above the rest of his countrymen by the politeness of his manners the liberality of his sentiments and the mild virtues of social life But the more numerous faction adhered to the fierce and faithless Priulf one hundred thirty foura who inflamed the passions and asserted the independence of his warlike followers On one of the solemn festivals when the chiefs of both parties were invited to the Imperial table they were insensibly heated by wine till they forgot the usual restraints of discretion and respect and betrayed in the presence of Theodosius the fatal secret of their domestic disputes The emperor who had been the reluctant witness of this extraordinary controversy dissembled his fears and resentment and soon dismissed the tumultuous assembly Fravitta alarmed and exasperated by the insolence of his rival whose departure from the palace might have been the signal of a civil war boldly followed him and drawing his sword laid Priulf dead at his feet Their companions flew to arms and the faithful champion of Rome would have been oppressed by superior numbers if he had not been protected by the seasonable interposition of the Imperial guards one hundred thirty five Such were the scenes of Barbaric rage which disgraced the palace and table of the Roman emperor and as the impatient Goths could only be restrained by the firm and temperate character of Theodosius the public safety seemed to depend on the life and abilities of a single man one hundred thirty six Footnote one hundred thirty three Constantinople was deprived half a day of the public allowance of bread to expiate the murder of a Gothic soldier was the guilt of the people Libanius Orat xii p three hundred ninety four edit Morel Footnote one hundred thirty four Zosimus l iv p two hundred sixty seven two hundred seventy one He tells a long and ridiculous story of the adventurous prince who roved the country with only five horsemen of a spy whom they detected whipped and killed in an old woman s cottage c Footnote one hundred thirty foura Eunapius M Footnote one hundred thirty five Compare Eunapius in Excerpt Legat p twenty one twenty two with Zosimus l iv p two hundred seventy nine The difference of circumstances and names must undoubtedly be applied to the same story Fravitta or Travitta was afterwards consul A D four hundred one and still continued his faithful services to the eldest son of Theodosius Tillemont Hist des Empereurs tom v p
