3848-28169-0000	train-other-500	the first he had allowed himself since his marriage three years ago It was a house in De Crespigny Park unattached double fronted with half sunk basement and a flight of steps to the stucco pillars at the entrance
3848-28169-0001	train-other-500	De Crespigny Park a thoroughfare connecting Grove Lane Camberwell with Denmark Hill presents a double row of similar dwellings its clean breadth with foliage of trees and shrubs in front gardens
3848-28169-0002	train-other-500	makes it pleasant to the eye that finds pleasure in suburban London In point of respectability it has claims only to be appreciated by the ambitious middle class of Camberwell Each house seems to remind its neighbour
3848-28169-0003	train-other-500	with all the complacence expressible in buff brick that in this locality lodgings are not to let For an hour after Peachey s departure the silence of the house was unbroken
3848-28169-0004	train-other-500	Then a bedroom door opened and a lady in a morning gown of the fashionable heliotrope came downstairs She had acute features eyes which seemed to indicate the concentration of her thoughts upon a difficult problem
3848-28169-0005	train-other-500	and cheeks of singular bloom Her name was Beatrice French her years numbered six and twenty She entered the dining room and drew up the blind
3848-28169-0006	train-other-500	Though the furniture was less than a year old and by no means of the cheapest description slovenly housekeeping had dulled the brightness of every surface On a chair lay a broken toy one of those elaborate and costly playthings
3848-28169-0007	train-other-500	which serve no purpose but to stunt a child s imagination Though the time was midsummer not a flower appeared among the pretentious ornaments The pictures were a strange medley
3848-28169-0008	train-other-500	autotypes of some artistic value hanging side by side with hideous oleographs framed in ponderous
none	none	 gilding Miss then violently rang the bell When the summons had been twice French looked about her with an expression of strong disgust repeated there appeared a young woman whose features told of long and placid slumbers Well what does this mean The cook doesn t feel well miss she can t get up 
3848-28169-0009	train-other-500	Then get breakfast yourself and look sharp about it Beatrice spoke with vehemence her cheeks showed a circle of richer hue around the unchanging rose The domestic made insolent reply and
3848-28169-0010	train-other-500	there began a war of words At this moment another step sounded on the stairs and as it drew near a female voice was raised in song And a penny in his pocket la de da la de da
3848-28169-0011	train-other-500	and a penny in his pocket la de da A younger girl this of much slighter build with a frisky gait a jaunty pose of the head pretty but thin featured and shallow eyed a long neck
3848-28169-0012	train-other-500	no chin to speak of a low forehead with the hair of washed out flaxen fluffed all over it Her dress was showy
none	none	 and in a taste that set the teeth on edge 
3848-28169-0013	train-other-500	Fanny French her name What s up
none	none	 Another row 
3848-28169-0014	train-other-500	she asked entering the room as the servant went out I ve known a good many fools said Beatrice
none	none	 but Ada s the biggest I ve come across yet 
3848-28169-0015	train-other-500	Is she Well I shouldn t wonder Fanny admitted impartially And with a skip she took up her song again A penny paper collar round his neck la de da
none	none	 Are you going to church this morning 
3848-28169-0016	train-other-500	asked her sister Yes Are you Come for a walk instead
none	none	 There s something I want to talk to you about 
3848-28169-0017	train-other-500	Won t it do afterwards I ve got an appointment With Lord Fanny laughed and nodded Interrupted by the reappearance of the servant who brought a tray and began to lay the table
3848-28169-0018	train-other-500	they crossed the hall to the drawing room In half an hour s time a sluttish meal was prepared for them and whilst they were satisfying their hunger the door opened to admit missus Peachey
none	none	 Ada presented herself in a costume which at any season but high summer 
3848-28169-0019	train-other-500	would have been inconveniently cool Beneath a loose thin dressing gown her feet in felt slippers showed stockingless her neck was bare almost to the bosom and the tresses of pale yellow
3848-28169-0020	train-other-500	upon which she especially prided herself lay raggedly pinned together on the top of her flat head She was about twenty eight years old but at present looked more than thirty
3848-28169-0021	train-other-500	Her features resembled Fanny s but had a much less amiable expression and betokened if the thing were possible an inferior intellect Fresh from the morning basin her cheeks displayed that peculiar colourlessness
3848-28169-0022	train-other-500	which results from the habitual use of paints and powders her pale pink lips thin and sullen were curiously wrinkled she had eyes of slate colour with lids so elevated that she always seemed to be staring in silly wonder
3848-28169-0023	train-other-500	So you ve got breakfast have you were her first words in a thin and rather nasal voice You may think yourselves lucky You have a cheek of your own replied Beatrice Whose place is it to see that we get meals
none	none	 And what can any one do with servants like I ve got 
3848-28169-0024	train-other-500	retorted the married sister It s your own fault You should get better and when you ve got them you should manage them But that s just what you can t do
none	none	 Oh you d be a wonderful housekeeper we know all about that If you re not satisfied you d better find board and lodging somewhere else as I ve told you often enough You re not likely to get it as cheap 
3848-28169-0025	train-other-500	They squabbled for some minutes Fanny looking on with ingenuous amusement and putting in a word now for this side now for that
none	none	 And what am I going to have for breakfast 
3848-28169-0026	train-other-500	demanded missus Peachey at length surveying the table You ve taken jolly good care of yourselves it seems to me She jumped up and rang the bell When a minute s interval brought no reply she rang again
none	none	 Beatrice thought it probable that the bell might be rung without effect 
3848-28169-0027	train-other-500	till all was blue We ll see about that answered her sister and forthwith invaded the lower parts of the house Thence presently her voice became audible rising gradually to shrillness
3848-28169-0028	train-other-500	with it there blended the rougher accents of the housemaid now in reckless revolt Beatrice listened for a minute or two in the hall then passed on into the drawing room with a contemptuous laugh
none	none	 Fanny to whom the uproar seemed to bring a renewal of appetite 
3848-28169-0029	train-other-500	cut herself a slice of bread and butter
none	none	 and ate it as she stood at the window 
3848-28169-0030	train-other-500	Dirty cat beast swine The mistress of the house fairly beaten away by superior force of vocabulary reappeared with these and other exclamations her face livid
3848-28169-0031	train-other-500	her foolish eyes starting from their sockets Fanny a sort of Mother Cary s chicken
none	none	 revelled in the row 
3848-28169-0032	train-other-500	and screamed her merriment It was long before the domestic uproar wholly subsided but towards eleven o clock the sisters found themselves together in the drawing room
none	none	 Ada sprawled limply on a sofa 
3848-28169-0033	train-other-500	Beatrice sat with legs crossed in the most comfortable chair and Fanny twirled about on a music stool The only books in the room were a few show volumes which belonged to Arthur Peachey and half a dozen novels of the meaner kind
none	none	 wherewith Ada sometimes beguiled her infinite leisure 
3848-28169-0034	train-other-500	But on tables and chairs lay scattered a multitude of papers illustrated weeklies journals of society cheap miscellanies penny novelettes and the like At the end of the week when new numbers came in
none	none	 Ada Peachey passed many hours upon her sofa 
3848-28169-0035	train-other-500	reading instalments of a dozen serial stories paragraphs relating to fashion sport the theatre answers to correspondents wherein she especially delighted columns of facetiae
3848-28169-0036	train-other-500	and gossip about notorious people Through a great deal of this matter Beatrice followed her and
none	none	 read much besides in which Ada took no interest 
3848-28169-0037	train-other-500	she studied a daily newspaper with special note of law suits police intelligence wills bankruptcies and any concern great or small wherein money played a part
3848-28169-0038	train-other-500	She understood the nature of investments and liked to talk about stocks and shares with her male acquaintances They were the daughters of a Camberwell builder lately deceased to each of them had fallen a patrimony
3848-28169-0039	train-other-500	just sufficient for their support in elegant leisure
none	none	 Ada s money 
3848-28169-0040	train-other-500	united with a small capital in her husband s possession went to purchase a share in the business of Messrs
none	none	 Ducker Blunt company 
3848-28169-0041	train-other-500	manufacturers of disinfectants Arthur Peachey previously a clerk to the firm became a junior partner with the result that most of the hard work was thrown upon his shoulders At their marriage
3848-28169-0042	train-other-500	the happy pair first of all established themselves in a modest house near Camberwell Road two years later growing prosperity brought about their removal to De Crespigny Park where they had now resided for some twelve months
3848-28169-0043	train-other-500	Unlike their elder sister Beatrice and Fanny had learnt to support themselves Beatrice in the postal service and Fanny sweet blossom by mingling her fragrance with that of a florist s shop in Brixton
3848-28169-0044	train-other-500	but on their father s death both forsook their employment and came to live with missus Peachey Between them these two were the owners of house property
none	none	 which produced Lone hundred forty a year 
3848-28169-0045	train-other-500	They disbursed together
none	none	 a weekly sum of twenty four shillings for board and lodging and spent or saved the rest as their impulses dictated CHAPTER two Ada brooded over her wrongs Beatrice glanced over The Referee Fanny after twirling awhile in maiden meditation turned to the piano and jingled a melody from The Mikado She broke off suddenly and without looking round addressed her companions You can give the third seat at the Jubilee to somebody else I m provided for Who are you going with asked Ada My masher the girl replied with a giggle Where Shop windows in the Strand I think She resumed her jingling it was now Queen of my Heart Beatrice dropping her paper looked fixedly at the girl s profile with an eyelid droop which signified calculation How much is he really getting she inquired all at once Seventy five pounds a year Oh where oh where is my leetle dog gone Does he say asked missus Peachey that his governor will stump up They spoke a peculiar tongue the product of sham education and mock refinement grafted upon a stock of robust vulgarity One and all would have been moved to indignant surprise if accused of ignorance or defective breeding Ada had frequented an establishment for young ladies up to the close of her seventeenth year the other two had pursued culture at a still more pretentious institute until they were eighteen All could play the piano all declared and believed that they knew French Beatrice had done Political Economy Fanny had been through Inorganic Chemistry and Botany The truth was of course that their minds characters propensities had remained absolutely proof against such educational influence as had been brought to bear upon them That they used a finer accent than their servants signified only that they had grown up amid falsities and were enabled by the help of money to dwell above stairs instead of with their spiritual kindred below Anticipating Fanny s reply Beatrice observed with her air of sagacity If you think you re going to get anything out of an old screw like Lord you ll jolly soon find your mistake Don t you go and make a fool of yourself Fanny said missus Peachey Why he can t be more than twenty one is he He s turned twenty two The others laughed scornfully Can t I have who I like for a masher cried Fanny reddening a little Who said I was going to marry him I m in no particular hurry to get married You think everybody s like yourselves If there was any chance of old Lord turning up his toes said Beatrice thoughtfully I dare say he ll leave a tidy handful behind him but then he may live another ten years or more And there s Nancy exclaimed Ada Won t she get half the plunder May be plenty even then said Beatrice her head aside The piano business isn t a bad line I shouldn t wonder if he leaves ten or fifteen thousand Haven t you got anything out of Horace asked Ada of Fanny What has he told you He doesn t know much that s the fact Silly There you are His father treats him like a boy if he talked about marrying he d get a cuff on the ear Oh I know all about old Lord Ada proceeded He s a regular old tyrant Why you ve only to look at him And he thinks no small beer of himself either for all he lives in that grubby little house I shouldn t wonder if he thinks us beneath him She stared at her sisters inviting their comment on this ludicrous state of things I quite believe Nancy does said Fanny with a point of malice She s a stuck up thing declared missus Peachey And she gets worse as she gets older I shall never invite her again it s three times she has made an excuse all lies of course Who will she marry asked Beatrice in a tone of disinterested speculation missus Peachey answered with a sneer She s going to the Jubilee to pick up a fancy Prince As it happens objected Fanny she isn t going to the Jubilee at all At least she says she isn t She s above it so her brother told me I know who wants to marry her Ada remarked with a sour smile Who is that came from the others mister Crewe With a significant giggle Fanny glanced at the more sober of her sisters she the while touched her upper lip with the point of her tongue and looked towards the window Does he Fanny asked of the ceiling He wants money to float his teetotal drink said Beatrice Hasn t he been at Arthur about it Not that I know answered the wife He tried to get round me but I A scream of incredulity from Fanny and a chuckle from missus Peachey covered the rest of the sentence Beatrice gazed at them defiantly Well idiots What s up now Oh nothing There s nobody knows Luckworth Crewe better than I do Beatrice pursued disdainfully and I think he knows me pretty well He ll make a fool of himself when he marries I ve told him so and he as good as said I was right If it wasn t for that I should feel a respect for him He ll have money one of these days And he ll marry Nancy Lord said Ada tauntingly Not just yet Ada rolled herself from the sofa and stood yawning Well I shall go and dress What are you people going to do You needn t expect any dinner I shall have mine at a restaurant Who have you to meet asked Fanny with a grimace Her sister disregarded the question yawned again and turned to Beatrice Who shall we ask to take Fan s place on Tuesday Whoever it fifteen they ll have to pay Those seats are selling for three guineas somebody told me Conversation lingered about this point for a few minutes till missus Peachey went upstairs When the door was open a child s crying could be heard but it excited no remark Presently the other two retired to make themselves ready for going out Fanny was the first to reappear and whilst waiting for her sister she tapped out a new music hall melody on the piano As they left the house Beatrice remarked that Ada really meant to have her dinner at Gatti s or some such place perhaps they had better indulge themselves in the same way Suppose you give Horace Lord a hint that we ve no dinner at home He might take us and stand treat Fanny shook her head I don t think he could get away The guv nor expects him home to dinner on Sundays The other laughed her contempt You see What good is he Look here Fan you just wait a bit and you ll do much better than that Old Lord would cut up rough as soon as ever such a thing was mentioned I know he would There s something I have had in my mind for a long time Suppose I could show you a way of making a heap of money no end of money Shouldn t you like it better to live as you pleased and be independent The listener s face confessed curiosity yet was dubious What do you say to going into business with me pursued Miss French We ve only to raise a little money on the houses and in a year or two we might be making thousands Business What sort of business Suppose somebody came to you and said Pay me a sovereign and I ll make you a member of an association that supplies fashionable clothing at about half the ordinary price wouldn t you jump at it If I thought it wasn t a swindle Fanny replied ingenuously Of course But you d be made to see it wasn t And suppose they went on to say Take a ten pound share and you shall have a big interest on it as well as your dresses for next to nothing How would you like that Can it be done I ve got a notion it can and I think I know two or three people who would help to set the thing going But we must have some capital to show Have you the pluck to join in And suppose I lose my money I ll guarantee you the same income you re getting now if that will satisfy you I ve been looking round and making inquiries and I ve got to know a bit about the profits of big dressmakers We should start in Camberwell or somewhere about there and fish in all the women who want to do the heavy on very little There are thousands and thousands of them and most of them she lowered her voice know as much about cut and material as they do about stockbroking Do you twig People like missus Middlemist and missus Murch They spend most likely thirty or forty pounds a year on their things and we could dress them a good deal more smartly for half the money Of course we should make out that a dress we sold them for five guineas was worth ten in the shops and the real cost would be two See The thing is to persuade them that they re getting an article cheap and at the same time making money out of other people Thus and at much greater length did Miss French discourse to her attentive sister Forgetful of the time Fanny found at length that it would be impossible to meet Horace Lord as he came out of church but it did not distress her CHAPTER three Nancy Lord stood at the front room window a hand grasping each side of her waist her look vaguely directed upon the limetree opposite and the house which it in part concealed She was a well grown girl of three and twenty with the complexion and the mould of form which indicate whatever else habitual nourishment on good and plenteous food In her ripe lips and softly rounded cheeks the current of life ran warm She had hair of a fine auburn and her mode of wearing it in a plaited diadem answered the purpose of completing a figure which without being tall had some stateliness and promised more Her gown trimmed with a collar of lace left the neck free the maiden cincture at her waist did no violence to natural proportion This afternoon it was Monday she could not occupy or amuse herself in any of the familiar ways Perhaps the atmosphere of national Jubilee had a disturbing effect upon her in spite of her professed disregard for the gathering tumult of popular enthusiasm She had not left home to day and the brilliant weather did not tempt her forth On the table lay a new volume from the circulating library something about Evolution but she had no mind to read it it would have made her too conscious of the insincerity with which she approached such profound subjects For a quarter of an hour and more she had stood at the window regarding a prospect now as always utterly wearisome and depressing to her Grove Lane is a long acclivity which starts from Camberwell suburban dwellings The houses vary considerably in size and Green and after passing a few mean shops becomes a road of aspect also in date with the result of a certain picturesqueness enhanced by the growth of fine trees on either side Architectural grace can nowhere be discovered but the contract builder of today has not yet been permitted to work his will age and irregularity even though the edifices be but so many illustrations of the ungainly the insipid and the frankly hideous have a pleasanter effect than that of new streets built to one pattern by the mile There are small cottages overgrown with creepers relics of Camberwell s rusticity rows of tall and of squat dwellings that lie behind grassy plots railed from the road larger houses that stand in their own gardens hidden by walls Narrow passages connect the Lane with its more formal neighbour Camberwell Grove on the other side are ways leading towards Denmark Hill quiet leafy From the top of the Lane where Champion Hill enjoys an aristocratic seclusion is obtainable a glimpse of open fields and of a wooded horizon southward It is a neighbourhood in decay a bit of London which does not keep pace with the times And Nancy hated it She would have preferred to live even in a poor and grimy street which neighboured the main track of business and pleasure Here she had spent as much of her life as she remembered from the end of her third year mister Lord never willingly talked of days gone by but by questioning him she had learnt that her birthplace was a vaguely indicated part of northern London there it seemed her mother had died a year or so after the birth of her brother Horace The relatives of whom she knew were all on her father s side and lived scattered about England When she sought information concerning her mother mister Lord became evasive and presently silent she had seen no portrait of the dead parent Of late years this obscure point of the family history had often occupied her thoughts Nancy deemed herself a highly educated young woman cultured was the word she would have used Her studies at a day school which was reputed modern terminated only when she herself chose to withdraw in her eighteenth year and since then she had pursued courses of independent reading had attended lectures had thought of preparing for examinations only thought of it Her father never suggested that she should use these acquirements for the earning of money little as she knew of his affairs it was obviously to be taken for granted that he could ensure her life long independence Satisfactory this but latterly it had become a question with her how the independence was to be used and no intelligible aim as yet presented itself to her roving mind All she knew was that she wished to live and not merely to vegetate Now there are so many ways of living and Nancy felt no distinct vocation for any one of them She was haunted by an uneasy sense of doubtfulness as to her social position mister Lord followed the calling of a dealer in pianos a respectable business to be sure but it appeared not lucrative enough to put her above caring how his money was made She knew that one s father may be anything whatever yet suffer no social disability provided he reap profit enough from the pursuit But Stephen Lord whilst resorting daily to his warehouse in Camberwell Road not a locality that one would care to talk about in cultured circles continued after twenty years to occupy this small and ugly dwelling in Grove Lane Possibly owing to an imperfect education he failed to appreciate his daughter s needs and saw no reason why she should not be happy in the old surroundings On the other hand perhaps he cared very little about her Undoubtedly his favourite was Horace and in Horace he had suffered a disappointment The boy in spite of good schooling had proved unequal to his father s hope that he would choose some professional career by preference the law he idled away his schooldays failed at examinations and ultimately had to be sent into business mister Lord obtained a place for him in a large shipping agency but it still seemed doubtful whether he would make any progress there notwithstanding the advantage of his start at two and twenty he was remunerated with a mere thirty shillings a week a nominal salary his employers called it Nancy often felt angry with her brother for his lack of energy and ambition he might so easily she thought have helped to establish by his professional dignity her own social status at the level she desired There came into view a familiar figure crossing from the other side of the way Nancy started waved her hand and went to open the door Her look had wholly altered she was bright mirthful overflowing with affectionate welcome This friend of hers Jessica Morgan by name had few personal attractions She looked overwrought and low spirited a very plain and slightly made summer gown exhibited her meagre frame with undue frankness her face might have been pretty if health had filled and coloured the flesh but as it was she looked a ghost of girlhood a dolorous image of frustrate sex In her cotton gloved hand she carried several volumes and notebooks I m so glad you re in was her first utterance between pants after hasty walking and the jerks of a nervous little laugh I want to ask you something about Geometrical Progression You remember that formula How can I remember what I never knew exclaimed Nancy I always hated those formulas I couldn t learn them to save my life Oh that s nonsense You were much better at mathematics than I was Do just look at what I mean She threw her books down upon a chair and opened some pages of scrawled manuscript talking hurriedly in a thin falsetto Her family a large one had fallen of late years from a position of moderate comfort into sheer struggle for subsistence Jessica armed with certificates of examinational prowess got work as a visiting governess At the same time she nourished ambitions discernible perhaps in the singular light of her deep set eyes and a something of hysteric determination about her lips Her aim at present was to become a graduate of London University she was toiling in her leisure hours the hours of exhaustion that is to say to prepare herself for matriculation which she hoped to achieve in the coming winter Of her intimate acquaintances only one could lay claim to intellectual superiority and even she Nancy Lord to wit shrank from the ordeals of Burlington House To become B A to have her name in the newspapers to be regarded as one of the clever the uncommon women for this Jessica was willing to labour early and late regardless of failing health regardless even of ruined complexion and hair that grew thin beneath the comb She talked only of the exam of her chances in this or that paper of the likelihood that this or the other question would be set Her brain was becoming a mere receptacle for dates and definitions vocabularies and rules syntactic for thrice boiled essence of history ragged scraps of science quotations at fifth hand and all the heterogeneous rubbish of a crammer s shop When away from her books she carried scraps of paper with jottings to be committed to memory Beside her plate at meals lay formulae and tabulations She went to bed with a manual and got up with a compendium Nancy whose pursuit of culture followed a less exhausting track regarded the girl with a little envy and some compassion Esteeming herself in every respect Jessica s superior she could not help a slight condescension in the tone she used to her yet their friendship had much sincerity on both sides and each was the other s only confidante As soon as the mathematical difficulty could be set aside Nancy began to speak of her private troubles The Prophet was here last night she said with a girlish grimace He s beginning again I can see it coming I shall have to snub him awfully next time Oh what a worry he is Yes but there s something worse I suspected that the Pasha knew of it now I feel sure he s encouraging him By this oriental style Nancy signified her father The Prophet was her father s partner in business mister Samuel Bennett Barmby I feel sure now that they talked it over when the Prophet was taken into partnership I was thrown in as a consideration But how could your father possibly think It s hard to say what he does think about me I m afraid I shall have to have a talk with him If so it will be a long talk and a very serious talk But he isn t well just now and I must put it off He isn t well A touch of gout he says Two days last week he didn t go to business and his temper was that orrible Nancy had a habit of facetiously quoting vulgarities this from an acquaintance of theirs who often supplied them with mirth I suppose the gout does make one bad tempered Has he been coming often mister Barmby I mean Pretty well I think I must turn matchmaker and get him married to some one It oughtn t to be difficult The Prophet has points I dare say some people would think him handsome assented Miss Morgan nibbling a finger which showed an ink stain and laughing shyly And his powers of conversation Don t you know any one that would do for him They jested on this theme until Nancy chose to become serious again Have you any lessons to morrow No Thank goodness every one is going to see the procession or the decorations or the illuminations and all the rest of the nonsense Jessica replied I shall have a good long day of work except that I ve promised to go in the afternoon and have tea with the little girls at Champion Hill I wish you d come too they d be delighted to see you and there ll be nobody except the governess Nancy looked up in doubt Are you sure Won t the dowager be at home She hasn t left her room for three weeks They exchanged a look of some special significance Then I suppose said Nancy with a peculiar smile that s why mister Tarrant has been calling Has he How do you know Again they looked at each other and Nancy laughed I have happened to meet him twice the last few days She spoke in an off hand way The first time it was just at the top of the lane he was coming away The second time I was walking along Champion Hill and he came up behind me going to the house Did he talk Nancy gave a nod Yes both times But he didn t tell me that the dowager was worse High and mighty asked Jessica Not quite so majestic as usual I thought I didn t feel quite so much of a shrimp before him And decidedly he was in better spirits Perhaps the dowager s death would be important to him Very likely Will you come to morrow Miss Lord hesitated then with a sudden frankness To tell you the truth I m afraid he might be there Oh I don t think so not on Jubilee Day But that s the very reason He may come to be out of the uproar I meant he was more likely to be out of town altogether Nancy still leaning over the table propped her chin on her hands and reflected Where does he go I wonder Oh all sorts of places no doubt Men of that kind are always travelling I suppose he goes shooting and fishing Nancy s laugh made an interruption No no he doesn t He told me once that he didn t care for that sort of thing Oh well you know much more about him than I do said Miss Morgan with a smile I ve often meant to ask you have they anything to do with Tarrant s black lead Jessica declared that she had never heard of it Never heard of it nonsense A few years ago it used to be posted up everywhere and I see it sometimes even now but other kinds seem to have driven it out of the market Now that s just like you Pray did you ever hear of Pears Soap Of course Really Oh there s hope of you You ll be a woman of the world some day Don t tease Nancy And what would it matter if he was there to morrow Oh I don t know But I shouldn t particularly like his lordship to imagine that I went in the hope of paying my respects to him and having the reward of a gracious smile One can t always be thinking about what other people think said Jessica impatiently You re too sensitive Any one else in your position would have lots of such friends In my position What is my position Culture is everything now a days observed Miss Morgan with the air of one who feels herself abundantly possessed of that qualification But Nancy laughed You may depend upon it mister Tarrant doesn t think so He calls himself a democrat And talks like one doesn t he Oh that s only his way I think He doesn t really mean to be haughty and and so on I wish I knew if he had any connection with Tarrant s blacklead said Miss Lord mischievously Why not ask him They laughed merrily Jessica s thin note contrasting with the mellow timbre of her friend s voice I will some day You would never dare to I daren t Then I will It would be dreadfully rude I don t mind being thought rude replied Nancy with a movement of the head if it teaches people that I consider myself as good as they are Well will you come to morrow Ye es if you ll go somewhere else with me in the evening Where to To walk about the streets after dark and see the crowds and the illuminations Nancy uttered this with a sly mirthfulness Her friend was astonished Nonsense you don t mean it I do I want to go for the fun of the thing I should feel ashamed of myself if I ran to stare at Royalties but it s a different thing at night It ll be wonderful all the traffic stopped and the streets crammed with people and blazing with lights Won t you go But the time the time I can t afford it I m getting on so wretchedly with my Greek and my chemistry You ve time enough said Nancy And you know after all it s a historical event In the year three thousand it will be set in an examination paper and poor wretches will get plucked because they don t know the date This was quite a new aspect of the matter to Jessica Morgan She pondered it and smiled Yes I suppose it will But we should have to be out so late Why not for once It needn t be later than half past eleven Nancy broke off and gesticulated That s just why I want to go I should like to walk about all night as lots of people will The public houses are going to be kept open till two o clock Do you want to go into public houses asked Jessica laughing Why not I should like to It s horrible to be tied up as we are we re not children Why can t we go about as men do Won t your father make any objection asked Jessica We shall take Horace with us Your people wouldn t interfere would they I think not Father is away in Yorkshire and will be till the end of the week Poor mother has her rheumatism The house is so dreadfully damp We ought never to have taken it The difference of rent will all go in doctors bills I don t think mother would mind but I must be back before twelve of course I don t see the of course Nancy returned impatiently but we could manage that I ll speak to the Pasha to night and either come or let you have a note to morrow morning If there s any objection I m not sure that I shan t make it the opportunity for setting up my standard of revolt But I don t like to do that whilst the Pasha is out of sorts it might make him worse You could reason with him quietly Reason with the Pasha How innocent you are Jess How unworldly It always refreshes me to hear you talk CHAPTER four Only twelve months ago Stephen Lord had renewed the lease of his house for a period of seven years Nancy had she been aware of this transaction would assuredly have found courage to enter a protest but mister Lord consulted neither son nor daughter on any point of business but for this habit of acting silently he would have seemed to his children a still more arbitrary ruler than they actually thought him The dwelling consisted of but eight rooms one of which situated at the rear of the entrance passage served mister Lord as sitting room and bed chamber it overlooked a small garden and afforded a side glimpse of the kitchen with its outer appurtenances In the front room the family took meals Of the chambers in the storey above one was Nancy s one her brother s the third had until six years ago been known as Grandmother s room and here its occupant Stephen Lord s mother died at the age of seventy eight Wife of a Norfolk farmer and mother of nine children she was one of the old world women whose thoughts found abundant occupation in the cares and pleasures of home Hardship she had never known nor yet luxury the old religion the old views of sex and of society endured with her to the end After her death the room was converted into a parlour used almost exclusively by the young people At the top of the house slept two servants each in her own well furnished retreat one of them was a girl the other a woman of about forty named Mary Woodruff Mary had been in the house for twenty years she enjoyed her master s confidence and since old missus Lord s death exercised practical control in the humbler domestic affairs With one exception all parts of the abode presented much the same appearance as when Stephen Lord first established himself antiquated and in primitive taste Nancy s bedroom alone here The furniture was old solid homely the ornaments were displayed the influence of modern ideas On her twentieth birthday the girl received permission to dress henceforth as she chose a strict sumptuary law having previously been in force and at the same time was allowed to refurnish her chamber Nancy pleaded for modern reforms throughout the house but in vain even the drawing room kept its uninviting aspect not very different save for the removal of the bed from that it had presented when the ancient lady slept here In her own little domain Miss Lord made a clean sweep of rude appointments and at small expense surrounded herself with pretty things The woodwork and the furniture were in white enamel the paper had a pattern of wild rose A choice chintz rose leaf and flower on a white ground served for curtains and for bed hangings Her carpet was of green felt matching in shade the foliage of the chintz On suspended shelves stood the books which she desired to have near her and round about the walls hung prints photographs chromolithographs selected in an honest spirit of admiration which on the whole did no discredit to Nancy s sensibilities To the best of Nancy s belief her father had never seen this room On its completion she invited him to inspect it but mister Lord coldly declined saying that he knew nothing and cared nothing about upholstery His return to day was earlier than usual Shortly after five o clock Nancy heard the familiar heavy step in the passage and went downstairs Will you have a cup of tea father she asked standing by the door of the back room which was ajar If it s ready replied a deep voice She entered the dining room and rang the bell In a few minutes Mary Woodruff appeared bringing tea and biscuits She was a neat quiet plain featured woman of strong physique and with set lips which rarely parted save for necessary speech Her eyes had a singular expression of inquietude of sadness A smile seldom appeared on her face but when it did the effect was unlooked for it touched the somewhat harsh lineaments with a gentleness so pleasing that she became almost comely Having set down the tray she went to mister Lord s door gave a soft tap and withdrew into the kitchen Nancy seated at the table turned to greet her father In early life Stephen Lord must have been handsome his face was now rugged of unhealthy tone and creased with lines betokening a moody habit He looked much older than his years which were fifty seven Dressed with excessive carelessness he had the appearance rather of one at odds with fortune than of a substantial man of business His short beard was raggedly trimmed his grizzled hair began to show the scalp Judging from the contour of his visage one might have credited him with a forcible and commanding character his voice favoured that impression but the countenance had a despondent cast the eyes seemed to shun observation the lips suggested a sullen pride indicative of some defect or vice of will Yet in the look which he cast upon her Nancy detected a sign of more amiability than she had found in him of late She addressed him with confidence Early to day father Yes The monosyllable sounded gruff but again Nancy felt satisfaction mister Lord who disliked to seat himself unless he were going to keep his position for some time took the offered beverage from his daughter s hand and stood with it before the fireplace casting glances about the room How have you felt father Nothing to complain of His pronunciation fell short of refinement but was not vulgar Something of country accent could still be detected in it He talked like a man who could strike a softer note if he cared to but despises the effort I suppose you will have a rest to morrow I suppose so If your grandmother had lived he added thoughtfully she would have been eighty four this week on Thursday The twenty third of June Yes I remember mister Lord swallowed his tea at two draughts and put down the cup Seemingly refreshed he looked about him with a half smile and said quietly I ve had the pleasure of punishing a scoundrel to day That s worth more than the Jubilee Nancy waited for an explanation but it was not vouchsafed A scoundrel she asked Her father nodded the nod which signified his pleasure that the subject should not be pursued Nancy could only infer that he spoke of some incident in the course of business as indeed was the case He had no particular aptitude for trade and that by which he lived he had entered upon it thirty years ago rather by accident than choice was thoroughly distasteful to him As a dealer in pianofortes he came into contact with a class of people who inspired him with a savage contempt and of late years his business had suffered considerably from the competition of tradesmen who knew nothing of such conflicts between sentiment and interest A majority of his customers obtained their pianos on the hire purchase system and oftener than not they were persons of very small or very precarious income who rabid in the pursuit of gentility signed agreements they had little chance of fulfilling when in pecuniary straits they either raised money upon the instruments or allowed them to fall into the hands of distraining creditors Inquiry into the circumstances of a would be customer sometimes had ludicrous results a newly married couple for instance would be found tenanting two top floor rooms the furnishing whereof seemed to them incomplete without the piano of which their friends and relatives boasted Not a few professional swindlers came to the office confederate rogues vouching for each other s respectability got possession of pianos merely to pawn or sell them having paid no more than the first month s charge It was mister Lord s experience that year by year the recklessness of the vulgar became more glaring and deliberate fraud more artful To day he had successfully prosecuted a man who seemed to have lived for some time on the hire purchase system and it made him unusually cheerful You don t think of going to see the Queen to morrow said his daughter smiling What have I to do with the Queen Do you wish to go Not to see Her Majesty I care as little about her as you do But I thought of having a walk in the evening Nancy phrased it thus with intention She wished to intimate that at her age it could hardly be necessary to ask permission But her father looked surprised In the evening Where Oh about the main streets to see the people and the illuminations Her voice was not quite firm But said her father there ll be such a swarm of blackguards as never was known How can you go into such a crowd It s astonishing that you should think of it The blackguards will be outnumbered by the decent people father You suppose that s possible he returned gloomily Oh I think so Nancy laughed At all events there ll be a great majority of people who pretend to be decent I have asked Jessica Morgan to go with me What right had you to ask her without first finding out whether you could go or not It was spoken rather gravely than severely mister Lord never looked fixedly at his daughter and even a glance at her face was unusual but at this juncture he met her eyes for an instant The nervous motion with which he immediately turned aside had been marked by Nancy on previous occasions and she had understood it as a sign of his lack of affection for her I am twenty three years old father she replied without aggressiveness That would be something of an answer if you were a man observed the father his eyes cast down Because I am a woman you despise me Stephen was startled at this unfamiliar mode of address He moved uneasily If I despised you Nancy I shouldn t care very much what you did I suppose you must do as you like but you won t go with my permission There was a silence then the girl said I meant to ask Horace to go with us Horace pooh Again a silence mister Lord laid down his cup moved a few steps away and turned back I didn t think this kind of thing was in your way he said gruffly I thought you were above it Nancy defended herself as she had done to Jessica but without the playfulness In listening her father seemed to weigh the merits of the case conscientiously with wrinkled brows At length he spoke Horace is no good But if Samuel Barmby will go with you I make no objection A movement of annoyance was Nancy s first reply She drummed with her fingers on the table looking fixedly before her I certainly can t ask mister Barmby to come with us she said with an effort at self control Well you needn t I ll speak about it myself He waited and again it chanced that their eyes met Nancy on the point of speaking checked herself A full minute passed and Stephen stood waiting patiently If you insist upon it said Nancy rising from her chair we will take mister Barmby with us Without comment mister Lord left the room and his own door closed rather loudly behind him Not long afterwards Nancy heard a new foot in the passage and her brother made his appearance Horace had good looks but his face showed already some of the unpleasant characteristics which time had developed on that of Stephen Lord and from which the daughter was entirely free one judged him slow of intellect and weakly self willed His hair was of pale chestnut the silky pencillings of his moustache considerably darker His cheek delicately pink and easily changing to a warmer hue his bright coloured lips and the limpid glistening of his eyes showed him of frail constitution he was very slim and narrow across the shoulders The fashion of his attire tended to a dandiacal extreme modish silk hat lavender necktie white waistcoat gaiters over his patent leather shoes gloves crushed together in one hand and in the other a bamboo cane For the last year or two he had been progressing in this direction despite his father s scornful remarks and his sister s good natured mockery Father in yet he asked at the door of the dining room in subdued voice Nancy nodded and the young man withdrew to lay aside his outdoor equipments What sort of temper was his question when he returned Pretty good until I spoilt it Horace exhibited a pettish annoyance What on earth did you do that for I want to have a talk with him to night About what Oh never mind I ll tell you after Both kept their voices low as if afraid of being overheard in the next room Horace began to nibble at a biscuit the hour of his return made it unnecessary for him as a rule to take anything before dinner but at present he seemed in a nervous condition and acted mechanically Come out into the garden will you he said after receiving a brief explanation of what had passed between Nancy and her father I ve something to tell you His sister carelessly assented and with heads uncovered they went through the house into the open air The garden was but a strip of ground bounded by walls of four feet high in the midst stood a laburnum now heavy with golden bloom and at the end grew a holly bush flanked with laurels a border flower bed displayed Stephen Lord s taste and industry Nancy seated herself on a rustic bench in the shadow of the laburnum and Horace stood before her one of the branches in his hand I promised Fanny to take her to morrow night he began awkwardly Oh you have And we re going together in the morning you know I know now I didn t before Nancy replied Of course we can make a party in the evening Of course Horace looked up at the ugly house backs and hesitated before proceeding That isn t what I wanted to talk about he said at length A very queer thing has happened a thing I can t make out at all The listener looked her curiosity I promised to say nothing about it but there s no harm in telling you you know You remember I was away last Saturday afternoon Well just when it was time to leave the office that day the porter came to say that a lady wished to see me a lady in a carriage outside Of course I couldn t make it out at all but I went down as quickly as possible and saw the carriage waiting there a brougham and marched up to the door Inside there was a lady a great swell smiling at me as if we were friends I took off my hat and said that I was mister Lord Yes she said I see you are and she asked if I could spare her an hour or two as she wished to speak to me of something important Well of course I could only say that I had nothing particular to do that I was just going home Then will you do me the pleasure she said to come and have lunch with me I live in Weymouth Street Portland Place The young man paused to watch the effect of his narrative especially of the last words Nancy returned his gaze with frank astonishment What sort of lady was it she asked Oh a great swell Somebody in the best society you could see that at once But how old Well I couldn t tell exactly about forty I should think Oh Go on One couldn t refuse you know I was only too glad to go to a house in the West End She opened the carriage door from the inside and I got in and off we drove I felt awkward of course but after all I was decently dressed and I suppose I can behave like a gentleman and well she sat looking at me and smiling and I could only smile back Then she said she must apologise for behaving so strangely but I was very young and she was an old woman one couldn t call her that though and she had taken this way of renewing her acquaintance with me Renewing But I didn t remember to have ever met her before I said Oh yes we have met before but you were a little child a baby in fact and there s no wonder you don t remember me And then she said I knew your mother very well Nancy leaned forward her lips apart Queer wasn t it Then she went on to say that her name was missus Damerel had I ever heard it No I couldn t remember the name at all She was a widow she said and had lived mostly abroad for a great many years now she was come back to settle in England She hadn t a house of her own yet but lived at a boarding house she didn t know whether to take a house in London or somewhere just out in the country Then she began to ask about father and about you and it seemed to amuse her when I looked puzzled She s a jolly sort of person always laughing Did she say anything more about our mother I ll tell you about that presently We got to the house and went in and she took me upstairs to her own private sitting room where the table was laid for two She said that she usually had her meals with the other people but it would be better for us to be alone so that we could talk How did she know where to find you Nancy inquired Of course I wondered about that but I didn t like to ask Well she went away for a few minutes and then we had lunch Everything was A one of course first rate wines to choose from and a rattling good cigar afterwards for me I mean She brought out a box said they were her husband s and had a laugh about it How long has she been a widow asked Nancy I don t know She didn t wear colours I noticed perhaps it was a fashionable sort of mourning We talked about all sorts of things I soon made myself quite at home And at last she began to explain She was a friend of mother s years and years ago and father was the cause of their parting a quarrel about something she didn t say exactly what And it had suddenly struck her that she would like to know how we were getting on Then she asked me to promise that I would tell no one She knew about mother s death I suppose Oh yes she knew about that It happened not very long after the affair that parted them She asked a good many questions about you And she wanted to know how father had got on in his business What did you say Oh I told her I really didn t know much about it and she laughed at that How long did you stay there Till about four But there s something else Before I went away she gave me an invitation for next Saturday She wants me to meet her at Portland Road Station and go out to Richmond and have dinner there Shall you go Well it s very awkward I want to go somewhere else on Saturday with Fanny But I didn t see how to refuse Nancy wore a look of grave reflection and kept silence It isn t a bad thing you know pursued her brother to have a friend of that sort There s no knowing what use she might be especially just now His tone caused Nancy to look up Why just now I ll tell you after I ve had a talk with father to night Horace replied setting his countenance to a show of energetic resolve Shall I guess what you re going to talk about If you like She gazed at him You re surely not so silly as to tell father about all that nonsense What nonsense exclaimed the other indignantly Why with Fanny French You ll find that it s anything but nonsense Horace replied raising his brows and gazing straight before him with expanded nostrils All right Let me know the result It s time to go in Horace sat alone for a minute or two his legs at full length his feet crossed and the upper part of his body bent forward He smiled to himself a smile of singular fatuity and began to hum a popular tune CHAPTER five When they assembled at table mister Lord had recovered his moderate cheerfulness Essentially he was anything but ill tempered Horace and Nancy were far from regarding him with that resentful bitterness which is produced in the victims of a really harsh parent Ten years ago as they well remembered anger was a rare thing in his behaviour to them and kindness the rule Affectionate he had never shown himself reserve and austerity had always distinguished him Even now a days it was generally safe to anticipate mildness from him at the evening meal In the matter of eating and drinking his prudence notably contradicted his precepts He loved strong meats dishes highly flavoured and partook of them without moderation At table his beverage was ale for wine unless it were very sweet port he cared little but in the privacy of his own room whilst smoking numberless pipes of rank tobacco he indulged freely in spirits The habit was unknown to his children but for some years he had seldom gone to bed in a condition that merited the name of sobriety When the repast was nearly over mister Lord glanced at his son and said unconcernedly You have heard that Nancy wants to mix with the rag tag and bobtail to morrow night I shall take care of her Horace replied starting from his reverie Doesn t it seem to you rather a come down for an educated young lady Oh there ll be lots of them about Will there Then I can t see much difference between them and the servant girls Nancy put in a word That shows you don t in the least understand me father We won t argue about it But bear in mind Horace that you bring your sister back not later than half past eleven You are to be here by half past eleven That s rather early replied the young man though in a submissive tone It s the hour I appoint Samuel Barmby will be with you and he will know the arrangement but I tell you now so that there may be no misunderstanding Nancy sat in a very upright position displeasure plain upon her countenance But she made no remark Horace who had his reasons for desiring to preserve a genial tone affected acquiescence Presently he and his sister went upstairs to the drawing room where they sat down at a distance apart Nancy by the window gazing at the warm clouds above the roofs opposite the young man in a corner which the dusk already shadowed Some time passed before either spoke and it was Horace s voice which first made itself heard Nancy don t you think it s about time we began to behave firmly It depends what you mean by firmness she answered in an absent tone We re old enough to judge for ourselves I am no doubt But I m not so sure about you Oh all right Then we won t talk about it Another quarter of an hour went by The room was in twilight There came a knock at the door and Mary Woodruff a wax taper in her hand entered to light the gas Having drawn the blind and given a glance round to see that everything was in order she addressed Nancy her tone perfectly respectful though she used no formality Martha has been asking me whether she can go out to morrow night for an hour or two You don t wish to go yourself Miss Lord returned her voice significant of life long familiarity Oh no And Mary showed one of her infrequent smiles She may go immediately after dinner and be away till half past ten The servant bent her head and withdrew As soon as she was gone Horace laughed There you are What did father say Nancy was silent Well I m going to have a word with him continued the young man sauntering towards the door with his hands in his pockets He looked exceedingly nervous When I come back I may have something to tell you Very likely remarked his sister in a dry tone and seated herself under the chandelier with a book Horace slowly descended the stairs At the foot he stood for a moment then moved towards his father s door Another hesitancy though briefer and he knocked for admission which was at once granted mister Lord sat in his round backed chair smoking a pipe on his knees an evening paper He looked at Horace from under his eyebrows but with good humour Coming to report progress Yes father and to talk over things in general The slim youth he could hardly be deemed more than a lad tried to assume an easy position with his elbow on the corner of the mantelpiece but his feet shuffled and his eyes strayed vacantly It cost him an effort to begin his customary account of how things were going with him at the shipping office In truth there was nothing particular to report there never was anything particular but Horace always endeavoured to show that he had made headway and to night he spoke with a very pronounced optimism Very well my boy said his father If you are satisfied I shall try to be the same Have you your pipe with you At your age I hadn t begun to smoke and I should advise you to be moderate but we ll have a whiff together if you like I ll go and fetch it Horace replied impulsively He came back with a rather expensive meerschaum recently purchased Hollo luxuries exclaimed his father It kept catching my eye in a window and at last I couldn t resist Tobacco s quite a different thing out of a pipe like this you know No one seeing them thus together could have doubted of the affectionate feeling which Stephen Lord entertained for his son It appeared in his frequent glances in the relaxation of his features in a certain abandonment of his whole frame as though he had only just begun to enjoy the evening s repose I ve something rather important to speak about father Horace began when he had puffed for a few minutes in silence Oh What s that You remember telling me when I was one and twenty that you wished me to work my way up and win an income of my own but that I could look to you for help if ever there was need of it Yes Stephen remembered He had frequently called it to mind and wondered whether it was wisely said the youth s character considered What of that he returned still genially Do you think of starting a new line of ocean steamships Well not just yet Horace answered with an uncertain laugh I have something more moderate in view I may start a competition with the P and O presently Let s hear about it I dare say it will surprise you a little The fact is I I am thinking of getting married The father did not move but smoke ceased to issue from his lips and his eyes fixed upon Horace widened a little in puzzled amusement Thinking of it are you he said in an undertone as one speaks of some trifle No harm in thinking Too many people do it without thinking at all I m not one of that kind said Horace with an air of maturity which was meant to rebuke his father s jest I know what I m about I ve thought it over thoroughly You don t think it too soon I hope Horace s pipe was going out he held it against his knee and regarded it with unconscious eyes I dare say it won t be said mister Lord when you have found a suitable wife Oh but you misunderstand me I mean that I have decided to marry a particular person And who may that be The younger Miss French Fanny His voice quivered over the name at the end he gave a gasp and a gulp Of a sudden his lips and tongue were very dry and he felt a disagreeable chill running down his back For the listener s face had altered noticeably it was dark stern and something worse But mister Lord could still speak with self control You have asked her to marry you Yes I have and she has consented Horace felt his courage returning like the so called second wind of a runner It seemed to him that he had gone through the worst The disclosure was made and had resulted in no outbreak of fury now he could begin to plead his cause Imagination excited by nervous stress brought before him a clear picture of the beloved Fanny with fluffy hair upon her forehead and a laugh on her never closed lips He spoke without effort I thought that there would be no harm in asking you to help us We should be quite content to start on a couple of hundred a year quite That is only about fifty pounds more than we have Calf love inspires many an audacity To Horace there seemed nothing outrageous in this suggestion He had talked it over with Fanny French several times and they had agreed that his father could not in decency offer them less than a hundred a year He began to shake out the ashes from his pipe with a vague intention of relighting it You really imagine said his father that I should give you money to enable you to marry that idiot Evidently he put a severe restraint upon himself The veins of his temples were congested his nostrils grew wide and he spoke rather hoarsely Horace straightened his back and though in great fear strung himself for conflict I don t see what right to insult the young lady His father took him up sternly Young lady What do you mean by young lady After all your education haven t you learnt to distinguish a lady from a dressed up kitchen wench I had none of your advantages There was there would have been some excuse for me if I had made such a fool of myself What were you doing all those years at school if it wasn t learning the difference between real and sham getting to understand things better than poor folks children You disappointed me and a good deal more than I ever told you I had hoped you would come from school better able to make a place in the world than your father was I made up my mind long ago that you should never go into my business you were to be something a good deal better But after all you couldn t or wouldn t do what I wanted Never mind I said to myself never mind at all events he has learnt to think in a better way than if I had sent him to common schools and after all that s the main thing But here you come to me and talk of marrying a low bred low minded creature who wouldn t be good enough for the meanest clerk How do you know that father What what right have you to say such things without knowing more of her than you do There was a brief silence before mister Lord spoke again You are very young he said with less vehement contempt I must remember that At your age a lad has a sort of devil in him that s always driving him out of the path of common sense whether he will or no I ll try my best to talk quietly with you Does your sister know what has been going on I daresay she does I haven t told her in so many words I never thought of it pursued mister Lord gloomily I took it for granted that everybody must see those people as I myself did I have wondered now and then why Nancy kept up any kind of acquaintance with them but she spoke of them in the rational way and that seemed enough I may have thought that they might get some sort of good out of her and I felt sure she had too much sense to get harm from them If it hadn t been so I should have forbidden her to know them at all What have you to say for yourself I don t want to think worse of you than I need I can make allowance for your age as I said What do you see in that girl Just talk to me freely and plainly After all you have said replied Horace his voice still shaky what s the use You seem to be convinced that there isn t a single good quality in her So I am What I want to know is what good you have found A great deal else I shouldn t have asked her to marry me A vein of stubbornness unmistakable inheritance from Stephen Lord had begun to appear in the youth s speech and bearing He kept his head bent and moved it a little from side to side Do you think her an exception in the family then She s a great deal better in every way than her sisters But I don t think as badly of them as you do mister Lord stepped to the door and out into the passage where he shouted in his deep voice Nancy The girl quickly appeared Shut the door please said her father All three were now standing about the room Your brother has brought me a piece of news It ought to interest you I should think He wants to marry and out of all the world he has chosen Miss French the youngest Horace s position was trying He did not know what to do with his hands and he kept balancing now on one foot now on the other Nancy had her eyes averted from him but she met her father s look gravely Now I want to ask you mister Lord proceeded whether you consider Miss French a suitable wife for your brother Just give me a plain yes or no I certainly don t replied the girl barely subduing the tremor of her voice Both my children are not fools thank Heaven Now tell me if you can what fault you have to find with the young lady as your brother calls her For one thing I don t think her Horace s equal She can t really be called a lady You are listening Horace bit his lip in mortification and again his head swung doggedly from side to side We might pass over that added mister Lord What about her character Is there any good point in her I don t think she means any harm But she s silly and I ve often thought her selfish You are listening Horace lost patience Then why do you pretend to be friends with her he demanded almost fiercely I don t replied his sister with a note of disdain We knew each other at school and we haven t altogether broken off that s all It isn t all shouted the young man on a high key If you re not friendly with her and her sisters you ve been a great hypocrite It s only just lately you have begun to think yourself too good for them They used to come here and you went to them and you talked just like friends would do It s abominable to turn round like this for the sake of taking father s side against me mister Lord regarded his son contemptuously There was a rather long silence he spoke at length with severe deliberation When you are ten years older you ll know a good deal more about young women as they re turned out in these times You ll have heard the talk of men who have been fools enough to marry choice specimens When common sense has a chance of getting in a word with you you ll understand what I now tell you Wherever you look now a days there s sham and rottenness but the most worthless creature living is one of these trashy flashy girls the kind of girl you see everywhere high and low calling themselves ladies thinking themselves too good for any honest womanly work Town and country it s all the same They re educated oh yes they re educated What sort of wives do they make with their education What sort of mothers are they Before long there ll be no such thing as a home They don t know what the word means They d like to live in hotels and trollop about the streets day and night There won t be any servants much longer you re lucky if you find one of the old sort who knows how to light a fire or wash a dish Go into the houses of men with small incomes what do you find but filth and disorder quarrelling and misery Young men are bad enough I know that they want to begin where their fathers left off and if they can t do it honestly they ll embezzle or forge But you ll often find there s a worthless wife at the bottom of it worrying and nagging because she has a smaller house than some other woman because she can t get silks and furs and wants to ride in a cab instead of an omnibus It is astounding to me that they don t get their necks wrung Only wait a bit we shall come to that presently It was a rare thing for Stephen Lord to talk at such length He ceased with a bitter laugh and sat down again in his chair Horace and his sister waited I ve no more to say fell from their father at length Go and talk about it together if you like Horace moved sullenly towards the door and with a glance at his sister went out Nancy after lingering for a moment spoke I don t think you need have any fear of it father Perhaps not But if it isn t that one it ll be another like her There s not much choice for a lad like Horace Nancy changed her purpose of leaving the room and drew a step nearer Don t you think there might have been mister Lord turned to look at her How What do you mean I don t want to make you angry with me Say what you ve got to say broke in her father impatiently It isn t easy when you so soon lose your temper My girl for once he gazed at her directly if you knew all I have gone through in life you wouldn t wonder at my temper being spoilt What do you mean What could I have done She stood before him and spoke with diffidence Don t you think that if we had lived in a different way Horace and I might have had friends of a better kind A different way I understand You mean I ought to have had a big house and made a show Isn t that it You gave us a good education replied Nancy still in the same tone and we might have associated with very different people from those you have been speaking of but education alone isn t enough One must live as the better people do Exactly That s your way of thinking And how do you know that I could afford it to begin with Perhaps I oughtn t to have taken that for granted Perhaps not Young women take a good deal for granted now a days But supposing you were right are you silly enough to think that richer people are better people as a matter of course Not as a matter of course said Nancy But I m quite sure I know from what I ve seen that there s more chance of meeting nice people among them What do you mean by nice mister Lord was lying back in his chair and spoke thickly as if wearied People who can talk so that you forget they re only using words they ve learnt like parrots No Just the contrary People who have something to say worth listening to If you take my advice you ll pay less attention to what people say and more to what they do What s the good of a friend who won t come to see you because you live in a small house That s the plain English of it If I had done as I thought right I should never have sent you to school at all I should have had you taught at home all that s necessary to make a good girl and an honest woman and have done my best to keep you away from the kind of life that I hate But I hadn t the courage to act as I believed I knew how the times were changing and I was weak enough to be afraid I might do you an injustice I did give you the chance of making friends among better people than your father Didn t I use to talk to you about your school friends and encourage you when they seemed of the right kind And now you tell me that they don t care for your society because you live in a decent unpretending way I should think you re better without such friends Nancy reflected seemed about to prolong the argument but spoke at length in another voice Well I will say good night father It was not usual for them to see each other after dinner so that a good night could seldom be exchanged The girl drawing away expected a response she saw her father nod but he said nothing Good night father she repeated from a distance Good night Nancy good night came in impatient reply CHAPTER six On Tuesday afternoon when beneath a cloudless sky the great London highways reeked and roared in celebration of Jubilee Nancy and her friend Miss Morgan walked up Grove Lane to Champion Hill Here and there a house had decked itself with colours of loyalty otherwise the Lane was as quiet as usual Champion Hill is a gravel byway overhung with trees large houses and spacious gardens on either hand Here the heat of the sun was tempered A carriage rolled softly along a nurse with well dressed children loitered in the shade One might have imagined it a country road so profound the stillness and so leafy the prospect A year ago Jessica Morgan had obtained a three months engagement as governess to two little girls who were sent under her care to the house of their grandmother at Teignmouth Their father mister Vawdrey of Champion Hill had recently lost his wife through an illness contracted at a horse race where the lady sat in wind and rain for some hours The children knew little of what is learnt from books but were surprisingly well informed on matters of which they ought to have known nothing they talked of theatres and race courses of the new murderer at Tussaud s of police news of notorious spendthrifts and demi reps discussed their grown up acquaintances with precocious understanding and repeated scandalous insinuations which could have no meaning for them Jessica was supposed to teach them for two hours daily she found it an impossibility Nevertheless a liking grew up between her and her charges and save by their refusal to study the children gave her no trouble they were abundantly good natured they laughed and sported all day long and did their best to put life into the pale overworked governess Whilst living thus at the seaside Jessica was delighted by the arrival of Nancy Lord who came to Teignmouth for a summer holiday With her came Mary Woodruff The faithful servant had been ill mister Lord sent her down into Devon to make a complete recovery and to act as Nancy s humble chaperon Nancy s stay was for three weeks The friends saw a great deal of each other and Miss Lord had the honour of being presented to missus Tarrant the old lady with whom Jessica lived mister Vawdrey s mother in law At the age of three score and ten missus Tarrant still led an active life and talked with great volubility chiefly of herself Nancy learnt from her that she had been married at seventeen and had had two children a son and a daughter both deceased of relatives there remained to her only mister Vawdrey and his family and a grandson Lionel Tarrant One evening as Jessica returned from a ramble with the children they encountered a young man who was greeted without much fervour as cousin Lionel mister Tarrant professed himself merely a passing visitant he had come to inquire after the health of his grandmother and in a day or two must keep an appointment with friends elsewhere Notwithstanding this announcement he remained at Teignmouth for a fortnight exhibiting a pious assiduity in his attendance upon the old lady Naturally he made acquaintance with Miss Lord whom his cousins regarded as a great acquisition so vivacious was she so ready to take part in any kind of lively amusement mister Tarrant had been at Oxford his speech was marked with the University accent he talked little and seemed to prefer his own society In conversation with Nancy though scrupulously courteous and perfectly good natured he never forgot that she was the friend of his cousins governess that their intercourse must be viewed as an irregular sort of thing and that it behoved him to support his dignity whilst condescending to a social inferior So at all events it struck Miss Lord very sensitive in such matters Fond of fitting people with nicknames she called this young man sometimes His Royal Highness sometimes His Majesty Of mister Tarrant s station in life nothing was discovered His grandmother though seemingly in possession of ample means betrayed an indifferent education and in her flow of gossip never referred to ancestral dignities never made mention of the calling her husband had pursued mister Vawdrey was known to be in business a business which must be tolerably lucrative On their return to London the children passed from Miss Morgan s care into that of missus Baker who kept house for the widower at Champion Hill but Jessica did not wholly lose sight of them and at their request she persuaded Nancy Lord to make an occasional call with her missus Baker relict it was understood of a military officer who had fallen in Eastern warfare behaved to the young ladies with much friendliness They did not meet mister Vawdrey Early in the following year old missus Tarrant forsaking Teignmouth came to live under her son in law s roof the winter had tried her health and henceforth she seldom left home To day as on former occasions only two or three in all Nancy was reluctant to approach the big house its imposing front made her feel that she came only on sufferance probably even missus Baker did not regard her as having a right to call here on terms of equality Yet the place touched her curiosity and her imagination she liked to study the luxurious appointments within and to walk about the neglected but pleasant garden quiet and secluded as if whole counties divided it from Camberwell In the hall she and Jessica were at once welcomed by the children who first informed them that tea would be served out of doors and next made known that cousin Lionel was here in missus Tarrant s drawing room The second piece of news vexed Nancy she resolved never to come again unless on formal invitation missus Baker an agreeable woman received them as if she were the mistress of the house With Jessica she chatted about matters examinational which she seemed thoroughly to understand with Miss Lord she talked of wider subjects in a tone not unpleasing to Nancy seeing that it presumed on her part some knowledge of the polite world It was observable that mister Vawdrey s daughters had benefited by the superintendence of this lady they no longer gossiped loudly about murders and scandals but demeaned themselves more as became their years On the arrival of other ladies to call upon missus Baker the children drew their friends away into the garden where tea now awaited them Amid the trees and flowers time passed not unpleasantly until on happening to turn her head Nancy perceived at a distance the approaching figure of mister Lionel Tarrant He sauntered over the grass with easy indolent step his straw hat and light lounge costume excellent tailoring suited the season and the place Jessica who regarded the young man with something of awe stood up to shake hands but Miss Lord kept her place in the garden chair Did you see the procession Tarrant inquired Ah then I can give you very important news thrilling news I know the colour of the Queen s bonnet and of her parasol Please don t keep us in suspense said Nancy They were of pale primrose Touching don t you think He had seated himself crosswise on a camp stool and seemed to be admiring the contour of his brown boots Lionel s age was not more than seven and twenty he enjoyed sound health and his face signified contentment with the scheme of things as it concerned himself but a chronic languor possessed him It might be sheer laziness possibly a result of that mental habit discernible In his look whereby he had come to regard his own judgment as the criterion of all matters in heaven and earth Yet the conceit which relaxed his muscles was in the main amiable it never repelled as does the conceit of a fop or a weakling or a vulgar person he could laugh heartily even with his own affectations for a source of amusement Of personal vanity he had little though women esteemed him good looking his steady indolent gaze made denial of such preoccupation Nor could he be regarded as emasculate his movements merely disguised the natural vigour of a manly frame and his conversational trifling hinted an intellectual reserve a latent power of mind obvious enough in the lines of his countenance Nancy was excusable for supposing that he viewed her slightingly He spoke as one who did not expect to be quite understood by such a hearer addressing her without the familiarity much as he addressed his young cousins To her his careful observance of formalities seemed the reverse of flattering she felt sure that with young women in his own circle he would allow himself much more freedom Whether the disparagement applied to her intellect or to her social status might be a question Nancy could not decide which of the two she would prefer Today an especial uneasiness troubled her from the first moment of his appearance she felt a stronger prompting than hitherto to assert herself and if possible to surprise mister Tarrant But as if he understood her thought his manner became only more bland his calm aloofness more pronounced The children who were never at ease in their cousin s presence succeeded in drawing Jessica apart and chattered to her about the educational methods imposed by missus Baker airing many grievances They nourished a hope that Miss Morgan might again become their governess lessons down at Teignmouth had been nothing like so oppressive as here at Champion Hill Tarrant meanwhile having drunk a cup of tea and touched his moustache with a silk handkerchief transferred himself from the camp stool to the basket chair vacated by Jessica He was now further from Nancy but facing her I have been talking with missus Bellamy fell from him in the same tone of idle good nature Do you know her She has but one subject of conversation an engrossing topic to be sure namely her servants Do you give much thought to the great servant question I have my own modest view of the matter It may not be novel but my mind has worked upon it in the night watches Nancy resolved not to smile found herself smiling Not so much at what he said as at the manner of it Her resentment was falling away she felt the influence of this imperturbable geniality Shall I tell you my theory He talked with less reserve than on the last occasion when they had sat together The mellow sunlight the garden odours the warm still air favoured a growth of intimacy By all means was Nancy s reply We must begin by admitting that the ordinary woman hates nothing so much as to have another woman set in authority over her He paused and laughed lazily Now before the triumph of glorious Democracy only those women kept servants who were capable of rule who had by birth the instinct of authority They knew themselves the natural superiors of their domestics and went through an education fitting them to rule Things worked very well no servant difficulty existed Now a days every woman who can afford it must have another woman to wait upon her no matter how silly or vulgar or depraved she may be the result of course is a spirit of rebellion in the kitchen Who could have expected anything else Nancy played with a dandelion she had plucked and gave sign neither of assent nor disagreement missus Bellamy continued the young man marvels that servants revolt against her What could be more natural The servants have learnt that splendid doctrine that every one is as good as everybody else and missus Bellamy is by no means the person to make them see things differently And this kind of thing is going on in numberless houses an utterly incompetent mistress and a democratic maid in spirited revolt The incompetents being in so vast a majority will sooner or later spoil all the servants in the country You should make an article of it said Nancy and send it to The Nineteenth Century So I might He paused and added casually You read The Nineteenth Century Now and then Nancy felt herself an impostor for of leading reviews she knew little more than the names And Tarrant s look so steady yet so good tempered disturbed her conscience with the fear that he saw through her She was coming wretchedly out of this dialogue in which she had meant to make a figure He changed the subject was it merely to spare her Shall you go to Teignmouth again this year I don t know yet I think not Silence followed Tarrant to judge from his face was absorbed in pleasant thought Nancy on the other hand felt so ill at ease that she was on the point of rising when his voice checked her I have an idea he spoke dreamily of going to spend next winter in the Bahamas Why the Bahamas Speaking with all the carelessness she could command Nancy shivered a little Spite of her culture she had but the vaguest notion where the Bahamas were To betray ignorance would be dreadful A suspicion awoke in her that Tarrant surprised by her seeming familiarity with current literature was craftily testing the actual quality of her education Upon the shiver followed a glow and in fear lest her cheeks would redden she grew angry He was replying Partly because it is a delightful winter climate partly because I have a friend there partly because the islands are interesting A man I knew at Oxford has gone out there and is likely to stay His father owns nearly the whole of an island and as he s in very bad health my friend may soon come into possession When he does he s going to astonish the natives How A vision of savages flashed before Nancy s mind She breathed more freely thinking the danger past Simply by making a fortune out of an estate that is lying all but barren Before the emancipation of the niggers the Bahamas flourished wonderfully now they are fallen to decay and ruled so far as I understand it by a particularly contemptible crew of native whites who ought all to be kicked into the sea My friend s father is a man of no energy he calls himself magistrate coroner superintendent of the customs and a dozen other things but seems to have spent his time for years in lying about smoking and imbibing His son I m afraid waits impatiently for the old man s removal to a better world He believes there are immense possibilities of trade Trying hard to recollect her geography Miss Lord affected but a slight interest There s no direct way of getting there Tarrant pursued What route should you suggest She was right after all He wished to convict her of ignorance Her cheeks were now burning beyond a doubt and she felt revengeful I advise you to make inquiries at a shipping office was her distant reply It seems he was smiling at Nancy I shall have to go to New York and then take the Cuba mail Are you going to join your friend in business Business I fear is hardly my vocation There was a tremor on Nancy s lips and about her eyelids She said abruptly I thought you were perhaps in business Did you What suggested it Tarrant looked fixedly at her in his expression as in his voice she detected a slight disdain and that decided her to the utterance of the next words Oh she had assumed an ingenuous air there s the Black Lead that bears your name Haven t you something to do with it She durst not watch him but a change of his countenance was distinctly perceptible and for the moment caused her a keen gratification His eyes had widened his lips had set themselves he looked at once startled and mortified Black lead The words fell slowly in a voice unlike that she had been hearing No I have nothing to do with it The silence was dreadful Nancy endeavoured to rise but her limbs would not do their office Then her eyes fixed on the grass she became aware that Tarrant himself had stood up Where are the children he was saying absently He descried them afar off with Miss Morgan and began to saunter in that direction As soon as his back was turned Nancy rose and began to walk towards the house In a few moments Jessica and the girls were with her I think we must go she said They entered and took leave of missus Baker who sat alone in the drawing room Did you say good bye to mister Tarrant Jessica asked as they came forth again Yes I didn t But I suppose it doesn t matter Nancy had thought of telling her friend what she had done of boasting that she had asked the impossible question But now she felt ashamed of herself and something more than ashamed Never again could she enter this garden And it seemed to her that by a piece of outrageous of wanton folly she had for ever excluded herself from the society of all superior people CHAPTER seven Now I look at it in this way It s to celebrate the fiftieth year of the reign of Queen Victoria yes but at the same time and far more it s to celebrate the completion of fifty years of Progress National Progress without precedent in the history of mankind One may say indeed Progress of the Human Race Only think what has been done in this half century only think of it Compare England now compare the world with what it was in eighteen thirty seven It takes away one s breath Thus mister Samuel Bennett Barmby as he stood swaying forward upon his toes his boots creaking Nancy and Jessica listened to him They were ready to start on the evening s expedition but Horace had not yet come home and on the chance of his arrival they would wait a few minutes longer I shall make this the subject of a paper for our Society next winter the Age of Progress And with special reference to one particular the Press Only think now of the difference between our newspapers all our periodicals of to day and those fifty years ago Did you ever really consider Miss Morgan what a marvellous thing one of our great newspapers really is Printed in another way it would make a volume absolutely a positive volume packed with thought and information And all for the ridiculous price of one penny He laughed a high chuckling crowing laugh the laugh of triumphant optimism Of the man s sincerity there could be no question it beamed from his shining forehead his pointed nose glistened in his prominent eyes He had a tall lank figure irreproachably clad in a suit of grey frock coat and waistcoat revealing an expanse of white shirt His cuffs were magnificent and the hands worthy of them A stand up collar of remarkable stiffness kept his head at the proper level of self respect By the bye Miss Lord are you aware that the Chinese Empire with four hundred MILLION inhabitants has only ten daily papers Positively only ten How do you know asked Nancy I saw it stated in a paper That helps one to grasp the difference between civilisation and barbarism One doesn t think clearly enough of common things Now that s one of the benefits one gets from Carlyle Carlyle teaches one to see the marvellous in everyday life Of course in many things I don t agree with him but I shall never lose an opportunity of expressing my gratitude to Carlyle Carlyle and Gurty Yes Carlyle and Gurty those two authors are an education in themselves He uttered a long Ah and moved his lips as if savouring a delicious morsel Now here s an interesting thing If all the cabs in London were put end to end he paused between the words gravely what do you think Miss Morgan would be the total length Oh I have no idea mister Barmby Forty miles positively Forty miles of cabs How do you know asked Nancy I saw it stated in a paper The girls glanced at each other and smiled Barmby beamed upon them with the benevolence of a man who knew his advantages personal and social And at this moment Horace Lord came in He had not the fresh appearance which usually distinguished him his face was stained with perspiration his collar had become limp the flower at his buttonhole hung faded Well here I am Are you going I suppose you know you have kept us waiting said his sister Awf ly sorry Couldn t get here before He spoke as if he had not altogether the command of his tongue and with a fixed meaningless smile We had better not delay said Barmby taking up his hat Seven o clock We ought to be at Charing Cross before eight that will allow us about three hours They set forth at once By private agreement between the girls Jessica Morgan attached herself to mister Barmby allowing Nancy to follow with her brother as they walked rapidly towards Camberwell Green Horace kept humming popular airs his hat had fallen a little to the side and he swung his cane carelessly His sister asked him what he had been doing all day Oh going about I met some fellows after the procession We had a splendid view up there on the top of Waterloo House Did Fanny go home We met her sisters and had some lunch at a restaurant Look here you don t want me to night You won t mind if I get lost in the crowd Barmby will be quite enough to take care of you You are going to meet her again I suppose Horace nodded We had better agree on a rendezvous at a certain time I say Barmby just a moment if any of us should get separated we had better know where to meet for coming home Oh there s no fear of that All the same it might happen There ll be a tremendous crush you know Suppose we say the place where the trams stop south of Westminster Bridge and the time a quarter to eleven This was agreed upon At Camberwell Green they mingled with a confused rush of hilarious crowds amid a clattering of cabs and omnibuses a jingling of tram car bells Public houses sent forth their alcoholic odours upon the hot air Samuel Barmby joyous in his protectorship of two young ladies for he regarded Horace as a mere boy bustled about them whilst they stood waiting for the arrival of the Westminster car It ll have to be a gallant rush You would rather be outside wouldn t you Miss Lord Here it comes charge But the charge was ineffectual for their purpose A throng of far more resolute and more sinewy people swept them aside and seized every vacant place on the top of the vehicle Only with much struggle did they obtain places within In an ordinary mood Nancy would have resented this hustling of her person by the profane public as it was she half enjoyed the tumult and looked forward to get more of it along the packed streets with a sense that she might as well amuse herself in vulgar ways since nothing better was attainable This did not however modify her contempt of Samuel Barmby it seemed never to have occurred to him that the rough and tumble might be avoided and time gained by the simple expedient of taking a cab Sitting opposite to Samuel she avoided his persistent glances by reading the rows of advertisements above his head Somebody s Blue somebody s Soap somebody s High class Jams and behold inserted between the Soap and the Jam God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son that whoso believeth in Him should not perish but have everlasting life Nancy perused the passage without perception of incongruity without emotion of any kind Her religion had long since fallen to pieces and universal defilement of Scriptural phrase by the associations of the market place had in this respect blunted her sensibilities Barmby was talking to Jessica Morgan She caught his words now and then Can you tell me what is the smallest tree in the world No it s the Greenland birch Its full grown height is only three inches positively But it spreads over several feet Nancy was tempted to lean forward and say How do you know But the jest seemed to involve her in too much familiarity with mister Barmby for her own peace it was better to treat him with all possible coldness A woman near her talked loudly about the procession with special reference to a personage whom she called Prince of Wiles This enthusiast declared with pride that she had stood at a certain street corner for seven hours accompanied by a child of five years old the same who now sat on her lap nodding in utter weariness together they were going to see the illuminations and walk about with intervals devoted to refreshments for several hours more Beyond sat a working man overtaken with liquor who railed vehemently at the Jubilee and in no measured terms gave his opinion of our Sovereign Lady the whole thing was a lay an occasion for filling the Royal pocket and it had succeeded to the tune of something like half a million of money wheedled most of it from the imbecile poor Shut up roared a loyalist whose patience could endure no longer We re not going to let a boozing blackguard like you talk in that way about er Majesty Thereupon retort of insult challenge to combat clamour from many throats deep and shrill Nancy laughed and would rather have enjoyed it if the men had fought At Westminster Bridge all jumped confusedly into the street and ran for the pavement It was still broad daylight the sun a potentate who keeps no Jubilee dropping westward amid the hues of summer eventide was unmarked for all his splendour by the roaring multitudes Where are you going to leave us Nancy inquired of her brother Charing Cross or somewhere about there Keep by me till then Barmby was endeavouring to secure her companionship He began to cross the bridge at her side but Nancy turned and bade him attend upon Miss Morgan saying that she wished to talk with her brother In this order they moved towards Parliament Street where the crowd began to thicken Now let us decide upon our route exclaimed Barmby with the air of a popular leader planning a great demonstration Miss Lord we will be directed by your wishes Where would you like to be when the lighting up begins I don t care What does it matter Let us go straight on and see whatever comes in our way That s the right spirit Let us give ourselves up to the occasion We can t be wrong in making for Trafalgar Square Advance They followed upon a group of reeling lads and girls who yelled in chorus the popular song of the day a sentimental one as it happened Do not forget me Do not forget me Think sometimes of me still Nancy was working herself into a nervous excited state She felt it impossible to walk on and on under Barmby s protection listening to his atrocious commonplaces his enthusiasms of the Young Men s Debating Society The glow of midsummer had entered into her blood she resolved to taste independence to mingle with the limitless crowd as one of its units borne in whatever direction That song of the streets pleased her made sympathetic appeal to her she would have liked to join in it Just behind her it was on the broad pavement at Whitehall some one spoke her name Miss Lord Why who would have expected to see you here Shouldn t have dared to think of such a thing upon my word I shouldn t A man of about thirty dressed without much care middle sized wiry ruddy of cheek and his coarse but strong features vivid with festive energy held a hand to her Luckworth Crewe was his name Nancy had come to know him at the house of missus Peachey where from time to time she had met various people unrecognised in her own home His tongue bewrayed him for a native of some northern county his manner had no polish but a genuine heartiness which would have atoned for many defects Horace who also knew him offered a friendly greeting but Samuel Barmby when the voice caught his ear regarded this intruder with cold surprise May I walk on with you Crewe asked when he saw that Miss Lord felt no distaste for his company Nancy deigned not even a glance at her nominal protector If you are going our way she replied Barmby his dignity unobserved strode on with Miss Morgan of whom he sought information concerning the loud voiced man Crewe talked away So you ve come out to have a look at it after all I saw the Miss Frenches last Sunday and they told me you cared no more for the Jubilee than for a dog fight Of course I wasn t surprised you ve other things to think about But it s worth seeing that s my opinion Were you out this morning No I don t care for Royalties No more do I Expensive humbugs that s what I call em But I had a look at them for all that The Crown Prince was worth seeing yes he really was I m not so prejudiced as to deny that He s the kind of chap I should like to get hold of and have a bit of a talk with and ask him what he thought about things in general It s been a big affair hasn t it I know a chap who made a Jubilee Perfume and he s netting something like a hundred pounds a day Have you any Jubilee speculation on hand Don t ask me It makes me mad I had a really big thing a Jubilee Drink a teetotal beverage the kind of thing that would have sold itself this weather A friend of mine hit on it a clerk in a City warehouse one of the cleverest chaps I ever knew It really was the drink I ve never tasted anything like it Why there s the biggest fortune on record waiting for the man who can supply the drink for total abstainers And this friend of mine had it He gave me some to taste one night about a month ago and I roared with delight It was all arranged I undertook to find enough capital to start with and to manage the concern I would have given up my work with Bullock and Freeman I d have gone in tooth and nail for that drink I sat up all one night trying to find a name for it but couldn t hit on the right one A name is just as important as the stuff itself that you want to sell Next morning it was Sunday I went round to my friend s lodgings and he slapped his thigh I m blest if the chap hadn t cut his throat Why Betting and forgery He would have been arrested next day But the worst of it was that his beverage perished with him I hadn t a notion how it was made he wouldn t tell me till I planked down money to start with and not a drop of it could be found anywhere And to think that he had absolutely struck oil as they say had nothing to do but sit down and count the money as it came in That s the third man I ve known go wrong in less than a year Betting and embezzlement betting and burglary betting and forgery I ll tell you some time about the chap who went in for burglary One of the best fellows I ever knew when he comes out I must give him a hand But ten to one he ll burgle again they always do burglary grows on a man like drink His laughter rang across the street Barmby who kept looking back surprised and indignant that this acquaintance of Miss Lord s was not presented to him paused for a moment but Nancy waved to him commandingly Straight on They reached Charing Cross Horace who took no part in the conversation and had dropped behind at this point found an opportunity of stealing away It was Crewe who first remarked his absence Hollo where s your brother Gone evidently Hush Don t say anything Will you do something for me mister Crewe Of course I will What is it Nancy pursued in a low voice He s gone to meet Fanny French At least he told me so but I want to know whether it is really Fanny or some one else He said they were to meet in front of the Haymarket Theatre Will you go as quickly as you can and see if Fanny is there Crewe laughed Like a bird But how am I to meet you again We ll be at the top of Regent Street at nine o clock by Peter Robinson s Don t lose time He struck off in the westerly direction and Barmby looking round at that moment saw him go Engrossed in thought of Nancy Samuel did not yet perceive that her brother had vanished Your friend isn t coming any further he said in a tone of forbearance No But where s mister Lord exclaimed Jessica Nancy pretended to look back for him and for a minute or two they waited Barmby glad to be delivered from both male companions made light of the matter Horace could take care of himself they had the appointment for a quarter to eleven on And he now fixed himself resolutely at Nancy s side She delighted with the success of her stratagem and careless of what might result from it behaved more companionably To Luckworth Crewe s society she had no objection indeed she rather liked him but his presence would have hindered the escape for which she was preparing Poor Jessica might feel it something of a hardship to pass hours alone with the Prophet but that could not be helped Nancy would be free to night if never again They turned into the Strand and Barmby voiced his opinion of the public decorations There s very little of what can be called Art very little indeed I m afraid we haven t made much progress in Art Now what would Ruskin say to this kind of thing The popular taste wants educating My idea is that we ought to get a few leading men Burne Jones and and William Morris and people of that kind you know Miss Lord to give lectures in a big hall on the elements of Art A great deal might be done in that way don t you think so Miss Morgan I have no faith in anything popular Jessica replied loftily No no But after all the people have got the upper hand now a days and we who enjoy advantages of education of culture ought not to allow them to remain in darkness It isn t for our own interest most decidedly it isn t Did your sisters go to see the procession Nancy asked Oh they were afraid of the crowd The old gentleman took them out to Tooting Common this afternoon and they enjoyed themselves Perhaps I should have been wiser if I had imitated their example I mean this morning of course I wouldn t have missed this evening for anything whatever But somehow one feels it a sort of duty to see something of these great public holidays I caught a glimpse of the procession In its way it was imposing yes really After all the Monarchy is a great fact as Gurty would have said I like to keep my mind open to facts The sun had set and with approach of dusk the crowds grew denser Nancy proposed a return westwards the clubs of Pall Mall and of saint James s Street would make a display worth seeing and they must not miss Piccadilly A little later said their escort with an air of liberality we must think of some light refreshment We shall be passing a respectable restaurant no doubt Twilight began to obscure the distance Here and there a house front slowly marked itself with points of flame shaping to wreath festoon or initials of Royalty Nancy looked eagerly about her impatient for the dark wishing the throng would sweep her away In Pall Mall Barmby felt it incumbent upon him to name the several clubs a task for which he was inadequately prepared As he stood staring in doubt at one of the coldly insolent facades Jessica gazing in the same direction Nancy saw that her moment had come She darted off struggled through a moving crowd and reached the opposite pavement All she had now to do was to press onward with the people around her save by chance she could not possibly be discovered Alarm at her daring troubled her for a few minutes As a matter of course Barmby would report this incident to her father unless she plainly asked him not to do so for which she had no mind Yet what did it matter She had escaped to enjoy herself and the sense of freedom soon overcame anxieties No one observed her solitary state she was one of millions walking about the streets because it was Jubilee Day and every moment packed her more tightly among the tramping populace A procession this greatly more significant than that of Royal personages earlier in the day Along the main thoroughfares of mid London wheel traffic was now suspended between the houses moved a double current of humanity this way and that filling the whole space so that no vehicle could possibly have made its way on the wonted track At junctions pickets of police directed progress the slowly advancing masses wheeled to left or right at word of command carelessly obedient But for an occasional bellow of hilarious blackguardism or for a song uplifted by strident voices or a cheer at some flaring symbol that pleased the passers there was little noise only a thud thud of footfalls numberless and the low unvarying sound that suggested some huge beast purring to itself in stupid contentment Nancy forgot her identity lost sight of herself as an individual Her blood was heated by close air and physical contact She did not think and her emotions differed little from those of any shop girl let loose The culture to which she laid claim evanesced in this atmosphere of exhalations Could she have seen her face its look of vulgar abandonment would have horrified her Some one trod violently on her heel and she turned with a half angry laugh protesting Beg your pardon miss said a young fellow of the clerkly order A push be ind made me do it He thrust himself to a place beside her and Nancy conversed with him unrestrainedly as though it were a matter of course The young man scrutinising her with much freedom shaped clerkly compliments and in his fashion grew lyrical until at a certain remark which he permitted himself Nancy felt it time to shake him off Her next encounter was more noteworthy Of a sudden she felt an arm round her waist and a man whose breath declared the source of his inspiration began singing close to her ear the operatic ditty Queen of my Heart He had moreover a good tenor voice and belonged vaguely to some stratum of educated society I think you had better leave me alone said Nancy looking him severely in the face Well if you really think so he seemed struck by her manner of speech of course I will but I d much rather not I might find it necessary to speak to a policeman at the next corner Oh in that case He raised his hat and fell aside And Nancy felt that after all the adventure had been amusing She was now in Regent Street and it came to her recollection that she had made an appointment with Luckworth Crewe for nine o clock Without any intention of keeping it but why not do so Her lively acquaintance would be excellent company for the next hour until she chose to bring the escapade to an end And indeed save by a disagreeable struggle she could hardly change the direction of her steps It was probably past nine Crewe might have got tired of waiting or have found it impossible to keep a position on the pavement Drawing near to the top of Regent Street she hoped he might be there And there he was jovially perspiring he saw her between crowded heads and crushed through to her side CHAPTER eight Where are your friends That s more than I can tell you They laughed together It s a miracle we ve been able to meet said Crewe I had to thrash a fellow five minutes ago and was precious near getting run in Shall we go the Tottenham Court Road way Look out You d better hold on to my arm These big crossings are like whirlpools you might go round and round and never get anywhere Don t be afraid if any one runs up against you I ll knock him down There wouldn t be room for him to fall said Nancy wild with merriment as they swayed amid the uproar For the first time she understood how perilous such a crowd might be A band of roisterers linked arm in arm were trying to break up the orderly march of thousands into a chaotic fight The point for which Crewe made was unattainable just in front of him a woman began shrieking hysterically another fainted and dropped into her neighbour s arms Don t get frightened Not I I like it It s good fun You re the right sort you are But we must get out of this It s worse than the pit door on the first night of a pantomime I must hold you up don t mind His arm encircled her body and for a moment now and then he carried rather than led her They were safe at length in the right part of Oxford Street and moving with the stream I couldn t find your brother Crewe had leisure to say and I didn t see Fanny French There weren t many people about just then either They must have gone off before I came Yes they must It doesn t matter You have some life in you He gazed at her admiringly You re worth half a million of the girls that squeak and wobble when there s a bit of rough play going on I hope so Did you set me down as one of that kind Nancy found that her tongue had achieved a liberty suitable to the occasion She spoke without forethought and found pleasure in her boldness Not I Crewe answered But I never had a chance before now of telling you what I thought Some one in front of them ignited a Bengal light and threw it into the air the flame flashed across Nancy s features and fell upon the hat of a man near her How do you mean to get home asked Crewe presently Nancy explained that all her party were to meet on the other side of the river Oh then there s plenty of time When you ve had enough of this kind of thing we can strike off into the quiet streets If you were a man which I m glad you re not I should say I was choking for a glass of beer Say it and look for a place where you can quench your thirst It must be a place then where you can come in as well You don t drink beer of course but we can get lemonade and that kind of thing No wonder we get thirsty look up there Following the direction of his eyes Nancy saw above the heads of the multitude a waving dust canopy sent up by myriad tramplings on the sun scorched streets Glare of gas illumined it in the foreground beyond it dimmed all radiance like a thin fog We might cut across through Soho he pursued and get among the restaurants Take my arm again Only a bit of cross fighting and we shall be in the crowd going the other way Did you do physics at school Remember about the resultant of forces Now we re a force tending to the right and the crowd is a force making for straight on to find the His hat was knocked over his eyes and the statement of the problem ended in laughter With a good deal of difficulty they reached one of the southward byways and thenceforth walking was unimpeded You know that I call myself Luckworth Crewe resumed Nancy s companion after a short silence Of course I do Well the fact is I ve no right to either of the names I thought I d just tell you for the fun of the thing I shouldn t talk about it to any one else that I know They tell me I was picked up on a doorstep in Leeds and the wife of a mill hand adopted me Their name was Crewe They called me Tom but somehow it isn t a name I care for and when I was grown up I met a man called Luckworth who was as kind as a father to me and so I took his name in place of Tom That s the long and short of it Nancy looked a trifle disconcerted You won t think any worse of me because I haven t a name of my own Why should I It isn t your fault No But I m not the kind of man to knuckle under I think myself just as good as anybody else I ll knock the man down that sneers at me and I won t thank anybody for pitying me that s the sort of chap I am And I m going to have a big fortune one of these days It s down in the books I know I shall live to be a rich man just as well as I know that I m walking down Dean Street with Miss Lord I should think it very possible his companion remarked It hasn t begun yet I can only lay my hand on a few hundred pounds one way and another And I m turned thirty But the next ten years are going to do it Do you know what I did last Saturday I got fifteen hundred pounds worth of advertising for our people from a chap that s never yet put a penny into the hands of an agent I went down and talked to him like a father He was the hardest nut I ever had to crack but in thirty five minutes I d got him like a roach on a hook And it ll be to his advantage mind you That fifteen hundred ll bring him in more business than he s had for ten years past I got him to confess he was going down the hill Of course I said because you don t know how to advertise and won t let anybody else know for you In a few minutes he was telling me he d dropped more than a thousand on a patent that was out of date before it got fairly going All right said I Here s your new cooking stove You ve dropped a thousand on the other thing give your advertising to us and I ll guarantee you shall come home on the cooking stove Come home on it Nancy inquired in astonishment Oh it s our way of talking said the other with his hearty laugh It means to make up one s loss And he ll do it And when he has he ll think no end of me I daresay Not long ago I boxed a chap for his advertising A fair turn up with the gloves Do you suppose I licked him Not I though I could have done it with one hand I just let him knock me out of time and two minutes after he put all his business into my hands Oh you ll get rich declared Nancy laughing No doubt about it There was a spot down the South Western Railway where we wanted to stick up a board a great big board as ugly as they make em It was in a man s garden a certain particular place where the trains slow and folks have time to read the advertisement and meditate on it That chap wouldn t listen What spoil his garden with our da with our confounded board not for five hundred a year Well I went down and I talked to him Like a father put in Nancy Just so like a father Look here said I my dear sir you re impeding the progress of civilisation How could we have become what we are without the modern science and art of advertising Till advertising sprang up the world was barbarous Do you suppose people kept themselves clean before they were reminded at every corner of the benefits of soap Do you suppose they were healthy before every wall and hoarding told them what medicine to take for their ailments Not they indeed Why a man like you an enlightened man I see it in your face he was as ugly as Ben s bull dog ought to be proud of helping on the age And I made him downright ashamed of himself He asked me to have a bit of dinner and we came to terms over the cheese In this strain did Luckworth Crewe continue to talk across the gloomy solitudes of Soho And Nancy would on no account have had him cease She was fascinated by his rough vigour and by his visions of golden prosperity It seemed to her that they reached very quickly the restaurant he had in view With keen enjoyment of the novelty she followed him between tables where people were eating drinking smoking and took a place beside him on a cushioned seat at the end of the room I know you re tired he said There s nearly half an hour before you need move Nancy hesitated in her choice of a refreshment She wished to have something unusual something that fitted an occasion so remarkable yet as Crewe would of course pay she did not like to propose anything expensive Now let me choose for you her companion requested After all that rough work you want something more than a drop of lemonade I m going to order a nice little bottle of champagne out of the ice and a pretty little sandwich made of whatever you like Champagne It had been in her thoughts a sparkling audacity Good champagne let it be And she leaned back in defiant satisfaction I didn t expect much from Jubilee Day observed the man of business but that only shows how things turn out always better or worse than you think for I m not likely to forget it it s the best day I ve had in my life yet and I leave you to guess who I owe that to I think this is good wine remarked Nancy as if she had not heard him Not bad You wouldn t suppose a fellow of my sort would know anything about it But I do I ve drunk plenty of good champagne and I shall drink better Nancy ate her sandwich and smiled The one glass sufficed her Crewe drank three Presently looking at her with his head propped on his hand he said gravely I wonder whether this is the last walk we shall have together Who can say she answered in a light tone Some one ought to be able to say I never make prophecies and never believe other people s Shows your good sense But I make wishes and plenty of them So do I said Nancy Then let us both make a wish to ourselves proposed Crewe regarding her with eyes that had an uncommon light in them His companion laughed then both were quiet for a moment They allowed themselves plenty of time to battle their way as far as Westminster Bridge At one point police and crowd were in brief conflict the burly guardians of order dealt thwacking blows right and left sound fisticuffs backed with hearty oaths The night was young by magisterial providence hours of steady drinking lay before the hardier jubilants Thwacks and curses would be no rarity in another hour or two At the foot of Parliament Street Nancy came face to face with Samuel Barmby on whose arm hung the wearied Jessica Without heeding their exclamations she turned to her protector and bade him a hearty good night Crewe accepted his dismissal He made survey of Barmby and moved off singing to himself Do not forget me do not forget me Part II Nature s Graduate CHAPTER one The disorder which Stephen Lord masked as a touch of gout had in truth a much more disagreeable name It was now twelve months since his doctor s first warning directed against the savoury meats and ardent beverages which constituted his diet Stephen resolved upon a change of habits but the flesh held him in bondage and medical prophecy was justified by the event All through Jubilee Day he suffered acutely for the rest of the week he remained at home sometimes sitting in the garden but generally keeping his room where he lay on a couch A man of method and routine sedentary with a strong dislike of unfamiliar surroundings he could not be persuaded to try change of air The disease intensified his native stubbornness made him by turns fretful and furious disposed him to a sullen solitude He would accept no tendance but that of Mary Woodruff to her as to his children he kept up the pretence of gout He was visited only by Samuel Barmby with whom he discussed details of business and by mister Barmby senior his friend of thirty years the one man to whom he unbosomed himself His effort to follow the regimen medically prescribed to him was even now futile At the end of a week s time imagining himself somewhat better he resumed his daily walk to Camberwell Road but remained at the warehouse only till two or three o clock then returned and sat alone in his room On one of the first days of July when the weather was oppressively hot he entered the house about noon and in a few minutes rang his bell Mary Woodruff came to him He was sitting on the couch pale wet with perspiration and exhausted I want something to drink he said wearily without raising his eyes Will you have the lime water sir Yes what you like Mary brought it to him and he drank two large glasses with no pause Where is Nancy In town sir She said she would be back about four He made an angry movement What s she doing in town She said nothing to me Why doesn t she come back to lunch Where does she go to for all these hours I don t know sir The servant spoke in a low respectful voice looking at her master with eyes that seemed to compassionate him Well it doesn t matter He waved a hand as if in dismissal Wait if I m to be alone I might as well have lunch now I feel hungry as if I hadn t eaten anything for twenty four hours Get me something Mary Later in the afternoon his bell again sounded and Mary answered it As he did not speak at once he was standing by the window with his hands behind him she asked him his pleasure Bring me some water Mary plain drinking water She returned with a jug and glass and he took a long draught No don t go yet I want to to talk to you about things Sit down there for a minute He pointed to the couch and Mary with an anxious look obeyed him I m thinking of leaving this house and going to live in the country There s no reason why I shouldn t My partner can look after the business well enough It might be the best thing you could do sir The best for your health Yes it might I m not satisfied with things I want to make a decided change in every way His face had grown more haggard during the last few days and his eyes wandered expressing fretfulness or fear he spoke with effort and seemed unable to find the words that would convey his meaning Now I want you to tell me plainly what do you think of Nancy Think of her sir No no don t speak in that way I don t want you to call me sir it isn t necessary we ve known each other so long and I think of you as a friend a very good friend Think of me in the same way and speak naturally I want to know your opinion of Nancy The listener had a face of grave attention it signified no surprise no vulgar self consciousness but perhaps a just perceptible pleasure And in replying she looked steadily at her master for a moment I really don t feel I can judge her mister Lord It s true in a way I ought to know her very well as I ve seen her day by day since she was a little thing But now she s a well educated and clever young lady and she has got far beyond me Ay there it is there it is Stephen interrupted with bitterness She s got beyond us beyond me as well as you And she isn t what I meant her to be very far from it I haven t brought them up as I wished I don t know I m sure I don t know why It was in own hands When they were little children I said to myself hey shall grow up plain good honest girl and boy I said that I wouldn t educate them very much I saw little good that came of it in our rank of life I meant them to be simple minded I hoped Nancy would marry a plain countryman like the men I used to know when I was a boy a farmer or something of that kind But see how it s come about It wasn t that I altered my mind about what was best But I seemed to have no choice For one thing I made more money at business than I had expected and so and so it seemed that they ought to be educated above me and mine There was my mother did a better woman ever live She had no education but that of home She could have brought up Nancy in the good old fashioned way if I had let her I wish I had yes I wish I had I don t think you could have felt satisfied said the listener with intelligent sympathy Why not If she had been as good and useful a woman as you are Ah you mustn t think in that way mister Lord I was born and bred to service Your daughter had a mind given her at her birth that would never have been content with humble things She was meant for education and a higher place What higher place is there for her She thinks herself too good for the life she leads here and yet I don t believe she ll ever find a place among people of a higher class She has told me herself it s my fault She says I ought to have had a big house for her so that she might make friends among the rich Perhaps she s right I have made her neither one thing nor another Mary if I had never come to London I might have lived happily My place was away there in the old home I ve known that for many a year I ve thought wait till I ve made a little more money and I ll go back But it was never done and now it looks to me as if I had spoilt the lives of my children as well as my own I can t trust Nancy that s the worst of it You don t know what she did on Jubilee night She wasn t with mister Barmby and the others Barmby told me about it she pretended to lose them and went off somewhere to meet a man she s never spoken to me about Is that how a good girl would act I didn t speak to her about it what use Very likely she wouldn t tell me the truth She takes it for granted I can t understand her She thinks her education puts her above all plain folk and their ways that s it Mary s eyes had fallen and she kept silence Suppose anything happened to me and they were left to themselves I have money to leave between them and of course they know it How could it do them anything but harm Do you know that Horace wants to marry that girl Fanny French a grinning chattering fool if not worse He has told me he shall do as he likes Whether or no it was right to educate Nancy I am very sure that I ought to have done with him as I meant at first He hasn t the brains to take a good position When his schooling went on year after year I thought at last to make of him something better than his father a doctor or a lawyer But he hadn t the brains he disappointed me bitterly And what use can he make of my money when I m in my grave If I die soon he ll marry and ruin his life And won t it be the same with Nancy Some plotting greedy fellow the kind of man you see everywhere now a days will fool her for the money s sake We must hope they ll be much older and wiser before they have to act for themselves said Mary looking into her master s troubled face Yes He came nearer to her with a sudden hopefulness And whether I live much longer or not I can do something to guard them against their folly They needn t have the money as soon as I am gone He seated himself in front of his companion I want to ask you something Mary If they were left alone would you be willing to live here still as you do now for a few more years I shall do whatever you wish whatever you bid me mister Lord answered the woman in a voice of heartfelt loyalty You would stay on and keep house for them But would they go on living here I could make them do so I could put it down as a condition in my will At all events I would make Nancy stay Horace might live where he liked though not with money to throw about They have no relatives that could be of any use to them I should wish Nancy to go on living here and you with her and she would only have just a sufficient income paid by my old friend Barmby or by his son And that till she was what I have thought of six and twenty By that time she would either have learnt wisdom or she never would She must be free sooner or later But she couldn t live by herself mister Lord You tell me you would stay he exclaimed impulsively Oh but I am only her servant That wouldn t be enough It would be Your position shall be changed There s no one living to whom I could trust her as I could to you There s no woman I respect so much For twenty years you have proved yourself worthy of respect and it shall be paid to you His vehemence would brook no opposition You said you would do as I wished I wish you to have a new position in this house You shall no longer be called a servant you shall be our housekeeper and our friend I will have it I tell you he cried angrily You shall sit at table with us and live with us Nancy still has sense enough to acknowledge that this is only your just reward from her I know there won t be a word of objection What can you have to say against it The woman was pale with emotion Her reserve and sensibility shrank from what seemed to her an invidious honour yet she durst not irritate the sick man by opposition It will make Nancy think he pursued with emphasis It will help her perhaps to see the difference between worthless women who put themselves forward and the women of real value who make no pretences Perhaps it isn t too late to set good examples before her I ve never found her ill natured though she s wilful it isn t her heart that s wrong I hope and think not only her mind that s got stuffed with foolish ideas Since her grandmother s death she s had no guidance You shall talk to her as a woman can not all at once but when she s used to thinking of you in this new way You are forgetting her friends Mary said at length with eyes of earnest appeal Her friends She s better without such friends There s one thing I used to hope but I ve given it up I thought once that she might have come to a liking for Samuel Barmby but now I don t think she ever will and I believe it s her friends that are to blame for it One thing I know that she ll never meet with any one who will make her so good a husband as he would We don t think alike in every way he s a young man and has the new ideas but I ve known him since he was a boy and I respect his character He has a conscience which is no common thing now a days He lives a clean homely life and you won t find many of his age who do Nancy thinks herself a thousand times too good for him I only hope he mayn t prove a great deal too good for her But I ve given up that thought I ve never spoken to her about it and I never shall no good comes of forcing a girl s inclination I only tell you of it Mary because I want you to understand what has been going on They heard a bell ring that of the front door It ll be Miss Nancy said Mary rising Go to the door then If it s Nancy tell her I want to speak to her and come back yourself mister Lord Do as I tell you at once All the latent force of Stephen s character now declared itself He stood upright his face stern and dignified In a few moments Nancy entered the room and Mary followed her at a distance Nancy said the father I want to tell you of a change in the house You know that Mary has been with us for twenty years You know that for a long time we haven t thought of her as a servant but as a friend and one of the best possible It s time now to show our gratitude Mary will continue to help us as before but henceforth she is one of our family She will eat with us and sit with us and I look to you my girl to make the change an easy and pleasant one for her As soon as she understood the drift of her father s speech Nancy experienced a shock and could not conceal it But when silence came she had commanded herself An instant s pause then with her brightest smile she turned to Mary and spoke in a voice of kindness Father is quite right Your place is with us I am glad very glad Mary looked from mister Lord to his daughter tried vainly to speak and left the room CHAPTER two His father s contemptuous wrath had an ill effect upon Horace Of an amiable disposition and without independence of character he might have been guided by a judicious parent through all the perils of his calf love for Fanny French thrown upon his own feeble resources he regarded himself as a victim of the traditional struggle between prosaic age and nobly passionate youth and resolved at all hazards to follow the heroic course which meant first of all a cold taciturnity towards his father and as to his future conduct a total disregard of the domestic restraints which he had hitherto accepted In a day or two he sat down and wrote his father a long letter of small merit as a composition and otherwise illustrating the profitless nature of the education for which Stephen Lord had hopefully paid It began with a declaration of rights He was a man he could no longer submit to childish trammels A man must not be put to inconvenience by the necessity of coming home at early hours A man could not brook cross examination on the subject of his intimacies his expenditure and so forth Above all a man was answerable to no one but himself for his relations with the other sex for the sacred hopes he cherished for his emotions and aspirations which transcended even a man s vocabulary With much more of like tenor To this epistle delivered by post mister Lord made no answer Horace flattered himself that he had gained a victory There was nothing like firmness and that evening about nine he went to De Crespigny Park As usual he had to ring the bell two or three times before any one came the lively notes of a piano sounded from the drawing room intimating no doubt that missus Peachey had guests The door at length opened and he bade the servant let Miss Fanny know that he was here he would wait in the dining room It was not yet dark but objects could only just be distinguished the gloom supplied Horace with a suggestion at which he laughed to himself He had laid down his hat and cane when a voice surprised him Who s that asked some one from the back of the room Oh are you there mister Peachey I ve come to see Fanny I didn t care to go among the people All right We d better light the gas With annoyance Horace saw the master of the house come forward and strike a match Remains of dinner were still on the table The two exchanged glances How is your father Peachey inquired He had a dull depressed look and moved languidly to draw down the blind Oh he isn t quite up to the mark But it s nothing serious I think Miss Lord quite well We haven t seen much of her lately I don t know why I m sure Nobody can depend upon her very much Well I ll leave you said the other with a dreary look about the room The table ought to have been cleared by now but that s nothing new Confounded servants muttered Horace Oh yes the servants was Peachey s ironical reply As soon as he was left alone Horace turned out the gas Then he stood near the door trembling with amorous anticipation But minutes went by his impatience grew intolerable he stamped and twisted his fingers together Then of a sudden the door opened Why it s dark there s nobody here Fanny discovered her mistake She was seized and lifted off her feet Oh Do you want to eat me I ll hit you as hard as I can I will You re spoiling my dress The last remonstrance was in a note that Horace did not venture to disregard Strike a light silly I know you ve done something to my dress Horace pleaded abjectly to be forgiven and that the room might remain shadowed but Fanny was disturbed in temper If you don t light the gas I ll go at once I haven t any matches darling Oh just like you You never have anything I thought every man carried matches She broke from him and ran out Wretched in the fear that she might not return Horace waited on the threshold In the drawing room some one was singing The Maid of the Mill It came to an end and there sounded voices which the tormented listener strove to recognise For at least ten minutes he waited and was all but frantic when the girl made her appearance coming downstairs Never do that again she said viciously I ve had to unfasten my things and put them straight What a nuisance you are He stood cowed before her limp and tremulous There light the gas Why couldn t you come into the drawing room like other people do Who is there asked the young man when he had obeyed her Go and see for yourself Don t be angry Fanny He followed her like a dog as she walked round the table to look at herself in the mirror over the fireplace It was only because I m so fond of you Oh what a silly you are she laughed seating herself on the arm of an easy chair Go ahead What s the latest Well for one thing I ve had a very clear understanding with the gov nor about my independence I showed him that I meant having my own way and he might bully as much as he liked It was not thus that Horace would naturally have spoken not thus that he thought of his father Fanny had subdued him to her own level poisoned him with the desires excited by her presence And he knew his baseness he was not ignorant of the girl s ignoble nature Only the fury of a virgin passion enabled him to talk and sometimes think as though he were in love with ideal purity I didn t think you had the pluck said Fanny swinging one of her feet as she tittered That shows you haven t done me justice And you re going to stay out late at night As late as I like Horace answered crossing his arms Then where will you take me to morrow It happened that Horace was in funds just now he had received his quarter s salary Board and lodging were no expense to him he provided his own clothing but with this exception had to meet no serious claim So in reply to Fanny s characteristic question he jingled coins Wherever you like Dorothy Ruddigore Delighted with his assent she became more gracious permitted a modest caress and presently allowed herself to be drawn on to her lover s knee She was passive unconcerned no second year graduate of the pavement could have preserved a completer equanimity it did not appear that her pulse quickened ever so slightly nor had her eyelid the suspicion of a droop She hummed Queen of my Heart and grew absent in speculative thought whilst Horace burned and panted at the proximity of her white flesh Oh how I do love you Fanny She trod playfully on his toe You haven t told the old gentleman yet I I m thinking about it But Fanny suppose he was to to refuse to do anything for us Would it make any difference There are lots of people who marry on a hundred and fifty a year oh lots The maiden arched her brows and puckered her lips Hitherto it had been taken for granted that mister Lord would be ready with subsidy Horace in a large vague way had hinted that assurance long ago Fanny s disinclination to plight her troth she still deemed herself absolutely free had alone interfered between the young man and a definite project of marriage What kind of people she asked coldly Oh respectable educated people like ourselves And live in apartments Thank you I don t quite see myself There isn t a bit of hurry dear boy Wait a bit She began to sing Wait till the clouds roll by If you thought as much of me as I do of you Tired of her position Fanny jumped up and took a spoonful of sweet jelly from a dish on the table Have some Come here again I ve something more to tell you Something very important She could only be prevailed upon to take a seat near him Horace beset with doubts as to his prudence but unable to keep the secret began to recount the story of his meeting with missus Damerel whom he had now seen for the second time Fanny s curiosity instantly awakened grew eager as he proceeded She questioned with skill and pertinacity and elicited many more details than Nancy Lord had been able to gather You ll promise me not to say a word to any one pleaded Horace I won t open my lips But you re quite sure she s as old as you say Old enough to be my mother I assure you The girl s suspicions were not wholly set at rest but she made no further display of them Now just think what an advantage it might be to you to know her Horace pursued She d introduce you at once to fashionable society really tip top people How would you like that Not bad was the judicial reply She must have no end of money and who knows what she might do for me It s a jolly queer thing mused the maiden There s no denying that We must keep it close whatever we do You haven t told anybody else Not a soul Horace lied stoutly They were surprised by the sudden opening of the door a servant appeared to clear the table Fanny reprimanded her for neglecting to knock We may as well go into the drawing room There s nobody particular Only missus Middlemist and mister Crewe and In the hall they encountered Crewe himself who stood there conversing with Beatrice A few words were exchanged by the two men and Horace followed his enchantress into the drawing room where he found seated in conversation with missus Peachey two persons whom he had occasionally met here One of them missus Middlemist was a stout coarse high coloured woman with fingers much bejewelled Until a year or two ago she had adorned the private bar of a public house kept by her husband retired from this honourable post she now devoted herself to society and the domestic virtues The other guest missus Murch by name proclaimed herself at a glance of less prosperous condition though no less sumptuously arrayed Her face had a hungry spiteful leering expression she spoke in a shrill peevish tone and wriggled nervously on her chair In eleven years of married life missus Murch had borne six children all of whom died before they were six months old She lived apart from her husband who had something to do with the manufacture of an Infants Food Fanny was requested to sing She sat down at the piano rattled a prelude and gave forth an echo of the music halls It s all up with poor Tommy now I shall never more be happy I vow It s just a week to day Since my Sairey went away And it s all up with poor Tommy now missus Middlemist who prided herself upon serious vocal powers remarked that comic singing should be confined to men You haven t a bad voice my dear if you would only take pains with it Now sing us For Ever and for Ever This song being the speaker s peculiar glory she was of course requested to sing it herself and after entreaty consented Her eyes turned upward her fat figure rolling from side to side her mouth very wide open missus Middlemist did full justice to the erotic passion of this great lyric Perchawnce if we ad never met We ad been spared this mad regret This hendless striving to forget For hever hand for he e e ver missus Murch let her head droop sentimentally Horace glanced at Fanny who however seemed absorbed in reflections as unsentimental as could be In the meanwhile on a garden seat under the calm but misty sky sat Luckworth Crewe and Beatrice French Crewe smoked a cigar placidly Beatrice was laying before him the suggestion of her great commercial scheme already confided to Fanny How does it strike you she asked at length Not bad old chap There s something in it if you re clever enough to carry it through And I shouldn t wonder if you are Will you help to set it going Can t help with money Crewe replied Very well will you help in other ways Practical hints and so on Of course I will Always ready to encourage merit in the money making line What capital are you prepared to put into it Not much The public must supply the capital A sound principle Crewe laughed But I shouldn t go on the old lines You didn t think of starting a limited company You d find difficulties Now what you want to start is a let us call it the South London Dress Supply Association or something of that kind But you won t get to that all at once You ought to have premises to begin with I m aware of it Can you raise a thousand or so Yes I could if I chose Now look here Your notion of the Fashion Club is a deuced good one and I don t see why it shouldn t be pretty easily started Out of every five hundred women you can reckon on four hundred and ninety nine being fools and there isn t a female fool who wouldn t read and think about a circular which promised her fashionable dresses for an unfashionable price That s a great and sound basis to start on What I advise is that you should first of all advertise for a dress making concern that would admit a partner with a small capital You ll have between ten and twelve hundred replies but don t be staggered go through them carefully and select a shop that s well situated and doing a respectable trade Get hold of these people and induce them to make changes in their business to suit your idea Then blaze away with circulars headed South London Fashion Club send them round the whole district addressed to women Every idiot of them will at all events come and look at the shop that can be depended upon in itself no bad advertisement Arrange to have a special department special entrance if possible with The Club painted up Yes by jingo Have a big room with comfortable chairs and the women s weekly papers lying about and smart dresses displayed on what d ye call ems like they have in windows Make the subscription very low at first and give rattling good value never mind if you lose by it Then when you ve got hold of a lot of likely people try them with the share project By the bye if you lose no time you can bring in the Jubilee somehow Yes start with the Jubilee Fashion Club I wonder nobody s done it already Beatrice was growing elated The public has to wait for its benefactors she replied I ll tell you what would you like me to sketch you out a prospectus of the Club Yes you might do that if you like You won t expect to be paid Hang it what do you take me for Business is business Miss French remarked coldly So it is And friendship is friendship Got a match He laughed No I suppose you haven t I ll go and get you one if you like There s a good fellow I ll think in the meantime Beatrice rose lazily and was absent for several minutes When she returned Crewe re lit his cigar Why shouldn t I start the shop on my own account Beatrice asked You haven t capital enough A little place wouldn t do I think I can get Fanny to join me Can you What will young Lord have to say to that Psh That s all fooling It ll never come to anything Unless of course the old man turned up his toes and left the boy a tidy sum But he won t just yet I ve told Fanny that if she ll raise something on her houses I ll guarantee her the same income she has now Take my advice said Crewe weightily and hook on to an established business Of course you can change the name if you like and there d have to be alterations and painting up to give a new look It s risky dealing with strangers How if they got hold of my idea and then refused to take me in Well now look here After all I ll make a bargain with you old chap If I can introduce you to the right people and get you safely started will you give me all your advertising on the usual commission You mean give it to Bullock and Freeman No I don t It s a secret just yet but I m going to start for myself Beatrice was silent They exchanged a look in the gloom and Crewe nodded in confirmation of his announcement How much have you got Miss French inquired carelessly Not much Most of the capital is here He touched his forehead Same as with you The young woman glanced at him again and said in a lower voice You d have had more by now if Crewe waited puffing his cigar but she did not finish Maybe he replied impartially Maybe not Don t think I m sorry Beatrice hastened to add It was an idea like any other Not half a bad idea But there were obstacles After a pause Beatrice inquired Do you still think the same about women with money Just the same Crewe replied at once though with less than his usual directness the question seemed to make him meditative Just the same Every man looks at it in his own way of course I m not the sort of chap to knuckle under to my wife and there isn t one woman in a thousand if she gave her husband a start could help reminding him of it It s the wrong way about Let women be as independent as they like as long as they re not married I never think the worse of them whatever they do that s honest But a wife must play second fiddle and think her husband a small god almighty that s my way of looking at the question Beatrice laughed scornfully All right We shall see When do you start business This side Christmas End of September perhaps You think to snatch a good deal from B F I daresay Crewe nodded and smiled Then you ll look after this affair for me said Beatrice with a return to the tone of strict business Without loss of time You shall be advised of progress Of course I must debit you with exes All right Mind you charge for all the penny stamps Every one don t you forget it He stood up tilted forward on his toes and stretched himself I ll be trotting homewards It ll be time for by by when I get to Kennington CHAPTER three Nancy was undisturbed by the promotion of Mary Woodruff A short time ago it would have offended her she would have thought her dignity her social prospects imperilled She was now careless on that score and felt it a relief to cast off the show of domestic authority Henceforth her position would be like that of Horace All she now desired was perfect freedom from responsibility to be as it were a mere lodger in the house to come and go unquestioned and unrestrained by duties Thus by aid of circumstance had she put herself into complete accord with the spirit of her time Abundant privilege no obligation A reference of all things to her sovereign will and pleasure Withal a defiant rather than a hopeful mood resentment of the undisguisable fact that her will was sovereign only in a poor little sphere which she would gladly have transcended Now a days she never went in the direction of Champion Hill formerly her favourite walk If Jessica Morgan spoke of her acquaintances there she turned abruptly to another subject She thought of the place as an abode of arrogance and snobbery She recalled with malicious satisfaction her ill mannered remark to Lionel Tarrant Let him think of her as he would at all events he could no longer imagine her overawed by his social prestige The probability was that she had hurt him in a sensitive spot it might be hoped that the wound would rankle for a long time Her personal demeanour showed a change So careful hitherto of feminine grace and decorum she began to affect a mannishness of bearing a bluntness of speech such as found favour at De Crespigny Park In a few weeks she had resumed friendly intercourse with missus Peachey and her sisters and spent an occasional evening at their house Her father asked no questions she rarely saw him except at meals A stranger must have observed the signs of progressive malady in mister Lord s face but Nancy was aware of nothing to cause uneasiness she thought of him as suffering a little from gout elderly people were of course subject to such disorders On most days he went to business if he remained at home Mary attended him assiduously and he would accept no other ministration Nancy was no longer inclined to study and cared little for reading of any sort That new book on Evolution which she had brought from the library just before Jubilee Day was still lying about a dozen times she had looked at it with impatience and reminded herself that it must be returned Evolution She already knew all about Darwinism all she needed to know If necessary she could talk about it oh with an air But who wanted to talk about such things After all only priggish people the kind of people who lived at Champion Hill Or idiots like Samuel Bennett Barmby who bothered about the future of the world What was it to her the future of the world She wanted to live in the present to enjoy her youth An evening like that she had spent in the huge crowd with a man like Crewe to amuse her with his talk was worth whole oceans of culture Culture she already possessed abundance of it The heap of books she had read Last winter she had attended a course of lectures delivered by a young University gentleman with a tone of bland omniscience on The History of Hellenic Civilisation her written answers to the little test papers had been marked very satisfactory Was it not a proof of culture achieved Education must not encroach upon the years of maturity Nature marked the time when a woman should begin to live There was poor Jessica As July drew on Jessica began to look cadaverous ghostly She would assuredly break down long before the time of her examination What a wretched what an absurd existence Her home too was so miserable missus Morgan lay ill unable to attend to anything if she could not have a change of air it must soon be all over with her But they had no money no chance of going to the seaside It happened at length that mister Lord saw Jessica one evening when she had come to spend an hour in Grove Lane After her departure he asked Nancy what was the matter with the girl and Nancy explained the situation Well why not take her with you when you go away I didn t know that I was going away father Nothing has been said of it It s your own business I leave you to make what plans you like Nancy reflected You ought to have a change she said considerately It would do you good Suppose we all go to Teignmouth I should think that would suit you Why Teignmouth I enjoyed it last year And the lodgings were comfortable We could have the same from the first week in August How do you know I wrote the other day and asked Nancy replied with a smile But mister Lord declined to leave home Mary Woodruff did her best to persuade him until he angrily imposed silence In a day or two he said to Nancy If you wish to go to Teignmouth take Jessica and her mother People mustn t die for want of a five pound note Make your arrangements and let me know what money you ll need It s very kind of you father mister Lord turned away His daughter noticed that he walked feebly and she felt a moment s compunction Father you are not so well to day Without looking round he replied that he would be well enough if left alone and Nancy did not venture to say more A few days later she called in De Crespigny Park after dinnertime missus Peachey and Fanny were at Brighton Beatrice had preferred to stay in London being very busy with her great project Whilst she talked of it with Nancy Peachey and Luckworth Crewe came in together There was sprightly conversation in which the host obviously glad of his wife s absence took a moderate part Presently Miss Lord and he found themselves gossiping alone the other two had moved aside and as a look informed Nancy were deep in confidential dialogue What do you think of that business she asked her companion in an undertone I shouldn t wonder if it answers said the young man speaking as usual with a soft amiable voice Our friend is helping and he generally knows what he s about Crewe remained only for half an hour on shaking hands with him Nancy made known that she was going to the seaside next Monday for a few weeks and the man of business answered only with I hope you ll enjoy yourself Soon afterwards she took leave At the junction of De Crespigny Park and Grove Lane some one approached her and with no great surprise Nancy saw that it was Crewe Been waiting for you he said You remember you promised me another walk Oh it s much too late Of course it is I didn t mean now But to morrow Impossible She moved on in the direction away from her home I shall be with friends in the evening the Morgans Confound it I had made up my mind to ask you for last Saturday but some country people nabbed me for the whole of that day I took them up the Monument and up saint Paul s I ve never been up the Monument said Nancy Never Come to morrow afternoon then You can spare the afternoon Let s meet early somewhere Take a bus to London Bridge I ll be at the north end of London Bridge at three o clock All right I ll be there Nancy replied off hand You really will Three sharp I was never late at an appointment business or pleasure Which do you consider this asked his companion with a shrewd glance Now that s unkind I came here to night on business though You quite understand that didn t you I shouldn t like you to make any mistake Business pure and simple Why of course replied Nancy with an ingenuous air What else could it be And she added Don t come any further Ta ta Crewe went off into the darkness The next afternoon Nancy alighted at London Bridge a full quarter of an hour late It had been raining at intervals through the day and clouds still cast a gloom over the wet streets Crewe quite insensible to atmospheric influence came forward with his wonted brisk step and animated visage At Miss Lord s side he looked rather more plebeian than when walking by himself his high hat not of the newest utterly misbecame his head and was always at an unconventional angle generally tilting back his clothes of no fashionable cut bore the traces of perpetual hurry and multifarious impact But he carried a perfectly new and expensive umbrella to which as soon as he had shaken hands with her he drew Nancy s attention A present this morning from a friend of mine in the business I ran into his shop to get shelter Upon my word I had no intention didn t think anything about it However he owed me an acknowledgment I ve sent him three customers from our office since I saw him last By the bye I shall have half a day at the seaside on Monday There s a sale of building plots down at Whitsand The estate agents run a complimentary special train for people going down to bid and give a lunch before the auction begins Not bad business Are you going to bid asked Nancy I m going to have a look at all events and if I see anything that takes my fancy Ever been to Whitsand I m told it s a growing place I should like to get hold of a few advertising stations Where is it you are going to on Monday Teignmouth I don t know that part of the country Wish I could run down but I shan t have time I ve got my work cut out for August and September Would you like to come and see the place where I think of opening shop Is it far No We ll walk round when we ve been up the Monument You don t often go about the City I daresay Nothing doing of course on a Saturday afternoon Nancy made him moderate his pace which was too quick for her Part of the pleasure she found in Crewe s society came from her sense of being so undeniably his superior she liked to give him a sharp command and observe his ready obedience To his talk she listened with a good natured condescending smile occasionally making a remark which implied a more liberal view a larger intelligence than his Thus as they stood for a moment to look down at the steamboat wharf and Crewe made some remark about the value of a cargo just being discharged she said carelessly I suppose that s the view you take of everything You rate everything at market price Marketable things of course But you know me well enough to understand that I m not always thinking of the shop Wait till I ve made money Now then clumsy A man leaning over the parapet by Nancy s side had pushed against her Thus addressed he glared at the speaker but encountered a bellicose look which kept him quiet I shall live in a big way Crewe continued as they walked on towards Fish Street Hill Not for the swagger of it I don t care about that but because I ve a taste for luxury I shall have a country house and keep good horses And I should like to have a little farm of my own a model farm make my own butter and cheese and know that I ate the real thing I shall buy pictures Haven t I told you I like pictures Oh yes I shall go round among the artists and encourage talent that hasn t made itself known Can you recognise it asked Nancy Well I shall learn to And I shall have my wife s portrait painted by some first rate chap never mind what it costs and hung in the Academy That s a great idea of mine to see my wife s portrait in the Academy His companion laughed Take care then that your wife is ornamental I ll take precious good care of that Crewe exclaimed merrily Do you suppose I should dream of marrying a woman who wasn t good looking Don t shout please People can hear you I beg your pardon His voice sank to humility That s a bad habit of mine But I was going to say I went to the Academy this year just to look at the portraits of men s wives There was nothing particular in that line Not a woman I should have felt particularly proud of Tastes differ of course Mine has altered a good deal in the last ten years A man can t trust himself about women till he s thirty or near it Talk of something else Nancy commanded Certainly There s the sun coming out You see I was afraid it would keep on raining and you would have an excuse for staying at home I needed no excuse said Nancy If I hadn t wished to come you may be sure I should have said so Crewe flashed a look at her Ah that s how I like to hear you speak That does one good Well here we are People used to be fond of going up they say just to pitch themselves down A good deal of needless trouble it seems to me Perhaps they gave themselves the off chance of changing their minds before they got to the top Or wanted to see if life looked any better from up there suggested Nancy Or hoped somebody would catch them by the coat tails and settle a pension on them out of pity Thus jesting they began the ascent Crewe whose spirits were at high pressure talked all the way up the winding stairs on issuing into daylight he became silent and they stood side by side mute before the vision of London s immensity Nancy began to move round the platform The strong west wind lashed her cheeks to a glowing colour excitement added brilliancy to her eyes As soon as she had recovered from the first impression this spectacle of a world s wonder served only to exhilarate her she was not awed by what she looked upon In her conceit of self importance she stood there above the battling millions of men proof against mystery and dread untouched by the voices of the past and in the present seeing only common things though from an odd point of view Here her senses seemed to make literal the assumption by which her mind had always been directed that she Nancy Lord was the mid point of the universe No humility awoke in her she felt the stirring of envies avidities unavowable passions and let them flourish unrebuked Crewe had his eyes fixed upon her his lips parted hungrily Now that s how I should like to see you painted he said all at once Just like that I never saw you looking so well I believe you re the most beautiful girl to be found anywhere in this London There was genuine emotion in his voice and his sweeping gesture suited the mood of vehemence Nancy having seen that the two or three other people on the platform were not within hearing gave an answer of which the frankness surprised even herself Portraits for the Academy cost a great deal you know I know But that s what I m working for There are not many men down yonder he pointed over the City have a better head for money making than I have Well prove it replied Nancy and laughed as the wind caught her breath How long will you give me She made no answer but walked to the side whence she could look westward Crewe followed close his features still set in the hungry look his eyes never moving from her warm cheek and full lips What it must be she said to have about twenty thousand a year The man of business gave a gasp In the same moment he had to clutch at his hat lest it should be blown away Twenty thousand a year he echoed Well it isn t impossible Men get beyond that and a good deal beyond it But it s a large order Of course it is But what was it you said The most beautiful girl in all London That s a large order too isn t it How much is she worth You re talking for the joke now said Crewe I don t like to hear that kind of thing either You never think in that way My thoughts are my own I may think as I choose Yes But you have thoughts above money Have I How kind of you to say so I ve had enough of this wind we ll go down She led the way and neither of them spoke till they were in the street again Nancy felt her hair Am I blown to pieces she asked No no you re all right Now will you walk through the City Where s the place you spoke of Farringdon Street That ll bring you round to Blackfriars Bridge when you want to go home But there s plenty of time yet So they rambled aimlessly by the great thoroughfares and by hidden streets of which Nancy had never heard talking or silent as the mood dictated Crewe had stories to tell of this and that thriving firm of others struggling in obscurity or falling from high estate to him the streets of London were so many chapters of romance but a romance always of to day for he neither knew nor cared about historic associations Vast sums sounded perpetually on his lips he glowed with envious delight in telling of speculations that had built up great fortunes He knew the fabulous rents that were paid for sites that looked insignificant he repeated anecdotes of calls made from Somerset House upon men of business who had been too modest in returning the statement of their income he revived legends of dire financial disaster and of catastrophe barely averted by strange expedients To all this Nancy listened with only moderate interest as often as not she failed to understand the details which should have excited her wonder None the less she received an impression of knowledge acuteness power in the speaker and this was decidedly pleasant Here s the place where I think of starting for myself said Crewe as he paused at length before a huge building in Farringdon Street This Can you afford such a rent Her companion burst into laughter I don t mean the whole building Two or three rooms that s all somewhere upstairs Nancy made a jest of her mistake An advertising agent doesn t want much space said Crewe I know a chap who s doing a pretty big business in one room not far from here Well we ve had a long walk now you must rest a bit and have a cup of tea I thought you were going to propose champagne Oh if you like They went to a restaurant in Fleet Street and sat for half an hour over the milder beverage Crewe talked of his projects his prospects and Nancy whom the afternoon had in truth fatigued a little though her mind was still excited listened without remark Well he said at length leaning towards her how long do you give me She looked away and kept silence Two years just to make a solid start to show that something worth talking about is to come I ll think about it He kept his position and gazed at her I know it isn t money that would tempt you He spoke in a very low voice though no one was within earshot Don t think I make any mistake about that But I have to show you that there s something in me I wouldn t marry any woman that thought I made love to her out of interest Nancy began to draw on her gloves and smiled just biting her lower lip Will you give me a couple of years from to day I won t bother you It s honour bright I ll think about it Nancy repeated Whilst you re away Yes whilst I m away at Teignmouth And tell me when you come back Tell you how long Yes And she rose CHAPTER four From the mouth of Exe to the mouth of Teign the coast is uninteresting Such beauty as it once possessed has been destroyed by the railway Cliffs of red sandstone drop to the narrow beach warm between the blue of sky and sea but without grandeur and robbed of their native grace by navvy hewing which for the most part makes of them a mere embankment their verdure stripped away their juttings tunnelled along their base the steel parallels of smoky traffic Dawlish and Teignmouth have in themselves no charm hotel and lodging house shamed by the soft pure light that falls about them look blankly seaward hiding what remains of farm or cottage in the older parts Ebb tide uncovers no fair stretch of sand and at flood the breakers are thwarted on a bulwark of piled stone which supports the railway or protects a promenade But inland these discontents are soon forgotten there amid tilth and pasture gentle hills and leafy hollows of rural Devon the eye rests and the mind is soothed By lanes innumerable deep between banks of fern and flower by paths along the bramble edge of scented meadows by the secret windings of copse and brake and stream worn valley a way lies upward to the long ridge of Haldon where breezes sing among the pines or sweep rustling through gorse and bracken Mile after mile of rustic loveliness ever and anon the sea limits blue beyond grassy slopes White farms dozing beneath their thatch in harvest sunshine hamlets forsaken save by women and children by dogs and cats and poultry the labourers afield Here grow the tall foxgloves bending a purple head in the heat of noon here the great bells of the convolvulus hang thick from lofty hedges massing their pink and white against dark green leafage here amid shadowed undergrowth trail the long fronds of lustrous hartstongue wherever the eye falls profusion of summer s glory Here in many a nook carpeted with softest turf canopied with tangle of leaf and bloom solitude is safe from all intrusion unless it be that of flitting bird or of some timid wild thing that rustles for a moment and is gone From dawn to midnight as from midnight to dawn one who would be alone with nature might count upon the security of these bosks and dells By Nancy Lord and her companions such pleasures were unregarded For the first few days after their arrival at Teignmouth they sat or walked on the promenade walked or sat on the pier sat or walked on the Den a long wide lawn decked about with shrubs and flower beds between sea fronting houses and the beach Nancy had no wish to exert herself for the weather was hot after her morning bathe with Jessica she found amusement enough in watching the people most of whom were here simply to look at each other or in listening to the band which played selections from Sullivan varied with dance music or in reading a novel from the book lender s that is to say gazing idly at the page and letting such significance as it possessed float upon her thoughts She was pleasantly conscious that the loungers who passed by male and female gave something of attention to her face and costume Without attempting to rival the masterpieces of fashion which invited envy or wonder from all observers she thought herself nicely dressed and had in fact as always made good use of her father s liberality Her taste in garments had a certain timidity that served her well by avoiding the extremes of mode and in virtue of her admirable figure she took the eye of those who looked for refinement rather than for extravagance The unconsidered grace of her bearing might be recognised by all whom such things concerned it by no means suggested that she came from a small house in Camberwell In her companions to be sure she was unfortunate but the over modest attire and unimpressive persons of missus Morgan and Jessica at least did her the office of relief by contrast Nancy had made this reflection she was not above it Yet her actual goodness of heart saved her from ever feeling ashamed of the Morgans It gratified her to think that she was doing them a substantial kindness but for her they would have dragged through a wretched summer in their unwholesome jimcrack house without a breath of pure air without a sight of the free heaven And to both of them that would probably have meant a grave illness missus Morgan was a thin tremulous woman with watery eyes and a singular redness about the prominent part of her face which seemed to indicate a determination of blood to the nose All her married life had been spent in a cheerless struggle to maintain the externals of gentility Not that she was vain or frivolous indeed her natural tendencies made for homeliness in everything but by birth and by marriage connected with genteel people she felt it impossible to abandon that mode of living which is supposed to distinguish the educated class from all beneath it She had brought into the world three sons and three daughters of the former two were dead and of the latter one in each case poverty of diet having proved fatal to a weak constitution For close upon thirty years the family had lived in houses of which the rent was out of all reasonable proportion to their means at present with a total income of one hundred and sixty pounds mister Morgan called himself a commission agent and seldom had anything to do they paid in rent and rates a matter of fifty five and bemoaned the fate which neighboured them with people only by courtesy to be called gentlefolk Of course they kept a servant her wages nine pounds a year Whilst the mother and elder daughter were at Teignmouth mister Morgan his son and the younger girl felt themselves justified in making up for lack of holiday by an extra supply of butcher s meat Well meaning but with as little discretion in this as in other things missus Morgan allowed scarce an hour of the day to pass without uttering her gratitude to Nancy Lord for the benefit she was enjoying To escape these oppressive thanks Nancy did her best never to be alone with the poor lady but a tete a tete was occasionally unavoidable as for instance on the third or fourth day after their arrival when missus Morgan had begged Nancy s company for a walk on the Den whilst Jessica wrote letters At the end of a tedious hour Jessica joined them and her face had an unwonted expression She beckoned her friend apart You ll be surprised Who do you think is here No one that will bore us I hope mister Tarrant I met him near the post office and he stopped me Nancy frowned Are they all here again No he says he s alone One minute mamma please excuse us He was surprised to see you said Nancy after reflecting He said so But I forgot to tell you in a letter to missus Baker I spoke of our plans She had written to me to propose a pupil for after the holidays Perhaps she didn t mention it to mister Tarrant Evidently not Nancy exclaimed with some impatience Why should you doubt his word I can t help thinking Jessica smiled archly that he has come just to meet somebody Somebody Who do you mean asked her friend with a look of sincere astonishment I may be mistaken a glance completed the suggestion Rubbish For the rest of that day the subject was unmentioned Nancy kept rather to herself and seemed meditative Next morning she was in the same mood The tide served for a bathe at eleven o clock afterwards as the girls walked briskly to and fro near the seat where missus Morgan had established herself with a volume of Browning Jessica insisted on her reading Browning though the poor mother protested that she scarcely understood a word they came full upon the unmistakable presence of mister Lionel Tarrant Miss Morgan in acknowledging his salute offered her hand it was by her that the young man had stopped Miss Lord only bent her head and that slightly Tarrant expected more but his half raised hand dropped in time and he directed his speech to Jessica He had nothing to say but what seemed natural and civil the dialogue Nancy remained mute occupied but a few minutes and Tarrant went his way sauntering landwards As missus Morgan had observed the meeting it was necessary to offer her an explanation But Jessica gave only the barest facts concerning their acquaintance and Nancy spoke as though she hardly knew him The weather was oppressively hot in doors or out little could be done but sit or lie in enervated attitudes a state of things accordant with Nancy s mood Till late at night she watched the blue starry sky from her open window seeming to reflect but in reality wafted on a stream of fancies and emotions Jessica s explanation of the arrival of Lionel Tarrant had strangely startled her no such suggestion would have occurred to her own mind Yet now she only feared that it might not be true A debilitating climate and absolute indolence favoured that impulse of lawless imagination which had first possessed her on the evening of Jubilee Day With luxurious heedlessness she cast aside every thought that might have sobered her even as she at length cast off all her garments and lay in the warm midnight naked upon her bed The physical attraction of which she had always been conscious in Tarrant s presence seemed to have grown stronger since she had dismissed him from her mind Comparing him with Luckworth Crewe she felt only a contemptuous distaste for the coarse vitality and vigour whereto she had half surrendered herself when hopeless of the more ambitious desire Rising early she went out before breakfast and found that a little rain had fallen Grass and flowers were freshened the air had an exquisite clearness and a coolness which struck delightfully on the face after the close atmosphere within doors She had paused to watch a fishing boat off shore when a cheery voice bade her good morning and Tarrant stepped to her side You are fond of this place he said Not particularly Then why do you choose it It does for a holiday as well as any other He was gazing at her and with the look which Nancy resented the look which made her feel his social superiority He seemed to observe her features with a condescending gratification Though totally ignorant of his life and habits she felt a conviction that he had often bestowed this look upon girls of a class below his own How do you like those advertisements of soaps and pills along the pier he asked carelessly I see no harm in them Perversity prompted her answer but at once she remembered Crewe and turned away in annoyance Tarrant was only the more good humoured You like the world as it is There s wisdom in that Better be in harmony with one s time advertisements and all He added Are you reading for an exam I You are confusing me with Miss Morgan Oh not for a moment I couldn t possibly confuse you with any one else I know Miss Morgan is studying professionally but I thought you were reading for your own satisfaction as so many women do now a days The distinction was flattering Nancy yielded to the charm of his voice and conversed freely It began to seem not impossible that he found some pleasure in her society Now and then he dropped a word that made her pulses flutter his eyes were constantly upon her face Don t you go off into the country sometimes he inquired when she had turned homewards We are thinking of having a drive to day And I shall most likely have a ride we may meet Nancy ordered a carriage for the afternoon and with her friends drove up the Teign valley but they did not meet Tarrant But next morning he joined them on the pier and this time Jessica had no choice but to present him to her mother Nancy felt annoyed that this should have come about Tarrant she supposed would regard poor missus Morgan with secret ridicule Yet if that were his disposition he concealed it perfectly no one could have behaved with more finished courtesy He seated himself by missus Morgan and talked with her of the simplest things in a pleasant kindly humour Yesterday so he made known he had ridden to Torquay and back returning after sunset This afternoon he was going by train to Exeter to buy some books Again he strolled about with Nancy and talked of idle things with an almost excessive amiability As the girl listened a languor crept upon her a soft and delicious subdual of the will to dreamy luxury Her eyes were fixed on the shadows cast by her own figure and that of her companion The black patches by chance touched She moved so as to part them and then changed her position so that they touched again so that they blended CHAPTER five Nancy had written to her father a short letter but affectionate begging him to let her know whether the improvement in his health of which he had spoken before she left home still continued The answer came without delay On the whole said mister Lord he was doing well enough no need whatever to trouble about him He wrote only a few lines but closed with love to you my dear child an unwonted effusiveness At the same time there came a letter from Horace You will be surprised it began at the address I write from As you know I had planned to go to Brighton but on the day before my holiday commenced I heard from F F saying that she and missus Peachey had had a quarrel and she was tired of Brighton and was coming home So I waited a day or two and then as I had half promised I went to see missus D We had a long talk and it ended in my telling her about F and all the row there s been Perhaps you will think I had better have kept it to myself but missus D and I are on first rate terms and she seems to understand me better than any one I ever met We talked about my holiday and she persuaded me to come to Scarborough where she herself was going for a week or two It s rather an expensive affair but worth the money Of course I have lodgings of my own missus D is at a big hotel where friends of hers are staying I have been introduced to two or three people great swells and I ve had lunch with missus D at the hotel twice This kind of life suits me exactly I don t think I get on badly with the swells Of course I say not a word about my position and of course nobody would think of asking questions You would like this place I rather wish you were here Of course father thinks I have come on my own hook It s very awkward having to keep a secret of this kind I must try and persuade missus D to have a talk with father But one thing I can tell you I feel pretty sure that she will get me somehow or other out of that beastly City life she s always talking of things I might do But not a word to any one about all this be sure This news caused Nancy to ponder for a long time The greater part of the morning she spent at home and in her own room after lunch she sat idly on the promenade little disposed for conversation It was the second day since Tarrant had told her that he was going to Exeter and they had not again met the Morgans had not seen him either The next morning however as all three were sitting in one of their favourite places Tarrant approached them missus Morgan who was fluttered by the natural supposition of a love affair between Miss Lord and the interesting young man made it easy for them to talk together Did you get your books Nancy asked when silence followed on trivialities Yes and spent half a day with them in a favourite retreat of mine inland It s a very beautiful spot I should like you to see it Indeed you ought to Nancy turned her eyes to the sea We might walk over there one afternoon he added missus Morgan can t walk far Why should we trouble her Are you obliged to remain under missus Morgan s wing It was said jestingly but Nancy felt piqued Certainly not I am quite independent So I should have supposed Then why not come He seemed perfectly self possessed but the voice was not quite his own To Nancy her eyes still looking straight forward it sounded as though from a distance it had an effect upon her nerves similar to that she had experienced three days ago when they were walking about the pier Her hands fell idly she leaned back more heavily on the seat a weight was on her tongue A country ramble of an hour or two pursued the voice which itself had become languorous Surely you are sometimes alone It isn t necessary to give a detailed account of your time She answered impatiently Of course not In this moment her thoughts had turned to Luckworth Crewe and she was asking herself why this invitation of Tarrant s affected her so very differently from anything she had felt when Crewe begged her to meet him in London With him she could go anywhere enjoying a genuine independence a complete self confidence thinking her unconventional behaviour merely good fun Tarrant s proposal startled her She was not mistress of the situation as when trifling with Crewe A sense of peril caused her heart to beat quickly This afternoon then the voice was murmuring She answered mechanically It s going to rain I think I think not But if so to morrow To morrow is Sunday Yes Monday then Nancy heard him smother a laugh She wished to look at him but could not It won t rain he continued still with the ease of one who speaks of everyday matters We shall see at all events Perhaps you will want to change your book at the library A novel lay on her lap We ll leave it an open possibility to meet there about three o clock Nancy pointed out to sea and asked where the steamer just passing might be bound for Her companion readily turned to this subject The rain she half hoped for it did not come By luncheon time every doubtful cloud had vanished Before sitting down to table she observed the sky at the open window Lovely weather sighed missus Morgan behind her But for you dear Nancy I should have been dreaming and wishing oh how vainly in the stifling town We ll have another drive this afternoon Nancy declared Oh how delightful But pray pray not on our account Jessica Nancy turned to her friend who had just entered the room we ll have the carriage at three And a better horse than last time I ll take good care of that Pen ink and paper she cried joyously The note shall go round at once You re a magnificent sort of person said Jessica Some day no doubt you ll keep a carriage and pair of your own Shan t I just And drive you down to Burlington House for your exams By the bye does a female Bachelor of Arts lose her degree if she gets married Nancy was sprightlier than of late Her mood maintained itself throughout the first half of the drive then she seemed to be overcome by a sudden weariness ceased to talk and gave only a listless look at things which interested her companions By when they reached home again she had a pale troubled countenance Until dinner nothing more was seen of her and after the meal she soon excused herself on the plea of a headache Again there passed two days Sunday and Monday without Tarrant s appearing missus Morgan and Jessica privately talked much of the circumstance Sentimental souls they found this topic inexhaustible Jessica having her mind thus drawn away from Burlington House benefited not a little by the mystery of her friend s position she thought however that Nancy might have practised a less severe reticence To missus Morgan it never occurred that so self reliant a young woman as Miss Lord stood in need of matronly counsel of strict chaperonage she would have deemed it an impertinence to allow herself the most innocent remark implying such a supposition On Wednesday afternoon about three o clock Nancy walked alone to the library There looking at books and photographs in the window stood Lionel Tarrant He greeted her as usual seemed not to remark the hot colour in her cheeks and stepped with her into the shop She had meant to choose a novel but with Tarrant looking on felt constrained to exhibit her capacity for severe reading The choice of grave works was not large and she found it difficult to command her thoughts even for the perusal of titles however she ultimately discovered a book that promised anything but frivolity Helmholtz s Lectures on Scientific Subjects and at this she clutched Two loudly dressed women were at the same time searching the shelves I wonder whether this is a pretty book said one to the other taking down a trio of volumes Oh it looks as if it might be pretty returned her friend examining the cover They faced to the person behind the counter Is this a pretty book one of them inquired loftily Oh yes madam that s a very pretty book very pretty Nancy exchanged a glance with her companion and smiled When they were outside again Tarrant asked Have you found a pretty book She showed the title of her choice Merciful heavens You mean to read that The girls of to day What mere man is worthy of them But I must rise to the occasion We ll have a chapter as we rest Insensibly Nancy had followed the direction he chose His words took for granted that she was going into the country with him My friends are on the pier she said abruptly stopping Where doubtless they will enjoy themselves Let me carry your book please Helmholtz is rather heavy Thanks I can carry it very well I shall turn this way No no My way this afternoon Nancy stood still looking up the street that led towards the sea She was still bright coloured her lips had a pathetic expression a child like pouting There was an understanding said Tarrant with playful firmness Not for to day No For the day when you disappointed me The day after I didn t think it worth while to come here yesterday I came but felt no surprise that I didn t meet you To day I had a sort of hope This way She followed and they walked for several minutes in silence Will you let me look at Helmholtz said the young man at length Most excellent book of course Physiological Causes of Harmony in Music Interaction of Natural Forces Conservation of Force You enjoy this kind of thing One must know something about it I suppose so I used to grind at science because everybody talked science In reality I loathed it and now I read only what I like Life s too short for intellectual make believe It is too short for anything but enjoyment Tell me what you read for pure pleasure Poetry They had left the streets and were pursuing a road bordered with gardens gardens of glowing colour sheltered amid great laurels shadowed by stately trees the air was laden with warm scents of flower and leaf On an instinct of resistance Nancy pretended that the exact sciences were her favourite study She said it in the tone of superiority which habit had made natural to her in speaking of intellectual things And Tarrant appeared to accept her declaration without scepticism but a moment after he turned the talk upon novels Thus for half an hour and more they strolled on by upward ways until Teignmouth lay beneath them and the stillness of meadows all about Presently Tarrant led from the beaten road into a lane all but overgrown with grass He began to gather flowers and offered them to Nancy Personal conversation seemed at an end they were enjoying the brilliant sky and the peaceful loveliness of earth They exchanged simple natural thoughts or idle words in which was no thought at all Before long they came to an old broken gate half open it was the entrance to a narrow cartway now unused which descended windingly between high thick hedges Ruts of a foot in depth baked hard by summer showed how miry the track must be in the season of rain This is our way said Tarrant his hand on the lichened wood Better than the pier or the promenade don t you think But we have gone far enough Nancy drew back into the lane looked at her flowers and then shaded her eyes with them to gaze upward Almost Another five minutes and you will see the place I told you of You can t imagine how beautiful it is Another day We are all but there He seemed regretfully to yield and Nancy yielded in her turn She felt a sudden shame in the thought of having perhaps betrayed timidity Without speaking she passed the gate The hedge on either side was of hazel and dwarf oak of hawthorn and blackthorn all intertwined with giant brambles and with briers which here and there met overhead High and low blackberries hung in multitudes swelling to purple ripeness Numberless the trailing and climbing plants Nancy s skirts rustled among the greenery her cheeks were touched as if with a caress by many a drooping branchlet in places Tarrant had to hold the tangle above her while she stooped to pass And from this they emerged into a small circular space where the cartway made a turn at right angles and disappeared behind thickets They were in the midst of a plantation on every side trees closed about them with a low and irregular hedge to mark the borders of the grassy road Nancy s eyes fell at once upon a cluster of magnificent foxgloves growing upon a bank which rose to the foot of an old elm beside the foxgloves lay a short hewn trunk bedded in the ground thickly overgrown with mosses lichens and small fungi Have I misled you said Tarrant watching her face with frank pleasure No indeed you haven t This is very beautiful I discovered it last year and spent hours here alone I couldn t ask you to come and see it then he added laughing It is delightful Here s your seat who knows how many years it has waited for you She sat down upon the old trunk About the roots of the elm above grew masses of fern and beneath it a rough bit of the bank was clothed with pennywort the green discs and yellowing fruity spires making an exquisite patch of colour In the shadow of bushes near at hand hartstongue abounded with fronds hanging to the length of an arm Now said Tarrant gaily you shall have some blackberries And he went to gather them returning in a few minutes with a large leaf full He saw that Nancy meanwhile had taken up the book from where he dropped it to the ground it lay open on her lap Helmholtz Away with him No I have opened at something interesting She spoke as though possession of the book were of vital importance to her Nevertheless the fruit was accepted and she drew off her gloves to eat it Tarrant seated himself on the ground near her and gradually fell into a half recumbent attitude Won t you have any Nancy asked without looking at him One or two if you will give me them She chose a fine blackberry and held it out Tarrant let it fall into his palm and murmured You have a beautiful hand When a moment after he glanced at her she seemed to be reading Helmholtz The calm of the golden afternoon could not have been more profound Birds twittered softly in the wood and if a leaf rustled it was only at the touch of wings Earth breathed its many perfumes upon the slumberous air You know said Tarrant after a long pause and speaking as though he feared to break the hush that Keats once stayed at Teignmouth Nancy did not know it but said Yes The name of Keats was familiar to her but of his life she knew hardly anything of his poetry very little Her education had been chiefly concerned with names Will you read me a paragraph of Helmholtz continued the other looking at her with a smile Any paragraph the one before you She hesitated but read at length in an unsteady voice something about the Conservation of Force It ended in a nervous laugh Now I ll read something to you said Tarrant And he began to repeat slowly musically lines of verse which his companion had never heard O what can ail thee Knight at arms Alone and palely loitering The sedge has wither d from the lake And no birds sing He went through the poem Nancy the while did not stir It was as though he murmured melody for his own pleasure rather than recited to a listener but no word was inaudible Nancy knew that his eyes rested upon her she wished to smile yet could not And when he ceased the silence held her motionless Isn t it better said Tarrant drawing slightly nearer to her Of course it is I used to know thousands of verses by heart Did you ever write any Half a dozen epics or so when I was about seventeen Yet I don t come of a poetical family My father He stopped abruptly looked into Nancy s face with a smile and said in a tone of playfulness Do you remember asking me whether I had anything to do with Nancy flushing over all her features exclaimed Don t please don t I m ashamed of myself I didn t like it But we know each other better now You were quite right That was how my grandfather made his money My father I believe got through most of it and gave no particular thought to me His mother the old lady whom you know had plenty of her own to be mine she tells me some day Do you wish to be forgiven for hurting my pride he added I don t know what made me say such a thing She faltered the words she felt her will subdued Tarrant reached a hand and took one of hers and kissed it then allowed her to draw it away Now will you give me another blackberry The girl was trembling a light shone in her eyes She offered the leaf with fruit in it Tarrant whilst choosing touched the blue veins of her wrist with his lips What are you going to do she asked presently I mean what do you aim at in life Enjoyment Why should I trouble about anything else I should be content if life were all like this to look at a beautiful face and listen to a voice that charms me and touch a hand that makes me thrill with such pleasure as I never knew It s waste of time Oh never time was spent so well Look at me again like that with the eyes half closed and the lips half mocking Oh the exquisite lips If I might if I might He did not stir from his posture of languid ease but Nancy with a quick movement drew a little away from him then rose It s time to go back she said absently No no not yet Let me look at you for a few minutes more She began to walk slowly head bent Well then to morrow or the day after The place will be just as beautiful and you even more The sea air makes you lovelier from day to day Nancy looked back for an instant Tarrant followed and in the deep leafy way he again helped her to pass the briers But their hands never touched and the silence was unbroken until they had issued into the open lane CHAPTER six The lodgings were taken for three weeks and more than half the time had now elapsed Jessica who declared herself quite well and strong again though her face did not bear out the assertion was beginning to talk of matters examinational once more Notwithstanding protests she brought forth from their hiding place sundry arid little manuals and black covered notebooks her thoughts were divided between algebraic formulae and Nancy s relations with Lionel Tarrant Perhaps because no secret was confided to her she affected more appetite for the arid little books than she really felt Nancy would neither speak of examinations nor give ear when they were talked about she whether consciously or not was making haste to graduate in quite another school On the morning after her long walk with Tarrant she woke before sunrise and before seven o clock had left the house A high wind and hurrying clouds made the weather prospects uncertain She strayed about the Den never losing sight for more than a minute or two of the sea fronting house where Tarrant lived But no familiar form approached her and she had to return to breakfast unrewarded for early rising Through the day she was restless and silent kept alone as much as possible and wore a look which as the hours went on darkened from anxiety to ill humour She went to bed much earlier than usual At eleven next morning having lingered behind her friends she found Tarrant in conversation with missus Morgan and Jessica on the pier His greeting astonished her it had precisely the gracious formality of a year ago a word or two about the weather and he resumed his talk with Miss Morgan its subject the educational value of the classics Obliged to listen Nancy suffered an anguish of resentful passion For a quarter of an hour she kept silence then saw the young man take leave and saunter away with that air which in satire she had formerly styled majestic And then passed three whole days during which Lionel was not seen The evening of the fourth between eight and nine o clock found Nancy at the door of the house which her thoughts had a thousand times visited A servant in reply to inquiry told her that mister Tarrant was in London he would probably return to morrow She walked idly away and at less than a hundred yards distance met Tarrant himself His costume showed that he had just come from the railway station Nancy would gladly have walked straight past him but the tone in which he addressed her was a new surprise and she stood in helpless confusion He had been to London called away on sudden business I thought of writing nay I did write but after all didn t post the letter For a very simple reason I couldn t remember your address And he laughed so naturally that the captive walked on by his side unresisting Their conversation lasted only a few minutes then Nancy resolutely bade him good night no appointment made for the morrow A day of showers then a day of excessive heat They saw each other several times but nothing of moment passed The morning after they met before breakfast To morrow is our last day said Nancy Yes missus Morgan told me Nancy herself had never spoken of departure This afternoon we ll go up the hill again I don t think I shall care to walk so far Look at the mist it s going to be dreadfully hot again Tarrant was in a mood of careless gaiety his companion appeared to struggle against listlessness and her cheek had lost its wonted colour You have tea at four or five I suppose Let us go after that when the heat of the day is over To this after various objections Nancy consented Through the hours of glaring sunshine she stayed at home lying inert by an open window Over the tea cups she was amiable but dreamy When ready to go out she just looked into the sitting room where Jessica bent over books and said cheerfully I may be a little late for dinner On no account wait I forbid it And so without listening to the answer she hurried away In the upward climbing lanes no breeze yet tempered the still air the sky of misted sapphire showed not a cloud from verge to verge Tarrant as if to make up for his companion s silence talked ceaselessly and always in light vein Sunshine he said was indispensable to his life he never passed the winter in London if he were the poorest of mortals he would at all events beg his bread in a sunny clime Are you going to the Bahamas this winter Nancy asked mentioning the matter for the first time since she heard of it at Champion Hill I don t know Everything is uncertain And he put the question aside as if it were of no importance They passed the old gate and breathed with relief in the never broken shadow of tangled foliage Whilst pushing a bramble aside Tarrant let his free arm fall lightly on Nancy s waist At once she sprang forward but without appearing to notice what had happened Stay did you ever see such ivy as this It was a mass of large lustrous leaves concealing a rotten trunk Whilst Nancy looked on Tarrant pulled at a long stem and tried to break it away I must cut it Why You shall see He wove three stems into a wreath There now take off your hat and let me crown you Have I made it too large for the little head Nancy after a moment s reluctance unfastened her hat and stood bareheaded blushing and laughing You do your hair in the right way the Greek way A diadem on the top the only way when the hair and the head are beautiful It leaves the outline free the exquisite curve that unites neck and head Now the ivy wreath and how will you look She wore a dress of thin creamy material which whilst seeming to cumber her as little as garments could yet fitted closely enough to declare the healthy beauty of her form The dark green garland for which she bent a little became her admirably I pictured it in my letter said Tarrant the letter you never got Where is it Oh I burnt it Tell me what was in it All sorts of things a long letter I think that s all nonsense about forgetting my address Mere truth In fact I never knew it Be so good as to tell me she spoke as she walked on before him what you meant by your behaviour that morning before you went to London But how did I behave Very strangely Tarrant affected not to understand but when she again turned Nancy saw a mischievous smile on his face A bit of nonsense Shall I tell you He stepped near and suddenly caught both her hands one of them was trailing her sunshade Forgive me in advance will you I don t know about that And she tried though faintly to get free But I will make you now refuse His lips had just touched hers just touched and no more Rosy red she trembled before him with drooping eyelids It meant nothing at all really he pursued his voice at its softest A sham trial to see whether I was hopelessly conquered or not Of course I was Nancy shook her head You dare to doubt it I understand now what the old poet meant when he talked of bees seeking honey on his lady s lips That fancy isn t so artificial as it seemed That s all very pretty she spoke between quick breaths and tried to laugh but you have thrown my hat on the ground Give it me and take the ivy for yourself I am no Bacchus He tossed the wreath aside Take the hat I like you in it just as well You shall have a girdle of woodbine instead I don t believe your explanation said Nancy Not believe me With feigned indignation he moved to capture her again but Nancy escaped Her hat in her hand she darted forward A minute s run brought her into the open space and there with an exclamation of surprise she stopped Tarrant but a step or two behind her saw at almost the same moment the spectacle which had arrested her flight Before them stood two little donkeys munching eagerly at a crop of rosy headed thistles They the human beings looked at each other Tarrant burst into extravagant laughter and Nancy joined him Neither s mirth was spontaneous Nancy s had a note of nervous tension a ring of something like recklessness Where can they come from she asked They must have strayed a long way I haven t seen any farm or cottage But perhaps some one is with them Wait I ll go on a little and see if some boy is hanging about He turned the sharp corner and disappeared For two or three minutes Nancy stood alone watching the patient little grey beasts whose pendent ears with many a turn and twitch expressed their joy in the feast of thistles She watched them in seeming only her eyes beheld nothing A voice sounded from behind her Nancy Startled she saw Tarrant standing high up in a gap of the hedge on the bank which bordered the wood How did you get there Went round He showed the direction with his hand I can see no one but somebody may come It s wonderful here among the trees Come over How can I We will drive the donkeys away No it s much better here a wild wood full of wonderful things The bank isn t too steep Give me your hand and you can step up easily just at this place She drew near Your sunshade first Oh it s too much trouble she said languidly all but plaintively I d rather be here Obey Your sunshade She gave it Now your hand He was kneeling on the top of the bank With very little exertion Nancy found herself beside him Then he at once leapt down among the brushwood a descent of some three feet We shall be trespassing said Nancy What do I care Now jump As if you could catch me Again she uttered her nervous laugh I am heavy Obey Jump he cried impatiently his eyes afire She knelt seated herself dropped forward Tarrant caught her in his arms You heavy a feather weight Why I can carry you I could run with you And he did carry her through the brushwood away into the shadow of the trees At dinner time missus Morgan and her daughter were alone They agreed to wait a quarter of an hour and sat silent pretending each to be engaged with a book At length their eyes met What does it mean Jessica asked the mother timidly I m sure I don t know It doesn t concern us She didn t mean to be back by what she said But isn t it rather Oh Nancy is all right I suppose she ll have something to tell you to night or to morrow We must have dinner I m hungry So am I dear Oh I m quite afraid to think of the appetites we re taking back Poor Milly will be terrified Eight o clock nine o clock The two conversed in subdued voices missus Morgan was anxious all but distressed Half past nine What can it mean Jessica I can t help feeling a responsibility After all Nancy is quite a young girl and I ve sometimes thought she might be steadier Hush That was a knock They waited In a minute or two the door was opened a few inches and a voice called Jessica She responded Nancy was standing in the gloom Come into my room she said curtly Arrived there she did not strike a light She closed the door and took hold of her friend s arm We can t go back the day after to morrow Jessica We must wait a day longer till the afternoon of Friday Why What s the matter Nancy Nothing serious Don t be frightened I m tired and I shall go to bed But why must we wait Listen will you promise me faithfully as friend to friend faith fully not to tell the reason even to your mother I will faithfully Then it s this On Friday morning I shall be married to mister Tarrant Gracious I may tell you more before then but perhaps not We shall be married by licence and it needs one day between getting the licence and the marriage You may tell your mother if you like that I want to stay longer on his account I don t care of course she suspects something But not a syllable to hint at the truth I have been your best friend for a long time and I trust you She spoke in a passionate whisper and Jessica felt her trembling You needn t have the least fear of me dear I believe it Kiss me and good night Part III Into Bontage CHAPTER one During his daughter s absence Stephen Lord led a miserable life The wasting disease had firm hold upon him day by day it consumed his flesh darkened his mind The more need he had of nursing and restraint the less could he tolerate interference with his habits invasion of his gloomy solitude The doctor s visits availed nothing he listened to advice or seemed to listen but with a smile of obstinate suspicion on his furrowed face which conveyed too plain a meaning to the adviser On one point Mary had prevailed with him After some days resistance he allowed her to transform the cabin like arrangements of his room and give it the appearance of a comfortable bed chamber But he would not take to his bed and the suggestion of professional nursing excited his wrath Do you write to Nancy he asked one morning of his faithful attendant with scowling suspicion No You are telling me the truth I never write to any one Understand plainly that I won t have a word said to her about me This was when Horace had gone away to Scarborough believing on his father s assurance that there was no ground whatever for anxiety Sometimes mister Lord sat hour after hour in an unchanging position his dull eyes scarcely moving from one point At others he paced his room or wandered about the house or made an attempt at gardening which soon ended in pain and exhaustion Towards night he became feverish his hollow cheeks glowing with an ominous tint In the morning he occasionally prepared himself as if to start for his place of business he left the house and walked for perhaps a couple of hundred yards then slackened his pace stopped looked about him in an agony of indecision and at length returned After this futile endeavour he had recourse to the bottles in his cupboard and presently fell into a troubled sleep At the end of the second week early one evening three persons came to him by appointment his partner Samuel Barmby mister Barmby senior and a well dressed gentleman whom Mary she opened the door to them had never seen before They sat together in the drawing room for more than an hour then the well dressed gentleman took his leave the others remaining for some time longer The promoted servant at mister Lord s bidding had made a change in her dress during the latter part of the day she presented the appearance of a gentlewoman and sat generally with needlework sometimes with a book alone in the dining room On a Sunday whilst Nancy and her brother were away the Barmby family father son and two daughters came to take tea and spend the evening Mary doing the honours of the house she bore herself without awkwardness talked simply and altogether justified mister Lord s opinion of her When the guests were gone Stephen made no remark but in saying good night to her smiled for an instant the first smile seen upon his face for many days Mary remained ignorant of the disease from which he was suffering in the matter of his diet she consulted and obeyed him though often enough it seemed to her that his choice suited little with the state of an invalid He ate at irregular times and frequently like a starving man Mary suspected that on the occasions when he went out for half an hour after dark he brought back food with him she had seen him enter with something concealed beneath his coat All his doings were to her a subject of ceaseless anxiety of a profound distress which in his presence she was obliged to conceal If she regarded him sadly the sufferer grew petulant or irate He would not endure a question concerning his health On the day which was understood to be Nancy s last at Teignmouth he brightened a little and talked with pleasure as it seemed of her return on the morrow Horace had written that he would be home this evening but mister Lord spoke only of his daughter At about six o clock he was sitting in the garden and Mary brought him a letter just delivered he looked at the envelope with a smile To tell us the train she s coming by no doubt Mary waited When mister Lord had read the brief note his face darkened first with disappointment then with anger Here look at it he said harshly What else was to be expected Dearest Father wrote Nancy I am sorry that our return must be put off we hope to get back on Friday evening Of course this will make no difference to you With best love dear father and hoping I shall find you much better What does she mean by behaving in this way resumed the angry voice before Mary had read to the end What does she mean by it Who gave her leave to stay longer Not a word of explanation How does she know it will make no difference to me What does she mean by it The fine weather has tempted them replied Mary I daresay they want to go somewhere What right has she to make the change at a moment s notice vociferated the father his voice suddenly recovering its old power his cheeks and neck suffused with red wrath And hopes she will find me better What does she care whether she finds me alive or dead Oh don t say that You wouldn t let her know that you were worse What does it mean I hate this deceitful behaviour She knew before of course she knew and she left it to the last moment so that I couldn t write and prevent her from staying As if I should have wished to As if I cared a brass farthing how long she stays or for that matter whether I ever see her again He checked the course of his furious speech and stood staring at the letter What did you say He spoke now in a hoarse undertone You thought they were going somewhere Last year there used to be steamers that went to places on certain days Nonsense She wouldn t alter all their plans for that It s something I am not to know of course it is She s deceitful like all women He met Mary s eye suddenly turned upon him His own fell before it and without speaking again he went into the house In half an hour s time his bell rang and not Mary but the young servant responded According to her directions she knocked at the door and without opening it asked her master s pleasure mister Lord said that he was going out and would not require a meal till late in the evening It was nearly ten o clock when he returned Mary sitting in the front room rose at his entrance I want nothing he said I ve been to the Barmbys Voice and movements proved how the effort had taxed him In sitting down he trembled fever was in his eyes and pain in every line of his countenance Mary handed him a letter it came from Horace and was an intimation that the young gentleman would not return to night but to morrow When mister Lord had read it he jerked a contemptuous laugh and threw the sheet of note paper across the table There you are Not much to choose between daughter and son He s due at business in the morning but what does that matter It doesn t suit his lordship to keep time He laughed again his emphasis on lordship showing that he consciously played with the family name But I was a fool to be angry Let them come when they will For a few minutes he lay back in the chair gazing at vacancy Has the girl gone to bed I ll tell her she can go Mary soon returned and took up the book with which she had been engaged In a low voice and as if speaking without much thought Stephen asked her what she was reading It was a volume of an old magazine bought by mister Lord many years ago Yes yes Nancy laughs at it calls it old rubbish These young people are so clever His companion made no remark Unobserved he scrutinised her face for a long time and said at length Don t let us fall out Mary You re not pleased with me and I know why I said all women were deceitful and you took it too seriously You ought to know me better There s something comes on me every now and then and makes me say the worst I can no matter who it hurts Could I be such a fool as to think ill of you It did hurt me replied the other still bent over her book But it was only the sound of it I knew you said more than you meant I m a fool and I ve been a fool all my life Is it likely I should have wise children When I went off to the Barmbys I thought of sending Samuel down to Teignmouth to find out what they were at But I altered my mind before I got there What good would it have done All I can do I ve done already I made my will the other day it s signed and witnessed I ve made it as I told you I should I m not much longer for this world but I ve saved the girl from foolishness till she s six and twenty After that she must take care of herself They sat silent whilst the clock on the mantelpiece ticked away a few more minutes mister Lord s features betrayed the working of turbid thought a stern resentment their prevailing expression When reverie released him he again looked at his companion Mary did you ever ask yourself what sort of woman Nancy s mother may have been The listener started like one in whom a secret has been surprised She tried to answer but after all did not speak I ll tell you Stephen pursued Yes I ll tell you You must know it Not a year after the boy s birth she left me And I made myself free of her I divorced her Their eyes just met You needn t think that it cost me any suffering Not on her account not because I had lost my wife I never felt so glad before or since as on the day when it was all over and I found myself a free man again I suffered only in thinking how I had fooled away some of the best years of my life for a woman who despised me from the first and was as heartless as the stones of the street I found her in beggary or close upon it I made myself her slave it s only the worthless women who accept from a man who expect from him such slavish worship as she had from me I gave her clothing she scarcely thanked me but I thought myself happy I gave her a comfortable home such as she hadn t known for years for a reward she mocked at my plain tastes and quiet ways but I thought no ill of it could see nothing in it but a girlish lighthearted sort of way that seemed one of her merits As long as we lived together she pretended to be an affectionate wife I should think no one ever matched her in hypocrisy But the first chance she had husband children home all flung aside in a moment Then I saw her in the true light and understood all at once what a blind fool I had been He breathed quickly and painfully Mary sat without a movement I thought I had done a great thing in marrying a wife that was born above me Her father had been a country gentleman horse racing and such things had brought him down and from her twelfth year his daughter lived I never quite knew how but on charity of some kind She grew up without trying to earn her own living she thought herself too good for that thought she had a claim to be supported because as a child she was waited upon by servants When I asked her once if she couldn t have done something she stared at me and laughed in my face For all that she was glad enough to marry a man of my sort rough and uneducated as I was She always reminded me of it though that I had no education I believe she thought that she had a perfect right to throw over such a husband whenever she chose Afterwards I saw very well that her education didn t amount to much How could it when she learnt nothing after she was twelve She was living with very poor people who came from my part of the country that s how I met her The father led some sort of blackguard life in London but had no money for her nor yet for his other girl who went into service I was told and perhaps made herself a useful honest woman He died in a hospital and he was buried at my expense not three months before his daughter went off and left me You will never tell your children said Mary when there had been a long pause I ve often thought it would only be right if I told them I ve often thought the last year or two that Nancy ought to know It might make her think and do her good No no returned the other hurriedly Never let her know of it never It might do her much harm You know now Mary why I look at the girl so anxiously She s not like her mother not much like her in face and I can t think she s like her in heart But you know what her faults are as well as I do Whether I ve been right or wrong in giving her a good education I shall never know Wrong I fear but I ve told you all about that You don t know whether she s alive or not asked Mary when once more it was left to her to break silence What do I care How should I know Don t be tempted to tell them either of them said the other earnestly My friend Barmby knows Whether he s told his son I can t say it s twenty years since we spoke about it If he did ever mention it to Samuel then it might somehow get known to Horace or the girl when I m gone I won t give up the hope that young Barmby may be her husband She ll have time to think about it But if ever she should come to you and ask questions I mean if she s been told what happened you ll set me right in her eyes You ll tell her what I ve told you I hope it may never So do I Stephen interrupted his voice husky with fatigue But I count on you to make my girl think rightly of me if ever there s occasion I count on you When I m dead I won t have her think that I was to blame for her mother s ill doing That s why I ve told you You believe me don t you And Mary lifting her eyes met his look of appeal with more than a friend s confidence CHAPTER two From chambers in Staple Inn Lionel Tarrant looked forth upon the laborious world with a dainty enjoyment of his own limitless leisure The old gables fronting upon Holborn pleased his fancy he liked to pass under the time worn archway and so at a step estrange himself from commercial tumult to be in the midst of modern life yet breathe an atmosphere of ancient repose He belonged to an informal club of young men who called themselves facetiously the Hodiernals Vixi hodie The motto suggested by some one or other after a fifth tumbler of whisky punch might bear more than a single interpretation Harvey Munden the one member of this genial brotherhood who lived by the sweat of his brow proposed as a more suitable title Les Faineants that however was judged pedantic not to say offensive For these sons of the Day would not confess to indolence each deemed himself after his own fashion a pioneer in art letters civilisation They had money of their own or were supported by some one who could afford that privilege most of them had ostensibly some profession in view for the present they contented themselves with living and the weaker brethren read in their hodiernity an obligation to be up to date Tarrant professed himself critical of To day apprehensive of To morrow he cast a backward eye None the less his avowed principle was to savour the passing hour When night grew mellow and the god of whisky inspired his soul he shone in a lyrical egoism which had but slight correspondence with the sincerities of his solitude His view of woman the Hodiernals talked much of woman differed considerably from his thoughts of the individual women with whom he associated protesting oriental sympathies he nourished in truth the chivalry appropriate to his years and to his education and imaged an ideal of female excellence whereof the prime features were moral and intellectual He had no money of his own What could be saved for him from his father s squandered estate the will established him sole inheritor went in the costs of a liberal education his grandmother giving him assurance that he should not go forth into the world penniless This promise missus Tarrant had kept though not exactly in the manner her grandson desired Instead of making him a fixed allowance the old lady supplied him with funds at uncertain intervals with the unpleasant result that it was sometimes necessary for him to call to her mind his dependent condition The cheques he received varied greatly in amount from handsome remittances of a hundred pounds or so down to minim gifts which made the young man feel uncomfortable when he received them Still he was provided for and it could not be long before this dependency came to an end He believed in his own abilities Should it ever be needful he could turn to journalism for which undoubtedly he had some aptitude But why do anything at all in the sense of working for money Every year he felt less disposed for that kind of exertion and had a greater relish of his leisurely life missus Tarrant never rebuked him indeed she had long since ceased to make inquiry about his professional views Perhaps she felt it something of a dignity to have a grandson who lived as gentleman at large But now in the latter days of August the gentleman found himself in one most important particular at large no longer On returning from Teignmouth to Staple Inn he entered his rooms with a confused disagreeable sense that things were not as they had been that his freedom had suffered a violation that he could not sit down among his books with the old self centred ease that his prospects were completely indescribably changed perchance much for the worse In brief Tarrant had gone forth a bachelor and came back a married man Could it be sober fact Had he in very deed committed so gross an absurdity He had purposed no such thing Miss Nancy Lord was not by any means the kind of person that entered his thoughts when they turned to marriage He regarded her as in every respect his inferior She belonged to the social rank only just above that of wage earners her father had a small business in Camberwell she dressed and talked rather above her station but so now a days did every daughter of petty tradesfolk From the first he had amused himself with her affectation of intellectual superiority Miss Lord represented a type to study her as a sample of the pretentious half educated class was interesting this sort of girl was turned out in thousands every year from so called High Schools if they managed to pass some examination or other their conceit grew boundless Craftily he had tested her knowledge it seemed all sham She would marry some hapless clerk and bring him to bankruptcy by the exigencies of her refinement So had he thought of Nancy till a few months ago But in the spring time when his emotions blossomed with the blossoming year he met the girl after a long interval and saw her with changed eyes She had something more than prettiness her looks undeniably improved It seemed too that she bore herself more gracefully and even talked with at times an approximation to the speech of a lady These admissions signified much in a man of Tarrant s social prejudice so strong that it exercised an appreciable effect upon his every day morals He began to muse about Miss Lord and the upshot of his musing was that having learnt of her departure for Teignmouth he idly betook himself in the same direction But as for marriage he would as soon have contemplated taking to wife a barmaid Between Miss Lord and the young lady who dispenses refreshment there were distinctions doubtless but none of the first importance Then arose the question in what spirit with what purpose did he seek her intimacy The answer he simply postponed And postponed it very late indeed Until the choice was no longer between making love in idleness and conscientiously holding aloof but between acting like a frank blackguard and making the amends of an honest man The girl s fault to be sure He had not credited himself with this power of fascination and certainly not with the violence of passion which recklessly pursues indulgence Still the girl s fault she had behaved well as a half educated girl of her class might be expected to behave Ignorance she could not plead that were preposterous Utter subjugation by first love that perhaps she affirmed it and possibly with truth a flattering assumption at all events But all said and done the issue had been of her own seeking Why then accuse himself of blackguardly conduct if he had turned a deaf ear to her pleading Not one word of marriage had previously escaped his lips nor anything that could imply a promise Well there was the awkward and unaccountable fact that he felt himself obliged to marry her that when he seemed to be preparing resistance downright shame rendered it impossible Her face her face when she looked at him and spoke The truth was that he had not hesitated at all there was but one course open to him He gave glances in the other direction he wished to escape he reviled himself for his folly he saw the difficulties and discontents that lay before him but choice he had none Love in that sense of the word which Tarrant respected could not be said to influence him He had uttered the word yes of course he had uttered it as a man will who is goaded by his raging blood But he was as far as ever from loving Nancy Lord Her beauty and a certain growing charm in her companionship had lured him on his habitual idleness and the vagueness of his principles made him guilty at last of what a moralist would call very deliberate rascality He himself was inclined to see his behaviour in that light yet why had Nancy so smoothed the path of temptation That her love was love indeed he might take for granted To a certain point it excused her But she seemed so thoroughly able to protect herself the time of her green girlhood had so long gone by For explanation he must fall back again on the circumstances of her origin and training Perhaps she illustrated a social peril the outcome of modern follies Yes that was how he would look at it A result of charlatan education operating upon crude character Who could say what the girl had been reading what cheap philosophies had unsettled her mind Is not a little knowledge a dangerous thing Thus far had he progressed in the four and twenty hours which followed his or Nancy s conquest Meanwhile he had visited the office of the registrar had made his application for a marriage licence a proceeding which did not tend to soothe him Later when he saw Nancy again he experienced a revival of that humaner mood which accompanied his pledge to marry her the mood of regret but also of tenderness of compassion A tenderness that did not go very deep a half slighting compassion His character and the features of the case at present allowed no more but he preferred the kindlier attitude Of course he preferred it Was he not essentially good natured Would he not at any ordinary season go out of his way to do a kindness Did not his soul revolt against every form of injustice Whom had he ever injured For his humanity no less than for his urbanity he claimed a noteworthy distinction among young men of the time And there lay the pity of it But for Nancy s self abandonment he might have come to love her in good earnest As it was the growth of their intimacy had been marked with singular unanticipated impulses on his side impulses quite inconsistent with heartless scheming In the compunctious visitings which interrupted his love making at least twice there was more than a revolt of mere honesty as he recognised during his brief flight to London Had she exercised but the common prudence of womanhood Why that she did not might tell both for and against her Granting that she lacked true dignity native refinement might it not have been expected that artfulness would supply their place Artful fencing would have stamped her of coarse nature But coarseness she had never betrayed he had never judged her worse than intellectually shallow Her self surrender might then indicate a trait worthy of admiration Her subsequent behaviour undeniably pleaded for respect She acquainted him with the circumstances of her home life very modestly perhaps pathetically He learnt that her father was not ill to do heard of her domestic and social troubles that her mother had been long dead things weighing in her favour to be sure If only she had loved him less It was all over he was married In acting honourably it seemed probable that he had spoilt his life He must be prepared for anything Nancy said that she should not could not tell her father yet awhile but that resolution was of doubtful stability For his own part he thought it clearly advisable that the fact should not become known at Champion Hill but could he believe Nancy s assurance that Miss Morgan remained in the dark Upon one catastrophe others might naturally follow Here Saturday at noon came a letter of Nancy s writing A long letter and by no means a bad one superior in fact to anything he thought she could have written It moved him somewhat but would have moved him more had he not been legally bound to the writer On Sunday she could not come to see him but on Monday early in the afternoon Well there were consolations A wise man makes the best of the inevitable CHAPTER three Since his return he had seen no one and none of his friends knew where he had been A call from some stray Hodiernal would be very unseasonable this Monday afternoon but probably they were all enjoying their elegant leisure in regions remote from town As the hour of Nancy s arrival drew near he sat trying to compose himself with indifferent success At one moment his thoughts found utterance and he murmured in a strange bewildered tone My wife Astonishing words He laughed at their effect upon him but unmirthfully And his next murmur was The devil A mere ejaculation betokening his state of mind He reached several times for his pipe and remembered when he had touched it that the lips with which he greeted Nancy ought not to be redolent of tobacco In outward respect at all events he would not fall short Just when his nervousness was becoming intolerable there sounded a knock The knock he had anticipated timid brief He stepped hastily from the room and opened Nancy hardly looked at him and neither of them spoke till the closing of two doors had assured their privacy Well you had no difficulty in finding the place No none at all They stood apart and spoke with constraint Nancy s bosom heaved as though she had been hastening overmuch her face was deeply coloured her eyes had an unwonted appearance resembling those of a night watcher at weary dawn She cast quick glances about the room but with the diffidence of an intruder Her attitude was marked by the same characteristic she seemed to shrink to be ashamed Come and sit down said Tarrant cheerfully as he wheeled a chair She obeyed him and he stooping beside her offered his lips Nancy kissed him closing her eyes for the moment then dropping them again It seems a long time Nancy doesn t it Yes a very long time You couldn t come on Sunday I found my father very ill I didn t like to leave home till to day Your father ill You said nothing of it in your letter No I didn t like to with the other things A singular delicacy this Tarrant understood it and looked at her thoughtfully Again she was examining the room with hurried glance upon him her eyes did not turn He asked questions about mister Lord Nancy could not explain the nature of his illness he had spoken of gout but she feared it must be something worse the change in him since she went away was incredible and most alarming This she said in short quick sentences her voice low Tarrant thought to himself that in her too a very short time had made a very notable change he tried to read its significance but could reach no certainty I m sorry to hear all this very sorry You must tell me more about your father Take off your hat dear and your gloves Her gloves she removed first and laid them on her lap Tarrant took them away Then her hat this too he placed on the table Having done so he softly touched the plaits of her hair And for the first time Nancy looked up at him Are you glad to see me she asked in a voice that seemed subdued by doubt of the answer I am very glad His hand fell to her shoulder With a quick movement a stifled exclamation the girl rose and flung her arms about him Are you really glad Do you really love me Never doubt it dear girl Ah but I can t help I have hardly slept at night in trying to get rid of the doubt When you opened the door I felt you didn t welcome me Don t you think of me as a burden I can t help wondering why I am here He took hold of her left hand and looked at it then said playfully Of course you wonder What business has a wife to come and see her husband without the ring on her finger Nancy turned from him opened the front of her dress unknotted a string of silk and showed her finger bright with the golden circlet That s how I must wear it except when I am with you I keep touching to make sure it s there Tarrant kissed her fingers Dear she had her face against him make me certain that you love me Speak to me like you did before Oh I never knew in my life what it was to feel ashamed Ashamed Because you are married Nancy Am I really married That seems impossible It s like having dreamt that I was married to you I can hardly remember a thing that happened The registry at Teignmouth remembers he answered with a laugh Those books have a long memory She raised her eyes But wouldn t you undo it if you could No no I don t mean that Only that if it had never happened if we had said good bye before those last days wouldn t you have been glad now Why that s a difficult question to answer he returned gently It all depends on your own feeling For whatever reason these words so overcame Nancy that she burst into tears Tarrant at once more lover like soothed and fondled her and drew her to sit on his knee You re not like your old self dear girl Of course I can understand it And your father s illness But you mustn t think of it in this way I do love you Nancy I couldn t unsay a word I said to you I don t wish anything undone Make me believe that I think I should be quite happy then It s the hateful thought that perhaps you never wanted me for your wife it will come again and again and it makes me feel as if I would rather have died Send such thoughts packing Tell them your husband wants all your heart and mind for himself But will you never think ill of me She whispered the words close clinging I should be a contemptible sort of brute No I ought to have If we had spoken of our love to each other and waited A very proper twelvemonth s engagement meetings at five o clock tea fifty thousand love letters and all that kind of thing Oh we chose a better way Our wedding was among the leaves and flowers You remember the glow of evening sunlight between the red pine and the silver birch I hope that place may remain as it is all our lives we will go there Never Never ask me to go there I want to forget I hope some day I may forget If you hope so then I will hope the same And you love me with real husband s love love that will last Why should I answer all the questions He took her face between his hands What if the wife s love should fail first You can say that lightly because you know What do I know You know that I am all love of you As long as I am myself I must love you It was because I had no will of my own left because I lived only in the thought of you day and night Their lips met in a long silence I mustn t stay past four o clock were Nancy s next words I don t like to be away long from the house Father won t ask me anything but he knows I m away somewhere and I m afraid it makes him angry with me She examined the room How comfortable you are here what a delightful old place to live in Will you look at the other rooms Not to day when I come again I must say good bye very soon oh see how the time goes What a large library you have You must let me look at all the books when I have time Let you They are yours as much as mine Her face brightened I should like to live here how I should enjoy it after that hateful Grove Lane Shall I live here with you some day There wouldn t be room for two Why your dresses would fill the whole place She went and stood before the shelves But how dusty you are Who cleans for you No one A very rickety old woman draws a certain number of shillings each week on pretence of cleaning What a shame She neglects you disgracefully You shall go away some afternoon and leave me here with a great pile of dusters You can do that kind of thing It never occurred to me to ask you are you a domestic person She answered with something of the old confident air That was an oversight wasn t it After all how little you know about me Do you know much more of me Her countenance fell You are going to tell me everything How long have you lived here Two years and a half And your friends come to see you here Of course they do I meant have you many friends Friends no A good many acquaintances Men like yourself Mostly men fellows who talk about art and literature And women Nancy faltered half turning away Oh magnificent creatures Greek scholars mathematicians all that is most advanced That s the right answer to a silly question said Nancy humbly Whereat Tarrant fixed his gaze upon her I begin to think that He checked himself awkwardly Nancy insisted on the completion of his thought That of all the women I know you have the most sense I had rather hear you say that than have a great fortune She blushed with joy Perhaps you will love me some day as I wish to be loved How I ll tell you another time If it weren t for my father s illness I think I could go home feeling almost happy But how am I to know what you are doing What do you wish me to do Just tell me how you live What shall you do now when I m gone Sit disconsolate he came nearer thinking you were just a little unkind No don t say that Nancy was flurried I have told you the real reason Our housekeeper says that father was disappointed and angry because I put off my return from Teignmouth He spoke to me very coldly and I have hardly seen him since He won t let me wait upon him and I have thought since I know how ill he really is that I must seem heartless I will come for longer next time To make amends for the reproach he had uttered in spite of himself Tarrant began to relate in full the events of his ordinary day I get my own breakfast the only meal I have at home Look here s the kitchen queer old place And here s the dining room Cupboards everywhere you see we boast of our cupboards The green paint is de rigueur duck s egg colour I ve got to like it That door leads into the bedroom Well after breakfast about eleven o clock that s to say I light up look at my pipe rack and read newspapers Then if it s fine I walk about the streets and see what new follies men are perpetrating And then He told of his favourite restaurants of his unfashionable club of a few houses where at long intervals he called or dined of the Hodiernals of a dozen other small matters What a life sighed the listener compared with mine We ll remedy that some day When she asked absently Wait just a little You don t wish to tell your father I daren t tell him I doubt whether I shall ever dare to tell him face to face Don t think about it Leave it to me I must have letters from you but how Perhaps if you could promise always to send them for the first post I generally go to the letter box and I could do so always whilst father is ill This was agreed upon Nancy whilst they were talking took her hat from the table at the same moment Tarrant s hand moved towards it Their eyes met and the hand that would have checked her was drawn back Quickly secretly she drew the ring from her finger hid it somewhere and took her gloves Did you come by the back way Tarrant asked when he had bitten his lips for a sulky minute Yes as you told me He said he would walk with her into Chancery Lane there could be no risk in it You shall go out first Any one passing will suppose you had business with the solicitor underneath I ll overtake you at Southampton Buildings Impatient to be gone she lingered minute after minute and broke hurriedly from his restraining arms at last The second outer door which Tarrant had closed on her entrance surprised her by its prison like massiveness In the wooden staircase she stopped timidly but at the exit her eyes turned to an inscription above which she had just glanced at when arriving Surrexit e flammis and a date Nancy had no Latin but guessed an interpretation from the last word Through the little court with its leafy plane trees and white worn cobble stones she walked with bent head hearing the roar of Holborn through the front archway and breathing more freely when she gained the quiet garden at the back of the Inn Tarrant s step sounded behind her Looking up she asked the meaning of the inscription she had seen You don t know Latin Well why should you Surrexit e flammis It rose again from the flames I thought it might be something like that You will be patient with my ignorance A strange word upon Nancy s lips No mortal ere this had heard her confess to ignorance But you know the modern languages said Tarrant smiling Yes That is a little French and German a very little German Tarrant mused seemingly with no dissatisfaction CHAPTER four In her brother s looks and speech Nancy detected something mysterious Undoubtedly he was keeping a secret from her and there could be just as little doubt that he would not keep it long Whenever she questioned him about the holiday at Scarborough he put on a smile unlike any she had ever seen on his face so profoundly thoughtful was it so loftily reserved On the subject of missus Damerel he did not choose to be very communicative Nancy gathered little more than she had learnt from his letter But very plainly the young man held himself in higher esteem than hitherto very plainly he had learnt to think of the office as a burden or degradation from which he would soon escape Prompted by her own tormenting conscience his sister wondered whether Fanny French had anything to do with the mystery but this seemed improbable She mentioned Fanny s name one evening Do you see much of her Not much was the dreamy reply When are you going to call Oh not at present said Nancy You ve altered again then She vouchsafed no answer There s something I think I ought to tell you said Horace speaking as though he were the elder and felt a responsibility People have been talking about you and mister Crewe What She flashed into excessive anger Who has been talking The people over there Of course I know it s all nonsense At least he raised his eyebrows I suppose it is I should suppose so said Nancy with vehement scorn Their father s illness imposed a restraint upon trifling conversation Mary Woodruff now attending upon mister Lord under the doctor s directions had held grave talk with Nancy The Barmbys father and son called frequently and went away with gloomy faces Nancy and her brother were summoned separately to the invalid s room at uncertain times but neither was allowed to perform any service for him their sympathy more often than not excited irritation the sufferer always seemed desirous of saying more than the few and insignificant words which actually passed his lips and generally after a long silence he gave the young people an abrupt dismissal With his daughter he spoke at length in language which awed her by its solemnity Nancy could only understand him as meaning that his end drew near He had been reviewing he said the course of her life and trying to forecast her future I give you no more advice it would only be repeating what I have said hundreds of times All I can do for your good I have done You will understand me better if you live a few more years and I think in the end you will be grateful to me Nancy sitting by the bedside laid a hand upon her father s and sobbed She entreated him to believe that even now she understood how wisely he had guided her Tried to Nancy tried to my dear Guidance isn t for young people now a days Don t let us shirk the truth I have never been satisfied with you but I have loved you And I you dear father I have I have I know better now how good your advice was I wish far far more sincerely than you think that I had kept more control upon myself thought less of myself in every way Whilst she spoke through her tears the yellow wrinkled face upon the pillow with its sunken eyes and wasted lips kept sternly motionless If you won t mock at me Stephen pursued I will show you an example you would do well to imitate It is our old servant now my kindest truest friend If I could hope that you will let her be your friend it would help to put my mind at rest Don t look down upon her that s such a poor way of thinking Of all the women I have known she is the best Don t be too proud to learn from her Nancy In all these twenty years that she has been in my house whatever she undertook to do she did well nothing too hard or too humble for her if she thought it her duty I know what that means I myself have been a poor weak creature compared with her Don t be offended because I ask you to take pattern by her I know her value now better than I ever knew it before I owe her a debt I can t pay Nancy left the room burdened with strange and distressful thoughts When she saw Mary she looked at her with new feelings and spoke to her less familiarly than of wont Mary was very silent in these days her face had the dignity of a profound unspoken grief To his son mister Lord talked only of practical things urging sound advice and refraining now from any mention of their differences Horace absorbed in preoccupations had never dreamt that this illness might prove fatal on finding Nancy in tears he was astonished Do you think it s dangerous he asked I m afraid he will never get well It was Sunday morning The young man went apart and pondered After the mid day meal having heard from Mary that his father was no worse he left home without remark to any one and from Camberwell Green took a cab to Trafalgar Square At the Hotel Metropole he inquired for missus Damerel her rooms were high up and he ascended by the lift Sunk in a deep chair her feet extended upon a hassock missus Damerel was amusing herself with a comic paper she rose briskly though with the effort of a person who is no longer slim Here I am you see up in the clouds Now did you get my letter No letter but a telegram There I thought so Isn t that just like me As soon as I had sent out the letter to post I said to myself that I had written the wrong address What address it was I couldn t tell you to save my life but I shall see when it comes back from the post office I rather suspect it s gone to Gunnersbury just then I was thinking about somebody at Gunnersbury or somebody at Hampstead I can t be sure which What a good thing I wired Oh now Horace I don t like that I don t really The young man looked at her in bewilderment What don t you like Why that tie It won t do at all Your taste is generally very good but that tie I ll choose one for you to morrow and let you have it the next time you come Do you know I ve been thinking that it might be well if you parted your hair in the middle I don t care for it as a rule but in your case with your soft beautiful hair I think it would look well Shall we try Wait a minute I ll run for a comb But suppose some one came Nobody will come my dear boy Hardly any one knows I m here I like to get away from people now and then that s why I ve taken refuge in this cock loft She disappeared and came back with a comb of tortoise shell Sit down there Oh what hair it is to be sure Almost as fine as my own I think you ll have a delicious moustache Her personal appearance was quite in keeping with this vivacity Rather short and inclining but as yet only inclining to rotundity of figure with a peculiarly soft and clear complexion missus Damerel made a gallant battle against the hostile years Her bright eye her moist lips the admirable smoothness of brow and cheek and throat bore witness to sound health as did the rows of teeth incontestably her own which she exhibited in her frequent mirth A handsome woman still though not of the type that commands a reverent admiration Her frivolity did not exclude a suggestion of shrewdness nor yet of capacity for emotion but it was difficult to imagine wise or elevated thought behind that narrow brow She was elaborately dressed with only the most fashionable symbols of widowhood rings adorned her podgy little hand and a bracelet her white wrist Refinement she possessed only in the society journal sense but her intonation was that of the idle class and her grammar did not limp There let me look Oh I think that s an improvement more distingue And now tell me the news How is your father Very bad I m afraid said Horace when he had regarded himself in a mirror with something of doubtfulness Nancy says that she s afraid he won t get well Oh you don t say that Oh how very sad But let us hope I can t think it s so bad as that Horace sat in thought missus Damerel her bright eyes subduing their gaiety to a keen reflectiveness put several questions regarding the invalid then for a moment meditated Well we must hope for the best Let me know to morrow how he gets on be sure you let me know And if anything should happen oh but that s too sad we won t talk about it Again she meditated tapping the floor and as it seemed trying not to smile Don t be downcast my dear boy Never meet sorrow half way if you knew how useful I have found it to remember that maxim I have gone through sad sad things ah But now tell me of your own affairs Have you seen la petite I just saw her the other evening he answered uneasily Just What does that mean I wonder Now you don t look anything like so well as when you were at Scarborough You re worrying yes I know you are It s your nervous constitution my poor boy So you just saw her No more imprudences She examined his face attentively her lips set with tolerable firmness It s a very difficult position you know said Horace wriggling in his chair I can t get out of it all at once And the truth is I m not sure that I wish to missus Damerel drew her eyebrows together and gave a loud tap on the floor Oh that s weak that s very weak After promising me Now listen listen seriously She raised a finger If it goes on I have nothing more whatever to do with you It would distress me very very much but I can t interest myself in a young man who makes love to a girl so very far beneath him Be led by me Horace and your future will be brilliant Prefer this young lady of Camberwell and lose everything Horace leaned forward and drooped his head I don t think you form anything like a right idea of her he said The other moved impatiently My dear boy I know her as well as if I d lived with her for years Oh how silly you are But then you are so young so very young With the vexation on her face there blended as she looked at him a tenderness unmistakably genuine Now I ll tell you what I have really no objection to make Fanny s acquaintance Suppose after all you bring her to see me one of these days Not just yet You must wait till I am in the mood for it But before very long Horace looked up with pleasure and gratitude Now that s really kind of you Really And all the rest is only pretended kindness Silly boy Some day you will know better Now think Horace suppose you were so unhappy as to lose your father Could you as soon as he was gone do something that you know would have pained him deeply The pathetic note was a little strained putting her head aside missus Damerel looked rather like a sentimental picture in an advertisement Horace did not reply You surely wouldn t pursued the lady with emphasis watching him closely you surely wouldn t and couldn t marry this girl as soon as your poor father was in his grave Oh of course not missus Damerel seemed relieved but pursued her questioning You couldn t think of marrying for at least half a year Fanny wouldn t wish it No of course not well now I think I must make her acquaintance But how weak you are Horace Oh those nerves All finely delicately organised people like you make such blunders in life Your sense of honour is such a tyrant over you Now mind I don t say for a moment that Fanny isn t fond of you how could she help being my dear boy But I do insist that she will be very much happier if you let her marry some one of her own class You Horace belong to a social sphere so far far above her If I could only impress that upon your modesty You are made to associate with people of the highest refinement How deplorable to think that a place in society is waiting for you and you keep longing for Camberwell The listener s face wavered between pleasure in such flattery and the impulse of resistance Remember Horace if anything should happen at home you are your own master I could introduce you freely to people of wealth and fashion Of course you could give up the office at once I shall be taking a house in the West end or a flat at all events I shall entertain a good deal and think of your opportunities My dear boy I assure you that with personal advantages such as yours you might end by marrying an heiress Nothing more probable And you can talk of such a girl as Fanny French for shame I mustn t propose any gaieties just now she said when they had been together for an hour And I shall wait so anxiously for news of your father If anything did happen what would your sister do I wonder I m sure I don t know except that she d get away from Camberwell Nancy hates it Who knows I may be able to be of use to her But you say she is such a grave and learned young lady I am afraid we should bore each other To this Horace could venture only an uncertain reply He had not much hope of mutual understanding between his sister and missus Damerel At half past five he was home again and there followed a cheerless evening Nancy was in her own room until nine o clock She came down for supper but had no appetite her eyes showed redness from weeping Horace could say nothing for her comfort After the meal they went up together to the drawing room and sat unoccupied If we lose father said Nancy in a dull voice very unlike her ordinary tones we shall have not a single relative left that is anything to us Her brother kept silence Has missus Damerel she continued ever said anything to you about mother s family After hesitation Horace answered Yes and his countenance showed that the affirmative had special meaning Nancy waited with an inquiring look I haven t told you he added because we have had other things to think about But missus Damerel is mother s sister our aunt How long have you known that She told me at Scarborough But why didn t she tell you so at first That s what I can t understand She says she was afraid I might mention it but I don t believe that s the real reason Nancy s questioning elicited all that was to be learnt from her brother little more than she had heard already the same story of a disagreement between missus Damerel and their father of long absences from England and a revival of interest in her relatives following upon missus Damerel s widowhood She would be glad to see you if you liked But I doubt whether you would get on very well Why She doesn t care about the same things that you do She s a woman of society you know But if she s mother s sister Yes I should like to know her Nancy spoke with increasing earnestness It makes everything quite different I must see her Well as I said she s quite willing But you remember that I m supposed not to have spoken about her at all I should have to get her to send you a message or something of that kind Of course we have often talked about you I can t form an idea of her said Nancy impatiently Is she good Is she really kind Couldn t you get her portrait to show me I should be afraid to ask unless she had given me leave to speak to you She really lives in good society Haven t I told you the sort of people she knows She must be very well off there can t be a doubt of it I don t care so much about that said Nancy in a brooding voice It s herself whether she s kind and good and wishes well to us The next day there was no change in mister Lord s condition a deep silence possessed the house In the afternoon Nancy went to pass an hour with Jessica Morgan on her return she met Samuel Barmby who was just leaving after a visit to the sick man Samuel bore himself with portentous gravity but spoke only a few commonplaces affecting hope he bestowed upon Nancy s hand a fervent pressure and strode away with the air of an undertaker who had called on business Two more days of deepening gloom then a night through which Nancy sat with Mary Woodruff by her father s bed mister Lord was unconscious but from time to time a syllable or a phrase fell from his lips meaningless to the watchers At dawn Nancy went to her chamber pallid exhausted Mary whose strength seemed proof against fatigue moved about the room preparing for a new day every few minutes she stood with eyes fixed on the dying face and the tears she had restrained in Nancy s presence flowed silently When the sun made a golden glimmer upon the wall Mary withdrew and was absent for a quarter of an hour On returning she bent at once over the bed her eyes were met by a grave wondering look Do you know me she whispered The lips moved she bent lower but could distinguish no word He was speaking the murmur continued but she gathered no sense You can trust me I will do all I can He seemed to understand her and smiled As the smile faded away passing into an austere calm Mary pressed her lips upon his forehead CHAPTER five After breakfast and before Arthur Peachey s departure for business there had been a scene of violent quarrel between him and his wife It took place in the bed room where as usual save on Sunday morning Ada consumed her strong tea and heavily buttered toast the state of her health she had frequent ailments more or less genuine such as afflict the indolent and brainless type of woman made it necessary for her to repose till a late hour Peachey did not often lose self control though sorely tried the one occasion that unchained his wrath was when Ada s heedlessness or ill temper affected the well being of his child This morning it had been announced to him that the nurse girl Emma could no longer be tolerated she was making herself offensive to her mistress had spoken insolently disobeyed orders and worst of all defended herself by alleging orders from mister Peachey Hence the outbreak of strife signalled by furious shrill voices audible to Beatrice and Fanny as they sat in the room beneath Ada came down at half past ten and found Beatrice writing letters She announced what any who did not know her would have taken for a final resolve I m going I won t put up with that beast any longer I shall go and live at Brighton Her sister paid not the slightest heed she was intent upon a business letter of much moment Do you hear what I say I m going by the first train this afternoon All right remarked Beatrice placidly Don t interrupt me just now The result of this was fury directed against Beatrice who found herself accused of every domestic vice compatible with her position She was a sordid creature living at other people s expense a selfish scheming envious wretch If I were your husband remarked the other without looking up I should long since have turned you into the street if I hadn t broken your neck first Exercise in quarrel only made Ada s voice the clearer and more shrill It rose now to the highest points of a not inconsiderable compass But Beatrice continued to write and by resolute silence put a limit to her sister s railing A pause had just come about when the door was thrown open and in rushed Fanny hatted and gloved from a walk He s dead she said excitedly He s dead Beatrice turned with a look of interest Who mister Lord Yes The blinds are all down He must have died in the night Her cheeks glowed and her eyes sparkled as though she had brought the most exhilarating news What do I care said missus Peachey to whom her sister had addressed the last remark Just as much as I care about your affairs no doubt returned Fanny with genial frankness Don t be in too great a hurry remarked Beatrice who showed the calculating wrinkle at the corner of her eye Because he s dead that doesn t say that your masher comes in for money Who ll get it then There may be nothing worth speaking of to get for all we know Beatrice had not as yet gained Fanny s company operation in the commercial scheme now being elaborated though of far more amiable nature than missus Peachey she heartily hoped that the girl might be disappointed in her expectations from mister Lord s will An hour later she walked along Grove Lane and saw for herself that Fanny s announcement was accurate the close drawn blinds could mean but one thing To day there was little likelihood of learning particulars but on the morrow Fanny might perchance hear something from Horace Lord However the evening brought a note hand delivered by some stranger Horace wrote only a line or two informing Fanny that his father had died about eight o clock that morning and adding Please be at home to morrow at twelve At twelve next day Fanny received her lover alone in the drawing room He entered with the exaggerated solemnity of a very young man who knows for the first time a grave bereavement and feels the momentary importance it confers upon him Fanny trying to regard him without a smile grimaced decorous behaviour was at all times impossible to her for she neither understood its nature nor felt its obligation In a few minutes she smiled unrestrainedly and spoke the things that rose to her lips I ve been keeping a secret from you said Horace in the low voice which had to express his sorrow for he could not preserve a gloomy countenance with Fanny before him But I can tell you now A secret And what business had you to keep secrets from me It s about missus Damerel When I was at the seaside she told me who she really is She s my aunt my mother s sister Queer isn t it Of course that makes everything different And she s going to ask you to come and see her It ll have to be put off a little now but not very long I dare say as she s a relative You ll have to do your best to please her I m sure I shan t put myself out of the way People must take me as they find me Now don t talk like that Fanny It isn t very kind just now I thought you d be different to day All right Have you anything else to tell me Horace understood her significant glance and shook his head I ll let you know everything as soon as I know myself Having learnt the day and hour of mister Lord s funeral Ada and Fanny made a point of walking out to get a glimpse of it The procession of vehicles in Grove Lane excited their contempt so far was it from the splendour they had anticipated There you are said Ada I shouldn t wonder if it s going to be a jolly good take in for you after all If he d died worth much they wouldn t have buried him like that Fanny s heart sank She could conceive no other explanation of a simple burial save lack of means or resentment in the survivors at the disposition made of his property by the deceased When on the morrow Horace told her that his father had strictly charged mister Barmby to have him buried in the simplest mode compatible with decency she put it down to the old man s excessive meanness On this occasion she learnt the contents of mister Lord s will and having learnt them got rid of Horace as soon as possible that she might astonish her sisters with the report In the afternoon of that day Beatrice had an appointment with Luckworth Crewe She was to meet him at the office he had just taken in Farringdon Street whence they would repair to a solicitor s in the same neighbourhood for the discussion of legal business connected with Miss French s enterprise She climbed the staircase of a big building and was directed to the right door by the sound of Crewe s voice loudly and jocularly discoursing He stood with two men in the open doorway and at the sight of Beatrice waved a hand to her Take your hook you fellows I have an engagement The men glancing at Miss French facetiously went their way How do old chum It s all in a mess yet hold your skirts together Come along this way Through glue pots and shavings and an overpowering smell of paint Beatrice followed to inspect the premises which consisted of three rooms one very much the smallest about ten feet square Three workmen were busy and one fitting up shelves whistled a melody with ear piercing shrillness Stop that damned noise shouted Crewe I ve told you once already Try it on again my lad and I ll drop you down the well of the staircase you ve too much breath you have The other workmen laughed It was evident that Crewe had made friends with them all Won t be bad when we get the decks cleared he remarked to Beatrice Plenty of room to make twenty thousand a year or so He checked himself and asked in a subdued voice Seen anything of the Lords Beatrice nodded with a smile And heard about the will Have you No I haven t Come into this little room He closed the door behind them and looked at his companion with curiosity but without show of eagerness Well it s a joke said Miss French Is it How Fanny s that mad about it She d got it into her silly noddle that Horace Lord would drop in for a fortune at once As it is he gets nothing at all for two years except what the Barmbys choose to give him And if he marries before he s four and twenty he loses everything every cent Crewe whistled a bar of a street melody then burst into laughter That s how the old joker has done them is it Quite right too The lad doesn t know his own mind yet Let Fanny wait if she really wants him and if she can keep hold of him But what are the figures Nothing startling Of course I don t know all the ins and outs of it but Horace Lord will get seven thousand pounds and a sixth share in the piano business Old Barmby and his son are trustees They may let Horace have just what they think fit during the next two years If he wants money to go into business with they may advance what they like But for two years he s simply in their hands to be looked after And if he marries pop goes the weasel And Miss Lord asked Crewe carelessly Beatrice pointed a finger at him You want to know badly don t you Well it s pretty much the same as the other To begin with if she marries before the age of six and twenty she gets nothing whatever If she doesn t marry there s two hundred a year to live on and to keep up the house Oh I was forgetting she must not only keep single to twenty six but continue to live where she does now with that old servant of theirs for companion At six and twenty she takes the same as her brother about seven thousand and a sixth share in Lord and Barmby Again Crewe whistled That s about three years still to live in Grove Lane he said thoughtfully Well the old joker has pinned them and no mistake I thought he had more to leave Of course you did remarked Beatrice significantly Look here old fellow don t talk to me like that he replied good humouredly but with a reproof not to be mistaken I thought nothing about it in the way that you mean But it isn t much after living as he has done I suppose you don t know how the money lies I have it all from Fanny and it s a wonder she remembered as much as she did Oh Fanny s pretty smart in L s d But did she say what becomes of the money if either of them break the terms Goes to a girl s orphanage somewhere in the old man s country But there s more than I ve accounted for yet Young Barmby s sisters get legacies a hundred and fifty apiece And last of all the old servant has an annuity of two hundred He made her a sort of housekeeper not long ago H L says thought no end of her Don t know anything about her said Crewe absently I should like to know the business details What arrangement was made I wonder when he took Barmby into partnership I shouldn t be surprised if he simply gave him a share Old Barmby and Lord were great chums Then you see Samuel Barmby has a third of his profits to pay over eventually Beatrice went on to speak of the mysterious missus Damerel concerning whom she had heard from Fanny The man of business gave particular ear to this story and asked many questions Of a sudden as if dismissing matters which hardly concerned him he said mirthfully You ve heard about the row at Lillie Bridge yesterday I saw something about it in the paper Well I was there Pure chance haven t been at that kind of place for a year and more It was a match for the Sprint Championship and a hundred pounds Timed for six o clock but at a quarter past the chaps hadn t come forward I heard men talking and guessed there was something wrong they thought it a put up job When it got round that there d be no race the excitement broke out and then I d have given something for you to see it First of all there was a rush for the gate money a shilling a piece you know we d all paid There were a whole lot of North of England chaps fellow countrymen of mine and I heard some of them begin to send up a roar that sounded dangerous I was tumbling along with the crowd quite ready for a scrimmage I rather enjoy a fight now and then and all at once some chap sang out just in front Let s burst up the blooming show only he used a stronger word And a lot of us yelled hooray and to it we went I don t mean I had a hand in the pillaging and smashing it wouldn t have done for a man just starting in business to be up at the police court but I looked on and laughed laughed till I could hardly stand They set to work on the refreshment place It was a scene if you like Fellows knocking off the heads of bottles and drinking all they could then pouring the rest on the ground Glasses and decanters flying right and left sandwiches and buns and I don t know what pelting about They splintered all the small wood they could lay their hands on and set fire to it and before you could say Jack Robinson the whole place was blazing The bobbies got it pretty warm bottles and stones and logs of wood I saw one poor chap with the side of his face cut clean open It does one good a real stirring up like that I feel better to day than for the last month And the swearing that went on It s a long time since I heard such downright hearty solid swearing There was one chap I kept near and he swore for a full hour without stopping except when he had a bottle at his mouth he only stopped when he was speechless with liquor I wish I d been there said Miss French gaily It must have been no end of fun A right down good spree And it wasn t over till about eight o clock I stayed till the police had cleared the grounds and then came home laughing all the way It did me good I tell you Well shall we go and see the lawyer suggested Beatrice Right you are Have a drink first Nice quiet place round in Fleet Street glass of wine No As you please old chum Think this shop ll do don t you You must come round when it s finished But I daresay you ll be here many a time on biz Oh I daresay And as they went down the stairs Crewe laughed again at his recollections of yesterday s sport CHAPTER six Gusts of an October evening swept about the square of the old Inn and made rushes at the windows all the more cosy seemed it here in Tarrant s room where a big fire fed into smokeless placidity purred and crackled Pipe in mouth Tarrant lay back in his big chair gracefully indolent as ever Opposite him lamp light illuminating her face on one side and fire gloom on the other Nancy turned over an illustrated volume her husband s gift today Many were the presents he had bestowed upon her costly some of them all flattering the recipient by a presumption of taste and intelligence She had been here since early in the afternoon it was now near seven o clock Nancy looked at the pictures but inattentively her brows slightly knitted and her lips often on the point of speech that concerned some other matter Since the summer holiday she had grown a trifle thinner in face her beauty was no longer allied with perfect health a heaviness appeared on her eyelids Of course she wore the garb of mourning and its effect was to emphasise the maturing change manifest in her features For several minutes there had passed no word but Tarrant s face no less than his companion s signalled discussion in suspense No unfriendly discussion yet one that excited emotional activity in both of them The young man his pipe hand falling to his knee first broke silence I look at it in this way We ought to regard ourselves as married people living under exceptionally favourable circumstances One has to bear in mind the brutal fact that man and wife as a rule see a great deal too much of each other thence most of the ills of married life squabblings discontents small or great disgusts leading often enough to altri guai People get to think themselves victims of incompatibility when they are merely suffering from a foolish custom the habit of being perpetually together In fact it s an immoral custom What does immorality mean but anything that tends to kill love to harden hearts The common practice of man and wife occupying the same room is monstrous gross it s astounding that women of any sensitiveness endure it In fact their sensitiveness is destroyed Even an ordinary honeymoon generally ends in quarrel as it certainly ought to You and I escape all that Each of us lives a separate life with the result that we like each other better as time goes on I speak for myself at all events I look forward to our meetings I open the door to you with as fresh a feeling of pleasure as when you came first If we had been ceaselessly together day and night well you know the result as well as I do He spoke with indulgent gravity in the tone of kindness to which his voice was naturally attuned And Nancy s reply though it expressed a stronger feeling struck the same harmonious note I can agree with all that But it applies to people married in the ordinary way I was speaking of ourselves placed as we are I don t pretend to like the concealment said Tarrant For one thing there s a suggestion of dishonour about it We ve gone over all that Oh I don t mean that for a moment It isn t really dishonourable My father could never have objected to you for my husband He only wanted to guard me Mary says so and he told her everything He thought me a silly flighty girl and was afraid I should be trapped for the sake of my money I wish oh how I wish I had had the courage to tell him He would have seen you and liked and trusted you how could he help It might have been better but who knows whether he would have seen me with your eyes Nancy Yes yes But I was going to say She hesitated Say on There are so many difficulties before us dear Not if we continue to think of each other as we do now Do you mean it might be discovered Yes through no fault of ours She hesitated again Quite sure you haven t told anybody No one Tarrant had a doubt on this point He strongly suspected that Jessica Morgan knew the truth but he shrank from pressing Nancy to an avowal of repeated falsehood Then it s very unlikely we should be found out Who would dream of tracking you here for instance And suppose we were seen together in the street or in the country who would suspect anything more than love making and that is not forbidden you No But But But suppose I She rose crossed to him seated herself on his knee and put an arm about his neck Before she had spoken another word Tarrant understood the smile on his face lost its spontaneity a bitter taste seemed to distort his lips You think you are afraid He heard a monosyllable and sat silent This indeed had not entered into his calculations but why not He could hardly say he had ignored the not unimportant detail as it lurked among possibilities Perhaps had willingly ignored it as introducing a complication oppressive to his indolence to his hodiernal philosophy And now he arraigned mother nature the very divinity whom hitherto he had called upon to justify him All at once he grew cold to Nancy The lulled objections to matrimony awoke in him again again he felt that he had made a fool of himself Nancy was better than he had thought he either loved her or felt something towards her not easily distinguishable from love His inferior she remained but not in the sense he had formerly attributed to the word Her mind and heart excelled the idle conception he had formed of them But Nancy was not his wife as the world understands that relation merely his mistress and as a mistress he found her charming lovable What she now hinted at would shatter the situation Tarrant thought not of the peril to her material prospects on that score he was indifferent save in so far as mister Lord s will helped to maintain their mutual independence But he feared for his liberty in the first place and in the second abhorred the change that must come over Nancy herself Nancy a mother he repelled the image as though it degraded her Delicacy however constrained him to a disguise of these emotions He recognised the human sentiments that should have weighed with him like a man of cultivated intelligence he admitted their force their beauty None the less a syllable on Nancy s lips had arrested the current of his feelings and made him wish again that he had been either more or less a man of honour down at Teignmouth And yet he said to himself could I have resisted an appeal for marriage now That comes of being so confoundedly humane It s a marvel that I didn t find myself married to some sheer demirep long ago Nancy was speaking Will it make you love me less I have always refused to prophesy about love he answered with forced playfulness But you wouldn t you wouldn t We should find ourselves in a very awkward position I know said Nancy hurriedly I can t see what would be done But you seem colder to me all at once Lionel Surely it oughtn t to to turn you away from me Perhaps I am mistaken This referred to the alarming possibility and Tarrant caught at hope Yes she might be mistaken they wouldn t talk about it he shook it away Let me fill my pipe again Yes you can do it for me That reminds me of a story Harvey Munden tells A man he knew a doctor got married and there was nothing his wife wouldn t do for him As he sat with her one evening smoking a patient called him into the consulting room He had only just lighted a fresh pipe and laid it down regretfully I ll keep it in for you said his wife And she did so with dainty and fearful puffs at long intervals But the doctor was detained and when he came back well the poor wife had succumbed to her devotion She never kept in his pipe again Nancy tried to laugh She was in her own chair again and sat resting her cheek upon her hand gazing at the fire How is it Lionel that no one ever knocks at your door when I m here Oh very simple I sport the oak as you know But don t you think some friend of yours might see a light in your window and come up If so il respecte la consigne No no I don t like you when you begin to use French words I think it reminds me of once when you did it a long time ago and I thought you never mind Tarrant laughed Weren t they strange those meetings of ours at Champion Hill What did you think me Arrogant Insolent That is my tendency with strangers I admit But I was asking you a question said Nancy You mean that no one would knock if he saw your outer door closed But what would they think No doubt that I was working I am supposed to be secretly engaged on some immortal composition Nancy pondered I do hope no one that knows you will ever see me coming or going What could it matter They wouldn t know who you were But to have such things thought I should feel it just as if they knew me I believe I could never come again Why what s the matter with you Tarrant asked You have tears in your eyes You re not well to day He checked himself on an unwelcome thought and proceeded more carelessly Do you suppose for a moment that any friend of mine is ass enough to think with condemnation of a girl who should come to my rooms whatever the circumstances You must get rid of that provincialism let us call it Camberwellism They wouldn t think it any harm even if My dear girl we have outgrown those ancestral prejudices Tarrant s humour never quite deserted him least of all when he echoed the talk of his world but his listener kept a grave face We have nothing to do with missus Grundy s morals But you believe in a morality of some kind she pursued with diffidence You used the word immoral just now Nancy felt no consciousness of the gulf that yawned between herself as she spoke now and the old self which had claimed superiority Her mind was so completely unsettled that she never tried to connect its present state with its earlier phases For the most part her sensations and her reflections were concerned with the crude elements of life the exceptional moments she spent in a world of vague joys and fears wherein thought properly speaking had no share Before she could outlive the shock of passion which seemed at once to destroy and to re create her she was confronted with the second supreme crisis of woman s existence its natural effects complicated with the trials of her peculiar position Tarrant s reception of her disclosure came as a new disturbance she felt bewildered and helpless He preoccupied with the anxiety he affected to dismiss had no inclination to debate ethical problems For a while he talked jestingly and at length fell into a mood of silence Nancy did not stay much longer they parted without mention of the subject uppermost in their thoughts They had no stated times of meeting Tarrant sent an invitation whenever it pleased him When the next arrived in about a week Nancy made reply that she did not feel well enough to leave home It was the briefest letter Tarrant had yet received from her and the least affectionate He kept silence for a few days and wrote again This time Nancy responded as usual and came To the involuntary question in his eyes hers answered unmistakably For the first few minutes they said very little to each other Tarrant was struggling with repulsions and solicitudes of which he felt more than half ashamed Nancy reticent for many reasons not the least of them a resentful pride which for the moment overcame her fondness endeavoured to speak of trivial things They kept apart and at length the embarrassment of the situation held them both mute With a nervous movement the young man pushed forward the chair on which Nancy usually sat I see that you don t look well Nancy turned to the window She had unbuttoned her jacket and taken off her gloves but went no further in the process of preparing herself for the ordinary stay of some hours Did something in my letter displease you inquired her husband You mean because I didn t come No I really didn t feel well enough Tarrant hesitated but the softer feeling prevailed with him He helped to remove her jacket seated her by the fire and led her to talk So there s no doubt of it Her silence made answer Then of course there s just as little doubt as to what we must do His voice had not a convincing sincerity he waited for the reply You mean that we can t keep the secret How is it possible But you are vexed about it You don t speak to me as you used to I don t think you ever will again It will make no change in me said Tarrant with resolute good humour All I want to be sure of is that you are quite prepared for the change in your prospects Are you dear Her tone and look deprived the inquiry of unpleasant implication He answered her with a laugh You know exactly how I regard it In one way I should feel relief Of course I don t like the thought that I shall have caused you to suffer such a loss I should never have that thought But are you quite sure about the result to yourself You remember saying that you couldn t be certain how How it will be taken at Champion Hill I was going to tell you the latest report from there It is very doubtful whether I should ever have to break the news They did not look at each other Everything in that quarter must be long since settled Pray remember that I have no vast expectations Quite certainly it won t be a large fortune very likely not more than your own But enough to live on no doubt I know the value of money no man better It would be pleasant enough to play with thousands a year But I don t grumble so long as I have a competency Nancy meditated and sighed Oh it s a pity Father never meant me to be penniless if I married wisely I suppose not Of course not They both meditated It wouldn t be possible would it Why he answered with a laugh last time you were here you spoke in quite the other way You were utterly miserable at the thought of living through it alone Yes I don t know whether I could even if What are you thinking of I ve been talking with Mary she replied after an uneasy pause She has lived with us so long and since father s death it seems quite natural to make a friend of her No one could be more devoted to me than she is I believe there s nothing she wouldn t do I believe I might trust her with any secret The obvious suggestion demanded thought By the bye said Tarrant looking up have you seen your aunt again Nancy s face changed to a cold expression No And I don t think I shall Probably you were as little sympathetic to her as she to you I don t like her was the brief reply I ve had curious thoughts about that lady said Tarrant smiling The mystery it seems to me is by no means solved You think she really is your aunt Impossible to doubt it Any one could see her likeness to Horace at once Ah you didn t mention that I had a fear that she might be simply an adventuress with an eye to your brother s money She is what she says I m sure But I shall never ask her to come and see me again and I don t think she ll want to That would be fortunate if if we wished Tarrant nodded At the same moment they heard a sound that startled them That s a knock at the door said Nancy rising as if to escape So it is Banging with a stick Let him bang It must be a stranger or he d respect the oak They sat listening The knock sounded again loud and prolonged Tarrant joked about it but a third time came the summons I may as well go and see who it is Oh you won t let any one Of course not Sit quietly He went out closing the room door behind him and opened the heavy door which should have ensured his privacy For five minutes he was absent then returned with a face portending news It was Vawdrey He knew my habit of sporting the oak and wouldn t go away till he had made sure My grandmother is dying They telegraphed to Vawdrey in the City and he came here at once to tell me I must go Perhaps I shall be too late What did he think of your keeping him outside I made some sort of excuse He s a good natured fellow it didn t matter Stay a little after I m gone stay as long as you like In fact You can pull to the inner door when you go What did the telegram say missus Tarrant sinking Come immediately Of course we expected it It s raining hard wait and see if it stops you must take care of yourself For this Nancy was not slow in exhibiting her gratitude which served as mask of the pleasure she could not decently betray When her husband had hastened off she sat for a few minutes in thought then alone here for the first time she began to walk about the rooms and to make herself more intimately acquainted with their contents CHAPTER seven Whilst she was thus occupied darkness came on She did not care to light the lamp so made herself ready and stole forth The rain had ceased Walking alone at night was a pleasure in which she now indulged herself pretty frequently at such times Mary Woodruff believed her in the company of Miss Morgan The marked sobriety of her demeanour since mister Lord s death and the friendliness even the affection she evinced in their common life at home had set Mary s mind at ease concerning her No murmur at her father s will had escaped Nancy in this respect very unlike her brother who when grief was forgotten declared himself ill used she seemed perfectly content with the conditions laid upon her and the sincerity of her mourning could not be doubted Anxious to conciliate the girl in every honest way Mary behaved to her with the same external respect as ever and without a hint of express guardianship The two were on excellent terms It seemed likely that before long they would have the house to themselves already Horace had spoken of taking lodgings in a part of London more congruous with the social aspirations encouraged by his aunt missus Damerel From Chancery Lane she passed into Fleet Street and sauntered along with observation of shop windows She was unspeakably relieved by the events of the afternoon it would now depend upon her own choice whether she preserved her secret or declared herself a married woman Her husband had proved himself generous as well as loving yes she repeated to herself generous and loving her fears and suspicions had been baseless missus Tarrant s death freed them from all sordid considerations A short time perhaps a day or two might put an end to irregularities and enable her to hold up her head once more Feeling hungry she entered a restaurant and dined Not carelessly but with fastidious choice of viands This was enjoyable she began to look more like herself of a few months ago She would return to Camberwell by train from Ludgate Hill At the circus crowding traffic held her back for a minute or two just as she ran forward a familiar voice caused her to stop again She became flurried lost her head stood still amid a tumult of omnibuses cabs and carts but a hand grasped her by the arm and led her safely to the opposite pavement What do you mean by shouting at me in the street were her first words The person addressed was Luckworth Crewe he had by no means anticipated such wrathful greeting and stood in confusion I beg your pardon Miss Lord I didn t think I shouted I only meant to call your attention Why should you call my attention Her cheeks were flushed with anger she regarded him as though he were a stranger guilty of mere insolence I don t wish to speak to you With astonishment Crewe found himself alone But a rebuff such as this so irrational as he thought it so entirely out of keeping with Miss Lord s behaviour he could by no means accept Nancy was walking towards the railway station he followed He watched her as she took a ticket then put himself in her way with all the humility of countenance he could command I m so sorry I offended you It wasn t the right thing to do I ought to have waited till you were across I m a blundering sort of fellow in those things Do let me beg your pardon and forgive me She was calmer now though still tremulous But for the attack of nervousness she would have met Crewe with nothing worse than a slight reserve to mark a change in their relations Very soon after her father s death he had written a becoming letter though it smacked of commercial phraseology To the hope expressed in it that he might be allowed to call upon her in a few weeks time Nancy made no reply A fortnight later he wrote again this time reminding her with modest propriety of what had occurred between them before she left town in August Nancy responded and in grave friendly language begged him to think of her no more he must not base the slightest hope upon anything she might have said To her surprise Crewe held his peace and she saw him now for the first time since their ascent of the Monument I m ashamed that I lost my temper mister Crewe I am in a hurry to get home In the booking office at Ludgate Hill it is not easy to detain by chivalrous discourse a lady bent on escaping but Crewe attempted it He subdued his voice spoke rapidly and with emotion implored that he might be heard for a moment Would she not permit him to call upon her He had waited respecting her seclusion He asked for nothing whatever but permission to call as any acquaintance might Have you heard I have opened an office in Farringdon Street I should so like to tell you all about it what I m doing No one calls to see me said Nancy with firmness I wish to live quite alone I m very sorry to seem unfriendly Is it anything I ve done No nothing whatever I assure you nothing Let us say good bye I can t stop another moment They shook hands and so parted You re back early said Mary when Nancy entered the drawing room Yes I left Jessica to her books sooner than usual The examination draws near Quiet sad diligent ever Mary kept unchanged the old domestic routine There was the same perfect order the same wholesome economy as when she worked under the master s eyes Nancy had nothing to do but enjoy the admirable care with which she was surrounded she took it all as a matter of course never having considered the difference between her own home and those of her acquaintances Horace had dined and was gone out again They talked of him Mary said that he had spoken of moving into lodgings very soon Of course he doesn t tell us everything said Nancy I feel pretty sure that he s going to leave the office but how he means to live I don t understand Perhaps missus Damerel will give him money or lend it him I only hope she may break it off between him and Fanny Hasn t he told you that Fanny is often with missus Damerel With her Nancy exclaimed He never said a word of it to me He said so to me this evening and laughed when I looked surprised Well then I don t pretend to understand what s going on We can t do anything About nine o clock the servant entered the room bringing Miss Lord a note which had just been left by a cab driver Nancy seeing that the address was in Tarrant s hand opened it with a flutter of joy such a proceeding as this openly sending a note by a messenger could only mean that her husband no longer cared to preserve secrecy To her astonishment the envelope contained but a hurried line Not a word yet to any one Without fail come to morrow afternoon at four With what show of calmness she could command she looked up at her companion The idea of his sending in this way It s that mister Crewe I ve told you of I met him as I was coming home and had to speak to him rather sharply to get rid of him Here comes his apology foolish man Living in perpetual falsehood Nancy felt no shame at a fiction such as this Mere truth telling had never seemed to her a weighty matter of the law And she was now grown expert in lies But Tarrant s message disturbed her gravely Something unforeseen must have happened something perhaps calamitous She passed a miserable night When she ascended the stairs at Staple Inn next afternoon it wanted ten minutes to four As usual at her coming the outer door stood open exposing the door with the knocker She had just raised her hand when with a sound of voices from inside the door opened and Tarrant appeared in company with a stranger Terror stricken she stepped back Tarrant after a glance paid no attention to her All right he was saying to his friend I shall see you in a day or two Good bye old man The stranger had observed Nancy but withheld his eyes from her and quickly vanished down the stairs Who was that she whispered I told you four o clock It is four No ten minutes to at least It doesn t matter but if you had been punctual you wouldn t have had a fright Nancy had dropped into a chair white and shaking Tarrant s voice abruptly reproachful affected her scarcely less than the preceding shock In the struggle to recover herself she sobbed and choked and at length burst into tears Tarrant spoke impatiently What s the matter Surely you are not so childish She stood up and went into the bedroom where she remained for several minutes returning at length without her jacket but with her hat still on I couldn t help it and you shouldn t speak to me in that way I have felt ill all the morning Looking at her the young man said to himself that love was one thing wedded life another He could make allowance for Nancy s weakness but it was beyond his power to summon the old warmth and tenderness If henceforth he loved her it must be with husband s love a phrase which signified to him something as distinct as possible from the ardour he had known a moral attachment instead of a passionate desire And there was another reason for his intolerant mood You hadn t spoken to any one before you got my note No Why are you treating me like this Are you ashamed that your friend saw me Ashamed not at all Who did he think I was I don t know He doesn t know anything about you at all events As you may guess I have something not very pleasant to tell I didn t mean to be unkind it was only the surprise at seeing you when I opened the door I had calculated the exact time But never mind You look cold warm yourself at the fire You shall drink a glass of wine it will put your nerves right again No I want nothing Tell me at once what it is But Tarrant quietly brought a bottle and glass from his cupboard Nancy again refused pettishly Until you have drunk he said with a smile of self will I shall tell you nothing I don t know what I ve done to make you like this Her sobs and tears returned After a moment of impatience Tarrant went up to her with the glass laid a hand upon her shoulder and kissed her Now come be reasonable We have uncommonly serious things to talk about What did your friend think of me That you were one of the prettiest girls he had ever been privileged to see and that I was an enviable fellow to have such a visitor There now another sip and let us have some colour back into your cheeks There s bad news Nancy confoundedly bad news dear girl My grandmother was dead when I got there Well the foolish old woman has been muddling her affairs for a long time speculating here and there without taking any one s advice and so on and the result is that she leaves nothing at all Nancy was mute Less than nothing indeed She owed a few hundreds that she had no means of paying The joke of the thing is that she has left an elaborate will with legacies to half a dozen people myself first of all If she had been so good as to die two years ago I should have come in for a thousand a year or so No one suspected what was going on she never allowed Vawdrey the one man who could have been useful to her to have an inkling of the affair An advertising broker got her in his clutches Vawdrey s lawyer has been going through her papers and finds everything quite intelligible The money has gone in lumps good after bad Swindling of course but perfectly legal swindling nothing to be done about it A minute or two before her death she gasped out some words of revelation to the nurse enough to set Vawdrey on the track when he was told Still the listener said nothing Well I had a talk with Vawdrey He s a blackguard but not a bad fellow Wished he could help me but didn t quite see how unless I would go into business However he had a suggestion to make For Nancy the pause was charged with apprehensions She seemed to discover in her husband s face a purpose which he knew would excite her resistance He and I have often talked about my friend Sutherland in the Bahamas and Vawdrey has an idea that there ll be a profitable opening in that quarter before long Sutherland has written to me lately that he thinks of bestirring himself in the projects I ve told you about he has got the old man s consent to borrow money on the property Now Vawdrey naturally enough would like Sutherland to join him in starting a company the thoughts of such men run only on companies So he offers if I will go out to the Bahamas for a month or two and look about me and put myself in a position to make some kind of report he offers to pay my expenses Of course if the idea came to anything and a company got floated I should have shares Again he paused The listener had wide miserable eyes Well I told him at once that I would accept the proposal I have no right to refuse All I possess in the world at this moment is about sixty pounds If I sold all my books and furniture they might bring another sixty or so What then is to become of me I must set to work at something and here s the first work that comes to hand But his voice softened this puts us face to face with a very grave question doesn t it Are we to relinquish your money and be both of us penniless Or is there any possibility of saving it How can we How could the secret be kept Voice and countenance joined in utter dismay It doesn t seem to me said Tarrant slowly a downright impossibility It might be managed with the help of your friend Mary and granting that you yourself have the courage But he made a large gesture of course I can t exact any such thing of you It must seem practicable to you yourself What are we to do if my money is lost Don t say we He smiled generously perhaps too generously A man must support his wife I shall arrange it somehow of course so that you have no anxiety But His voice dropped Lionel She sprang up and approached him as he stood by the fireplace You won t leave me dear How can you think of going so far away for months and leaving me as I am now Oh you won t leave me He arched his eyebrows and smiled gently If that s how you look at it well I must stay You can do something here Nancy continued with rapid pleading You can write for the papers You always said you could yes you did say so We don t need very much to live upon at first I shall be content A moment You mean that the money must be abandoned She had meant it but under his look her confused thoughts took a new direction No We needn t lose it Only stay near me and I will keep the secret through everything You will only need then just to support yourself and that is so easy I will tell Mary how it is She can be trusted I am sure she can She would do anything for me She knows that father was not thinking of a man such as you It would be cruelly wrong if I lost everything I will tell her and she will help me Scarcely any one comes to the house as it is and I will pretend to have bad health and shut myself up And then when the time comes Mary will go away with me and and the child shall be taken care of by some people we can trust to be kind to it Horace is going to live in lodgings and missus Damerel I am sure won t come to see me again and I can get rid of other people The Barmbys shall think I am sulking about the will I m sure they think already that I dislike them because of it Let them think it I will refuse presently to see them at all It s only a few months If I tell people I m not well nobody will feel surprised if I go away for a month or two now soon Mary would go with me of course I might go for December and January Father didn t mean I was never to have change of air Then there would be February and March at home And then I might go away again till near the end of May I m sure we can manage it She stopped breathless Tarrant who had listened with averted face turned and spoke judicially There s one thing you re forgetting Nancy Do you propose that we shall never acknowledge the child Remember that even if you were bold enough after our second marriage to acknowledge it in the face of scandal that wouldn t be safe Any one if suspicion is aroused can find out when we were actually married We can t think of that The child may not live Tarrant moved and the movement startled Nancy It meant that she had pained him perhaps made him think of her with repugnance I hardly know what I am saying You know I don t wish that But all I can think of now is to keep you near me I can t bear to be separated from you I love you so much more than you love me Let me just tell you what I had in mind Nancy Supposing the secret can be kept we must eventually live abroad that is to say if our child is not to grow up a stranger to us which neither you nor I could wish Now at Nassau the capital of the Bahamas a lot of Americans always spend the winter If I made acquaintances among them it might be a very useful step it would be preparing for the future To Nancy this sounded far from convincing She argued against it in a perfectly natural way and as any one else would have done who knew Tarrant More than once he had declared to her that he would rather die than drag out his life in one of the new countries that he could not breathe in an atmosphere of commercialism unrelieved by historic associations Nancy urged that it would be better to make a home on the continent whither they could go at any moment without a sense of exile So it comes to this he interrupted with an air of resignation I must refuse Vawdrey s offer and in doing so refuse an excellent chance of providing for our future if what is by no means improbable the secret should be discovered I must turn to journalism or be a clerk Well and good My wife decrees it And he began to hum an air as if the matter were dismissed There was a long silence How long would you be away murmured Nancy at length I suppose two months at most November December The second of those months you might be spending as you said away from London Down in Devon perhaps I can t blame your thoughts about it but it seems doesn t it a trifle inconsiderate when you think what may result from my journey Would you promise me to be back by the end of the year Not promise Nancy But do my best Letters take fourteen days that s all You should hear by every mail Why not promise Because I can t foresee how much I may have to do there and how long it will take me But you may be very sure that Vawdrey won t pay expenses for longer than he can help It has occurred to me that I might get materials for some magazine articles That would help to float me with the editors you know if it s necessary Nancy sighed If I consented if I did my best not to stand in your way would you love me better when you came back The answer was a pleased laugh Why there he cried you ve given in a nutshell the whole duty of a wife who wishes to be loved Nancy tried to laugh with him CHAPTER eight He must be a strong man whom the sudden stare of Penury does not daunt and in some measure debase Tarrant whatever the possibilities of his nature had fallen under a spell of indolent security which declared its power only when he came face to face with the demand for vigorous action The moment found him a sheer poltroon What Is it possible that I I am henceforth penniless I to whom the gods were so gracious I without warning flung from sheltered comfort on to the bare road side where I must either toil or beg The thing seemed unintelligible He had never imagined such ruin of his hopes For the first time he turned anxious thoughts upon the money to which his wife was would be might be entitled He computed the chances of success in the deception he and she were practising and knew with shame that he must henceforth be party to a vulgar fraud Could Nancy be trusted to carry through this elaborate imposition difficult for the strongest minded woman Was it not a certainty that some negligence or some accident must disclose her secret Then had he a wife and child upon his hands to support even as common men support wife and child by incessant labour The prospect chilled him If he went to the West Indies his absence would heighten the probability of Nancy s detection Yet he desired to escape from her Not to abandon her of that thought he was incapable but to escape the duty repulsive to his imagination of encouraging her through the various stages of their fraud From the other side of the Atlantic he would write affectionate consolatory letters face to face with her could he support the show of tenderness go through an endless series of emotional interviews always reminding himself that the end in view was hard cash Not for love s sake he loved her less than before she proved herself his wife in earnest Veritable love no man knew better would have impelled him to save himself and her from a degrading position Was he committing himself to a criminality which the law would visit Hardly that until he entered into possession of money fraudulently obtained In miserable night watchings he fell to the most sordid calculations Supposing their plot revealed would Nancy in fact be left without resources Surely not with her brother her aunt her lifelong friends the Barmbys to take thought for her She could not suffer extremities And upon this he blushed relief Better to make up his mind that the secret must inevitably out For the moment Nancy believed she had resigned herself to his departure and that she had strength to go through with the long ordeal But a woman in her situation cannot be depended upon to pursue a consistent course It is Nature s ordinance that motherhood shall be attained through phases of mental disturbance which leave the sufferer scarce a pretence of responsibility Nancy would play strange pranks by which assuredly he would be driven to exasperation if they passed under his eyes He had no mind to be called father perhaps even his humanity might fail under the test to which as a lover he had given scarce a casual thought By removing himself and awaiting the issue afar off he gained time and opportunity for reflection Of course his wife could not come to want that after all was the one clearly comforting thought Her old servant would take good care of her happen what might He must taste of liberty again before sinking into the humdrum of married life The thought of an ocean voyage of the new life amid tropic splendours excited his imagination all the more because it blended with the thought of recovered freedom Marriage had come upon him with unfair abruptness for such a change as that even the ordinary bachelor demands a season preparative much more then the young man who revelled in a philosophic sense of detachment who wrote his motto Vixi hodie For marriage he was simply unfit forced together he and his wife would soon be mutually detestable A temporary parting might mature in the hearts of both that affection of which the seed was undeniably planted With passion they had done the enduring tenderness of a reasonable love must now unite them were they to be united at all And to give such love a chance of growing in him Tarrant felt that he must lose sight of Nancy until her child was born Yes it had begun already the trial he dreaded A letter from Nancy written and posted only an hour or two after her return home a long distracted letter Would he forgive her for seeming to be an obstacle in the way of what he had proposed Would he promise her to be faithful Would he He had hardly patience to read it through The next evening on returning home about ten o clock he was startled by the sight of Nancy s figure at the foot of his staircase What has happened Nothing don t be frightened But I wanted to see you tonight She gripped his hand How long have you waited What Hours But this is downright madness such a night as this Couldn t you put a note for me in the letter box Don t don t speak so I wanted to see you She hurried her words as if afraid he would refuse to listen I have told Mary I wanted you to know Come in But there s no fire and you re chilled through Do you want to be ill What outrageous silliness Her vitality was indeed at a low ebb and reproaches made her weep Tarrant half carried her up to his room made a light and fell to his knees at fire building Let me do it Nancy exclaimed Let me wait upon you If you don t sit still and keep quiet you ll make me angry in earnest Then you re not really angry with me I couldn t help it No I m afraid you couldn t Tarrant muttered cheerlessly I wanted to tell you that Mary will be our friend She was speechless with astonishment at first I didn t know what she would say she looked at me as she had never looked before as if she were the mistress and I the servant But see what I have come to all I felt was a dread lest she should think it her duty to cast me off I haven t a bit of pride left I could have fallen on my knees before her I almost did But she was very good and kind and gentle at last She ll do everything she can for me The fire in a blaze Tarrant stood up and regarded it gloomily Well did she think it possible he asked at length Yes she did She said it would be very difficult but the secret might be kept if I were strong enough And I am strong enough I will be It doesn t look like it said Tarrant taking the edge off his words with a smile I won t come again in this way Where have you been tonight Oh with friends Which friends where He moved impatiently People you don t know Nancy and wouldn t care about if you did Do you know what time it is Do tell me where you have been It isn t prying into your affairs Your friends ought to be mine at least I mean I ought to know their names and something about them Suppose I were to tell you I had been spending the evening with friends My dear girl I shouldn t ask a question unless you invited it However it s better to tell you that I have been making arrangements to sublet these chambers I can t afford to keep them even if there were any use in it Harvey Munden has introduced me to a man who is likely to relieve me of the burden I shall warehouse my books and furniture Then you are going Really going to leave England He affected astonishment in truth nothing now could surprise him But wasn t it all decided between us Didn t you repeat it in your letter Yes I know but I didn t think it would come so soon We won t talk about it to night said Tarrant firmly For one thing there s no time Come closer to the fire and get warm through then I must see you home Nancy hung her head When in a few moments she looked up again it was to say drily There s no need for you to see me home I m going to at all events Why You don t care much about me I might as well be run over or anything To this remark no sort of answer was vouchsafed Nancy sat with her feet on the fender and Tarrant kept up a great blaze with chips which sputtered out their moisture before they began to crackle He and she both seemed intent on this process of combustion Now you re quite warm said the young man as if speaking to a child and it s time to go Nancy rose obediently gazed at him with dreaming eyes and suffered herself to be led away by the arm In Chancery Lane Tarrant hailed a crawling hansom When they were driving rapidly southward Nancy began to question him about the date of his departure she learnt that he might be gone in less than a week If you could behave quietly and sensibly we would have an evening to make final arrangements I can she answered with a calm that surprised him If you go without letting me see you again I don t know what I might do But I can be as sensible as you are if I m treated fairly He grasped her hand Remember dear girl that I have a good deal to worry me just now Do you suppose I leave you with a light heart If you can persuade me that you care I care a good deal more than I can easily say Your position is a very hard one harder than mine But I m going away to work for your future I see clearly that it s the best thing I could do Whether Vawdrey s ideas come to anything or not I shall make profit out of the journey I mean to write I think it s all I can do to any purpose and the material I shall get together over there will give me a start Don t think I am cold hearted because I talk in this way if I broke down so much the worse for both of us The time has come for serious work But we shan t lose my money I ve made up my mind we shan t It s impossible for you to guard against every danger We must be prepared for the worst and that responsibility rests on me Try and keep your mind at ease whatever happens to protect you is my duty and I shall not fail in it Speaking thus Tarrant felt the glow of virtue His words were perfectly sincere but had reference to a future which his thoughts left comfortably vague They were to meet again probably for the definite parting three days hence Tarrant whose desire for escape had now become incontrollable used the intervening time in a rush of preparations He did not debate with himself as to the length of his sojourn in the West Indies that must be determined by circumstances Explicitly he had avoided a promise on the subject What money he possessed he would take with him it might be to his interest for Nancy s likewise to exceed the term of absence provided for in his stipulations with mister Vawdrey But all he deliberately thought of was the getting away Impatient with Nancy because of the vagaries resultant from her mental and physical state he himself exhibited a flagrant triumph of instinct over reason Once in enjoyment of liberty he would reflect like a practical man on the details of his position review and recognise his obligations pay his debt to honour but liberty first of all Not his the nature to accept bondage it demoralised him made him do and say things of which he was ashamed Only let him taste the breezes of ocean and the healthful spirit which is one with rectitude would again inspire him Much to his surprise he neither saw nor heard from Nancy until the hour appointed She came very punctually On opening the door to her with an air of resolute cheerfulness he saw something in her face that removed the necessity for playing a part It was the look which had so charmed him in their love days the indescribable look characteristic of Nancy and of her alone a gleam between smile and laughter a glance mingling pride with submission a silent note of personality which thrilled the senses and touched the heart What now he asked holding her hand and gazing at her Some good news None that I know of How hot your room is Why you look glad to see me Was I ever anything else She answered him with a smile It s a very pleasant surprise he continued watching her as she threw off her out door things I expected a doleful visage eyes red with weeping Did you See how much a man thinks of himself If you choose to go away I choose to think as little of you as possible That s common sense isn t it I don t want you to cry about it Oh yes you do It flatters you and you like flattery But I ve been too obliging I feel myself again and there s no more flattery for you till you come back I don t ask you when that will be I ask you nothing at all I am independent of you Tarrant grew uneasy He feared that this mood of jest would change only too suddenly and her collapse into feminine feebleness be the more complete Be as independent as you like he said only keep your love for me Oh indeed It s your experience is it that the two things can go together That s the difference between man and woman I suppose I shall love you just as little as possible and how little that will be perhaps I had better not tell you Still he stood gazing at her You look very beautiful to day I know I saw it for myself before I left home But we won t talk about that When do you go My goods will be warehoused to morrow and the next day I go to Liverpool I m glad it s so soon We shan t need to see each other again Smoke your pipe I m going to make a cup of tea Kiss me first You forgot when you came in You get no kiss by ordering it Beg for it prettily and we ll see What does it all mean Nancy How can you have altered like this You prefer me as I was last time Not I indeed You make me feel that it will be very hard to leave you I shall carry away a picture of you quite different from the dreary face that I had got to be afraid of Nancy laughed and of a sudden held out her hands to him Haven t I thought of that These were the very words I hoped to hear from you Now beg for a kiss and you shall have one Never perhaps had they spent together so harmonious an evening Nancy s tenderness took at length a graver turn but she remained herself face and speech untroubled by morbid influence I won t see you again she said because I mightn t be able to behave as I can to day To day I am myself for a long time I have been living I don t know how Tarrant murmured something about her state of health Yes I know all about that A strange thought came to me last night When my father was alive I fretted because I couldn t be independent I wanted to be quite free to live as I chose I looked forward to it as the one thing desirable Now I look back on that as a time of liberty I am in bondage now threefold bondage How threefold To you because I love you and couldn t cease loving you however I tried Then to my father s will which makes me live in hiding as if I were a criminal And then What other tyranny You mustn t expect all my love Before long some one else will rule over me What an exchange I have made And I was going to be so independent To the listener her speech seemed to come from a maturer mind than she had hitherto revealed But he suffered from the thought that this might be merely a pathological phase In reminding him of her motherhood she checked the flow of his emotion You ll remember Nancy went on that I m not enjoying myself whilst you are away I don t want you to be unhappy only to think of me and keep in mind what I m going through If you do that you won t be away from me longer than you can help It was said with unforced pathos and Tarrant s better part made generous reply If you find it too hard dear write to me and tell me and there shall be an end of it Never You think me wretchedly weak but you shall see It s of your own free will you undertake it Yes of my own free will she answered firmly I won t come to you penniless It isn t right I should do so My father didn t mean that If I had had the sense and the courage to tell him all this misery would have been spared That money is mine by every right and I won t lose it Not only for your sake and my own there is some one else to think of Tarrant gave her a kind look Don t count upon it Trust to me I like to hear you say that but I don t wish you to be put to proof You are not the kind of man to make money How do you mean it As you like to take it Silly boy don t I love you just because you are not one of the money making men If you hadn t a penny in the world I should love you just the same and I couldn t love you more if you had millions The change which Tarrant expected did not come To the end she was brave and bright her own best self She said good bye without a tear refused to let him accompany her and so even as she had resolved left in her husband s mind an image beckoning his return Part IV The Veiled Figure CHAPTER one Before his admission to a partnership in mister Lord s business Samuel Barmby lived with his father and two sisters in Coldharbour Lane Their house was small old and crumbling for lack of repair the landlord his ground lease having but a year or two to run looked on with equanimity whilst the building decayed Under any circumstances the family must soon have sought a home elsewhere and Samuel s good fortune enabled them to take a house in Dagmar Road not far from Grove Lane a new and most respectable house with bay windows rising from the half sunk basement to the second storey Samuel notwithstanding his breadth of mind privately admitted the charm of such an address as Dagmar Road which looks well at the head of note paper and falls with sonority from the lips The Barmby sisters Lucy and Amelia by name were unpretentious young women without personal attractions and soberly educated They professed a form of Dissent their reading was in certain religious and semi religious periodicals rarely in books domestic occupations took up most of their time and they seldom had any engagements At appointed seasons a festivity in connection with the Chapel called them forth it kept them in a flutter for many days and gave them a headache In the strictest sense their life was provincial nominally denizens of London they dwelt as remote from everything metropolitan as though Camberwell were a village of the Midlands If they suffered from discontent no one heard of it a confession by one or the other that she felt dull excited the sister s surprise and invariably led to the suggestion of a little medicine Their brother they regarded with admiration tempered by anxiety Great talents they knew by report were often perilous to the possessor and there was reason to fear that Samuel Bennett Barmby had not resisted all the temptations to which his intellect exposed him At the age of one and twenty he made a startling announcement the Chapel no longer satisfied the needs of his soul and he found himself summoned to join the Church of England as by law established Religious intolerance not being a family characteristic mister Barmby and his daughters though they looked grave over the young man s apostasy admitted his freedom in this matter their respected friend mister Lord belonged to the Church and it could not be thought that so earnest minded a man walked in the way to perdition At the same time Samuel began to exhibit a liking for social pleasures which were it might be hoped innocent but as they kept him from home of evenings gave some ground for uneasiness He had joined a society of young men who met for intellectual debate and his success as an orator fostered the spiritual pride already discernible in him His next step could not be regarded without concern for he became a member of the National Sunday League Deceptive name At first the Miss Barmbys supposed this was a union for safe guarding the Sabbath day it appalled them to discover that the League had quite an opposite tendency that its adherents sallied forth together on Sunday excursions that they received tickets for Sunday admission to picture galleries and in various other ways offended orthodox feeling But again the father and sisters gave patient ear to Samuel s elaborate arguments They became convinced that he had no evil intentions The elder girl having caught up a pregnant phrase in some periodical she approved began to remark that Samuel had a modern mind and this eventually consoled them When it began to be observed that Samuel talked somewhat frequently of Miss Lord the implied suggestion caused a tremor of confused feeling To the Miss Barmbys Nancy seemed an enigmatic person they had tried to like her but could not they objected to her assumption of superiority and were in grave doubt as to her opinions on cardinal points of faith and behaviour Yet when it appeared a possibility that their brother might woo Miss Lord and win her for a wife the girls did their best to see her in a more favourable light Not for a moment did it occur to them that Nancy could regard a proposal from Samuel as anything but an honour to them she might behave slightingly for they were of her own sex and not clever but a girl who prided herself on intellectual attainments must of course look up to Samuel Bennett with reverence In their unworldliness of a truth they were good simple creatures the slight difference of social position seemed unimportant And with Samuel s elevation to a partnership even that one shadowy obstacle was removed Henceforth they would meet Nancy in a conciliatory spirit and if she insisted upon it bow down before her mister Barmby senior whose years drew nigh to three score had a great advantage in point of physical health over his old friend Stephen Lord and his mind enjoyed a placidity which promised him length of days Since the age of seventeen he had plied a pen in the office of a Life Assurance Company where his salary by small and slow increments had grown at length to two hundred and fifty a year Himself a small and slow person he had every reason to be satisfied with this progress and hoped for no further advance He was of eminently sober mind profoundly conscientious and quite devoid of social ambition points of character which explained the long intimacy between him and Stephen Lord Yet one habit he possessed which foreshadowed the intellectual composition of his son he loved to write letters to the newspapers At very long intervals one of these communications achieved the honour of type and then mister Barmby was radiant with modest self approval He never signed such letters with his own name but chose a pseudonym befitting the subject Thus if moved to civic indignation by pieces of orange peel on the pavement he styled himself Urban Rambler if anxious to protest against the overcrowding of bus or railway carriage his signature was Otium cum Dignitate When he took a holiday at the seaside unwonted leisure and novel circumstances prompted him to address local editors at considerable length The preservation of decency by bathers was then his favourite topic and he would sign Pudor or perchance Paterfamilias His public epistles if collected would have made an entertaining and instructive volume so admirably did they represent one phase of the popular mind No sir this sentence frequently occurred it was not thus that our fathers achieved national and civic greatness And again All the feelings of an English parent revolt c Or And now sir where is this to end a phrase applied at one moment to the prospects of religion and morality at another to the multiplication of muffin bells On a Sunday afternoon mister Barmby often read aloud to his daughters and in general his chosen book was Paradise Lost These performances had an indescribable solemnity but it unfortunately happened that as his fervour increased the reader became regardless of aspirates Thus at the culmination of Satanic impiety he would give forth with shaking voice Ail orrors ail and thou profoundest Ell Receive thy new possessor This though it did not distress the girls was painful to Samuel Bennett who had given no little care to the correction of similar lapses in his own speech Samuel conceived himself much ahead of his family Quite uneducated in any legitimate sense of the word he had yet learnt that such a thing as education existed and by dint of busy perusal of penny popularities had even become familiar with names and phrases with modes of thought and of ambition appertaining to a world for ever closed against him He spoke of Culture and imagined himself far on the way to attain it His mind was packed with the oddest jumble of incongruities Herbert Spencer jostled with Charles Bradlaugh Matthew Arnold with Samuel Smiles in one breath he lauded George Eliot in the next was enthusiastic over a novel by missus Henry Wood from puerile facetiae he passed to speculations on the origin of being and with equally light heart Save for Pilgrim s Progress and Robinson Crusoe he had read no English classic since boyhood indeed he had probably read no book at all for much diet of newspapers rendered him all but incapable of sustained attention Whatever he seemed to know of serious authors came to him at second or third hand Avowing his faith in Christianity when with orthodox people in the society of sceptics he permitted himself to smile at the old faiths though he preferred to escape this temptation the Nonconformist conscience still reigning within him At home he posed as a broad minded Anglican and having somewhere read that Tennyson s In Memoriam represented this attitude he spoke of the poem as one of the books that have made me what I am His circle of acquaintances lay apart from that in which the Lords moved it consisted for the most part of young men humbly endowed in the matter of income and making little pretence of social dignity When others resorted to theatre or public house or places not so readily designated Samuel and his friends met together to discourse on subjects of which they knew somewhat less than nothing Some of them occasionally held audacious language especially when topics such as the relations of the sexes invited their wisdom they had read something somewhere which urged them to cast off the trammels of conventional thought they ventured to say that in a very few years surprising changes of opinion would come about These revolutionaries after startling the more sober of their hearers went quietly home to mother or landlady supped on cheese and cocoa and next day plied the cleric pen with exemplary zeal Samuel believed himself in love That he should conceive matrimonial intentions with regard to Stephen Lord s daughter was but the natural issue of circumstance from that conception resulted an amorous mood so much inflamed by Nancy s presence that a young man whose thoughts did not often transgress decorum had every reason to suppose himself her victim When Nancy rejected his formal offer of devotion the desire to wed her besieged him more vigorously Samuel was piqued at the tone of lofty trifling in which the girl answered his proposal for assuredly he esteemed himself no less remarkable a person than he appeared in the eyes of his sisters and his vanity had been encouraged by mister Lord s favour Of his qualities as a man of business there was no doubt in one direction or another he would have struck the road to fortune why Nancy should regard him with condescension and make him feel at once that his suit was hopeless puzzled him for many a day He tried flattery affecting to regard her as his superior in things of the intellect but only with the mortifying result that Miss Lord accepted his humility as quite natural Then he held apart in dignified reserve and found no difficulty in maintaining this attitude until after mister Lord s death Of course he did not let his relatives know of the repulse he had suffered but when speaking to them of what had happened on Jubilee night he made it appear that his estimate of Miss Lord was undergoing modification She has lost him all through her flightiness said the sisters to each other They were not sorry and felt free again to criticise Nancy s ideas of maidenly modesty The provisions of mister Lord s will could not but trouble the intercourse between Grove Lane and Dagmar Road mister Barmby senior undertook with characteristic seriousness the guardianship conferred upon him He had long interviews with Horace and Nancy in which he acquitted himself greatly to his own satisfaction Samuel equally a trustee showed his delicacy by holding aloof save when civility dictated a call upon the young people But his hopes had revived he was quite willing to wait three years for Nancy and it seemed to him more than probable that this period of reflection would bring the young lady to a sense of his merits In the meantime he would pursue with energy the business now at his sole direction and make it far more lucrative than when managed on mister Lord s old fashioned principles As the weeks went on it seemed more clear than at first that Nancy resented the authority held by Samuel and his father They were not welcome at the house in Grove Lane the Miss Barmbys called several times without being admitted though they felt sure that Nancy was at home Under these circumstances it became desirable to discover some intermediary who would keep them acquainted with the details of Nancy s life and of her brother s Such intermediary was at hand in the person of Miss Jessica Morgan CHAPTER two Until of late there had existed a bare acquaintance between Jessica and the Barmby family The two or three hours which she perforce spent in Samuel s company on Jubilee night caused Jessica no little embarrassment as a natural result their meetings after that had a colour of intimacy and it was not long before Miss Morgan and the Miss Barmbys began to see more of each other Nancy on a motive correspondent with that which actuated her guardians desired Jessica s familiarity with the household in Dagmar Road her friend could thus learn and communicate sundry facts of importance else hidden from her in the retirement to which she was now condemned How did the Barmbys regard her behaviour to them Did they in their questioning betray any suspicion fraught with danger Jessica enjoying the possession of a most important secret which she had religiously guarded even from her mother made time to accept the Barmbys invitations pretty frequently and invited the girls to her own home as often as she could afford a little outlay on cakes and preserves It made a salutary distraction in her life As December drew near she exhibited alarming symptoms of over work and but for the romance which assured to her an occasional hour of idleness she must have collapsed before the date of her examination As it was she frightened one of her pupils at the end of a long lesson by falling to the floor and lying there for ten minutes in unconsciousness The warning passed unheeded day and night she toiled at her insuperable tasks at times half frenzied by the strangest lapses of memory and feeling the more she laboured only the more convinced that at the last moment every fact she had acquired would ruthlessly desert her Her place of abode favoured neither health nor mental tranquillity It was one of a row of new houses in a new quarter A year or two ago the site had been an enclosed meadow portion of the land attached to what was once a country mansion London devourer of rural limits of a sudden made hideous encroachment upon the old estate now held by a speculative builder of many streets to be constructed three or four had already come into being and others were mapped out in mud and inchoate masonry athwart the ravaged field Great elms the pride of generations passed away fell before the speculative axe or were left standing in mournful isolation to please a speculative architect bits of wayside hedge still shivered in fog and wind amid hoardings variegated with placards and scaffolding black against the sky The very earth had lost its wholesome odour trampled into mire fouled with builders refuse and the noisome drift from adjacent streets it sent forth under the sooty rain a smell of corruption of all the town s uncleanliness On this rising locality had been bestowed the title of Park missus Morgan was decided in her choice of a dwelling here by the euphonious address Merton Avenue Something or other Park The old mansion not very old and far from beautiful but stoutly built stood grim and desolate long dismantled and waiting only to be torn down for the behoof of speculative dealers in old material What aforetime was a tree bordered drive now curved between dead stumps a mere slushy cartway the stone pillars which had marked the entrance damaged in the rending away of metal with a market value drooped sideways ready at a touch to bury themselves in slime Through summer months the Morgans had suffered sufficiently from the defects of their house with the coming on of winter they found themselves exposed to miseries barely endurable At the first slight frost cistern and water pipes went to ruin already so damp that unlovely vegetation had cropped up on cellar walls the edifice was now drenched with torrents of water Plaster fell from the ceilings paper peeled away down the staircase stuccoed portions of the front began to crack and moulder Not a door that would close as a door should not a window that would open in the way expected of it not a fireplace but discharged its smoke into the room rather than by the approved channel Everywhere piercing draughts which often entered by orifices unexplained and unexplainable From cellar floor to chimney pot no square inch of honest or trustworthy workmanship So thin were the parti walls that conversation not only might but must be distinctly heard from room to room and from house to house the Morgans learnt to subdue their voices lest all they said should become common property of the neighbourhood For the privilege of occupying such a residence the interior said advertisement handsomely decorated they were racked with an expenditure which away in the sweet scented country would have housed them amid garden graces and orchard fruitfulness At this time mister Morgan had joined an acquaintance in the establishment of a debt collecting agency his partner provided the modest capital needful for such an enterprise and upon himself fell the disagreeable work A man of mild temper and humane instincts he spent his day in hunting people who would not or could not pay the money they owed straining his wits to circumvent the fraudulent and swooping relentlessly upon the victims of misfortune The occupation revolted him but at present he saw no other way of supporting the genteel appearances which he knew not why were indispensable to his life He subsisted like a bird of prey he was ever on the look out for carrion which the law permitted him to seize From the point of view forced upon him society became a mere system of legalised rapine You are in debt behold the bond Behold too my authority for squeezing out of you the uttermost farthing You must beg or starve I deplore it but I for my part have a genteel family to maintain on what I rend from your grip He set his forehead against shame he stooped to the basest chicanery he exposed himself to insult to curses to threats of violence Sometimes a whole day of inconceivably sordid toil resulted in the pouching of a few pence sometimes his reward was a substantial sum He knew himself despised by many of the creditors who employed him Bad debts For how much will you sell them to me And as often as not he took away with his bargain a glance which was equivalent to a kick The genteel family knew nothing of these expedients missus Morgan talked dolorously to her friends of commercial depression and gave it to be vaguely understood that her husband had suffered great losses because he conducted his affairs in the spirit of a gentleman Her son was in an office her elder daughter was attempting the art of fiction which did not promise to be lucrative Jessica more highly educated would shortly matriculate at the University of London a consoling prospect but involving the payment of a fee that could with difficulty be afforded Every friend of the family held it a matter of course that Jessica would succeed in the examination It seemed probable that she would have a place in Honours And meanwhile the poor girl herself was repenting of the indiscreet boastfulness with which she had made known her purpose To come out in an inferior class would be painful enough how support the possibility of absolute failure Yet she knew only too well that in certain subjects she was worse than shaky Her Greek her Chemistry her Algebra By way of propitiating the stern fates she began to talk with Lucy and Amelia Barmby in a tone of diffidence Half a year ago she would have held her head very high in such company now the simple goodness of the old fashioned girls made an appeal to her aching heart and their homely talk soothed her exhausted brain It s fearfully difficult she said to them one evening as she sat in their parlour And I lose so much time with my pupils Really you know I haven t a fair chance I was showing Nancy Lord the Algebra paper set last summer and she confessed she could hardly do a single question She couldn t exclaimed one of the sisters in astonishment But we always thought she was so very clever So she is in many things But she never dreamt of going in for such an examination as this And do you really know more than she does Jessica smiled with affected modesty Oh I have studied so much more It was sweet to gain this triumph over her friend whose progress in the school of life she watched with the jealousy of a girl condemned to sterile passions Their talk was interrupted by the entrance of Samuel Barmby and his elder sister addressing him without reflection said wonderingly Sam did you know that Nancy Lord couldn t pass the examination that Miss Morgan is going in for Jessica blushed and hastened to extenuate this crude statement Oh I didn t say that Only that she would have to study very hard if she went in for the matriculation Of course she would Samuel assented largely as he took his stand before the fireplace and beamed upon the female trio Miss Lord goes in for broad culture that s quite a different thing from studying for examinations To the hearers Jessica not excepted this seemed to argue the spirit of broad culture in Samuel himself Miss Morgan pursued nervously Examinations are nothing I believe very stupid people often do well in them and clever people often fail Her voice sank on the last word and she tried to read Barmby s face without meeting his look Of late a change had come about in her estimation of Samuel Formerly she spoke of him with contemptuous amusement in the tone set by Nancy since she had become a friend of the family his sisters profound respect had influenced her way of thinking and in secret she was disposed rather to admire the Prophet He had always struck her as a comely man and her education notwithstanding she never perceived in his remarks that downright imbecility which excited Nancy s derision On Jubilee night he was anything but a tedious companion apart from her critical friend Jessica had listened without impatience to his jests his instructive facts his flowing rhetoric Now a days in her enfeebled state of body and mind she began to look forward with distinct pleasure to her occasional meetings with Samuel pleasure which perhaps was enhanced by the air of condescension wherewith he tempered his courtesy Morbid miseries brought out the frailty of her character Desiring to be highly esteemed by mister Barmby she found herself no less willing to join his sisters in a chorus of humbly feminine admiration when he discoursed to them from an altitude At moments after gazing upon his eloquent countenance she was beset by strange impulses which brought blood to her cheek and made her dread the Miss Barmbys scrutiny I look upon examinations Samuel was saying as a professional matter I never went in for them myself simply because I I turned my energies in another direction You could have passed them remarked one of his sisters easily enough In Miss Morgan s presence he stroked his chin and smiled with delicious fatuity I prefer to say nothing on that point Oh but of course you could mister Barmby sounded Jessica s voice in an unsteady falsetto whilst her eyes were turned upon the floor You would have thought nothing of this matriculation which seems to me so dreadful Profoundly flattered Samuel addressed the girl in his suavest tones I have a theory Miss Morgan that young ladies ought not to undergo these ordeals The delicacy of their nervous system unfits them for such a strain I m sure we shall all feel very glad when you are successfully through the trial After it you ought to have a long rest Oh you ought indeed you ought assented the girls By the bye said Samuel my father has heard from Miss Lord that she is going away for a month or two She says her health requires it Jessica sat silent still with downcast eyes But it s a new thing isn t it remarked Amelia for Miss Lord to be in bad health She has suffered a good deal I m afraid said Jessica since her father s death The doctor tells her she oughtn t to live in that dull house through the winter In that case Samuel exclaimed of course she must go at once of course He never spoke of Nancy but with stress of unctuous generosity This if his hearers knew what he had suffered at her hands must tell greatly to his credit if they were not aware of the circumstances such a tone would become him as the young lady s hopeful admirer I fear her nerves are affected pursued Jessica She can t bear society So unlike her isn t it She goes out very little indeed sometimes not for days together And really she sees nobody I m getting quite anxious about her The subject was an awkward one in this house and it soon gave place to freer conversation On her way home though mechanically repeating dates and formulae Jessica could not resist the tendency of her thoughts to dwell on Samuel s features and Samuel s eloquence This was a new danger she had now little more than a fortnight for her final cram and any serious distraction meant ruin In a day or two she took leave of Nancy who had chosen for her winter retreat no less remote a spot than Falmouth Horace having settled himself in lodgings the house was to be shut up Mary Woodruff of course went down into Cornwall Nancy had written a letter to mister Barmby senior excusing herself for not being able to see him before her departure it was an amiable letter but contained frank avowal of pain and discontent at the prospect of her long pupilage Of course I submit to the burden my father chose to lay upon me and before long I hope I shall be able to take things in a better spirit All I ask of you dear mister Barmby is to have forbearance with me until I get back my health and feel more cheerful You know that I could not be in better hands whilst Mary is with me I shall write frequently and give you an account of myself Let me hear sometimes and show me that you make allowance for my very trying position Jessica heard the letter discussed by its recipient and his family Samuel spoke with his wonted magnanimity his father took a liberal view of the matter And in writing to her friend a few days later Jessica was able to say I think you may safely stay at Falmouth for the whole winter You will not be interfered with if you write nicely I shouldn t wonder if they would let you keep out of their reach as long as it is necessary The week of Jessica s ordeal was now at hand She had had another fainting fit her sleep was broken every night with hideous dreams she ate scarce enough to keep herself alive a perpetual fever parched her throat and burned at her temples On the last day of cram she sat from morning to night in her comfortless little bedroom bending over the smoky fire reading desperately through a pile of note books The motive of vanity no longer supported her gladly she would have crept away into a life of insignificance but the fee for the examination was paid and she must face the terrors the shame that waited her at Burlington House No hope of passing Perhaps at the last moment a stroke of mortal illness would come to her relief Not so She found herself in the ghastly torture hall at a desk on which lay sheets of paper not whiter than her face Somebody gave her a scroll stereotyped in imitation of manuscript the questions to be answered For a quarter of an hour she could not understand a word She saw the face of Samuel Barmby and heard his tones The delicacy of a young lady s nervous system unfits her for such a strain That evening she went home with a half formed intention of poisoning herself But the morrow saw her seated again before another scroll of stereotype still thinking of Samuel Barmby still hearing his voice The man was grown hateful to her he seemed to haunt her brain malignantly and to paralyse her hand Day after day in the room of torture until all was done Then upon her long despair followed a wild unreasoning hope Though it rained she walked all the way home singing chattering to herself and reached the house door without consciousness of the distance she had traversed Her mother and sister came out into the hall they had been watching for her I did a good paper to day I think I ve passed after all yes I feel sure I ve passed You look dreadful exclaimed missus Morgan And you re wet through I did a good paper to day I feel sure I ve passed She sat down to a meal but could not swallow I feel sure I ve passed I feel sure And she fell from the chair to all appearances stone dead They took her upstairs undressed her sent for the doctor When he came she had been lying for half an hour conscious but mute She looked gravely at him and said as if repeating a lesson The delicacy of a young lady s nervous system unfits her for such a strain Undoubtedly repeated the doctor with equal gravity But she added eagerly let mister Barmby know at once that I have passed He shall know at once said the doctor CHAPTER three A lady who lived at Kilburn and entertained largely in a house not designed for large entertainment was at home this evening At eleven o clock the two drawing rooms contained as many people as could sit and stand with semblance of comfort around the hostess on the landing pressed a crowd which grew constantly thicker by affluence from the staircase In the hall below a Hungarian band discoursed very loud music Among recent arrivals appeared a troupe of nigger minstrels engaged to give their exhilarating entertainment if space could be found for them Bursts of laughter from the dining room announced the success of an American joker who in return for a substantial cheque provided amusement in fashionable gatherings A brilliant scene The air which encouraged perspiration was rich with many odours voices endeavouring to make themselves audible in colloquy swelled to a tumultuous volume that vied with the Hungarian clangours In a corner of the staircase squeezed behind two very fat women in very low dresses stood Horace Lord His heated countenance wore a look of fretful impatience he kept rising upon his toes in an endeavour to distinguish faces down in the hall At length his expression changed and with eager eyes he began to force a way for himself between the fat women Not unrewarded with glaring glances and even with severe remarks he succeeded in gaining the foot of the staircase and came within reach of the persons for whom he had been waiting These were missus Damerel and Fanny French The elder lady exhibited a toilet of opulence corresponding with her mature charms the younger as became a debutante wore graceful white symbol of her maiden modesty You promised to be early said Horace addressing missus Damerel but regarding Fanny who stood in conversation with a florid man of uncertain age Couldn t get here before my dear boy Surely you haven t brought that fellow with you Hush You mustn t talk in that way We met at the door missus Dane knows him What does it matter Horace moved aside to Fanny Flushed with excitement her hair adorned with flowers she looked very pretty Come along he said gripping her hand more violently than he intended Let us get upstairs Oh you hurt me Don t be so silly The man beside her gave Horace a friendly nod His name was Mankelow Horace had met him once or twice of late at missus Damerel s but did not like him and felt still less disposed to do so now that Mankelow was acquainted with Fanny French He suspected that the two were more familiar than Fanny pretended With little ceremony he interposed himself between the girl and this possible rival Why didn t you make her come earlier he said to Fanny as they began a slow upward struggle in the rear of missus Damerel It isn t fashionable to come early Nonsense Look at the people here already Fanny threw up her chin and glanced back to see that Mankelow was following In his vexation Horace was seized with a cough a cough several times repeated before he could check it Your cold s no better said Fanny You oughtn t to have come out at night It is better he replied sharply That s the first time I ve coughed to day Do you mean you would rather not have found me here How silly you are People will hear what you re saying It was Fanny s first season but not her first at home missus Damerel seemed to be taking an affectionate interest in her and had introduced her to several people Horace gratified in the beginning now suffered from jealousy it tortured him to observe Fanny when she talked with men That her breeding was defective mattered nothing in this composite world of pseudo elegance Young Lord who did not lack native intelligence understood by this time that missus Damerel and her friends were far from belonging to a high order of society he saw vulgarity rampant in every drawing room to which he was admitted and occasionally heard things which startled his suburban prejudices But Fanny in her wild enjoyment of these novel splendours appeared to lose all self control She flirted outrageously and before his very eyes If he reproached her she laughed at him if he threatened to free himself she returned a look which impudently bade him try Horace had all her faults by heart and no longer tried to think that he respected her or that if he married such a girl his life could possibly be a happy one but she still played upon his passions and at her beck he followed like a dog The hostess missus Dane a woman who looked as if she had once been superior to the kind of life she now led welcomed him with peculiar warmth and in a quick confidential voice bade him keep near her for a few minutes There s some one I want to introduce you to some one I m sure you will like to know Obeying her he soon lost sight of Fanny but missus Dane continued to talk at intervals in such a flattering tone that his turbid emotions were soothed He had heard of the Chittles No They were very old friends of hers said missus Dane and she particularly wanted him to know them Ah here they came mother and daughter Horace observed them missus Chittle was a frail worn nervous woman who must once have been comely her daughter a girl of two and twenty had a pale thin face of much sweetness and gentleness They seemed by no means at home in this company but missus Chittle when she conversed assumed a vivacious air the daughter trying to follow her example strove vainly against an excessive bashfulness and seldom raised her eyes Why he should be expected to pay special attention to these people Horace was at a loss to understand but missus Chittle attached herself to him and soon led him into familiar dialogue He learnt from her that they had lived for two or three years in a very quiet country place they had come up for the season but did not know many people She spoke of her daughter who stood just out of earshot her eyes cast down on her face a sad fixed smile and said that it had been necessary almost to force her into society She loves the country and is so fond of books but at her age it s really a shame to live like a nun don t you think so mister Lord Decidedly it was said Horace I m doing my best pursued missus Chittle to cure her of her shyness She is really afraid of people and it s such a pity She says that the things people talk about don t interest her but all people are not frivolous are they mister Lord Horace hoped not and presently out of mere good nature he tried to converse with the young lady in a way that should neither alarm her shyness nor prove distasteful to her intelligence But with very little success From time to time the girl glanced at him with strange timidity yet seemed quite willing to listen as long as he chose to talk Fanny being at a considerable distance from home was to return to the boarding house where her chaperon now lived and have a room there for the night Horace disliked this arrangement for the objectionable Mankelow lived in the same house When he was able to get speech with Fanny he tried to persuade her to go with him all the way home to Camberwell in a cab Miss French would not listen to the suggestion Who ever heard of such a thing It wouldn t be proper Proper Oh I like that he replied with scathing irony You can either like it or not missus Damerel wouldn t dream of allowing it I think she s quite as good a judge of propriety as you are They were in a corner of the dining room Fanny having supped much to her satisfaction had a high colour and treated her lover with more than usual insolence Horace had eaten little but had not refrained from beverages he was disposed to assert himself It seems to me that we ought to have an understanding You never do as I wish in a single thing What do you mean by it Oh if you re going to be nasty She made the gesture of a servant girl who quarrels with her young man at the street corner I can t stand the kind of treatment you ve given me lately said Horace with muffled anger I ve told you I shall do just as I like Very well That s as much as to say that you care nothing about me I m not going to be the slave of a girl who has no sense of honour not even of decency If you wish me to speak to you again you must speak first And he left her Fanny laughing scornfully It drew towards one o clock when having exhausted the delights of the evening and being in a decidedly limp condition missus Damerel and her protegee drove home Fanny said nothing of what had passed between her and Horace The elder lady after keeping silence for half the drive spoke at length in a tone of indulgent playfulness So you talked a good deal with mister Mankelow Not for long Now and then He took me down to supper the first time I m afraid somebody will be a little jealous I shall get into trouble I didn t foresee this Somebody must treat me in a reasonable way Fanny answered with a dry laugh I m quite sure he will said missus Damerel suavely But I feel myself a little responsible you know Let me put you on your guard against mister Mankelow I m afraid he s rather a dangerous man I have heard rather alarming stories about him You see he s very rich and very rich men if they re rather handsome as well say and do things you understand Is he really very rich Well several thousands a year and a prospect of more when relatives die I don t mean to say that he is a bad man He belongs to a very good family and I believe him perfectly honourable He would never do any one any harm or if he happened to without meaning it I m quite sure he d repair it in the honourable way You said he was dangerous To a young lady who is already engaged Confess that you think him rather good looking Having inflamed the girl s imagination missus Damerel presently dropped the subject and fell again into weary silence At noon of the next day she received a call from Horace who found her over tea and toast in her private sitting room The young man looked bilious he coughed too and said that he must have caught fresh cold last night That house was like an oven I won t go to any more such places That isn t my idea of enjoying myself missus Damerel examined him with affectionate solicitude and reflected before speaking Haven t you been living rather fast lately He avoided her eyes Not at all Quite sure How much money have you spent this last month Not much By careful interrogation the caressing notes of her voice seemed to convey genuine feeling missus Damerel elicited the fact that he had spent not less than fifty pounds in a few weeks She looked very grave What would our little Fanny say to this I don t care what she would say And he unburdened himself of his complaints against the frivolous charmer missus Damerel listening with a compassionate smile I m afraid it s all too true dear boy But didn t I warn you You have made her worse And I more than half believe you have purposely put her in the way of that fellow Mankelow Now I tell you plainly his voice quivered if I lose her I ll raise all the money I can and play the very devil Hush no naughty words Let us talk about something else till you are quieter What did you think of missus Chittle I thought nothing of her good or bad Of her daughter then Isn t she a sweet quiet girl Do you know that she is rich It s perfectly true missus Chittle is the widow of a man who made a big fortune out of a kind of imitation velvet It sold only for a few years then something else drove it out of the market but the money was made I know all about it from missus Dane It s nothing to me said Horace peevishly But missus Damerel continued The poor girl has been very unfortunate In the last year of her father s life they lived in good style town house and country house And she fell in love with somebody who who treated her badly broke it off in fact just before the wedding She had a bad illness and since then she has lived as her mother told you How do you know she told me I oh I took it for granted She said you had had a long talk You can see of course that they re not ordinary people Didn t Winifred her name is Winifred strike you as very refined and lady like She hardly spoke half a dozen words That s her nervousness She has quite got out of the habit of society But she s very clever and so good I want you to see more of her If she comes here to tea will you just to please me look in for half an hour She bent her head aside wistfully Horace vouchsafed no reply Dear boy I know very well what a disappointment you are suffering Why not be quite open with me Though I m only a tiresome old aunt I feel every bit as anxious for your happiness as if I were your mother I do indeed Horace You believe me don t you You have been very kind in many ways But you ve done harm to Fanny No harm whatever Horace believe me I have only given her an opportunity of showing what she really is You see now that she thinks of nothing at all but money and selfish pleasures Compare her my dear with such a girl as Winifred Chittle I only mean just to show you the difference between a lady and such a girl as Fanny She has treated you abominably my poor boy And what would she bring you Not that I wish you to marry for money I have seen too much of the world to be so foolish so wicked But when there are sweet clever lady like girls with large incomes And a handsome boy like you You may blush but there s no harm in telling the truth You are far too modest You don t know how you look in the eyes of an affectionate thoughtful girl like Winifred for instance It s dreadful to think of you throwing yourself away My dear it may sound shocking to you but Fanny French isn t the sort of girl that men marry Horace showed himself startled You are so young pursued the mature lady with an indulgent smile You need the advice of some one who knows the world In years to come you will feel very grateful to me Now don t let us talk any more of that just now but tell me something about Nancy How much longer does she mean to stay in Cornwall He answered absently She talks of another month or two But what have her guardians to say to that Why she has been away for nearly half a year How can that be called living at the old house It s no business of mine Nor of mine you mean to say Still it does seem rather strange I suppose she is quite to be trusted Trusted What harm can come to her She s keeping out of Sam Barmby s way that s all I believe he plagued her to marry him A nice husband for Nancy I wish we had taken to each other said missus Damerel musingly I think she was a little jealous of the attention I had paid to you But perhaps we shall do better some day And I m quite content so long as you care a little for me dear boy You ll never give me up will you It was asked with unusual show of feeling she leaned forward her eyes fixed tenderly upon the boy s face You would never let a Fanny French come between us Horace dear I only wish you hadn t brought her among your friends Some day you will be glad of what I did Whatever happens I am your best friend the best and truest friend you will ever have You will know it some day The voice impressed Horace its emotion was so true Several times through the day he recalled and thought of it As yet he had felt nothing like affection for missus Damerel but before their next meeting an impulse he did not try to account for caused him to write her a letter simply to assure her that he was not ungrateful for her kindness The reply that came in a few hours surprised and touched him for it repeated in yet warmer words all she had spoken Let me be in the place of a mother to you dear Horace Think of me as if I were your mother If I were your mother indeed I could not love you more He mused over this and received from it a sense of comfort which was quite new to him All through the winter he had been living as a gentleman of assured independence This was managed very simply Acting on missus Damerel s counsel he insured his life and straightaway used the policy as security for a loan of five hundred pounds from a friend of missus Damerel s The insurance itself was not effected without a disagreeable little episode As a result of the medical examination Horace learnt greatly to his surprise that he would have to pay a premium somewhat higher than the ordinary Unpleasant questions were asked Was he quite sure that he knew of no case of consumption in his family Quite sure he answered stoutly and sincerely Why Did the doctor think him consumptive Oh dear no but a slight constitutional weakness In fine the higher premium must be exacted He paid it with the indifference of his years but said nothing to missus Damerel And thereupon began the sowing of wild oats At two and twenty after domestic restraint and occupations that he detested he was let loose upon life Five hundred pounds seemed to him practically inexhaustible He did not wish to indulge in great extravagance merely to see and to taste the world Ah the rapture of those first nights when he revelled amid the tumult of London pursuing joy with a pocket full of sovereigns Theatres music halls restaurants and public houses he had seen so little of these things that they excited him as they do a lad fresh from the country He drew the line nowhere Love of a worthy woman tells for chastity even in the young and the sensual love of a Fanny French merely debauches the mind and inflames the passions Secure in his paganism Horace followed where the lures of London beckoned him he knew not reproach of conscience shame offered but thin resistance to his boiling blood By a miracle he had as yet escaped worse damage to health than a severe cold caught one night after heroic drinking That laid him by the heels for a time and the cough still clung to him In less than two years he would command seven thousand pounds and a share in the business now conducted by Samuel Barmby What need to stint himself whilst he felt able to enjoy life If Fanny deceived him were there not after all other and better Fannys to be won by his money For it was a result of this girl s worthlessness that Horace in most things so ingenuous had come to regard women with unconscious cynicism He did not think he could be loved for his own sake but he believed that at any time the show of love perhaps its ultimate sincerity might be won by display of cash Midway in the month of May he again caught a severe cold and was confined to the house for nearly three weeks missus Damerel who nursed him well and tenderly proposed that he should go down for change of air to Falmouth He wrote to Nancy asking whether she would care to see him A prompt reply informed him that his sister was on the point of returning to London so that he had better choose some nearer seaside resort He went to Hastings for a few days but wearied of the place and came back to his London excitements Nancy however had not yet returned nor did she until the beginning of July CHAPTER four This winter saw the establishment of the South London Fashionable Dress Supply Association the name finally selected by Beatrice French and her advisers It was an undertaking shrewdly conceived skilfully planned and energetically set going Beatrice knew the public to which her advertisements appealed she understood exactly the baits that would prove irresistible to its folly and greed In respect that it was a public of average mortals it would believe that business might be conducted to the sole advantage of the customer In respect that it consisted of women it would give eager attention to a scheme that permitted each customer to spend her money and yet to have it In respect that it consisted of ignorant and pretentious women this public could be counted upon to deceive itself in the service of its own vanity and maintain against all opposition that the garments obtained on this soothing system were supremely good and fashionable On a basis of assumptions such as these there was every possibility of profitable commerce without any approach to technical fraud By means of the familiar goose club licensed victuallers make themselves the bankers of people who are too weak minded to save their own money until they wish to spend it and who are quite content to receive in ultimate return goods worth something less than half the deposit By means of the familiar teapot grocers persuade their customers that an excellent trade can be done by giving away the whole profit on each transaction Beatrice French an observant young woman with a head for figures had often noted and reflected upon these two egregious illustrations of human absurdity Her dressmaking enterprise assimilated the features of both and added novel devices that sprang from her own fruitful brain The Fashion Club a wheel within a wheel was merely the goose club strictly a goose club for the licensed victualler addresses himself to the male of the species The larger net cast for those who lacked money or a spirit of speculation caught all who in the realm of grocery are lured by the teapot Every sovereign spent with the Association carried a bonus paid not in cash but in kind These startling advantages were made known through the medium of hand bills leaflets nicely printed little pamphlets gorgeously designed placards the publicity department being in the hands of mister Luckworth Crewe of Farringdon Street was most ably and vigorously conducted Thanks also to Luckworth Crewe Beatrice had allied herself with partners who brought to the affair capital experience and activity Before Christmas an important point the scene of operations was ready a handsome shop with the new and attractive appendages so called club room refreshment bar c which Crewe and Beatrice had visioned in their prophetic minds Before the close of the year substantial business had been done and eighteen eighty eight opened with exhilarating prospects The ineptitude of uneducated English women in all that relates to their attire is a fact that it boots not to enlarge upon Beatrice French could not be regarded as an exception for though she recognised monstrosities she very reasonably distrusted her own taste in the choice of a garment For her sisters monstrosities had a distinct charm and to this class of women belonged all customers of the Association who pretended to think for themselves as to wherewithal they should be clothed But women in general came to the shop with confessed blankness of mind beyond the desire to buy something that was modish and to pay for it in a minus quantity they knew felt thought nothing whatever Green or violet cerulean or magenta all was one to them In the matter of shape they sought merely a confident assurance from articulate man or woman themselves being somewhat less articulate than jay or jackdaw that this or that was the feature of the season They could not distinguish between a becoming garment and one that called for the consuming fires of Heaven It is often assumed as a commonplace that women whatever else they cannot do may be trusted to make up their minds about habiliments Nothing more false as Beatrice French was abundantly aware A very large proportion of the servant keeping females in Brixton Camberwell and Peckham could not with any confidence buy a chemise or a pair of stockings and when it came to garments visible they were lost indeed Fanny French began to regret that she had not realised her capital and put it into the Association Wishing at length to do so she met with a scornful rebuff Beatrice would have none of her money but told her she might use the shop like any other customer which of course Fanny did missus Peachey meanwhile kept declaring to both her sisters that they must not expect to live henceforth in De Crespigny Park on the old nominal terms Beatrice was on the way to wealth Fanny moved in West End society under the chaperonage of a rich woman they ought to be ashamed of themselves for not volunteering handsome recognition of the benefits they had received beneath their sister s roof But neither Beatrice nor Fanny appeared to see the matter in this light The truth was that they both had in view a change of domicile The elder desired more comfort and more independence than De Crespigny Park could afford her the younger desired a great many things and flattered herself that a very simple step would put her in possession of them The master of the house no longer took any interest in the fortunes of his sisters in law He would not bid them depart he would not bid them stay least of all would he demand money from them Of money he had no need and he was the hapless possessor of a characteristic not to be found in any other member of his household natural delicacy Arthur Peachey lived only for his child the little boy whose newly prattling tongue made the sole welcome he expected or cared for on his return from a hard day s work Happily the child had good health but he never left home without dread of perils that might befall it in his absence On the mother he counted not at all a good tempered cow might with more confidence have been set to watch over the little one s safety The nurse girl Emma retained in spite of her mistress s malice still seemed to discharge her duties faithfully but being mortal she demanded intervals of leisure from time to time and at such seasons as Peachey too well knew the child was uncared for Had his heart been resolute as it was tender he would long ago have carried out a project which haunted him at every moment of anger or fear In the town of Canterbury lived a sister of his who for several years had been happily wedded but remained childless If the worst came to the worst if his wife compelled him to the breaking up of a home which was no home this married sister would gladly take the little boy into her motherly care He had never dared to propose the step but Ada might perchance give ready assent to it even now For motherhood she had no single qualification but the physical Before her child s coming into the world she snarled at the restraints it imposed upon her at its birth she clamoured against nature for the pains she had to undergo and hated her husband because he was the intermediate cause of them The helpless infant gave her no pleasure touched no emotion in her heart save when she saw it in the nurse s care and received female compliments upon its beauty She rejected it at night because it broke her sleep in the day because she could not handle it without making it cry When Peachey remonstrated with her she stared in insolent surprise and wished that he had had to suffer all her hardships of the past year Peachey could not be said to have any leisure On returning from business he was involved forthwith in domestic troubles and broils which consumed the dreary evening and invaded even his sleep Thus it happened that at long intervals he was tempted instead of going home to dinner to spend a couple of hours at a certain small eating house a resort of his bachelor days where he could read the newspapers have a well cooked chop in quietude and afterwards if acquaintances were here play a game of chess Of course he had to shield this modest dissipation with a flat falsehood alleging to his wife that business had kept him late Thus on an evening of June when the soft air and the mellow sunlight overcame him with a longing for rest he despatched a telegram to De Crespigny Park and strolled quietly about the streets until the hour and his appetite pointed him tablewards The pity of it was that he could not dismiss anxieties he loathed the coward falsehood and thought more of home than of his present freedom But at least Ada s tongue was silent He seated himself in the familiar corner and turned over illustrated papers whilst his chop hissed on the grid Ah if he were but unmarried what a life he might make for himself now that the day s labour brought its ample reward He would have rooms in London and a still clean lodging somewhere among the lanes and fields His ideals expressed the homeliness of the man On intellect he could not pride himself his education had been but of the commercial order he liked to meditate rather than to read questions of the day concerned him not at all A weak man but of clean and kindly instincts In mercantile life he had succeeded by virtue of his intensely methodical habits the characteristic which made him suffer so from his wife s indolence incapacity and vicious ill humour Before his marriage he had thought of women as domestic beings A wife was the genius of home He knew men who thanked their wives for all the prosperity and content that they enjoyed Others he knew who told quite a different tale but these surely were sorrowful exceptions Nowadays he saw the matter in a light of fuller experience In his rank of life married happiness was a rare thing and the fault could generally be traced to wives who had no sense of responsibility no understanding of household duties no love of simple pleasures no religion Yes there was the point no religion Ada had grown up to regard church going as a sign of respectability but without a shadow of religious faith Her incredible ignorance of the Bible story of Christian dogmas often amazed him Himself a believer though careless in the practice of forms he was not disturbed by the modern tendency to look for morals apart from faith he had not the trouble of reflecting that an ignorant woman is the last creature to be moralised by anything but the Christian code he saw straight into the fact that there was no hope of impressing Ada with ideas of goodness truthfulness purity simply because she recognised no moral authority For such minds no moral authority merely as a moral authority is or can be valid Such natures are ruled only by superstition the representative of reasoned faith in nobler beings Rob them of their superstition and they perish amid all uncleanliness Thou shalt not lie for God consumes a liar in the flames of hell Ada Peachey could lend ear to no admonition short of that And living when she did bred as she was only a John Knox could have impressed her with this menace to be forgotten when the echoes of his voice had failed He did not enjoy his chop this evening In the game of chess that followed he played idly with absent thoughts And before the glow of sunset had died from the calm heaven he set out to walk homeward anxious melancholy On approaching the house he suffered as always from quickened pulse and heart constricted with fear Until he knew that all was well he looked like a man who anticipates dread calamity This evening on opening the door he fell back terror stricken In the hall stood a police constable surrounded by a group of women missus Peachey her sisters Emma the nurse girl and two other servants Oh here you are at last exclaimed his wife in a voice exhausted with rage You re just in time to see this beast taken off to the lock up Perhaps you ll believe me now What is it What has she done Stolen money that s what she s done your precious Emma She s been at it for a long time I ve told you some one was robbing me So I marked some coins in my purse and left it in the bedroom whilst we were at dinner and then when I found half a crown gone and it was her evening out too I sent for a policeman before she knew anything and we made her turn out her pockets And there s the half crown Perhaps you ll believe it this time The girl s face declared her guilt she had hardly attempted denial Then with a clamour of furious verbosity Ada enlightened her husband on other points of Emma s behaviour It was a long story gathered in the last few minutes partly from the culprit herself partly from her fellow servants Emma had got into the clutches of a jewellery tallyman one of the fellows who sell trinkets to servant girls on the pay by instalment system She had made several purchases of gewgaws and had already paid three or four times their value but was still in debt to the tallyman who threatened all manner of impossible proceedings if she did not make up her arrears Bottomless ignorance and imbecile vanity had been the girl s ruin aided by a grave indiscretion on Peachey s part of which he was to hear presently Some one must go to the police station and make a formal charge Ada would undertake this duty with pious eagerness enjoying it all the more because of loud wailings and entreaties which the girl now addressed to her master Peachey looked at his sisters in law and in neither face perceived a compassionate softening Fanny stood by as at a spectacle provided for her amusement without rancour but equally without pity Beatrice was contemptuous What right said her countenance had a servant girl to covet jewellery And how pitiable the spirit that prompted to a filching of half crowns For the criminals of finance who devastate a thousand homes Miss French had no small admiration crimes such as the present were mean and dirty Ada reappeared hurriedly clad for going forth but no one had fetched a cab Incensed she ordered her husband to do so Who are you speaking to he replied wrathfully I am not your servant Fanny laughed The policeman professionally calm averted a smiling face It s nothing to me said missus Peachey I m quite willing to walk Come along constable Her husband interposed The girl doesn t go from my house until she s properly dressed He turned to the other servants Please to blow the whistle at the door or get a cab somehow Emma go upstairs and put your things on It was about time you behaved like a man fell quietly from Beatrice You re right He looked sternly at the speaker It is time and that you shall all know The culprit suddenly silent obeyed his order The constable went out at the front door and there waited whilst a cab summoning whistle shrilled along De Crespigny Park Ada had ascended to the first landing to make sure that the culprit did not escape her Beatrice and Fanny retired into the drawing room After a lapse of some ten minutes two cabs rattled up to the door from opposite directions each driver lashing his horse to gain the advantage So nearly were they matched that with difficulty the vehicles avoided a collision The man who had secured a place immediately in front of the doorsteps waved his whip and uttered a shout of insulting triumph his rival answered with volleys of abuse and drove round as if meditating an assault it was necessary for the policeman to interfere Whereupon the defeated competitor vowed that it was sanguinary hard lines that for the sanguinary whole of this sanguinary day had he waited vainly for a sanguinary fare and but for a sanguinary stumble of his sanguinary horse Tired of waiting and suspicious of the delay Ada went up to the room where the servant was supposed to be making ready It was a little room which served as night nursery by the girl s bed stood a cot occupied by the child Ada exclaiming Now come along opened the door violently A candle was burning the boy awake but silent sat up in his cot and looked about with sleepy yet frightened eyes Where are you Emma could not be seen Astonished and enraged Ada rushed forward she found the girl lying on the floor and after bending over her started back with a cry half of alarm half of disgust Come up here at once she screamed down the staircase Come up The wretch has cut her throat There was a rush of feet Peachey the first to enter saw a gash on the neck of the insensible girl in her hand she held a pair of scissors I hope you re satisfied he said to his wife The police officer animated by a brisk succession of events such as he could not hope for every day raised the prostrate figure and speedily announced that the wound was not mortal She s fainted that s all Tried to do for herself with them scissors and didn t know the way to go about it We ll get her off sharp to the surgeon It ll be attempted suicide now as well as stealing cried Ada Terrified by the crowd of noisy people the child began to cry loudly Peachey lifted him out of the cot wrapped a blanket about him and carried him down to his own bedroom There heedless of what was going on above he tried to soothe the little fellow lavishing caresses and tender words My little boy will be good He ll wait here quietly till father comes back Only a few minutes and father will come back and sit by him Yes he shall sleep here all night Ada burst into the room I should think you d better go and look after your dear Emma As if I didn t know what s been going on It s all come out so you needn t tell me any lies You ve been giving her money The other servants knew of it she confessed it herself Oh you re a nice sort of man you are Men of your sort are always good at preaching to other people You ve given her money what does that mean I suspected it all along You wouldn t have her sent away oh no She was so good to the child and so good to somebody else A dirty servant I d choose some one better than that if I was a man How much has she cost you As much no doubt as one of the swell women in Piccadilly Circus Peachey turned upon her the sweat beading on his ghastly face Go Out of this room or by God I shall do something fearful Out She backed before him He seized her by the shoulders and flung her forth then locked the door From without she railed at him in the language of the gutter and the brothel Presently her shouts were mingled with piercing shrieks they came from the would be suicide who restored to consciousness was being carried down for removal in the cab Peachey looking and feeling like a man whom passion had brought within sight of murder stopped his ears and huddled himself against the bedside The child screamed in terror At length came silence Peachey opened the door and listened Below voices sounded in quiet conversation Who is down there he called All of us except Ada replied Beatrice The policeman said she needn t go unless she liked but she did like Very well He ran up to the deserted bedroom carefully gathered together his child s day garments and brought them down Then as well as he could he dressed the boy Is it time to get up inquired the little three year old astonished at all that was happening but soothed and amused by the thought that his father had turned nurse It isn t light yet You are going somewhere with father dear Somewhere nice The dialogue between them in sweet broken words such as the child had not yet outgrown and the parent did not wish to abandon for common speech went on until the dressing was completed Now will my boy show me where his clothes are for going out His cap and his coat Oh yes they were up in the nursery boy would show father and laughed merrily that he knew something father didn t A few minutes more and the equipment was completed Now wait for me here only a minute My boy won t cry if I leave him for a minute Cry of course not Peachey descended to the drawing room closed the door behind him and stood facing his sisters in law I want to tell you that I am going away and taking the child with me Ada needn t expect me back to night nor ever As long as I live I will never again be under the same roof with her You Beatrice said it was about time I behaved like a man You were right I ve put up long enough with things such as no man ought to endure for a day Tell your sister that she may go on living here if she chooses for another six months to the end of the year not longer She shall be supplied with sufficient money After Christmas she may find a home for herself where she likes money will be paid to her through a lawyer but from this day I will neither speak nor write to her You two must make your own arrangements you have means enough You know very well both of you why I am taking this step think and say about me what you like I have no time to talk and so I bid you good bye They did not seek to detain him but stood mute whilst he left the room The little boy timid and impatient was at the head of the stairs His father enveloped him warmly in a shawl and so they went forth It was not long before they met with a vacant cab Half an hour s drive brought them to the eating house where Peachey had had his chop that evening and here he obtained a bedroom for the night By eleven o clock the child slept peacefully The father seated at a table was engaged in writing to a solicitor At midnight he lay softly down by the child s side and there until dawn listened to the low breathing of his innocent little bedfellow Though he could not sleep it was joy rather than any painful excitement that kept him wakeful A great and loathsome burden had fallen from him and in the same moment he had rescued his boy out of an atmosphere of hated impurity At length he could respect himself and for the first time in four long years he looked to the future with tranquil hope Careless of the frank curiosity with which the people of the house regarded him he went down at seven o clock and asked for a railway time table Having found a convenient train to Canterbury he ordered breakfast for himself and the child to be laid in a private room It was a merry meal Sunshine of midsummer fell warm and bright upon the table the street below was so full of busy life that the little boy must needs have his breakfast by the window where he could eat and look forth at the same time No such delightful holiday had he ever enjoyed Alone with father and going away by train into wonderful new worlds Is Emma coming he asked It was significant that he did not speak of his mother They drove to the railway station Peachey no less excited than the child From here he despatched a telegram to his partners saying that he should be absent for a day or two Then the train struggling slowly out of London s welter through the newest outposts of gloom and grime bore them hearts companioned in love and blamelessness to the broad sunny meadows and the sweet hop gardens of Kent CHAPTER five Serves her jolly well right said Beatrice A lot she ll care said Fanny I should think myself precious lucky She gets rid of him and of the kid too and has as much as she wants to live on It s better than she deserves Do you believe he s been carrying on with that girl Miss French laughed contemptuously Not he Well there s been a jolly good row to night if we never see another We shall all be in the papers The prospect had charms for Fanny What are you going to do Live here till Christmas Beatrice was quietly reviewing the situation She kept silence and her sister also became meditative Suddenly Fanny inquired What sort of a place is Brussels Brussels Why I know nothing about it Not much of a place I think sprouts come from there don t they It s a big town said the other and a lively sort of place they say Why do you ask me if you know What about it As usual when performing the operation which in her answered to thought Fanny shuffled with her hands on her waist At a distance from Beatrice she stood still and said Some one I know is going there I ve a good mind to go too I want to see abroad Her sister asked several searching questions but Fanny would not make known whether the friend was male or female I shouldn t be much surprised remarked the woman of business indifferently if you go and make a fool of yourself before long That missus Damerel is up to some game with you any one could see it with half an eye I suppose it isn t Lord that s going to Brussels Fanny sputtered her disdain If you had any common sense pursued her sister you d stick to him but you haven t Oh yes you think you can do better Very well we shall see If you find yourself in a hole one of these days don t expect me to pull you out I wouldn t give you a penny to save you from the workhouse Wait till you re asked I know where all your money ll go to And that s into Crewe s pocket He ll fool you out of all you have Beatrice reddened with wrath But unlike the other members of her family she could command her tongue Fanny found it impossible to draw another word from her On returning from the police station haggard and faint with excitement but supported by the anticipation of fresh attacks upon her husband Ada immediately learnt what had happened For the first moment she could hardly believe it She rushed upstairs and saw that the child was really gone then a blind frenzy took hold upon her Alarming and inexplicable sounds drew her sisters from below they found her armed with something heavy smashing every breakable object in her bedroom mirrors toilet ware pictures chimney piece ornaments She s gone mad shrieked Fanny She ll kill us That beast shall pay for it yelled Ada with a frantic blow at the dressing table Wanton destruction of property revolted all Beatrice s instincts Courageous enough she sprang upon the wild animal and flung her down Now indeed the last trace of veneer was gone the last rag of pseudo civilisation was rent off these young women in physical conflict vilifying each other like the female spawn of Whitechapel they revealed themselves as born raw material which the mill of education is supposed to convert into middle class ladyhood As a result of being held still by superior strength Ada fell into convulsions foamed at the mouth her eyes starting from their sockets then she lay as one dead You ve killed her cried the terrified Fanny No fear Give me some water to pitch over her With a full jug from another bedroom she drenched the prostrate figure When Ada came round she was powerless even her rancorous lips could utter only a sound of moaning The sisters stripped her stark naked on the floor made a show of drying her with towels and tumbled her into bed Then Beatrice brewed a great jorum of hot whisky punch and after drinking freely to steady her shaken nerves poured a pint or so down missus Peachey s throat There won t be a funeral just yet she remarked with a laugh Now we ll have supper I feel hungry They went to bed at something after midnight The servants having stolen a bottle of spirits from the cupboard which Beatrice left open both got drunk and slept till morning upon the kitchen floor On the morrow Miss French attired as a walking advertisement of the South London Fashionable Dress Supply Association betook herself to Farringdon Street for an interview with her commercial friend Crewe was absent but one of three clerks who occupied his largest room informed her that it could not be very long before he returned and being so familiar a figure here she was permitted to wait in the agent s sanctum When the door closed upon her the three young men discussed her character with sprightly freedom Beatrice the while splendidly indifferent to the remarks she could easily divine made a rapid examination of loose papers lying on Crewe s desk read several letters opened several books and found nothing that interested her until on turning over a slip of paper with pencilled figures upon it she discovered a hotel bill the heading Royal Hotel Falmouth It was for a day and night s entertainment the debtor mister Crewe the date less than a week gone by This document she considered attentively her brows knitted her eyes wide But a sound caused her to drop it upon the desk again Another moment and Crewe entered He looked keenly at her and less good humouredly than of wont These persons never shook hands and indeed dispensed as a rule with all forms of civility What are you staring at asked Crewe bluffly What are you staring at Nothing that I know He hung up his hat and sat down I ve a note to write wait a minute The note written and given to a clerk Crewe seemed to recover equanimity His visitor told him all that happened in De Crespigny Park even to the crudest details and they laughed together uproariously I m going to take a flat Beatrice then informed him Just find me something convenient and moderate will you A bachelor s flat What about Fanny She has something on I don t know what it is Talks about going to Brussels with a friend Crewe looked astonished You ought to see after her I know what the end ll be Brussels I ve heard of English girls going there but they don t usually come back What can I do I m pretty certain that Damerel woman has a game on hand She doesn t want Fanny to marry her nephew if Lord is her nephew She wants his money that s my idea Mine too remarked the other quietly Look here old chap it s your duty to look after your little damned fool of a sister I tell you that plainly I shan t think well of you if you don t Beatrice displayed eagerness to defend herself She had done her best Fanny scorned all advice and could not be held against her will Has she given up all thought of Lord I m not sure but I think so And it looks as if he was going his own way and didn t care much He never writes to her now Of course it s that woman s doing Crewe reflected I shall have to look into missus Damerel s affairs Might be worth while Where is she living He made a note of the information Well anything else to tell me Beatrice spoke of business matters then asked him if he had been out of town lately The question sounded rather abrupt and caused Crewe to regard her with an expression she privately interpreted A few short runs Nowhere particular Oh Not been down into Cornwall He lost his temper What are you after What business is it of yours If you re going to spy on me I ll soon let you know that I won t stand that kind of thing Don t disturb yourself said Beatrice with a cold smile I haven t been spying and you can go where you like for anything I care I guessed you had been down there that s all Crewe kept silence his look betraying uneasiness as well as anger Speaking at length he fixed her with keen eyes If it s any satisfaction to you you re welcome to know that I have been into Cornwall and to Falmouth Beatrice merely nodded and still he searched her face Just answer me a plain question old chap Come there s no nonsense between us we know each other eh Oh yes we know each other Miss French answered her lips puckering a little What do you know about her What has she been doing all this time Beatrice laughed I know just as little about her as I care You care a good deal more than you ll confess I wouldn t be up to women s tricks if I were you She revolted After all I suppose I am a woman Well I suppose so Crewe grinned good naturedly But that isn t in the terms of our partnership you remember You can be a reasonable fellow enough when you like Just tell me the truth What do you know about Nancy Lord Beatrice assumed an air of mystery I ll tell you that if you tell me what it is you want of her Is it her money Her money be damned It s herself then And what if it is What have you to say to it Her eyes fell and she muttered Nothing Just bear that in mind then And now that I ve answered your question answer mine What have you heard about her Or what have you found out She raised her eyes again and again but in a mocking voice said Nothing You re telling me a lie You re a brute to say so They exchanged fierce glances but could not meet each other s eyes steadily Crewe mastering his irritation said with a careless laugh All right I believe you Didn t mean to offend you old chap I won t be called that She was trembling with stormy emotions You shall treat me decently Very well Old girl then I m a good deal younger than you are And I m a good deal better than you in every way I m a lady at all events and you can t pretend to be a gentleman You re a rough common fellow Holloa Holloa Draw it mild He was startled and in some degree abashed his eyes travelling to the door indicated a fear that this singular business colloquy might be overheard But Beatrice went on without subduing her voice and having delivered herself of much plain language walked from the room leaving the door open behind her As a rule she returned from her day s occupations to dinner in De Crespigny Park at seven o clock To day her arrival at home was considerably later About three o clock she made a call at the boarding house where missus Damerel lived but was disappointed in her wish to see that lady who would not be in before the hour of dining She called again at seven and missus Damerel received her very graciously It was the first time they had met Beatrice in no mood for polite grimaces at once disclosed the object of her visit she wanted to talk about Fanny did missus Damerel know anything of a proposed journey to Brussels The lady professed utter ignorance of any such intention on Fanny s part She had not seen Fanny for at least a fortnight How can that be She told me she dined here last Sunday That s very strange answered missus Damerel with suave concern She certainly did not dine here And the Sunday before Your sister has dined here only once Miss French and that was three months ago Then I don t understand it Haven t you been taking her to theatres and parties and that kind of thing I have taken her once to a theatre and twice to evening at homes The last time we were together anywhere was at missus Dane s about the middle of May Since then I have seen her hardly at all I m very much afraid you are under some misconception Thinking your sister was engaged to marry my nephew mister Lord I naturally desired to offer her a few friendly attentions But it came out at length that she did not regard the engagement as serious I was obliged to speak gravely to my young nephew and beg him to consider his position There is the second dinner bell but I am quite at your service Miss French if you wish to question me further Beatrice was much inclined to resent this tone and to use her vernacular But it seemed only too probable that Fanny had been deceiving her and as she really feared for the girl s safety prudence bade her be civil with missus Damerel Can t you help me to find out what Fanny has really been doing I m afraid it s quite out of my power She never confided in me and it is so long since I have seen anything of her at all It s best to speak plainly said Beatrice in her business tone Can t you think of any man in the society you introduced her to who may be trying to lead her astray Really Miss French The society in which I move is not what you seem to suppose If your sister is in any danger of that kind you must make your inquiries elsewhere in an inferior rank of life Beatrice no longer contained herself Perhaps I know rather more than you think about your kind of society There s not much to choose between the men and the women Miss French I believe you reside in a part of London called Camberwell And I believe you are engaged in some kind of millinery business This excuses you for ill manners All the same I must beg you to relieve me of your presence She rang the bell Good evening I dare say we shall see each other again replied Beatrice with an insulting laugh I heard some one say to day that it might be as well to find out who you really are And if any harm comes to Fanny I shall take a little trouble about that inquiry myself missus Damerel changed colour but no movement betrayed anxiety In the attitude of dignified disdain she kept her eyes on a point above Miss French s head and stood so until the plebeian adversary had withdrawn Then she sat down and for a few minutes communed with herself In the end instead of going to dinner she rang her bell again A servant appeared Is mister Mankelow in the dining room Yes ma am Ask him to be kind enough to come here for a moment With little delay mister Mankelow answered the summons which called him from his soup He wore evening dress his thin hair was parted down the middle his smooth shaven and rather florid face expressed the annoyance of a hungry man at so unseasonable an interruption Do forgive me began missus Damerel in a pathetic falsetto I have been so upset I felt obliged to seek advice immediately and no one seemed so likely to be of help to me as you a man of the world Would you believe that a sister of that silly little Miss French has just been here a downright virago declaring that the girl has been led astray and that I am responsible for it Can you imagine such impertinence She has fibbed shockingly to the people at home told them she was constantly here with me in the evenings when she must have been who knows where It will teach me to meddle again with girls of that class Mankelow stood with his hands behind him and legs apart regarding the speaker with a comically puzzled air My dear missus Damerel he had a thick military sort of voice why in the world should this interpose between us and dinner Afterwards we might But I am really anxious about the silly little creature It would be extremely disagreeable if my name got mixed up in a scandal of any kind You remember my telling you that she didn t belong exactly to the working class She has even a little property of her own and I shouldn t wonder if she has friends who might make a disturbance if her her vagaries could be in any way connected with me and my circle Something was mentioned about Brussels She has been chattering about some one who wanted to take her to Brussels The listener arched his eyebrows more and more What can it matter to you To be sure I have no acquaintance with any one who could do such things Why of course not And even if you had I understand that the girl is long out of her teens Long since Then it s her own affair and that of the man who cares to purchase such amusement By the bye it happens rather oddly that I myself have to run over to Brussels on business but I trust he laughed that my years and my character Oh mister Mankelow absurd It s probably some commercial traveller or man of that sort don t you think The one thing I do hope is that if anything like this happens the girl will somehow make it clear to her friends that I had no knowledge whatever of what was going on But that can hardly be hoped I fear Their eyes crossed they stood for a moment perusing vacancy Yes I think it might be hoped said Mankelow airily She seemed to me a rather reckless sort of young person It s highly probable she will write letters which release every one but herself from responsibility In fact he gazed at her with a cynical smile my knowledge of human nature disposes me to assure you that she certainly will She might even I should say write a letter to you perhaps a cheeky sort of letter which would at once set your mind at ease Oh if you really take that view I do indeed Don t you think we might dismiss the matter and dine They did so Until noon of to day missus Peachey had kept her bed lying amid the wreck wrought by last night s madness She then felt well enough to rise and after refreshment betook herself by cab to the offices of Messrs Ducker Blunt company manufacturers of disinfectants where she conversed with one of the partners and learnt that her husband had telegraphed his intention to be absent for a day or two Having with the self respect which distinguished her related her story from the most calumnious point of view she went home again to nurse her headache and quarrel with Fanny But Fanny had in the meantime left home and unaccountable fact had taken with her a large tin box and a dress basket heavily packed said the servants Her direction to the cabman was merely Westminster Bridge which conveyed to missus Peachey no sort of suggestion When Beatrice came back and learnt this event she went apart in wrathful gloom Ada could not engage her in a quarrel It was a wretchedly dull evening They talked next morning and Beatrice announced her purpose of going to live by herself as soon as possible But she would not quarrel Left alone Ada prepared to visit certain of their relatives in different parts of London to spread among them the news of her husband s infamy CHAPTER six When Mary Woodruff unlocked the house door and entered the little hall it smelt and felt as though the damp and sooty fogs of winter still lingered here untouched by the July warmth She came alone and straightway spent several hours in characteristic activity airing cleaning brightening For a few days there would be no servant Mary after her long leisure down in Cornwall enjoyed the prospect of doing all the work herself They had reached London last evening and had slept at a family hotel where Nancy remained until the house was in order for her Unhappily their arrival timed with a change of weather which brought clouds and rain The glories of an unshadowed sky would have little more than availed to support Nancy s courage as she passed the creaking little gate and touched the threshold of a home to which she returned only on compulsion gloom overhead and puddles underfoot tried her spirit sorely She had a pale face and thin cheeks and moved with languid step Her first glance was at the letter box Nothing Mary shook her head During their absence letters had been re addressed by the post office and since the notice of return nothing had come I m quite sure a letter has been lost Yes it may have been But there ll be an answer to your last very soon I don t think so Most likely I shall never hear again And Nancy sat by the window of the front room looking as she had looked so many a time at the lime tree opposite and the house visible through wet branches A view unchanged since she could remember recalling all her old ambitions revolts pretences and ignorances recalling her father who from his grave still oppressed her living heart Somewhere near sounded the wailing shout of a dustman It was like the voice of a soul condemned to purge itself in filth Mary She rose up and went to the kitchen I can t live here It will kill me if I have to live in this dreadful place Why even you have been crying I can see you have If you give way think what it must be to me It s only for a day or two dear answered Mary We shall feel at home again very soon Miss Morgan will come this evening and perhaps your brother I must do something Give me some work Mary could not but regard this as a healthy symptom and she suggested tasks that called for moderate effort Sick of reading she had read through a whole circulating library in the past six months Nancy bestirred herself about the house but she avoided her father s room Horace did not come to day a note arrived from him saying that he would call early to morrow morning But at tea time Jessica presented herself She looked less ghostly than half a year ago the grave illness through which she had passed seemed to have been helpful to her constitution Yet she was noticeably changed In her letters Nancy had remarked an excessive simplicity a sort of childishness very unlike Jessica s previous way of writing and the same peculiarity now appeared in her conversation By turns she was mawkish and sprightly tearful and giggling Her dress formerly neglected to the point of untidiness betrayed a new born taste for fashionable equipment she suddenly drew attention to it in the midst of serious talk asking with a bashful smirk whether Nancy thought it suited her I got it at Miss French s place the Association you know It s really wonderful how cheap things are there And the very best cut by dressmakers from Paris Nancy wondered and felt that her diminishing regard for Miss Morgan had suffered a fresh blow There was much news to receive and impart In writing from Falmouth Nancy had referred to the details of her own life with studied ambiguity She regretted having taken Jessica into her confidence and avoided penning a word which if read by any one but her correspondent would betray the perilous secret Jessica after her illness was inclined to resent this extreme caution which irritated her curiosity but in vain she assured Nancy that there was not the least fear of her letters falling into wrong hands For weeks at a time she heard nothing and then would come a letter long indeed but without a syllable of the information she desired Near the end of May she received a line or two I have been really ill but am now much better I shall stay here only a few weeks more Don t be anxious I am well cared for and the worst is over She heard the interpretation from Nancy s lips and laughed and cried over it What you must have suffered my poor dear And to be separated from the little darling Oh it s too cruel You are sure they will be kind to it Mary has every confidence in the woman And I like the look of her I don t feel uneasy I shall go there very often of course And when is he coming back He oughtn t to have kept away all this time How unkind Not at all Nancy replied with sudden reserve He is acting for the best You mustn t ask me about that you shall know more some day Jessica whose face made legible presentment of her every thought looked disappointed and peevish And you are really going in for the examination again Nancy asked Oh of course I am answered the other perkily but not till summer of next year I m not allowed to study much yet the doctor says I might do my brain a serious injury I read a great deal books that rest the mind poetry and fiction of course only the very best fiction I shall soon be able to begin teaching again but I must be very careful Only an hour or two a day at first and perhaps quite young children Evidently the girl felt a certain pride in what she had undergone Her failure to matriculate was forgotten in the sense that she offered a most interesting case of breakdown from undue mental exertion The doctor had declared his astonishment that she held up until the examination was over He simply wouldn t believe me when I told him the hours I worked He said I ought to be on my trial for attempted suicide And she laughed with extravagant conceit You have quite made friends with the Barmbys said Nancy eyeing her curiously They are very nice people Of course the girls quite understand what a difference there is between themselves and me I like them because they are so modest they would never think of contradicting my opinion about anything And what about the Prophet I don t think you ever quite understood him Jessica replied with an obvious confusion which perplexed her friend He isn t at all the kind of man you thought No doubt I was wrong Nancy hastened to say It was prejudice And you remember that I never had any fault to find with his his character You disliked him said the other sharply And you still dislike him I m sure you do So plainly did Jessica desire a confirmation of this statement that Nancy allowed herself to be drawn into half avowing a positive dislike for Samuel Whereupon Jessica looked pleased and tossed her head in a singular way I needn t remind you fell from Nancy after a moment of troubled reflection how careful you must be in talking about me to the Barmbys Oh don t have the slightest fear Weren t you delirious in your illness I should think I was indeed For a long time I hope you said nothing About you Oh not a word I m quite sure I talked all the time about my studies The doctor heard me one day repeating a long bit of Virgil And I kept calling for bits of paper to work out problems in Geometrical Progression Just fancy I don t think most girls are delirious in that way If I had said anything about you that sounded queer of course mother would have told me afterwards Oh it was quite an intellectual delirium Had Jessica since her illness become an insufferable simpleton or Nancy wondered was it she herself who through experience and sorrows was grown wiser and saw her friend in a new light It troubled her gravely that the preservation of a secret more than ever momentous should depend upon a person with so little sense The girl s departure was a relief but in the silence that followed upon silly talk she had leisure to contemplate this risk hitherto scarce taken into account She spoke of it with Mary the one friend to whom her heart went out in absolute trust from whom she concealed but few of her thoughts and whose moral worth only understood since circumstances compelled her reliance upon it had set before her a new ideal of life Mary she well knew abhorred the deceit they were practising and thought hard things of the man who made it a necessity so it did not surprise her that the devoted woman showed no deep concern at a new danger It s more the shame than anything else that I fear now said Nancy If I have to support myself and my child I shall do it How I don t know but other women find a way and I should If he deserts me I am not such a poor creature as to grieve on that account I should despise him too much even to hate him But the shame of it would be terrible It s common vulgar cheating such as you read of in the newspapers such as people are punished for I never thought of it in that way when he was here Yet he felt it He spoke of it like that but I wouldn t listen Mary heard this with interest Did he wish you to give it up she asked You never told me that He said he would rather we did But that was when he had never thought of being in want himself Afterwards yes even then he spoke in the same way but what could we do Don t fear that he will forsake you said Mary You will hear from him very soon He knows the right and the wrong and right will be stronger with him in the end If only I were sure that he has heard of his child s birth If he has and won t even write to me then he is no man and it s better we should never see each other again She knew the hours of postal delivery and listened with throbbing heart to the double knocks at neighbouring houses When the last postman was gone by she sat down sick with disappointment At bedtime she said to Mary My little baby is asleep oh if I could but see it for a moment And tears choked her as she turned away It was more than two months since she had heard from her husband At first Tarrant wrote as frequently as he had promised She learnt speedily of his arrival at New York then that he had reached Nassau the capital of the Bahamas then that he was with his friend Sutherland on the little island amid the coral reefs Subsequent letters written in buoyant spirits contained long descriptions of the scenery about him and of the life he led He expressed a firm confidence in Sutherland s enterprises beyond a doubt there was no end of money to be made by an energetic man he should report most favourably to mister Vawdrey whose company operation would of course be invaluable For his own part whether he profited or not from these commercial schemes he had not been mistaken in foreseeing material for journalism even for a book Yes he should certainly write a book on the Bahamas if only to expose the monstrous system of misgovernment which accounted for the sterility into which these islands had fallen The climate in winter at all events was superb Sutherland and he lay about in delicious sunshine under a marvellous sky smoking excellent cigars and talking over old Oxford days He quoted Tennyson Larger constellations burning c At the end of December when Nancy according to their agreement began to hope for his return a letter in a very different tone burdened her with dismal doubts Tarrant had quarrelled with his friend He had discovered that Sutherland was little better than a swindler I see that the fellow s professed energy was all sham He is the laziest scamp imaginable lazier even than his boozing old father He schemes only to get money out of people and his disappointment on finding that I have no money to lose has shown itself at length in very gross forms I find he is a gambler there has just been a tremendous row between him and an American whom he is said to have cheated at cards Last year he was for several weeks in Mexico City a place notorious for gambling and there lost a large sum of money that didn t belong to him The upshot was that he could no longer advise mister Vawdrey to have anything to do with Sutherland But he must not leave the Bahamas yet that would be most unwise as he was daily gathering most valuable information Vawdrey might be induced to lend him a hundred pounds or so But he would write again very soon It was the close of January when he dated his next letter Vawdrey had sent him fifty pounds this however was to include the cost of his return to England See then what I have decided I shall make a hurried tour through the West Indian Islands then cross to the States and travel by land to New York or Boston seeing all I can afford to on the way If I have to come home as a steerage passenger never mind that too will be valuable experience There followed many affectionate phrases but Nancy s heart remained cold He wrote next from Washington after six weeks silence Difficulties of which he would speak at length in another letter had caused him to postpone answering the two letters he had received Nancy must never lose faith in him his love was unshaken before the birth of her child he would assuredly be back in England Let her address to New York He was well but could not pretend to be very cheerful However courage He had plans and hopes of which she should soon hear After that Nancy knew nothing of him save that he was living in New York He wrote two or three times but briefly always promising details in the next epistle Then he ceased to correspond Not even the announcement of the child s birth elicited a word from him One subsequent letter had Nancy despatched this unanswered she would write no more She was herself surprised at the calmness with which she faced so dreadful a possibility as desertion by the man she had loved and married the father of her baby It meant perhaps that she could not believe such fate had really befallen her Even in Tarrant s last short letter sounded a note of kindness of truthfulness incompatible it seemed to her with base cruelty I dreamt of you last night dearest and woke up with a heart that ached for your suffering How could a man pen those words and be meditating dastardly behaviour to the woman he addressed Was he ill then or had fatal accident befallen him She feared such explanation only in her weakest moments If long ago he could keep silence for six weeks at a time why not now for months As for the news she had sent him does a man think it important that a little child has been born into the world Likely enough that again he merely postponed writing Of course he no longer loved her say what he might at most he thought of her with a feeling of compassion not strong enough to overcome his dislike of exertion He would come back when it pleased him Nancy would not sully her mind by thinking that he might only return when her position made it worth his while He was not a man of that stamp Simply he had ceased to care for her and having no means of his own whilst she was abundantly provided he yielded to the temptation to hold aloof from a woman whose claim upon him grew burdensome Her thoughts admitted no worse accusation than this Did any grave ill befall her if for instance the fact of her marriage became known and she were left helpless her letter to New York would not be disregarded To reflect thus signified a mental balance rare in women and remarkable in one situated as Nancy was She talked with her companion far less consistently for talk served to relieve the oppression of her heart and mind When next morning Horace entered the sitting room brother and sister viewed each other with surprise Neither was prepared for the outward change wrought in both by the past half year Nancy looked what she in truth had become a matronly young woman in uncertain health and possessed by a view of life too grave for her years Horace no longer a mere lad exhibited in sunken cheeks and eyes bright with an unhappy recklessness the acquisition of experience which corrupts before it can mature Moving to offer her lips Nancy was checked by the young man s exclamation What on earth has been the matter with you I never saw any one so altered His voice with its deepened note and the modification of his very accent due to novel circumstances checked the hearer s affectionate impulse If not unfeeling the utterance had nothing fraternal Deeply pained and no less alarmed by this warning of the curiosity her appearance would excite in all who knew her Nancy made a faltering reply Why should you seem astonished You know very well I have had an illness But what sort of illness What caused it You used always to be well enough You had better go and talk to my medical attendant said Nancy in a cold offended voice Horace resumed with irritability Isn t it natural for me to ask such questions You re not a bit like yourself And what did you mean by telling me you were coming back at once when I wanted to join you at Falmouth I meant to But after all I had to stay longer Oh well it s nothing to me They had not even shaken hands and now felt no desire to correct the omission which was at first involuntary Horace seemed to have lost all the amiability of his nature he looked about him with restless excited eyes Are you in a hurry asked his sister head erect No hurry that I know of You haven t heard what s been going on Where Of course it won t interest you There s something about you I can t understand Is it father s will that has spoilt your temper and made you behave so strangely It is not my temper that s spoilt And as for behaving strangely She made an effort to command herself Sit down Horace and let me know what is the matter with you Why we should be unfriendly I really can t imagine I have suffered from ill health that s all I m sorry I behaved in that way when you talked of coming to Falmouth it wasn t meant as you seem to think Tell me what you have to tell He could not take a reposeful attitude but after struggling with some reluctance began to explain the agitation that beset him missus Damerel has done something I didn t think any woman would be capable of For months she has been trying to ruin Fanny and now it has come she has succeeded She made no secret of wanting to break things off between her and me but I never thought her plotting could go as far as this Fanny has run away gone to the Continent with a man missus Damerel introduced to her Perhaps they are married said Nancy with singular impulsiveness Of course they re not It s a fellow I knew to be a scoundrel the first time I set eyes on him I warned Fanny against him and I told missus Damerel that I should hold her responsible if any harm came of the acquaintance she was encouraging between him and Fanny She did encourage it though she pretended not to Her aim was to separate me and Fanny she didn t care how He spoke in a high vehement note his cheeks flushed violently his clenched fist quivered at his side How do you know where she is gone Nancy asked She as good as told her sister that she was going to Brussels with some one Then one day she disappeared with her luggage And that fellow Mankelow s his name has gone too He lived in the same boarding house with missus Damerel That is all the evidence you have Quite enough he replied bitterly It doesn t seem so to me But suppose you re right what proof have you that missus Damerel had anything to do with it If she is our mother s sister and you say there can be no doubt of it I won t believe that she could carry out such a hateful plot as this What does it matter who she is I would swear fifty times that she has done it You know very well when you saw her you disliked her at once You were right in that and I was wrong I can t be sure Perhaps it was she that disliked me more than I did her For one thing I don t believe that people make such plots And what plotting was needed Couldn t any one have told you what a girl like Fanny French would do if she lost her head among people of a higher class Then missus Damerel must have foreseen it That s just what I say She pretended to be a friend to the girl on purpose to ruin her Have you accused her of it Yes I have His eyes flashed Nancy marvelled at this fire drawn from a gentle nature by what seemed to her so inadequate so contemptible a cause Of course she denied it and got angry with me but any one could see she was glad of what had happened There s an end between us at all events I shall never go to see her again she s a woman who thinks of nothing but money and fashion I dislike her friends every one of them I ve met I told her that what she had done ought to be a punishable crime Nancy reflected then said quietly Whether you are right or wrong I don t think you would have got any good from her But will you tell me what you are going to do I told you that I thought borrowing money only to live on it in idleness was very foolish Her brother stiffened his neck You must allow me to judge for myself But have you judged for yourself Wasn t it by missus Damerel s advice that you gave up business Partly But I should have done it in any case Have you any plans No I haven t he answered You can t expect a man to have plans whose life has been thoroughly upset Nancy reminded of his youthfulness by the tone in which he called himself a man experienced a revival of natural feeling Though revolting against the suggestion that a woman akin to them had been guilty of what her brother believed she was glad to think that Fanny French had relinquished all legitimate claim upon him and that his connection with smart society had come to an end Obvious enough were the perils of his situation and she as elder sister recognised a duty towards him she softened her voice and endeavoured to re establish the confidence of old time Impossible at once though with resolution she might ultimately succeed Horace at present was a mere compound of agitated and inflamed senses The life he had been leading appeared in a vicious development of his previously harmless conceit and egoism All his characteristics had turned out as it were the seamy side and Nancy with difficulty preserved her patience as he showed point after point of perverted disposition The result of their talk was a careless promise from Horace that he would come to Grove Lane not seldomer than once a week He stayed only an hour resisting Nancy s endeavour to detain him at least for the mid day meal To Mary he spoke formally awkwardly as though unable to accept her position in the house and then made his escape like one driven by an evil spirit CHAPTER seven With the clearing of the sky Nancy s spirit grew lighter She went about London and enjoyed it after her long seclusion in the little Cornish town enjoyed too her release from manifold restraints and perils Her mental suffering had made the physical harder to bear she was now recovering health of mind and body and found with surprise that life had a new savour independent of the timorous joy born with her child Strangely as it seemed to her she grew conscious of a personal freedom not unlike what she had vainly desired in the days of petulant girlhood the sense came only at moments but was real and precious under its influence she forgot everything abnormal in her situation and though without recognising this significance knew the exultation of a woman who has justified her being A day or two of roaming at large gave her an appetite for activity Satisfied that her child was safe and well cared for she turned her eyes upon the life of the world and wished to take some part in it not the part she had been wont to picture for herself before reality supplanted dreams Horace s example on the one hand and that of Jessica Morgan on the other helped her to contemn mere social excitement and the idle vanity which formerly she styled pursuit of culture Must there not be discoverable in the world to which she had or could obtain access some honest strenuous occupation which would hold in check her unprofitable thoughts and soothe her self respect That her fraud up to and beyond the crucial point had escaped detection must be held so wonderful that she felt justified in an assurance of impunity The narrowest escape of which she was aware had befallen only a few weeks ago On the sixth day after the birth of the child there was brought to her lodgings at Falmouth a note addressed to Miss Lord Letters bearing this address had arrived frequently and by the people of the house were supposed to be for Mary Woodruff who went by the name of Miss Lord Nancy having disguised herself as missus Woodruff but they had always come by post and the present missive must be from some acquaintance actually in the town Nancy could not remember the handwriting Breaking open the envelope as she lay in bed she saw with alarm the signature Luckworth Crewe He was at Falmouth on business Crewe wrote and before leaving London he had ventured to ask Miss Lord s address from her brother whom he casually met somewhere Would Nancy allow him to see her were it but for a minute or two Earnestly he besought this favour He desired nothing more than to see Miss Lord and to speak with her in the way of an ordinary acquaintance After all this time she had he felt sure forgiven his behaviour at their last meeting Only five minutes of conversation All seemed lost Nancy was silent in despair But Mary faced the perilous juncture and to all appearances averted catastrophe She dressed herself and went straight to the hotel where Crewe had put up and where he awaited an answer Having made known who she was she delivered a verbal message Miss Lord was not well enough to see any one to day and in any case she could not have received mister Crewe she begged him to pardon her before long they might perhaps meet in London but for her own part she wished mister Crewe would learn to regard her as a stranger Of course there followed a dialogue and Mary seeming to speak with all freedom convinced Crewe that his attempt to gain an interview was quite hopeless She gave him much information concerning her mistress none of it false but all misleading and in the end had to resist an offer of gold coins pressed upon her as a bribe for her good word with Nancy The question was had Crewe been content to leave Falmouth without making inquiries of other people To a man of his experience nothing was easier than such investigation But with other grounds of anxiety this had ceased to disturb Nancy s mind Practically she lived as though all danger were at an end The task immediately before her seemed very simple she had only to resume the old habits and guard against thoughtless self betrayal in her everyday talk The chance that any one would discover her habit of visiting a certain house at the distance of several miles from Camberwell was too slight for consideration She wrote to mister Barmby senior informing him of her return in improved health to Grove Lane and thanking him once more for his allowing her to make so long a stay in Cornwall If he wished to see her she would be at home at any time convenient to him In a few days the old gentleman called and for an hour or two discoursed well meaning commonplace He was sorry to observe that she looked a trifle pale in the autumn she must go away again and to a more bracing locality he would suggest Broadstairs which had always exercised the most beneficial effect upon his own health Above all he begged her to refrain from excessive study most deleterious to a female constitution Then he asked questions about Horace and agreed with Nancy that the young man ought to decide upon some new pursuit if he had definitely abandoned the old lack of steady occupation was most deleterious at his age In short mister Barmby rather apologised for his guardianship than sought to make assertion of it and Nancy by a few feminine devices won a better opinion than she had hitherto enjoyed On the day following Samuel Barmby and his sisters waited upon Miss Lord all three were surprisingly solemn and Samuel talked for the most part of a paragraph he had recently read which stated that the smoke of London if properly utilised would be worth a vast sum of money The English are a wasteful people was his conclusion to which Nancy assented with a face as grave as his own Not a little to her astonishment the next day brought her a long letter in Samuel s fair commercial hand It began by assuring her that the writer had no intention whatever of troubling her with the renewal of a suit so firmly rejected on more than one occasion he wished only to take this opportunity of her return from a long absence to express the abiding nature of his devotion which years hence would be unbroken as to day He would never distress her by unwelcome demonstrations possibly she might never again hear from his lips what he now committed to paper Enough for him Samuel to cherish a love which could not but exalt and purify him which was indeed in the words of Shakespeare a liberal education In recompense of his self command he only besought that Miss Lord would allow him from time to time to look upon her face and to converse with her of intellectual subjects A paper he added which I read last week at our Society is now being printed solely at the request of friends The subject is one that may interest you The Influence of Culture on Morality I beg that you will accept the copy I shall have the pleasure of sending you and that at some future date you will honour me with your remarks thereon Which epistle Nancy cruelly read aloud to Mary with a sprightliness and sarcastic humour not excelled by her criticisms of the Prophet in days gone by Mary did not quite understand but she saw in this behaviour a proof of the wonderful courage with which Nancy faced her troubles A week had passed and no news from America I don t care said Nancy Really and truly I don t care Yesterday I never once thought of it never once looked for the postman The worst is over now and he may write or not as he likes Mary felt sure there would be an explanation of such strange silence Only illness or death would explain it so as to make me forgive him But he isn t ill He is alive and enjoying himself There was no bitterness in her voice She seemed to have outlived all sorrows and anxieties relative to her husband Mary suggested that it was always possible to call at mister Vawdrey s house and make inquiries of missus Baker No I won t do that Other women would do it but I won t So long as I mayn t tell the truth I should only set them talking about me you know how I see the use now of having a good deal of pride I m only sorry for those letters I wrote when I wasn t in my senses If he writes now I shall not answer He shall know that I am as independent as he is What a blessed thing it is for a woman to have money of her own It s because most women haven t that they re such poor wretched slaves If he knew you were in want said her companion he would never have behaved like this Who can say No I won t pretend to think worse of him than I do You re quite right He wouldn t leave his wife to starve It s certain that he hears about me from some one If I were found out and lost everything some one would let him know But I wouldn t accept support from him now He might provide for his child but he shall never provide for me come what may never It was in the evening after dinner Nancy had a newspaper and was reading the advertisements that offered miscellaneous employment What do you think this can be she asked looking up after a long silence To ladies with leisure Ladies desiring to add to their income by easy and pleasant work should write c c I ve no faith in those kind of advertisements said Mary No of course it s rubbish There s no easy and pleasant way of earning money only silly people expect it And I don t want anything easy or pleasant I want honest hard work Not work with my hands I m not suited for that but real work such as lots of educated girls are doing I m quite willing to pay for learning it most likely I shall have to Who could I write to for advice They were sitting upstairs and so did not hear a visitor s knock that sounded at the front door The servant came and announced that Miss French wished to see Miss Lord Miss French Is it the younger Miss French The girl could not say she had repeated the name given to her Nancy spoke to her friend in a low voice It may be Fanny I don t think Beatrice would call unless it s to say something about her sister She had better come up here I suppose Mary retired and in a few moments there entered not Fanny but Beatrice She was civilly not cordially welcomed Her eye as she spoke the words natural at such a meeting dwelt with singular persistency on Nancy s face You are quite well again Quite thank you It has been a troublesome illness I m afraid Nancy hesitated detecting a peculiarity of look and tone which caused her uneasiness I had a sort of low fever was altogether out of sorts below par the doctor said Are you all well Settling herself comfortably as if for a long chat Beatrice sketched with some humour the course of recent events in De Crespigny Park I m out of it all thank goodness I prefer a quiet life Then there s Fanny You know all about her I dare say Nothing at all Nancy replied distantly But your brother does Hasn t he been to see you yet Nancy was in no mood to submit to examination Whatever I may have heard I know nothing about Fanny s affairs and really they don t concern me I should have thought they might rejoined the other smiling absently She has run away from her friends a pause and is living somewhere rather mysteriously another pause and I think it more than likely that she s married The listener preserved a face of indifference though the lines were decidedly tense Doesn t that interest you asked Beatrice in the most genial tone If it s true was the blunt reply You mean you are glad if she has married somebody else and not your brother Yes I am glad of that Beatrice mused with wrinkles at the corner of her eye Then fixing Nancy with a very keen look she said quietly I m not sure that she s married But if she isn t no doubt she ought to be On Nancy s part there was a nervous movement but she said nothing Her face grew rigid I have an idea who the man is Miss French pursued but I can t be quite certain One has heard of similar cases Even you have no doubt I don t care to talk about it fell mechanically from Nancy s lips which had lost their colour But I ve come just for that purpose The eyes of mocking scrutiny would not be resisted They drew a gaze from Nancy and then a haughty exclamation I don t understand you Please say whatever you have to say in plain words Don t be angry with me You were always too ready at taking offence I mean it in quite a friendly way you can trust me I m not one of the women that chatter Don t you think you ought to sympathise a little with Fanny She has gone to Brussels or somewhere about there But she might have gone down into Cornwall to a place like Falmouth It was quite far enough off don t you think Nancy was stricken mute and her countenance would no longer disguise what she suffered No need to upset yourself pursued the other in smiling confidence I mean no harm I m curious that s all just want to know one or two things We re old friends and whatever you tell me will go no further depend upon that What do you mean The words came from lips that moved with difficulty Beatrice still smiling bent forward Is it any one that I know Any one Who That made it necessary for you to go down into Cornwall my dear Nancy heaved a sigh the result of holding her breath too long She half rose and sat down again In a torture of flashing thoughts she tried to determine whether Beatrice had any information or spoke conjecturally Yet she was able to discern that either case meant disaster to have excited the suspicions of such a person was the same as being unmasked an inquiry at Falmouth and all would at once be known No not all Not the fact of her marriage not the name of her husband Driven to bay by such an opponent she assumed an air wholly unnatural to her one of cynical effrontery You had better say what you know All right Who was the father of the child born not long ago That s asking a question And telling what I know at the same time It saves breath Beatrice laughed and Nancy become a mere automaton laughed too That s more like it said Miss French cheerfully Now we shall get on together It s very shocking my dear A person of my strict morality hardly knows how to look you in the face Perhaps you had rather I didn t try Very well Now tell me all about it comfortably I have a guess you know What is it Wait a little I don t want to be laughed at Is it any one I know You have never seen him and I dare say never heard of him Beatrice stared incredulously I wouldn t tell fibs Nancy I m telling the truth It s very queer then Who did you think The speaking automaton as though by defect of mechanism stopped short Look straight at me I shouldn t have been surprised to hear that it was Luckworth Crewe Nancy s defiant gaze shame in anguish shielding itself with the front of audacity changed to utter astonishment The blood rushed back into her cheeks she voiced a smothered exclamation of scorn The father of my child Luckworth Crewe I thought it not impossible said Beatrice plainly baffled It was like you Nancy gave a hard laugh You judged me by yourself Have another guess Surprised both at the denial so obviously true and at the unexpected tone with which Nancy was meeting her attack Miss French sat meditative It s no use guessing she said at length with complete good humour I don t know of any one else Very well You can t expect me to tell you As you please It s a queer thing I felt pretty sure But if you re telling the truth I don t care a rap who the man is You can rest in peace said Nancy with careless scorn Any way of convincing me except by saying it Yes Wait here a moment She left the room and returned with the note which Crewe had addressed to her from the hotel at Falmouth Read that and look at the date Beatrice studied the document and in silence canvassed the possibilities of trickery No it was genuine evidence She remembered the date of Crewe s journey to Falmouth and in this new light could interpret his quarrelsome behaviour after he had returned Only the discovery she had since made inflamed her with a suspicion which till then had never entered her mind Of course you didn t let him see you Of course not All right Don t suppose I wanted to insult you I took it for granted you were married Of course it happened before your father s death and his awkward will obliged you to keep it dark Again Nancy was smitten with fear Deeming Miss French an unscrupulous enemy she felt that to confess marriage was to abandon every hope Pride appealed to her courage bade her here and now have done with the ignoble fraud but fear proved stronger She could not face exposure and all that must follow She spoke coldly but with down dropt eyes I am not married The words cost her little effort Practically she had uttered them before her overbold replies were an admission of what from the first she supposed Beatrice to charge her with not secret wedlock but secret shame Beatrice however had adopted that line of suggestion merely from policy hoping to sting the proud girl into avowal of a legitimate union she heard the contrary declaration with fresh surprise I should never have believed it of Miss Lord was her half ingenuous half sly comment Nancy beginning to realise what she had done sat with head bent speechless Don t distress yourself continued the other Not a soul will hear of it from me If you like to tell me more you can do it quite safely I m no blabber and I m not a rascal I should never have troubled to make inquiries about you down yonder if it hadn t been that I suspected Crewe That s a confession you know take it in return for yours Nancy was tongue tied A full sense of her humiliation had burst upon her She who always condescended to Miss French now lay smirched before her feet an object of vulgar contempt What does it matter went on Beatrice genially You ve got over the worst and very cleverly Are you going to marry him when you come in for your money Perhaps I don t know She faltered no longer able to mask in impudence and hardly restraining tears Beatrice ceased to doubt and could only wonder with amusement Why shouldn t we be good friends Nancy I tell you I am no rascal I never thought of making anything out of your secret not I If it had been Crewe marriage or no marriage well I might have shown my temper I believe I have a pretty rough side to my tongue but I m a good enough sort if you take me in the right way Of course I shall never rest for wondering who it can be She paused but Nancy did not look up did not stir Perhaps you ll tell me some other time But there s one thing I should like to ask about and it s for your own good that I should know it When Crewe was down there don t you think he tumbled to anything Perplexed by unfamiliar slang Nancy raised her eyes Found out anything you mean I don t know But you must have been in a jolly fright about it I gave it very little thought replied Nancy able now to command a steady voice and retiring behind a manner of frigid indifference No Well of course I understand that better now I know that you can t lose anything Still it is to be hoped he didn t go asking questions By the bye you may as well just tell me he has asked you to marry him hasn t he Yes Beatrice nodded Doesn t matter You needn t be afraid even if he got hold of anything He isn t the kind of man to injure you out of spite I fear him as little as I fear you Well as I ve told you you needn t fear me at all I like you better for this a good deal better than I used to If you want any help you know where to turn I ll do whatever I can for you and I m in the way of being useful to my friends You re cut up just now it s natural I won t bother you any longer But just remember what I ve said If I can be of any service don t be above making use of me Nancy heard without heeding for an anguish of shame and misery once more fell upon her and seemed to lay waste her soul Part V Compassed Round CHAPTER one There needed not Mary Woodruff s suggestion to remind Nancy that no further away than Champion Hill were people of whom in extremity she might inquire concerning her husband At present even could she have entertained the thought it seemed doubtful whether the Vawdrey household knew more of Tarrant s position and purposes than she herself for only a month ago Jessica Morgan had called upon the girls and had ventured a question about their cousin whereupon they answered that he was in America but that he had not written for a long time To missus Baker Jessica did not like to speak on the subject but probably that lady could have answered only as the children did Once indeed a few days after her return Nancy took the familiar walk along Champion Hill and glanced in passing at mister Vawdrey s house afterwards she shunned that region The memories it revived were infinitely painful She saw herself an immature and foolish girl behaving in a way which for all its affectation of reserve and dignity no doubt offered to such a man as Lionel Tarrant a hint that here if he chose he might make a facile conquest Had he not acted upon the hint It wrung her heart with shame to remember how in those days she followed the lure of a crude imagination A year ago Oh a lifetime Unwilling now to justify herself with the plea of love doubtful in very truth whether her passion merited that name she looked back in the stern spirit of a woman judging another s frailty What treatment could she have anticipated at the hands of her lover save that she had received He married her it was much he forsook her it was natural The truth of which she had caught troublous glimpses in the heyday of her folly now stood revealed as pitiless condemnation Tarrant never respected her never thought of her as a woman whom he could seriously woo and wed She had a certain power over his emotions and not the sensual alone but his love would not endure the test of absence From the other side of the Atlantic he saw her as he had seen her at first and shrank from returning to the bondage which in a weak moment he had accepted One night about this time she said to herself I was his mistress never his wife And all her desperate endeavours to obscure the history of their love to assert herself as worthy to be called wife mother had fallen fruitless Those long imploring letters despatched to America from her solitude by the Cornish sea elicited nothing but a word or two which sounded more like pity than affection Pity does not suffice to recall the wandering steps of a man wedded against his will In her heart she absolved him of all baseness The man of ignoble thought would have been influenced by her market value as a wife Tarrant all the more because he was reduced to poverty would resolutely forget the crude advantage of remaining faithful to her Herein Nancy proved herself more akin to her father than she had ever seemed when Stephen Lord sought eagerly in her character for hopeful traits The severity of her self judgment and the indulgence tempering her attitude towards Tarrant declared a love which had survived its phase of youthful passion But Nancy did not recognise this symptom of moral growth She believed herself to have become indifferent to her husband and only wondered that she did not hate him Her heart seemed to spend all its emotion on the little being to whom she had given life a healthy boy who already so she fancied knew a difference between his mother and his nurse and gurgled a peculiar note of contentment when lying in her arms Whether wife or not she claimed every privilege of motherhood Had the child been a weakling she could not have known this abounding solace the defect would have reproached her But from the day of his birth he manifested so vigorous a will to live clung so hungrily to the fountain breast kicked and clamoured with such irresistible self assertion that the mother s pride equalled her tenderness My own brave boy My son Wonderful new words honey upon the lips and rapture to the ear She murmured them as though inspired with speech never uttered by mortal The interval of a day between her journeys to see the child taxed her patience but each visit brought a growth of confidence No harm would befall him Mary had chosen wisely Horace kept aloof and sent no message When at length she wrote to him a letter all of sisterly kindness there came a stinted reply He said that he was going away for a holiday and might be absent until September Don t bother about me You shall hear again before long There s just a chance that I may go in for business again with prospect of making money Particulars when I see you Nancy found this note awaiting her after a day s absence from home and with it another To her surprise missus Damerel had written I called early this afternoon wishing particularly to see you Will you please let me know when I should find you at home It is about Horace that I want to speak It began with My dear Nancy and ended Yours affectionately Glad of the opportunity thus offered she answered at once making an appointment for the next day When missus Damerel came Nancy was even more struck than at their former meeting with her resemblance to Horace Eyes and lips recalled Horace at every moment This time the conversation began more smoothly On both sides appeared a disposition to friendliness though Nancy only marked her distrust in the hope of learning more about this mysterious relative and of being useful to her brother You have a prejudice against me said the visitor when she had inquired concerning Nancy s health It s only natural I hardly seem to you a real relative I m afraid you know so little about me and now Horace has been laying dreadful things to my charge He thinks you responsible for what has happened to Fanny French Nancy replied in an impartial voice Yes and I assure you he is mistaken Miss French deceived him and her own people leading them to think that she was spending her time with me when really she was who knows where To you I am quite ready to confess that I hoped something might come between her and Horace but as for plotting really lam not so melodramatic a person All I did in the way of design was to give Horace an opportunity of seeing the girl in a new light You can imagine very well no doubt how she conducted herself I quite believe that Horace was getting tired and ashamed of her but then came her disappearance and that made him angry with me Even the voice suggested Horace s tones especially when softened in familiar dialogue Nancy paid closer attention to the speaker s looks and movements than to the matter of what she said missus Damerel might possibly be a well meaning woman her peculiarities might result from social habits and not from insincerity yet Nancy could not like her Everything about her prompted a question and a doubt How old was she Probably much older than she looked What was her breeding her education Probably far less thorough than she would have one believe Was she in good circumstances Nancy suspected that her fashionable and expensive dress signified extravagance and vanity rather than wealth I have brought a letter to show you which she has sent me from abroad Read it and form your own conclusion Is it the letter of an injured innocent A scrawl on foreign note paper which ran thus DEAR missus DAMEREL Just a word to console you for the loss of my society I have gone to a better world so dry your tears If you see my masher tell him I ve met with somebody a bit more like a man I should advise him to go to school again and finish his education I won t trouble you to write Many thanks for the kindness you didn t mean to do me Yours in the best of spirits I don t mean Cognac FANNY nee FRENCH Nancy returned the paper with a look of disgust saying I didn t think she was as bad as that No more did I It really gave me a little shock of surprise Do you think it likely she is married missus Damerel pursed her lips and arched her eyebrows with so unpleasant an effect on Nancy that she looked away I have no means whatever of forming an opinion But there s no more fear for Horace said Nancy I hope not I think not But my purpose in coming was to consult with you about the poor boy He has renounced me he won t answer my letters and I am so dreadfully afraid that a sort of despair it sounds ridiculous but he is so very young may drive him into reckless living You have taken part with him against me I fear No I haven t I told him I was quite sure the girl had only herself to blame whatever happened How kind of you missus Damerel sank her voice to a sort of cooing not unmelodious but to Nancy s ear a hollow affectation If we could understand each other I am so anxious for your dear brother s happiness and for yours believe me I have suffered greatly since he told me I was his enemy and cast me off Here sounded a note of pathos which impressed the critical listener There was a look too in missus Damerel s eyes quite unlike any that Nancy had yet detected What do you wish him to do she asked If I must tell you the truth I don t think he ll get any good in the life of society Society s representative answered in a tone of affectionate frankness He won t I can see that I don t wish him to live idly The question is What ought he to do I think you know a gentleman of his acquaintance mister Crewe The question was added rather abruptly and with a watchful gaze I know him a little Something has been said I believe about Horace investing money in mister Crewe s business Do you think it would be advisable Surprise kept Nancy silent Is mister Crewe trustworthy I understand he has been in business for himself only a short time Nancy declared herself unable to judge mister Crewe whether in private or in commercial life And here she paused but could not refrain from adding the question whether missus Damerel had personal knowledge of him I have met him once Immediately all Nancy s suspicions were revived She had felt a desire to talk of intimate things with mention of her mother s name but the repulsion excited in her by this woman s air of subtlety by looks movements tones which she did not understand forbade it She could not speak with satisfaction even of Horace feeling that missus Damerel s affection however genuine must needs be baleful From this point her part in the dialogue was slight If any of Miss French s relatives said the visitor presently should accuse me to you you will be able to contradict them I am sure I can depend upon you for that service I am not likely to see them and I should have thought you would care very little what was said about you by people of that kind I care little enough rejoined missus Damerel with a curl of the lips It s Horace I am thinking of These people will embitter him against me so long as they have any ground to go upon But haven t you let him know of that letter missus Damerel seemed to fall into abstraction answered with a vague Yes and after surveying the room said softly So you must live here alone for another two or three years It isn t compulsory it s only a condition Another vague Yes Then I do so wish Horace would come back and make his home here I m afraid you have spoilt him for that said Nancy with relief in this piece of plain speaking missus Damerel did not openly resent it She looked a mild surprise and answered blandly Then I must undo the mischief You shall help me When he has got over this little trouble he will see who are his true friends Let us work together for his good Nancy was inclined once more to reproach herself and listened with patience whilst her relative continued talking in grave kindly tones Lest she should spoil the effect of these impressive remarks missus Damerel then took leave In shaking hands she bent upon the girl a gaze of affection and as she turned away softly sighed Of what had passed in the recent interview with Beatrice French Nancy said nothing to her faithful companion This burden of shame must be borne by herself alone It affected profoundly the courageous mood which had promised to make her life tolerable henceforth she all but abandoned the hope of gaining that end for which she had submitted to so deep a humiliation Through Beatrice would not her secret coloured shamefully become known to Luckworth Crewe and to others Already perchance a growing scandal attached to her name Fear had enabled her to endure dishonour in the eyes of one woman but at any moment the disgrace might front her in an intolerable shape then regardless of the cost she would proclaim her marriage and have in return for all she had suffered nothing but the reproach of an attempted fraud To find employment means of honourable support was an urgent necessity She had written in reply to sundry advertisements but without result She tried to draw up an advertisement on her own account but found the difficulty insuperable What was there she could do Teach children perhaps but as a visiting governess the only position of the kind which circumstances left open to her she could hope for nothing more than the paltriest remuneration Be somebody s secretary That sounded pleasant but very ambitious a sense of incompetency chilled her In an office in a shop who would dream of giving her an engagement Walking about the streets of London in search of suggestions she gained only an understanding of her insignificance In the battle of life every girl who could work a sewing machine or make a matchbox was of more account than she If she entered a shop to make purchases the young women at the counter seemed to smile superiority Of what avail her education her culture The roar of myriad industries made mocking laughter at such futile pretensions She shrank back into her suburban home A little book on employments for women which she saw advertised and bought merely heightened her discouragement Here doubtless were occupations she might learn but when it came to choosing and contemplating the practical steps that must be taken her heart sank She was a coward she dreaded the world she saw as never yet the blessedness of having money and a secure home The word home grew very sweet to her ears A man she said to herself may go forth and find his work his pleasure in the highways but is not a woman s place under the sheltering roof What right had a mother to be searching abroad for tasks and duties Task enough duty obvious in the tending of her child Had she but a little country cottage with needs assured and her baby cradled beside her she would ask no more How idle all the thoughts of her girlhood How little she knew of life as it would reveal itself to her mature eyes Fatigued into listlessness she went to the lending library and chose a novel for an hour s amusement It happened that this story was concerned with the fortunes of a young woman who after many an affliction sore discovered with notable suddenness the path to fame lucre and the husband of her heart she became at a bound a successful novelist Nancy s cheek flushed with a splendid thought Why should not she do likewise At all events for modesty was now her ruling characteristic why should she not earn a little money by writing Stories Numbers of women took to it not a few succeeded It was a pursuit that demanded no apprenticeship that could be followed in the privacy of home a pursuit wherein her education would be of service With imagination already fired by the optimistic author she began to walk about the room and devise romantic incidents A love story of course and why not one very like her own The characters were ready to her hands She would begin this very evening Mary saw the glow upon her face the delightful frenzy in her eyes and wondered I have an idea said Nancy Don t ask me about it Just leave me alone I think I see my way Daily she secluded herself for several hours and whatever the literary value of her labour it plainly kept her in good spirits and benefited her health Save for the visits to her baby regular as before she hardly left home Jessica Morgan came very often much oftener than Nancy desired not only was her talk wearisome but it consumed valuable time She much desired to see the baby and Nancy found it difficult to invent excuses for her unwillingness When importunity could not be otherwise defeated she pretended a conscientious scruple I have deceived my husband in telling him that no one knows of our marriage but Mary If I let you see the child I should feel that I was deceiving him again Don t ask me I can t Not unnaturally this struck Jessica as far fetched She argued against it and became petulant Nancy lost patience but remembered in time that she was at Jessica s mercy and to her mortification had to adopt a coaxing almost a suppliant tone with the result that Miss Morgan s overweening conceit was flattered into arrogance Her sentimental protestations became strangely mixed with a self assertiveness very galling to Nancy s pride Without the slightest apparent cause for ill humour she said one day I do feel sorry for you it must be a dreadful thing to have married a man who has no sense of honour Nancy fired up What do you mean How can he have when he makes you deceive people in this way for the sake of the money he ll get He doesn t It s my own choice Then he oughtn t let you do it No honourable man would That has nothing to do with you Nancy exclaimed anger blanching her cheek Please don t talk about my husband You say things you ought to be ashamed of Oh don t be angry The facile tears started in Jessica s eyes It s because I feel indignant on your account dear I don t want your indignation Never mention this subject again or I shall feel sure you do it on purpose to annoy me Jessica melted into mawkishness none the less Nancy felt a slave to her former friend who for whatever reason seemed to have grown hypocritical and spiteful When next the girl called she was told that Miss Lord had left home for the day a fiction which spared Nancy an hour s torment Miss Morgan made up for it by coming very early on the next Sunday afternoon and preparing herself avowedly for a stay until late in the evening Resolute to avoid a long tete a tete which was sure to exasperate her temper Nancy kept Mary in the room and listened to no hint from Jessica that they should retire for the accustomed privacy At four o clock they were joined by Samuel Barmby whom for once Nancy welcomed with pleasure Samuel who had come in the hope of finding Miss Lord alone gave but the coldest attention to Jessica Mary however he greeted with grave courtesy addressing to her several remarks which were meant as a recognition of social equality in the quondam servant He was dressed with elaborate care Snowy cuffs concealed half his hands his moustache of late in training sketched the graceful curl it would presently achieve a faint perfume attended the drawing forth of his silk handkerchief Samuel never lacked a subject for the display of eloquence Today it was one that called for indignant fervour A most disgraceful fact has come under my notice and I am sorry to say Miss Lord that it concerns some one with whom you are acquainted Indeed said Nancy not without tremor Who is that mister Peachey of De Crespigny Park I believe you are on terms of friendship with the family Oh you can hardly call it friendship I know them Then I may speak without fear of paining you You are aware that mister Peachey is a member of the firm of Ducker Blunt company who manufacture disinfectants Now if any manufacture should be carried on in a conscientious spirit as of course all manufactures should surely it is that of disinfectants Only think what depends upon it People who make disinfectants ought to regard themselves as invested with a sacred trust The whole community looks to them for protection against disease The abuse of such confidence cannot be too severely condemned all the more so that there is absolutely no legal remedy against the adulteration of disinfectants Did you know that Miss Lord The law guards against adulteration of food but it seems I have been making inquiry into the matter that no thought has ever been given by the legislature to the subject of disinfectants Nancy saw that Jessica was watching the speaker with jealous eyes and in spite of prudence she could not help behaving to mister Barmby more graciously than usual a small revenge for the treatment she had suffered at the hands of Miss Morgan I could point out a great number of such anomalies pursued Samuel But this matter of disinfectants is really one of the gravest My father has written to The Times about it and his letter will probably be inserted to morrow I am thinking of bringing it before the attention of our Society Do mister Peachey s people adulterate their disinfectants inquired Nancy I was going to tell you Some acquaintances of ours have had a severe illness in their house and have been using disinfectants made by Ducker Blunt company Fortunately they have a very good medical man and through him it has been discovered that these pretended safeguards are all but absolutely worthless He had the stuff analysed Now isn t this shameful Isn t this abominable For my own part I should call it constructive murder The phrase came by haphazard to Samuel s tongue and he uttered it with gusto repeating it twice or thrice Constructive murder nothing short of that And to think that these people enjoy a positive immunity impunity He corrected himself quickly then uncertain whether he had really made a mistake reddened and twisted his gloves To think he raised his voice that they are capable of making money out of disease and death It is one of the worst illustrations of a corrupt spirit in the commercial life of our times that has yet come under my observation He remained for a couple of hours talking ceaselessly A glance which he now and then cast at Miss Morgan betrayed his hope that she would take her leave before the necessary time of his own departure Jessica perfectly aware of this desire sat as though no less at home than Nancy Every remark she made was a stroke of malice at her friend and in her drawn features appeared the passions by which she was tormented As soon as mister Barmby had regretfully withdrawn Nancy turned upon the girl with flashing eyes I want to speak to you Come downstairs She led the way to the dining room Jessica followed without a word Why are you behaving like this What has come to you The feeble anaemic creature fell back before this outbreak of wholesome wrath her eyes stared in alarm I won t put up with it cried Nancy If you think you can insult me because I trusted you when you were my only friend you ll find your mistake A little more and you shall see how little your power over me is worth Am I to live at your mercy I d starve rather What do you mean by it Oh Nancy to think you should speak to me like this You are to be allowed to spit poison at me are you And I must bear it No that I won t Of course I know what s the matter with you You have fallen in love with Samuel Barmby You have Any one can see it You have no more command of yourself than a child And because he prefers me to you you rage against me Idiot What is Samuel Barmby to me Can I do more to keep him off Can I say to him Do have pity on poor Miss Morgan who She was interrupted by a scream on which followed a torrent of frenzied words from Jessica You re a bad hearted woman You ve behaved disgracefully yourself oh I know more than you think and now you accuse me of being as bad Why did you get married in such a hurry Do you think I didn t understand it It s you who have no command over yourself If the truth were known no decent woman would ever speak to You again And you ve got your reward Pretend as you like I know your husband has deserted you What else could you expect That s what makes you hate every one that hasn t fallen into the mud I wouldn t have such a character as yours All this afternoon you ve been looking at that man as no married woman could who respected herself You encourage him he comes here often Hysterical passion strangled her voice and before she could recover breath Nancy terrible in ire advanced upon her Leave this house and never dare to show yourself here again Do what you like I ll endure you no longer be off Jessica retreated her bloodless lips apart her eyes starting as in suffocation She stumbled against a chair fell to the ground and with a cry of anguish threw herself upon her knees before Nancy What did I say I didn t mean it I don t know what I have been saying it was all madness Oh do forgive me That isn t how I really think of you you know it isn t I m not so wicked as that We have been friends so long I must have gone mad to speak such words Don t drive me away from you dear dear Nancy I implore you to forgive me Look I pray to you on my knees to forget it Despise me for being such a weak wicked creature but don t drive me away like that I didn t mean one word I said Rubbish Of course you meant it You have thought it every day and you ll say it again behind my back if not to my face Stand up and don t make yourself sillier than you are You can t call me anything too bad but don t drive me away I can t bear it You are the only friend I have in the world the only only friend No one was ever kind and good to me but you and this is how I have repaid you Oh I hate myself I could tear my tongue out for saying such things Only say that you ll try to forgive me dear Nancy dear She fell with face upon the carpet and grovelled there in anguish of conflicting passions a lamentable object Unable to bear the sight of her Nancy moved away and stood with back turned perforce hearing the moans and sobs and half articulate words which lasted until the fit of hysteria left its victim in mute exhaustion Then contemptuously pitiful she drew near again to the prostrate figure Stand up at once and let us have an end of this vulgar folly Stand up or I ll leave you here and never speak to you again Nancy can you forgive me I believe you have never got over your illness If I were you I should see the doctor again and try to be cured You ll end in an asylum if you don t mind I often feel almost mad I do really Will you forget those dreadful words I spoke I know you can t forgive me at once Only stand up and try to behave like a reasonable being What do I care for your words The girl raised herself threw her arms over a chair and wept miserably CHAPTER two On an afternoon at the end of October Samuel Barmby returned from business found Miss Morgan having tea with his sisters For a month or two after Midsummer the Barmbys had scarcely seen her now their friendly intercourse was renewed and Jessica came at least once a week She had an engagement at a girls school in this neighbourhood and though her health threatened another collapse she talked of resuming study for the Matriculation of next year Samuel perfectly aware of the slavish homage which Miss Morgan paid him took pleasure in posing before her It never entered his mind to make any return beyond genial patronage but the incense of a female devotee was always grateful to him and he had come to look upon Jessica as a young person peculiarly appreciative of intellectual distinction A week ago walking with her to the omnibus after an evening she had spent in Dagmar Road he had indulged a spirit of confidence and led her to speak of Nancy Lord The upshot of five minutes conversation was a frank inquiry which he could hardly have permitted himself but for the shadow of night and the isolating noises around them As an intimate friend did she feel able to tell him whether or not Miss Lord was engaged to be married Jessica after a brief silence answered that she did not feel at liberty to disclose what she knew on the subject but the words she used and her voice in uttering them left no doubt as to her meaning Samuel said no more At parting he pressed the girl s hand warmly This afternoon they began by avoiding each other s look Samuel seemed indisposed for conversation he sipped at a cup of tea with an abstracted and somewhat weary air until Miss Morgan addressed him To morrow is the evening of your lecture isn t it mister Barmby To morrow By the agency of a friend who belonged to a society of mutual improvement at Pentonville Samuel had been invited to go over and illumine with his wisdom the seekers after culture in that remote district a proposal that flattered him immensely and inspired him with a hope of more than suburban fame For some months he had spoken of the engagement He was to discourse upon National Greatness its Obligations and its Dangers Of course it will be printed afterwards pursued the devotee Oh I don t know It s hardly worth that Oh I m sure it will be And Jessica appealed to the sisters who declared that certain passages they had been privileged to hear seemed to them very remarkable Ladies were to be admitted but the Miss Barmbys felt afraid to undertake so long a journey after dark I know some one who would very much like to go said Jessica steadying her voice Could you spare me a ticket to give away mister Barmby Samuel smiled graciously and promised the ticket Of course it was for Jessica s own use On the following evening long before the hour which would have allowed her ample time to reach Pentonville by eight o clock she set forth excitedly Unless Samuel Barmby were accompanied by some friend from Camberwell only too probable she might hope to make the return journey under his protection Perhaps he would speak again of Nancy Lord and this time he should be answered with less reserve What harm if she even told him the name of the man whom Nancy was engaged to marry Nancy was no longer her friend A show of reconciliation had followed that scene on the Sunday afternoon three months ago but Jessica well knew that she had put herself beyond forgiveness nor did she desire it Even without the memory of her offence by this time she must needs have regarded Nancy with steadfast dislike Weeks had gone by since their last meeting which was rendered so unpleasant by mutual coldness that a renewal of intercourse seemed out of the question She would not be guilty of treachery But in justice to herself she might give Samuel Barmby to understand how hopeless was his wooing To her disappointment the lecture room was small and undignified she had imagined a capacious hall with Samuel Bennett Barmby standing up before an audience of several hundred people The cane bottomed chairs numbered not more than fifty and at eight o clock some of them were still unoccupied Nor did the assembly answer to her expectation It seemed to consist of young shopmen with a few females of their kind interspersed She chose a place in the middle of the room where the lecturer could hardly fail to observe her presence With Barmby s entrance disillusion gave way before the ardours of flesh and spirit The whole hour through she never took her eyes from him His smooth pink face with its shining moustache embodied her ideal of manly beauty his tall figure inflamed her senses the words that fell from his lips sounded to her with oracular impressiveness conveying a wisdom before which she bowed and a noble enthusiasm to which she responded in fervent exaltation And she had been wont to ridicule this man to join in mockery of his eloquence with a conceited wanton such as Nancy Lord No it never came from her heart it was moral cowardice from the first she had recognised Samuel Barmby s infinite superiority to the ignoble the impure girl who dared to deride him He saw her their eyes met once and again and yet again He knew that she alone in the audience could comprehend his noble morality grasp the extent of his far sighted speculations To her he spoke And in his deep glowing heart he could not but thank her for such evidence of sympathy There followed a tedious debate a muddy flow of gabble and balderdash It was over by ten o clock With jealous eyes she watched her hero surrounded by people who thought poor creatures that they were worthy of offering him congratulations At a distance she lingered And behold his eye once more fell upon her He came out from among the silly chatterers and walked towards her You played me a trick Miss Morgan I should never have allowed you to come all this way to hear me If I had come ten times the distance I should have been repaid His round eyes gloated upon the flattery Well well I mustn t pretend that I think the lecture worthless But you might have had the manuscript to read Are you quite alone Then I must take care of you It s a wretched night we ll have a cab to King s Cross He said it with a consciousness of large handed generosity Jessica s heart leapt and throbbed She was by his side in the vehicle Her body touched his She felt his warm breath as he talked In all too short a time they reached the railway station Did you come this way Have you a ticket Leave that to me Again largely generous he strode to the booking office They descended and stood together upon the platform among hurrying crowds in black fumes that poisoned the palate with sulphur This way and that sped the demon engines whirling lighted waggons full of people Shrill whistles the hiss and roar of steam the bang clap bang of carriage doors the clatter of feet on wood and stone all echoed and reverberated from a huge cloudy vault above them High and low on every available yard of wall advertisements clamoured to the eye theatres journals soaps medicines concerts furniture wines prayer meetings all the produce and refuse of civilisation announced in staring letters in daubed effigies base paltry grotesque A battle ground of advertisements fitly chosen amid subterranean din and reek a symbol to the gaze of that relentless warfare which ceases not night and day in the world above For the southward train they had to wait ten minutes Jessica keeping as close as possible to her companion s side tried to converse but her thoughts were in a tumult like to that about her She felt a faintness a quivering in her limbs May I sit down for a moment she said looking at Barmby with a childlike appeal To be sure She pointed in a direction away from the crowd I have something to say it s quieter Samuel evinced surprise but allowed himself to be led towards the black mouth of the tunnel whence at that moment rushed an engine with glaring lights upon its breast We may not be alone in the train continued Jessica There s something you ought to know I must tell you to night You were asking me about Nancy Lord She spoke with panting breath and looked fixedly at him The eagerness with which he lent ear gave her strength to proceed You asked me if she was engaged Yes well He had even forgotten his politeness he saw in her a mere source of information Jessica moved closer to him on the bench Had you any reason for thinking she was No particular reason except something strange in her behaviour Would you like to know the whole truth It was a very cold night and a keen wind swept the platform but Jessica though indifferently clad felt no discomfort from this cause Yet she pressed closer to her companion so that her cheek all but touched his shoulder Of course I should Barmby answered Is there any mystery I oughtn t to tell Then you had better not But why did you begin You ought to know Why ought I to know Because you She broke off A sudden chill made her teeth chatter Well why asked Samuel with impatience Are you are you in love with her Voice and look embarrassed him So did the girl s proximity she was now all but leaning on his shoulder Respectable mister Barmby could not be aware that Jessica s state of mind rendered her scarcely responsible for what she said or did That s a very plain question he began but she interrupted him I oughtn t to ask it There s no need for you to answer I know you have wanted to marry her for a long time But you never will Perhaps not if she has promised somebody else If I tell you will you be kind to me Kind I didn t mean that she added hurriedly I mean will you understand that I felt it a duty I oughtn t to tell a secret but it s a secret that oughtn t to be kept Will you understand that I did it out of out of friendship for you and because I thought it right Oh certainly After going so far you had better tell me and have done with it Jessica approached her lips to his ear and whispered She is married What Impossible She was married at Teignmouth just before she came back from her holiday last year Well Upon my word And that s why she has been away in Cornwall Again Jessica whispered her body quivering the while She has a child It was born last May Well Upon my word Now I understand Who could have imagined You see what she is She hides it for the sake of the money But who is her husband asked Samuel staring at the bloodless face A man called Tarrant a relative of mister Vawdrey of Champion Hill She thought he was rich I don t know whether he is or not but I believe he doesn t mean to come back to her He s in America now Barmby questioned and Jessica answered until there was nothing left to ask or to tell save the one thing which rose suddenly to Jessica s lips You won t let her know that I have told you Samuel gravely but coldly assured her that she need not fear betrayal CHAPTER three It was to be in three volumes She saw her way pretty clearly to the end of the first she had ideas for the second the third must take care of itself until she reached it Hero and heroine ready to her hand subordinate characters vaguely floating in the background After an hour or two of meditation she sat down and dashed at Chapter One Long before the end of the year it ought to be finished But in August came her baby s first illness for nearly a fortnight she was away from home and on her return though no anxiety remained she found it difficult to resume work The few chapters completed had a sorry look they did not read well not at all like writing destined to be read in print After a week s disheartenment she made a new beginning At the end of September baby again alarmed her A trivial ailment as before but she could not leave the child until all was well Again she reviewed her work and with more repugnance than after the previous interruption But go on with it she must and would The distasteful labour slow wearisome often performed without pretence of hope went on until October Then she broke down Mary Woodruff found her crying by the fireside feverish and unnerved I can t sleep she said I hear the clock strike every hour night after night But she would not confess the cause In writing her poor novel she had lived again through the story enacted at Teignmouth and her heart failed beneath its burden of hopeless longing Her husband had forsaken her Even if she saw him again what solace could be found in the mere proximity of a man who did not love her who had never loved her The child was not enough its fatherless estate enhanced the misery of her own solitude When the leaves fell and the sky darkened and the long London winter gloomed before her she sank with a moan of despair Mary s strength and tenderness were now invaluable By sheer force of will she overcame the malady in its physical effects and did wonders in the assailing of its moral source Her appeal now as formerly was to the nobler pride always struggling for control in Nancy s character A few days of combat with the besieging melancholy that threatened disaster and Nancy could meet her friend s look with a smile She put away and turned the key upon her futile scribbling no more of that Novel writing was not her vocation she must seek again Early in the afternoon she made ready to go forth on the only business which now took her from home It was nearly a week since she had seen her boy Opening the front door she came unexpectedly under two pairs of eyes Face to face with her stood Samuel Barmby his hand raised to signal at the knocker just withdrawn from him And behind Barmby was a postman holding a letter which in another moment would have dropped into the box Samuel performed the civil salute Ha How do you do Miss Lord You are going out I m afraid Yes I am going out She replied mechanically and in speaking took the letter held out to her A glance at it sent all her blood rushing upon the heart I want to see you particularly said Samuel Could I call again this afternoon Nancy gazed at him but did not hear He saw the sudden pallor of her cheeks and thought he understood it As she stood like a statue he spoke again It is very particular business If you could give me an appointment Business Oh come in if you like She drew back to admit him but in the passage stood looking at her letter Barmby was perplexed and embarrassed You had rather I called again Called again Just as you like Oh then I will stay said Samuel bluntly For he had things in mind which disposed him to resent this flagrant discourtesy His voice awakened Nancy She opened the door of the dining room Will you sit down mister Barmby and excuse me for a few minutes Certainly Don t let me inconvenience you Miss Lord At another time Nancy would have remarked something very unusual in his way of speaking especially in the utterance of her name But for the letter in her hand she must have noticed with uneasiness a certain severity of countenance which had taken the place of Barmby s wonted smile As it was she scarcely realised his presence and on closing the door of the room he had entered she forthwith forgot that such a man existed Her letter His handwriting at last And he was in England She flew up to her bedroom and tore open the envelope He was in London Great College Street S W A short letter soon read DEAREST NANCY I am ashamed to write yet write I must All your letters reached me there was no reason for my silence but the unwillingness to keep sending bad news I have still nothing good to tell you but here I am in London again and you must know of it When I posted my last letter to you from New York I meant to come back as soon as I could get money enough to pay my passage Since then I have gone through a miserable time idle for the most part ill for a few weeks and occasionally trying to write something that editors would pay for But after all I had to borrow It has brought me home steerage if you know what that means and now I must earn more If we were to meet I might be able to say something else I can t write it Let me hear from you if you think me worth a letter Yours ever dear girl L For a quarter of an hour she stood with this sheet open as though still reading Her face was void of emotion she had a vacant look cheerless but with no more decided significance Then she remembered that Samuel Barmby was waiting for her downstairs He might have something to say which really concerned her Better see him at once and get rid of him With slow step she descended to the dining room The letter folded and rolled she carried in her hand I m sorry to have kept you waiting mister Barmby Don t mention it Will you sit down Yes of course She spoke abstractedly and took a seat not far from him I was just going out but there s no hurry I hardly know how to begin Perhaps I had better prepare you by saying that I have received very strange information His air was magisterial he subdued his voice to a note of profound solemnity What sort of information asked Nancy vaguely her brows knitted in a look rather of annoyance than apprehension Very strange indeed You have said that already Her temper was failing She felt a nervous impulse to behave rudely to declare the contempt it was always difficult to disguise when talking with Barmby I repeat it because you seem to have no idea what I am going to speak of I am the last person to find pleasure in such a disagreeable duty as is now laid upon me In that respect I believe you will do me justice Will you speak plainly This roundabout talk is intolerable Samuel drew himself up and regarded her with offended dignity He had promised himself no small satisfaction from this interview had foreseen its salient points His mere aspect would be enough to subdue Nancy and when he began to speak she would tremble before him Such a moment would repay him for the enforced humility of years Perhaps she would weep she might even implore him to be merciful How to act in that event he had quite made up his mind But all such anticipations were confused by Nancy s singular behaviour She seemed in truth not to understand the hints which should have overwhelmed her More magisterial than ever he began to speak with slow emphasis Miss Lord I will still address you by that name though for a very long time I have regarded you as a person worthy of all admiration and have sincerely humbled myself before you I cannot help thinking that a certain respect is due to me Even though I find that you have deceived me as to your position the old feelings are still so strong in me that I could not bear to give you needless pain Instead of announcing to my father and to other people the strange facts which I have learnt I come here as a friend I speak with all possible forbearance I do my utmost to spare you Am I not justified in expecting at least courteous treatment A pause of awful impressiveness The listener fully conscious at length of the situation she had to face fell into a calmer mood All was over Suspense and the burden of falsehood had no longer to be endured Her part now for this hour at all events was merely to stand by whilst Fate unfolded itself Please say whatever you have to say mister Barmby she replied with quiet civility I believe your intention was good You made me nervous that was all Pray forgive me Perhaps it will be best if I ask you a simple question You will see that the position I hold under your father s will leaves me no choice but to ask it Is it true that you are married I will answer if you tell me how you came to think that I was married I have been credibly informed By whom You must forgive me I can t tell you the name Then I can t answer your question Samuel mused He was unwilling to break a distinct promise No doubt said Nancy you have undertaken not to mention the person I have If it is some one who used to be a friend of mine you needn t have any scruples She as good as told me what she meant to do Of course it is Miss Morgan As you have yourself spoken the name Very well She isn t in her senses and I wonder she has kept the secret so long You admit the truth of what she has told me Yes I am married She made the avowal in a tone very like that in which to Beatrice French she had affirmed the contrary And your true name is missus Tarrant That is my name The crudely masculine in Barmby prompted one more question but some other motive checked him He let his eyes wander slowly about the room Even yet there was a chance of playing off certain effects which he had rehearsed with gusto Can you imagine his voice shook a little how much I suffer in hearing you say this If you mean that you still had the hopes expressed in your letter some time ago I can only say in my defence that I gave you an honest answer Yes You said you could never marry me But of course I couldn t understand it in this sense It is a blow I find it very hard to bear He rose and went to the window as if ashamed of the emotion he could not command Nancy too much occupied with her own troubles to ask or care whether his distress was genuine laid Tarrant s letter upon a side table and began to draw off her gloves Then she unbuttoned her jacket These out of door garments oppressed her Samuel turned his head and came slowly back There are things that might be said but I will not say them Most men in my position would yield to the temptation of revenge But for many years I have kept in view a moral ideal and now I have the satisfaction of conquering my lower self You shall not hear one word of reproach from my lips He waited for the reply the expected murmur of gratitude Nancy said nothing missus Tarrant he stood before her what do you suppose must be the result of this There can only be one You mean the ruin of your prospects But do you forget that all the money you have received since mister Lord s death has been obtained by false pretences Are you not aware that this is a criminal offence Nancy raised her eyes and looked steadily at him Then I must bear the punishment For a minute Barmby enjoyed her suffering Of his foreseen effects this one had come nearest to succeeding But he was not satisfied he hoped she would beseech his clemency The punishment might be very serious I really can t say what view my father may take of this deception Is there any use in talking about it I am penniless that s all you have to tell me What else I have to bear I shall know soon enough One thing I must ask Isn t your husband in a position to support you I can t answer that Please to say nothing about my husband Barmby caught at hope It might be true as Jessica Morgan believed that Nancy was forsaken The man Tarrant might be wealthy enough to disregard her prospects In that case an assiduous lover one who by the exercise of a prudent generosity had obtained power over the girl could yet hope for reward Samuel had as little of the villain in his composition as any Camberwell householder He cherished no dark designs But after the manner of his kind he was in love with Nancy and even the long pursuit of a lofty ideal does not render a man proof against the elementary forces of human nature We will suppose then he said with a certain cheerfulness that you have nothing whatever to depend upon but your father s will What is before you How can you live That is my own affair It was not said offensively but in a tone of bitter resignation Barmby sat down opposite to her and leaned forward Do you think for one moment his voice was softly melodious that I I who have loved you for years could let you suffer for want of money He had not skill to read her countenance Trouble he discerned and shame but the half veiled eyes the quivering nostril the hard cold lips spoke a language beyond Samuel s interpretation Even had he known of the outrages previously inflicted upon her pride and that this new attack came at a moment when her courage was baffled her heart cruelly wounded he would just as little have comprehended the spirit which now kept her mute He imagined her overcome by his generosity Another of his great effects had come off with tolerable success Put your mind at rest he pursued mellifluously You shall suffer no hardships I answer for it Still mute and her head bowed low Such is the power of nobility displayed before an erring soul You have never done me justice Confess that you haven t To this remarkable appeal Nancy perforce replied I never thought ill of you When she had spoken colour came into her cheeks Observing it Samuel was strangely moved Had he impressed her even more profoundly than he hoped to do Jessica Morgan s undisguised subjugation had flattered him into credulity respecting his influence over the female mind But you didn t think me capable of of anything extraordinary Even in her torment Nancy marvelled at this revelation of fatuity She did not understand the pranks of such a mind as Barmby s when its balance is disturbed by exciting circumstance What are you offering me she asked in a low voice How could I take money from you I didn t mean that you should Your secret has been betrayed to me Suppose I refuse to know anything about it and leave things as they were Nancy kept her eyes down Suppose I say Duty bids me injure this woman who has injured me but no I will not Suppose I say I can make her regret bitterly that she married that other man but no I will not Suppose instead of making your secret known I do my utmost to guard it What would be your opinion of this behaviour I should think it was kindly meant but useless Useless Why Because it isn t in your power to guard the secret Jessica Morgan won t leave her work half done If that s all I say again that you can put your mind at rest I answer for Miss Morgan With her my will is law Samuel smiled A smile ineffable The smile of a suburban deity Why should you take any trouble about me said Nancy I can do nothing for you in return You can She looked anxiously at him for his voice sounded ominous What You can acknowledge that you never did me justice It s true that I didn t she answered languidly speaking as though the concession mattered little Barmby brightened His hands were upon his knees he raised his chin and smiled at vacancy You thought me unworthy of you You can confess to me that you were mistaken I didn t know you as I do now fell from the expressionless lips Thank you for saying that Well then your anxiety is at an end You are not in the hands of a mercenary enemy but of a man whose principles forbid him to do anything ignoble who has an ideal of life the result of much study and thought You have never heard me speak about religion but you would be gravely mistaken if you thought I had no religious convictions Some day I shall treat that subject before our Society and it is probable that my views will give rise to a good deal of discussion I have formed a religion for myself when I write my essay I think I shall call it The Religion of a Man of Business One of the great evils of the day is the vulgar supposition that commerce has nothing to do with religious faith I shall show how utterly wrong that is It would take too long to explain to you my mature views of Christianity I am not sure that I recognise any of the ordinary dogmas I think I have progressed beyond them However we shall have many opportunities of talking about these things Nancy uttered a mere Yes She was looking at Tarrant s letter on the side table and wishing to be alone that she might read it again In the meantime Samuel pursued whatever difficulty arises confide it to me Probably you will wish to tell me more before long you know that I am not unworthy to be your adviser And so let us shake hands in sign of genuine friendship Nancy gave her fingers which felt very cold upon Barmby s warm moist palm This conversation has been trying to you he said but relief of mind will soon follow If anything occurs to me that may help to soothe you I will write Thank you At the beginning of our interview you didn t think it would end like this There was something of the boy in Samuel perhaps the wholesomest part of him Having manifested his admirable qualities he felt a light hearted pleasure in asking for renewed assurance of the good opinion he had earned I hardly cared said Nancy as she rose with a sigh of weariness But you have got over that You will be quite cheerful now In time no doubt I shall call again let us say on Wednesday evening By that time I shall be able to put you entirely at ease with regard to Miss Morgan Nancy made no reply In shaking hands she regarded the radiant Samuel with a dreamy interest and when he had left her she still gazed for a few moments at the door CHAPTER four The habit of confidence prompted Nancy to seek Mary Woodruff and show her the long expected letter But for Barmby s visit she would have done so As it was her mind sullenly resisted the natural impulse Forlorn misery intensified by successive humiliations whereof the latest was the bitterest hardened her even against the one the indubitable friend to whom she had never looked in vain for help and solace Of course it was not necessary to let Mary know with what heart breaking coldness Tarrant had communicated the fact of his return but she preferred to keep silence altogether Having sunk so low as to accept with semblance of gratitude pompous favours dishonouring connivance at the hands of Samuel Barmby she would now stand alone in her uttermost degradation Happen what might she would act and suffer in solitude Something she had in mind to do which Mary if told of it would regard with disapproval Mary was not a deserted and insulted wife she could reason and counsel with the calmness of one who sympathised but had nothing worse to endure Even Mary s sympathy was necessarily imperfect since she knew not and should never know what had passed in the crucial interviews with Beatrice French with Jessica Morgan and with Samuel Barmby Bent on indulging her passionate sense of injury hungering for a taste of revenge however poor Nancy executed with brief delay a project which had come into her head during the hour of torture just elapsed She took a sheet of notepaper and upon it wrote half a dozen lines thus As your reward for marrying me is still a long way off and as you tell me that you are in want I send you as much as I can spare at present Next month you shall hear from me again Within the paper she folded a five pound note and placed both in an envelope which she addressed to Lionel Tarrant esquire at his lodgings in Westminster Having posted this at the first pillar box she walked on Her only object was to combat mental anguish by bodily exercise to distract if possible the thoughts which hammered upon her brain by moving amid the life of the streets In Camberwell Road she passed the place of business inscribed with the names Lord and Barmby it made her think not of the man who from being an object of her good natured contempt was now become a hated enemy but of her father and she mourned for him with profounder feeling than when her tears flowed over his new made grave But for headstrong folly incredible in the retrospect that father would have been her dear and honoured companion her friend in every best sense of the word her guide and protector Many and many a time had he invited her affection her trust For long years it was in her power to make him happy and in doing so to enrich her own life to discipline her mind as no study of books even had it been genuine ever could Oh to have the time back again the despised privilege the thwarted embittered love She was beginning to understand her father to surmise with mature intelligence the causes of his seeming harshness To her own boy when he was old enough she would talk of him and praise him Perhaps even thus late his spirit of stern truthfulness might bear fruit in her life and in her son s The tender memory and pure resolve did not long possess her They soon yielded before the potency of present evil and for an hour or more she walked along the sordid highway nursing passions which struck their venom into her heart It was one of those cold dry clouded evenings of autumn when London streets affect the imagination with a peculiar suggestiveness New lit lamps sickly yellow under the dying day stretch in immense vistas unobscured by fog but exhibit no detail of the track they will presently illumine one by one the shop fronts grow radiant on deepening gloom and show in silhouette the figures numberless that are hurrying past By accentuating a pause between the life of daytime and that which will begin after dark this grey hour excites to an unwonted perception of the city s vastness and of its multifarious labour melancholy yet not dismal the brooding twilight seems to betoken Nature s compassion for myriad mortals exiled from her beauty and her solace Noises far and near blend into a muffled murmur sound s equivalent of the impression received by the eye it seems to utter the weariness of unending ineffectual toil Nancy had now walked as far as Newington a district unfamiliar to her and repulsive By the Elephant and Castle she stood watching the tumultuous traffic which whirls and roars at this confluence of six highways she had neither a mind to go on nor yet to return The conductor of an omnibus close at hand kept bellowing London Bridge and her thoughts wandered to that day of meeting with Luckworth Crewe when he took her up the Monument She had never felt more than an idle interest in Crewe and whenever she remembered him nowadays it was only to reflect with bitterness that he doubtless knew a part of her secret the part that was known to Beatrice French and on that account had ceased to urge his suit yet at this moment she wished that she had pledged herself to him in good faith His behaviour argued the steadfast devotion of an honest man however lacking in refinement Their long engagement would have been brightened with many hopes in the end she might have learned to love him and prosperity would have opened to her a world of satisfactions for which she could no longer hope It grew cold She allowed the movements of a group of people to direct her steps and went eastward along New Kent Road But when the shops were past and only a dreary prospect of featureless dwellings lay before her she felt her heart sink and paused in vacillating wretchedness From a house near by sounded a piano a foolish jingle but it smote her with a longing for companionship for friendly cheerful talk And then of a sudden she determined that this life of intolerable isolation should come to an end Her efforts to find employment that would bring her among people had failed simply because she applied to strangers who knew nothing of her capabilities and cared nothing for her needs But a way offered itself if she could overcome the poor lingering vestiges of pride and shame which hitherto had seemed to render it impossible In this hour her desolate spirit rejected everything but the thought of relief to be found in new occupation fresh society She had endured to the limit of strength Under the falling night before the grey vision of a city which by its alien business and pleasure made her a mere outcast she all at once found hope in a resource which till now had signified despair Summoning the first empty cab she gave an address known to her only by hearsay that of the South London Fashionable Dress Supply Association and was driven thither in about a quarter of an hour The shop with its windows cunningly laid out to allure the female eye spread a brilliant frontage between two much duller places of business at the doorway stood a commissionaire distributing some newly printed advertisements to the persons who entered or who paused in passing Nancy accepted a paper without thinking about it and went through the swing doors held open for her by a stripling in buttons she approached a young woman at the nearest counter and in a low voice asked whether Miss French was on the premises I m not sure madam I will inquire at once She calls me madam said Nancy to herself whilst waiting So do shopkeepers generally I suppose I look old The young person she honeyed a Cockney twang speedily came back to report that Miss French had left about half an hour ago and was not likely to return Can you give me her private address Not having seen Miss French since the latter s unwelcome call in Grove Lane she only knew that Beatrice had left De Crespigny Park to inhabit a flat somewhere or other I wish to see her particularly on business Excuse me a moment madam On returning the young person requested Nancy to follow her up the shop and led into a glass partitioned office where at a table covered with fashion plates sat a middle aged man with a bald head of peculiar lustre He rose and bowed Nancy repeated her request Could I despatch a message for you madam My business is private The bald headed man coughed urbanely and begged to know her name Miss Lord of Grove Lane Immediately his countenance changed from deprecating solemnity to a broad smile of recognition Miss Lord Oh to be sure I will give you the address at once Pray pardon my questions we have to be so very careful So many people desire private interviews with Miss French I will jot down the address He did so on the back of an advertisement and added verbal directions Nancy hurried away Another cab conveyed her to Brixton and set her down before a block of recently built flats She ascended to the second floor pressed the button of a bell and was speedily confronted by a girl of the natty parlour maid species This time she began by giving her name and had only a moment to wait before she was admitted to a small drawing room furnished with semblance of luxury A glowing fire and the light of an amber shaded lamp showed as much fashionable upholstery and bric a brac as could be squeezed into the narrow space Something else was perceptible which might perhaps have been dispensed with to wit the odour of a very savoury meal a meal in which fried onions had no insignificant part But before the visitor could comment to herself upon this disadvantage attaching to flats Beatrice joined her I could hardly believe it So you have really looked me up Awfully jolly of you I m quite alone we ll have a bit of dinner together Miss French was in her most expansive mood She understood the call as one of simple friendliness I wasn t sure that you knew the address Got it at the shop They don t go telling everybody I hope Some one there seemed to know my name said Nancy whom the warmth and light and cheery welcome encouraged in the step she had taken And she explained Ah mister Clatworthy rum old cove when you get to know him Yes yes no doubt he has heard me speak of you in a general way you know Come into my snooze corner and take your things off The snooze corner commonly called a bedroom lacked one detail of comfort pure air The odour of dinner blending with toilet perfumes made an atmosphere decidedly oppressive Beatrice remarked on the smallness of the chamber adding archly But I sleep single What s your brother doing she asked while helping to remove Nancy s jacket I passed him in Oxford Street the other day and he either didn t see me or didn t want to Thought he looked rather dissipated I know very little about him answered the visitor who spoke and acted without reflection conscious chiefly at this moment of faintness induced by fatigue and hunger Fanny s in Paris pursued Miss French Writes as if she was amusing herself I think I shall run over and have a look at her Seen Ada She s been playing the fool as usual Found out that Arthur had taken the kid to his sister s at Canterbury went down and made a deuce of a kick up they had to chuck her out of the house Of course she cares no more about the child than I do it s only to spite her husband She s going to law with him she says She won t leave the house in De Crespigny Park and she s running up bills you bet Nancy tried to laugh The effort and its semi success indicated surrender to her companion s spirit rather than any attention to the subject spoken of They returned to the drawing room but had not time to begin a conversation before the servant summoned them to dinner A very satisfying meal it proved not badly cooked as cooking is understood in Brixton and served with more of ceremony than the guest had expected Fried scallops rump steak smothered in onions an apple tart and very sound Stilton cheese Such fare testified to the virile qualities of Beatrice s mind she was above the feminine folly of neglecting honest victuals Moreover there appeared two wines sherry and claret Did you ever try this kind of thing said the hostess finally reaching a box of cigarettes I Of course not Nancy replied with a laugh It s expected of a sensible woman now a days I ve got to like it Better try no need to make yourself uncomfortable Just keep the smoke in your mouth for half a minute and blow it out prettily I buy these in the Haymarket special brand for women And you dine like this by yourself every day Like this but not always alone Some one or other drops in Luckworth Crewe was here yesterday Speaking she watched Nancy who bore the regard with carelessness and replied lightly It s an independent sort of life at all events Just the kind of life that suits me I m my own mistress There was a suggested allusion in the sly tone of the last phrase but Nancy thinking her own thoughts did not perceive it As the servant had left them alone they could now talk freely Beatrice by her frequent glance of curiosity seemed to await some explanation of a visit so unlooked for How are things going with you she asked at length tapping the ash of her cigarette over a plate I want something to do was the blunt reply Too much alone isn t that it Yes Just what I thought You don t see him often Nancy had ceased her pretence of smoking and leaned back A flush on her face and something unwonted in the expression of her eyes something like a smile yet touched with apathy told of physical influences which assisted her resolve to have done with scruple and delicacy She handled her wine glass which was half full and before answering raised it to her lips No I don t see him often Well I told you to come to me if I could be any use What s your idea Do you know of anything I could do It isn t so much to earn money as to to be occupied and escape from loneliness But I must have two afternoons in the week to myself Beatrice nodded and smiled No not for that Nancy added hastily To see my boy The other appeared to accept this correction All right I think I can find you something We re opening a branch She mentioned the locality There ll be a club room like at headquarters and we shall want some one ladylike to sit there and answer questions You wouldn t be likely to see any one that knows you and you d get a good deal of fun out of it Hours from ten to five but Saturday afternoon off and Wednesday after three if that would do Yes that would do very well Any payment at first Oh we wouldn t be so mean as all that Say ten shillings a week till Christmas and afterwards we could see she laughed whether you re worth more I know nothing about fashions You can learn all you need to know in an hour It s the ladylike appearance and talk more than anything else Nancy sipped again from her wine glass When could I begin The place ll be ready on Monday week Next week you might put in a few hours with us Just sit and watch and listen that s all to get the hang of the thing Thank you for being so ready to help me Not a bit of it I haven t done yet There s a condition If I fix up this job for you will you tell me something I want to know Nancy turned her eyes apprehensively You can guess what it is I quite believe what you told me some time ago but I shan t feel quite easy until I know She finished the sentence with a look Nancy s eyes fell Curiosity nothing else added the other Just to make quite sure it isn t anybody I ve thought of There was a long silence Leaning forward upon the table Nancy turned her wine glass about and about She now had a very high colour and breathed quickly Is it off then said Beatrice in an indifferent tone Thereupon Nancy disclosed the name of her husband her lover as Miss French thought him Plied with further questions she told where he was living but gave no account of the circumstances that had estranged them Abundantly satisfied Beatrice grew almost affectionate and talked merrily Nancy wished to ask whether Luckworth Crewe had any knowledge of her position It was long before her lips could utter the words but at length they were spoken And Beatrice assured her that Crewe good silly fellow did not even suspect the truth CHAPTER five For a man said Tarrant who can pay no more than twelve and sixpence a week it s the best accommodation to be found in London There s an air of civilisation about the house Look a bath and a little book case and an easy chair such as can be used by a man who respects himself You feel you are among people who tub o mornings and know the meaning of leisure Then the view He was talking to his friend Harvey Munden the journalist The room in which they stood might with advantage have been larger but as a bed chamber it served well enough and only the poverty of its occupant who put it to the additional use of sitting room and study made the lack of space particularly noticeable The window afforded a prospect pleasant enough to eyes such as theirs Above the lower houses on the opposite side of the way appeared tall trees in the sere garb of later autumn growing by old Westminster School and beyond them grey in twilight rose the towers of the Abbey From this point of view no vicinage of modern brickwork spoilt their charm the time worn monitors stood alone against a sky of ruddy smoke drift and purple cloud The old Adam is stronger than ever in me he pursued If I were condemned for life to the United States I should go mad and perish in an attempt to swim the Atlantic Then why did you stay so long I could have stayed with advantage even longer It s something to have studied with tolerable thoroughness the most hateful form of society yet developed I saw it at first as a man does who is living at his ease at last as a poor devil who is thankful for the institution of free lunches I went first class and I came back as a steerage passenger It has been a year well spent It had made him in aspect more than a twelve month older His lounging attitude the spirit of his talk showed that he was unchanged in bodily and mental habits but certain lines new graven upon his visage and an austerity that had taken the place of youthful self consciousness signified a more than normal progress in experience Do you know said Munden slyly that you have brought back a trans Atlantic accent Accent The devil I don t believe it Intonation at all events Tarrant professed a serious annoyance If that s true I ll go and live for a month in Limerick It would be cheaper to join a Socialist club in the East End But just tell me how you stand How long can you hold out in these aristocratic lodgings Till Christmas I m ashamed to say how I ve got the money so don t ask I reached London with empty pockets And I ll tell you one thing I have learnt Munden There s no villainy no scoundrelism no baseness conceivable that isn t excused by want of money I understand the whole social question The man who has never felt the perspiration come out on his forehead in asking himself how he is going to keep body and soul together has no right to an opinion on the greatest question of the day What particular scoundrelism or baseness have you committed asked the other Tarrant averted his eyes I said I could understand such things One sees that you have been breathed upon by democracy I loathe the word and the thing even more than I did which is saying a good deal Be it so You say you are going to work Yes I have come back to work Even now it s difficult to realise that I must work or starve I understand how fellows who have unexpectedly lost their income go through life sponging on relatives and friends I understand how an educated man goes sinking through all the social grades down to the common lodging house and the infirmary And I honestly believe there s only one thing that saves me from doing likewise And what s that I can t tell you not yet at all events I always thought you a very fine specimen of the man born to do nothing said Munden with that smile which permitted him a surprising candour in conversation And you were quite right returned Tarrant with a laugh I am a born artist in indolence It s the pity of pities that circumstances will frustrate Nature s purpose You think you can support yourself by journalism I must try Run your eye over that He took from the table a slip of manuscript headed A Reverie in Wall Street Munden read it sat thoughtful for a moment and laughed Devilish savage Did you write it after a free lunch Wrote it this morning Shall I try one of the evening papers with it or one of the weeklies Munden suggested a few alterations and mentioned the journal which he thought might possibly find room for such a bit of satire Done anything else Here s a half finished paper The Commercial Prospects of the Bahamas Let me look After reading a page or two with critically wrinkled forehead Munden laid it down Seems pretty solid libellous too I should say You ve more stuff in you than I thought All right go ahead Come and dine with me to morrow to meet a man who may be useful To morrow I can t I dine at Lady Pollard s Who is she Didn t you know Pollard of Trinity the only son of his mother and she a widow Next day then Can t I dine with some people at Bedford Park Munden lifted his eyebrows At this rate you may live pretty well on a dress suit Any more engagements None that I know of But I shall accept all that offer I m hungry for the society of decent English people I used to neglect my acquaintances I know better now Go and live for a month in a cheap New York boarding house and you ll come out with a wholesome taste for English refinement To enable his friend to read Tarrant had already lit a lamp Munden glancing about the room said carelessly Do you still possess the furniture of the old place No was the answer given with annoyance Vawdrey had it sold for me Pictures books and all the nick nacks Everything Of course I m sorry for it but I thought at the time that I shouldn t return to England for some years You never said anything of that kind to me No I didn t the other replied gloomily And all at once he fell into so taciturn a mood that his companion after a few more remarks and inquiries rose from his chair to leave From seven to nine Tarrant sat resolutely at his table and covered a few pages with the kind of composition which now came most easily to him a somewhat virulent sarcasm He found pleasure in the work but after nine o clock his thoughts strayed to matters of personal interest and got beyond control Would the last post of the evening bring him an answer to a letter he had despatched this morning At length he laid down his pen and listened nervously for that knock which at one time or another is to all men a heart shaking sound It came at the street door and was quickly followed by a tap at his own Nancy had lost no time in replying What her letter might contain he found it impossible to conjecture Reproaches Joyous welcome Wrath Forgiveness He knew her so imperfectly that he could not feel sure even as to the probabilities of the case And his suspense was abundantly justified Her answer came upon him with the force of a shock totally unexpected He read the lines again and again he stared at the bank note His first sensation was one of painful surprise thereupon succeeded fiery resentment Reason put in a modest word hinting that he had deserved no better but he refused to listen Nothing could excuse so gross an insult He had not thought Nancy capable of this behaviour Tested she betrayed the vice of birth Her imputation upon his motive in marrying her was sheer vulgar abuse possible only on vulgar lips Well and good now he knew her all the torment of conscience he had suffered was needless And for the moment he experienced a great relief In less than ten minutes letter and bank note were enclosed in a new envelope and addressed back again to the sender With no word of comment she must interpret him as she could and would He went out and threw the offensive packet into the nearest receptacle for such things Work was over for to night After pacing in the obscurity of Dean s Yard until his pulse had recovered a normal beat he issued into the peopled ways and turned towards Westminster Bridge Despite his neglect of Nancy he had never ceased to think of her with a tenderness which in his own judgment signified something more than the simple fidelity of a married man Faithful in the technical sense he had not been but the casual amours of a young man caused him no self reproach Nancy s image remained without rival in his mind he had continued to acknowledge her claims upon him and from time to time to think of her with a lover s longing As he only wrote when prompted by such a mood his letters however unsatisfying were sincere Various influences conflicted with this amiable and honourable sentiment The desire of independence which had speeded him away from England still accompanied him on his return he had never ceased to regret his marriage and it seemed to him that without this legal bondage it would have been much easier to play a manly part at the time of Nancy s becoming a mother Were she frankly his mistress he would not be keeping thus far away when most she needed the consolation of his presence The secret marriage condemned him to a course of shame and the more he thought of it the more he marvelled at his deliberate complicity in such a fraud When poverty began to make itself felt when he was actually hampered in his movements by want of money this form of indignity more than any galling to his pride intensified the impatience with which he remembered that he could no longer roam the world as an adventurer Any day some trivial accident might oppress him with the burden of a wife and child who looked to him for their support Tarrant the married man unless he were content to turn simple rogue and vagabond must make for himself a place in the money earning world His indolence had no small part in his revolt against the stress of such a consideration The climate of the Bahamas by no means tended to invigorate him and in the United States he found so much to observe even to enjoy that the necessity of effort was kept out of sight as long as by one expedient and another he succeeded in procuring means to live upon without working During the homeward voyage a trial such as he had never known amid squalid discomforts which enraged even more than they disgusted him his heart softened in anticipation of a meeting with Nancy and of the sight of his child Apart from his fellow travellers in whom he could perceive nothing but coarseness and vileness he spent the hours in longing for England and for the home he would make there in castigating the flagrant faults of his character moderating his ambitions and endeavouring to find a way out of the numerous grave difficulties with which his future was beset Landed he rather forgot than discarded these wholesome meditations What he had first to do was so very unpleasant and taxed so rudely his self respect that he insensibly fell back again into the rebellious temper Choice there was none reaching London with a few shillings in his pocket of necessity he repaired forthwith to mister Vawdrey s office in the City and made known the straits into which he had fallen Now my dear fellow said mister Vawdrey with his usual good humour how much have you had of me since you started for the Bahamas That is hardly a fair question Tarrant replied endeavouring not to hang his head like an everyday beggar I went out on a commission True But after you ceased to be a commissioner You have lent me seventy pounds Living in the States is expensive What I got for my furniture has gone as well yet I certainly haven t been extravagant and for the last month or two I lived like a tramp Will you make my debt to you a round hundred It shall be repaid though I may be a year or two about it The loan was granted but together with a great deal of unpalatable counsel Having found his lodging Tarrant at once invested ten pounds in providing himself with a dress suit and improving his ordinary attire he had sold every garment he could spare in New York For the dress suit he had an immediate use on the very platform of Euston Station at his arrival a chance meeting with one of his old college friends resulted in an invitation to dine and even had not policy urged him to make the most of such acquaintances he was in no mood for rejecting a summons back into the world of civilisation Postponing the purposed letter to Nancy which had he written it sooner would have been very unlike the letter he subsequently sent he equipped himself once more as a gentleman and spent several very enjoyable hours in looking up the members of his former circle Hodiernals and others Only to Harvey Munden did he confide something of the anxieties which lay beneath his assumed lightheartedness Munden was almost the only man he knew for whom he had a genuine respect Renewal of intercourse with people of good social standing made him more than ever fretful in the thought that he had clogged himself with marriage Whatever Nancy s reply to his announcement that he was home again he would have read it with discontent To have the fact forced upon him a fact he seriously believed it that his wife could not be depended upon even for elementary generosity of thought was at this moment especially disastrous it weighed the balance against his feelings of justice and humanity hitherto no matter how he acted always preponderant over the baser issues of character and circumstance He stood leaning upon the parapet of Westminster Bridge his eyes scanning the dark facade of the Houses of Parliament How would the strong unscrupulous really ambitious man act in such a case What was to prevent him from ignoring the fact that he was married and directing his course precisely as he would have done if poverty had come upon him before his act of supreme foolishness Journalism must have been his refuge then as now but Society would have held out to him the hope of every adventurer a marriage with some woman whose wealth and connections would clear an upward path in whatever line he chose to follow Why not abandon to Nancy the inheritance it would degrade him to share and so purchase back his freedom The bargain might be made a strong man would carry it through and ultimately triumph by daring all risks Having wrought himself to this point of insensate revolt he quitted his musing station on the bridge and walked away Nancy did not write again There passed four or five days and Tarrant working hard as well as enjoying the pleasures of Society made up his mind not to see her He would leave events to take their course A heaviness of heart often troubled him but he resisted it and told himself that he was becoming stronger After a long day of writing he addressed a packet to a certain periodical and went out to post it No sooner had he left the house than a woman who had been about to pass him on the pavement abruptly turned round and hurriedly walked away But for this action he would not have noticed her as it was he recognised the figure and an impulse which allowed of no reflection brought him in a moment to her side In the ill lighted street a face could with difficulty be observed but Nancy s features were unmistakable to the eye that now fell upon them Stop and let me speak to you he exclaimed She walked only the more quickly and he was obliged to take her by the arm What do you want She spoke as if to an insolent stranger and shook off his grasp If you have nothing to say to me why are you here Here I suppose the streets are free to me Nothing would bring you to Great College Street if you didn t know that I was living here Now that we have met we must talk I have nothing at all to say to you Well then I will talk Come this way there s a quiet place where no one will notice us Nancy kept her eyes resolutely averted from him he the while searched her face with eagerness as well as the faint rays of the nearest lamp allowed it If you have anything to say you must say it here It s no use then Go your way and I ll go mine He turned and walked slowly in the direction of Dean s Yard There was the sound of a step behind him and when he had come into the dark quiet square Nancy was there too Better to be reasonable said Tarrant approaching her again I want to ask you why you answered a well meant letter with vulgar insult The insult came from you she answered in a shaking voice What did I say that gave you offence How can you ask such a question To write in that way after never answering my letter for months leaving me without a word at such a time making me think either that you were dead or that you would never let me hear of you again I told you it was a mere note just to let you know I was back I said you should hear more when we met Very well we have met What have you to say for yourself First of all this That you are mistaken in supposing I should ever consent to share your money The thought was natural to you no doubt but I see things from a different point of view His cold anger completely disguised the emotion stirred in him by Nancy s presence Had he not spoken thus he must have given way to joy and tenderness For Nancy seemed more beautiful than the memory he had retained of her and even at such a juncture she was far from exhibiting the gross characteristics attributed to her by his rebellious imagination Then I don t understand were her next words why you wrote to me again at all There are many things in me that you don t understand and can t understand Yes I think so That s why I see no use in our talking Tarrant was ashamed of what he had said a meaningless retort which covered his inability to speak as his heart prompted At all events I wanted to see you and it s fortunate you passed just as I was coming out Nancy would not accept the conciliatory phrase I hadn t the least intention of seeing you she replied It was a curiosity to know where you lived nothing else I shall never forgive you for the way in which you have behaved to me so you needn t try to explain yourself Here and now I should certainly not try The only thing I will say about myself is that I very much regret not having made known that you were married to me when plain honesty required it Now I look upon it as something over and done with as far as I am concerned I shall never benefit by the deception She interrupted him How do you know that I shall benefit by it How can you tell what has been happening since you last heard from me in America I have taken it for granted that things are the same Then you didn t even take measures to have news of me from any one else What need I should always have received any letter you sent You thought it likely that I should appeal to you if I were in difficulties He stood silent glad of the obscurity which made it needless for him to command his features At length What is the simple fact Has your secret been discovered or not How does it concern you Only in this way that if you are to be dependent upon any one it must be upon me Nancy gave a scornful laugh That s very generous considering your position But happily you can t force me to accept your generosity any more than I can compel you to take a share of my money Without the jibe at my poverty Tarrant said that is a sufficient answer As we can t even pretend to be friendly with each other I am very glad there need be no talk of our future relations You are provided for and no doubt will take care not to lose the provision If ever you prefer to forget that we are legally bound I shall be no obstacle I have thought of that replied Nancy after a pause her voice expressing satisfaction Perhaps we should do better to make the understanding at once You are quite free I should never acknowledge you as my husband You seriously mean it Do I seem to be joking Very well I won t say that I should never acknowledge you as my wife so far from that I hold myself responsible whenever you choose to make any kind of claim upon me But I shall not dream of interfering with your liberty If ever you wish to write to me you may safely address to the house at Champion Hill And remember always he added sternly that it was not I who made such a parting necessary Nancy returned his look through the gloom and said in like tone I shall do my best never to think of it at all Fortunately my time and my thoughts are occupied How Tarrant could not help asking as she turned away for her tone implied some special significance in the words You have no right to ask anything whatever about me came from Nancy who was already moving away He allowed her to go So it is to be as I wished he said to himself with mock courage So much the better And he went home to a night of misery CHAPTER six Not long after the disappearance of Fanny French missus Damerel called one day upon Luckworth Crewe at his office in Farringdon Street Crewe seldom had business with ladies and few things could have surprised him more than a visit from this lady in particular whom he knew so well by name and regarded with such special interest She introduced herself as a person wishing to find a good investment for a small capital but the half hour s conversation which followed became in the end almost a confidential chat missus Damerel spoke of her nephew Horace Lord with whom she understood mister Crewe was on terms of intimacy she professed a grave solicitude on his account related frankly the unhappy circumstances which had estranged the young man from her and ultimately asked whether Crewe could not make it worth his own while to save Horace from the shoals of idleness and pilot him into some safe commercial haven This meeting was the first of many between the fashionable lady and the keen man of affairs Without a suspicion of how it had come about Horace Lord presently found himself an informal partner in Crewe s business he invested only a nominal sum which might be looked upon as a premium of apprenticeship but there was an understanding that at the close of the term of tutelage imposed by his father s will he should have the offer of a genuine partnership on very inviting terms Horace was not sorry to enter again upon regular occupation He had considerably damaged his health in the effort to live up to his ideal of thwarted passion and could no longer entertain a hope that Fanny s escapade was consistent with innocence Having learnt how money slips through the fingers of a gentleman with fastidious tastes he welcomed a prospect of increased resources and applied himself with some energy to learning his new business But with missus Damerel he utterly refused to be reconciled and of his sister he saw very little Nancy however approved the step he had taken and said she would be content to know that all was well with him Upon a Sunday morning when the church bells had ceased to clang Luckworth Crewe not altogether at his ease in garb of flagrant respectability sat by the fireside of a pleasant little room conversing with missus Damerel Their subject as usual at the beginning of talk was Horace Lord He won t speak of you at all said Crewe in a voice singularly subdued sympathetic respectful I have done all I could short of telling him that I know you He s very touchy still on that old affair How would he like it asked the lady if you told him that we are acquaintances Impossible to say Perhaps it would make no difference one way or another missus Damerel was strikingly yet becomingly arrayed The past year had dealt no less gently with her than its predecessors if anything her complexion had gained in brilliancy perhaps a consequence of the hygienic precautions due to her fear of becoming stout A stranger even a specialist in the matter might have doubted whether the fourth decade lay more than a month or two behind her So far from seeking to impress her visitor with a pose of social superiority she behaved to him as though his presence honoured as much as it delighted her look tone bearing each was a flattery which no obtuseness could fail to apprehend and Crewe s countenance proved him anything but inappreciative Hitherto she had spoken and listened with her head drooping in gentle melancholy now with a sudden change intended to signify the native buoyancy of her disposition she uttered a rippling laugh which showed her excellent teeth and said prettily Poor boy I must suffer the penalty of having tried to save him from one of my own sex Not she added that I foresaw how that poor silly girl would justify my worst fears of her Perhaps her head drooping again I ought to reproach myself with what happened I don t see that at all replied Crewe whose eyes lost nothing of the exhibition addressed to them Even if you had been the cause of it which of course you weren t I should have said you had done the right thing Every one knew what Fanny French must come to Isn t it sad A pretty girl but so ill brought up I fear Can you give me any news of her sister the one who came here and frightened me so Oh she s going on as usual Crewe checked himself and showed hesitation She almost threatened me missus Damerel pursued with timid sweetness Do you think she is the kind of person to plot any harm against one She had better not try it on said Crewe in his natural voice Then as if recollecting himself he pursued more softly But I was going to speak of her You haven t heard that Miss Lord has taken a position in the new branch of that Dress Supply Association missus Damerel kept an astonished silence There can t be any doubt of it I have been told on the best authority She is in what they call the club room a superintendent It s a queer thing what can have led her to it I must make inquiries said missus Damerel with an air of concern How sad it is mister Crewe that these young relatives of mine almost the only relatives I have should refuse me their confidence and their affection Pray does Horace know of what his sister is doing I thought I wouldn t speak to him about it until I had seen you How very kind How grateful I am to you for your constant thoughtfulness Why Crewe should have practised such reticence why it signified kindness and thoughtfulness to missus Damerel neither he nor she could easily have explained But their eyes met with diffident admiration on the one side and touching amiability on the other Then they discussed Nancy s inexplicable behaviour from every point of view or rather missus Damerel discussed it and her companion made a pretence of doing so Crewe s manner had become patently artificial he either expressed himself in trivial phrases which merely avoided silence or betrayed an embarrassment an abstraction which caused the lady to observe him with all the acuteness at her command You haven t seen her lately she asked when Crewe had been staring at the window for a minute or two Seen her No not for a long time I think you told me you haven t called there since mister Lord s death I never was there at all he answered abruptly Oh I remember your saying so Of course there is no reason why she shouldn t go into business if time is heavy on her hands as I dare say it may be So many ladies prefer to have an occupation of that kind now a days It s a sign of progress we are getting more sensible Society used to have such silly prejudices Even within my recollection how quickly things change no lady would have dreamt of permitting her daughter to take an engagement in a shop or any such place Now we have women of title starting as milliners and modistes and soon it will be quite a common thing to see one s friends behind the counter She gave a gay little laugh in which Crewe joined unmelodiously for he durst not be merry in the note natural to him then raised her eyes in playful appeal If ever I should fall into misfortune mister Crewe would you put me in the way of earning my living You couldn t You re above all that kind of thing It s for the rough and ready sort of women and I can t say I have much opinion of them That s a very nice little compliment but at the same time it s rather severe on the women who are practical Tell me frankly Is my my niece one of the people you haven t much opinion of Crewe shuffled his feet I wasn t thinking of Miss Lord But what is really your opinion of her missus Damerel urged softly Crewe looked up and down smiled in a vacant way and appeared very uncomfortable May I guess the truth said his playful companion No I ll tell you I wanted to marry her and did my best to get her to promise I thought so She paused on the note of arch satisfaction and mused How nice of you to confess And that s all past and forgotten is it Never man more unlike himself than the bold advertising agent in this colloquy He was subdued and shy his usual racy and virile talk had given place to an insipid mildness He seemed bent on showing that the graces of polite society were not so strange to him as one might suppose But under missus Damerel s interrogation a restiveness began to appear in him and at length he answered in his natural blunt voice Yes it s all over and for a good reason The lady s curiosity was still more provoked No she exclaimed laughingly I am not going to ask the reason That would be presuming too far on friendship Crewe fixed his eyes on a corner of the room and seemed to look there for a solution of some difficulty When the silence had lasted more than a minute he began to speak slowly and awkwardly I ve half a mind to in fact I ve been thinking that you ought to know The good reason Yes You re the only one that could stand in the place of a mother to her And I don t think she ought to be living alone like she is with no one to advise and help her I have felt that very strongly said missus Damerel The old servant who is with her can t be at all a suitable companion that is to be treated on equal terms A very strange arrangement indeed But you don t mean that you thought less well of her because she is living in that way Of course not It s something a good deal more serious than that missus Damerel became suddenly grave Then I certainly ought to know You ought I think it very likely she would have been glad enough to make a friend of you if it hadn t been for this this affair which stood in the way There can t be any harm in telling you as you couldn t wish anything but her good That surely you may take for granted Well then I have an idea that she s trying to earn money because some one is getting all he can out of her leaving her very little for herself and if so it s time you interfered The listener was so startled that she changed colour You mean that some man has her in his power If I m not mistaken it comes to that But for her father s will she would have been married long ago and she ought to be Having blurted out these words Crewe felt much more at ease As missus Damerel s eyes fell the sense of sexual predominance awoke in him and he was no longer so prostrate before the lady s natural and artificial graces How do you know this she asked in an undertone From some one who had it from Miss Lord herself Are you quite sure that it isn t a malicious falsehood As sure as I am that I sit here I know the man s name and where he lives and all about him And I know where the child is at nurse The child Oh surely never A genuine agitation possessed her she had a frightened pain stricken look and moved as if she must act without delay It s nearly six months old Crewe continued Of course that s why she was away so long But why haven t you told me this before It was your duty to tell me your plain duty How long have you known I heard of it first of all about three months ago but it was only the other day that I was told the man s name and other things about him Is it known to many people Is the poor girl talked about No no Crewe replied with confidence The person who told me is the only one who has found it out you may depend upon that It must be a woman said missus Damerel sharply Yes it s a woman Some one I know very well She told me just because she thought I was still hoping to marry Miss Lord and well the truth is though we re good friends she has a little spite against me and I suppose it amused her to tell me something disagreeable I have no doubt said missus Damerel that the secret has been betrayed to a dozen people I ll go bail it hasn t returned Crewe falling into his vernacular I can hardly believe it at all I should never have dreamt that such a thing was possible What is the man s name what is his position Tarrant is his name and he s related somehow to a mister Vawdrey well known in the City who has a big house over at Champion Hill I have no notion how they came together or how long it was going on But this mister Tarrant has been in America for a year I understand has only just come back and now he s living In poorish lodgings Great College Street Westminster I ve made a few inquiries about him but I can t get at very much A man who knows Vawdrey tells me that Tarrant has no means and that he s a loafing affected sort of chap If that s true and it seems likely from the way he s living of course he will be ready enough to marry Miss Lord when the proper time has come I m only afraid that s all he had in view from the first And I can t help suspecting as I said that she s supporting him now If not why should she go and work in a shop At all events a decent man wouldn t allow her to do it A decent man said the listener would never have allowed her to fall into disgrace Certainly not Crewe assented with energy And as for my keeping quiet about it missus Damerel you ve only to think what an awkward affair it was to mention I m quite sure you ll have a little feeling against me because I knew of it I beg you not to think that She returned to her manner of suave friendliness I shall owe you gratitude for telling me and nothing but gratitude You have behaved with very great delicacy I cannot say how highly I appreciate your feeling on the poor girl s behalf If I can be of any use I am always at your service Thank you dear mister Crewe thank you In you I have found a real friend and how rarely they are met with Of course I shall make inquiries at once My niece must be protected A helpless girl in that dreadful position may commit unheard of follies I fear you are right He is making her his victim With such a secret she is absolutely at his mercy And it explains why she has shunned me Oh do you think her brother knows it I m quite sure he doesn t hasn t the least suspicion Of course not But it s wonderful how she has escaped Your informant how did she find it out You say she had the story from the girl s own lips But why She must have shown that she knew something Crewe imparted such details as had come to his knowledge they were meagre and left many obscurities but missus Damerel rewarded him with effusive gratitude and strengthened the spell which she had cast upon this knight of Farringdon Street CHAPTER seven Every day Tarrant said to himself I am a free man I was only married in a dream Every night he thought of Nancy and suffered heartache He thought too of Nancy s child his own son That Nancy was a tender mother he knew from the letter she had written him after the baby s birth a letter he would have liked to read again but forbore Must not the separation from her child be hard If he saw the poor little mortal how would the sight affect him At moments he felt a longing perhaps definable as the instinct of paternity but he was not the man to grow sentimental over babies his own or other people s Irony and sarcasm very agreeable to a certain class of newspaper readers were just now his stock in trade and he could not afford to indulge any softer mode of meditation His acquaintances agreed that the year of absence had not improved him He was alarmingly clever he talked well but his amiability the poetry of his mind seemed to have been lost in America He could no longer admire or praise For his own part he did not clearly perceive this change It struck him only that the old friends were less interesting than he had thought them and he looked for reception in circles better able to appreciate his epigrams and paradoxes A few weeks of such life broke him so completely to harness that he forgot the seasonable miseries which had been wont to drive him from London at the approach of November When the first fog blackened against his windows he merely lit the lamp and wrote on indifferent Two years ago he had declared that a London November would fatally blight his soul that he must flee to a land of sunshine or perish There was little time now to think about his soul One Monday morning arrived a letter which surprised and disturbed him It ran thus missus Eustace Damerel presents her compliments to mister Tarrant and would take it as a great favour if he could call upon her either to morrow or Tuesday at any hour between three and seven She particularly desires to see mister Tarrant on a private matter of mutual interest Now this could have but one meaning missus Eustace Damerel was of course Nancy s relative from Nancy herself or in some other way she must have learnt the fact of his marriage Probably from Nancy since she knew where he lived He was summoned to a judicial interview Happily attendance was not compulsory Second thoughts advised him that he had better accept the invitation He must know what measures were in progress against him If Nancy had already broken her word she might be disposed to revenge herself in every way that would occur to an angry woman of small refinement she might make life in London impossible for him He sat down and penned a reply saying that he would call upon missus Damerel at five to morrow But he did not post this After all a day s delay would only irritate him better to go this afternoon in which case it was not worth while sending an answer It seemed to him very probable that Nancy would be with her aunt to confront him If so if indeed she were going to act like any coarse woman with no regard but for her own passions and Interests he would at least have the consolation of expelling from his mind at once and for ever her haunting image missus Damerel who during the past twelve months had changed her abode half a dozen times now occupied private lodgings in Tyburnia On his admittance Tarrant sat alone for nearly five minutes in a pretentiously furnished room just the room in which he had expected to find Nancy s relative the delay and the surroundings exasperated his nervous mood so that when the lady entered he behaved with slighter courtesy than became his breeding Nothing in her appearance surprised or interested him There was a distant facial resemblance to Nancy natural in her mother s sister there was expensive though not particularly tasteful dress and a gait a manner distinguishable readily enough from what they aimed at displaying the grace of a woman born to social privilege It would be a humiliating conversation Tarrant braced himself to go through with it He stood stiffly while his hostess regarded him with shrewd eyes She had merely bent her head Will you sit down mister Tarrant He took a chair without speaking I think you know me by name I have heard of a missus Damerel Some time ago I suppose And in that you have the advantage of me I heard your name yesterday for the first time It was the sharp rejoinder of a woman of the world Tarrant began to perceive that he had to do with intelligence and would not be allowed to perform his share of the talking de haut en bas In what can I be of service to you he asked with constrained civility You can tell me please what sort of connection there is between you and my niece Miss Lord missus Damerel was obviously annoyed by his demeanour and made little effort to disguise her feeling She gave him the look of one who does not mean to be trifled with Really answered the young man with a smile I don t know what authority you have to make such inquiries You are not I believe Miss Lord s guardian No but I am her only relative who can act on her behalf where knowledge of the world is required As a gentleman you will bear this in mind It s quite true that I can t oblige you to tell me anything but when I say that I haven t spoken even to my niece of what I have heard and haven t communicated with the gentlemen who are her guardians I think you will see that I am not acting in a way you ought to resent You mean missus Damerel that what passes between us is in confidence I only mean mister Tarrant that I am giving you an opportunity of explaining yourself so that I can keep the matter private if your explanation is satisfactory You have a charge of some kind to bring against me said Tarrant composedly I must first of all hear what it is The prisoner at the bar can t be prosecuting counsel at the same time Do you acknowledge that you are on intimate terms with Miss Lord I have known her for a year or two Tarrant began to exercise caution Nancy had no hand in this matter some one had told tales about her that was all He must learn without committing himself exactly how much had been discovered Are you engaged to her Engaged to marry her No He saw in missus Damerel s clear eye that she convicted him of ambiguities You have not even made her a promise of marriage How much simpler if you would advance a clear charge I will answer it honestly missus Damerel seemed to weigh the value of this undertaking Tarrant met her gaze with steady indifference It may only be a piece of scandal a mistake or a malicious invention I have been told that that you are in everything but law my niece s husband They regarded each other during a moment s silence Tarrant s look indicated rapid and anxious thought It seems he said at length that you have no great faith in the person who told you this It is the easiest matter in the world to find out whether the story is true or not Inquiries at Falmouth would be quite sufficient I dare say I give you the opportunity of keeping it quiet that s all You won t care to let me know who told you There s no reason why I shouldn t said missus Damerel after reflection Do you know mister Luckworth Crewe I don t think I ever heard the name Indeed He is well acquainted with Miss Lord Some one he wouldn t mention gave him all the particulars having learnt them from Miss Lord herself and he thought it his duty to inform me of my niece s very painful position Who is this man Tarrant asked abruptly I am rather surprised you have never heard of him He s a man of business My nephew mister Horace Lord is shortly to be in partnership with him Crewe No the name is quite strange to me Tarrant s countenance darkened he paused for an instant then added impatiently You say he had all the particulars What were they these particulars Will one be enough A child was born at Falmouth and is now at a place just outside London in the care of some stranger The source of this information might or might not be Nancy herself In either case there was no further hope of secrecy Tarrant abandoned his reserve and spoke quietly civilly So far you have heard the truth What have you to ask of me now You have been abroad for a long time I think For about a year Does that mean that you wished to see no more of her That I deserted her in plain words It meant nothing of the kind You are aware then that she has taken a place in a house of business just as if she thought it necessary to earn her own living Tarrant displayed astonishment I am aware of no such thing How long has that been going on Then you don t see her I have seen her but she told me nothing of that There s something very strange in this mister Tarrant You seem to me to be speaking the truth No please don t take offence Before I saw you you were a total stranger to me and after what I had heard I couldn t think very well of you I may as well confess that you seem a different kind of man from what I expected I don t wish to offend you far from it If we can talk over this distressing affair in a friendly way so much the better I have nothing whatever in view but to protect my niece to do the best that can be done for her That I have taken for granted Tarrant replied I understand that you expected to meet a scoundrel of a very recognisable type Well I am not exactly that But what particular act of rascality have you in mind Something worse than mere seduction of course Will you answer a disagreeable question Are you well to do Anything but that Indeed And you can form no idea why Nancy has gone to work in a shop Tarrant raised his eyebrows I see he said deliberately You suspect that I have been taking money from her I did suspect it now it seems to me more unlikely Many thanks he answered with cold irony So the situation was this Miss Lord had been led astray by a rascally fellow who not only left her to get on as best she could but lived on her income so that she had at length to earn money for her own needs There s something very clear and rounded very dramatic about that What I should like to know is whether Miss Lord tells the story in this way I can t say that she does I think it was mister Crewe who explained things like that I am obliged to mister Crewe But he may after all only repeat what he has heard It s a pity we don t know Miss Lord s actual confidante Of course you have not received assistance from her Tarrant stared for a moment then laughed unpleasantly I have no recollection of it Another disagreeable question Did you really go away and leave her to get on as best she could He looked darkly at her And if I did Wasn t it rather unaccountable behaviour in a gentleman Possibly I can t believe it There is something unexplained Yes there is something unexplained missus Damerel I should have thought you would naturally speak first to your niece Why did you send for me before doing so To find out what sort of man you were so that I should be able to form my own opinion of what Nancy chose to tell me Perhaps she may refuse to tell me anything at all we are not like ordinary relatives I am sorry to say But I dare say you know better than I do how she thinks of me I have heard her speak of you only once or twice At all events now that you are prepared you will go and see her I must It would be wrong to stand by and do nothing And you will see her guardians That must depend I certainly shall if she seems to be suffering hardships I must know why she goes out to work as if she were pinched for money There is her child to support of course but that wouldn t make any difference to her she is well provided for Yes There s no choice but to fall back upon the villain theory He rose and took up his hat You mustn t go yet mister Tarrant said his hostess firmly I have said that I can t believe such things of you If you would only explain That s just what I can t do It s as much a mystery to me as to you her wishing to earn money I was going to say if you would only explain your intentions as to the future My intentions will depend entirely on what I hear from your niece I shall see her as soon as possible Perhaps you can tell me at what hour she returns from business No I can t I wish you would talk a little longer His eyes flashed angrily missus Damerel I have said all that I am willing to say What you have heard is partly true you probably won t have to wait very long for the rest of the story but I have no time and no inclination to tell it Go and see your niece to morrow by all means or her guardians if it seems necessary I am very sorry we are parting in this way You must remember how difficult it is to keep one s temper under certain kinds of accusation I don t accuse you Well then to explain calmly that one couldn t commit this or that sordid rascality it comes to the same thing However I am obliged to you for opening my eyes I have got into a very foolish position and I promise you I will get out of it as quickly as may be Whereupon he bowed his leave taking and withdrew CHAPTER eight It was not yet dark but street lamps had begun to flare and flicker in the gust of a cold damp evening A thin and slippery mud smeared the pavement Tarrant had walked mechanically as far as to the top of Park Lane before he began to consider his immediate course Among the people who stood waiting for omnibuses he meditated thus She may not get home until seven or half past then she will have a meal I had better put it off till about half past eight That leaves me some four hours to dispose of First of all I ll walk home and yes by all the devils I ll finish that bit of writing A year ago I could no more have done it under such circumstances than have built a suspension bridge To day I will just to show that I ve some grit in me Down Park Lane and by Buckingham Palace across to Westminster he kept his thoughts for the most part on that bit of writing Only thus could he save himself from an access of fury which would only have injured him the ire of shame in which a man is tempted to beat his head against stone walls He composed aloud balancing many a pretty antithesis and polishing more than one lively paradox In his bedroom study the fire had gone out No matter he would write in the cold It was mere amanuensis work penning at the dictation of his sarcastic demon Was he a sybarite Many a poor scribbler has earned bed and breakfast with numb fingers The fire in his body would serve him for an hour or two So he sat down and achieved his task to the last syllable He read it through corrected it made it up for post and rose with the plaudits of conscience Who shall say now that I am a fop and a weakling Half past seven Good just time enough to appease his hunger and reach Grove Lane by the suitable hour He went out to the little coffee shop which was his resort in Spartan moods ate with considerable appetite and walked over Westminster Bridge to the Camberwell tram To kill time on the journey he bought a halfpenny paper As he ascended Grove Lane his heart throbbed more than the exercise warranted At the door of the house which he had never yet entered and which he had not looked upon for more than a year he stood to calm himself with lips set and cheek pale in the darkness Then a confident peal at the knocker It was Mary who opened He had never seen her but knew that this grave hard featured person not totally unlike a born gentlewoman must be Mary Woodruff And in her eyes he read a suspicion of his own identity Is Miss Lord at home he asked in a matter of fact way Yes What name shall I mention mister Tarrant Her eyes fell and she requested him to enter to wait in the hall for a moment then went upstairs She was absent for a few minutes and on returning asked him to follow her She led to the drawing room on the way Tarrant felt a surprise that in so small a house the drawing room should be correctly situated on the upper floor Here he had again to wait A comfortable room he thought and with a true air of home about it He knew how significant is this impression first received on entering a strange abode home or encampment attraction or repulsion according to the mind of the woman who rules there Was it Nancy or Mary who made the atmosphere of the house The door opened and he faced towards it Nancy s dress had an emphasis of fashion formerly unknown to it appropriate enough considering her new occupation The flush upon her cheeks the light of doubtful meaning in her eyes gave splendour to a beauty matured by motherhood In the dark street a fortnight ago Tarrant could hardly be said to have seen her he gazed in wonder and admiration What has brought you here A cause quite sufficient This is a little house can we talk without being overheard You can shout if you wish to she answered flippantly The servant is Out and Mary is downstairs Nancy did not seat herself and offered no seat to the visitor Why have you made yourself a shop girl I didn t know that I had I am told you go daily to some shop or other I am engaged at a place of business but I don t However that doesn t matter What business is it of yours Who is mister Luckworth Crewe Nancy kept her eyes still more resolutely fronting his severe look A man I used to know You don t see him now a days It s many months since I saw him Who then is the woman who has told him your whole story with embellishments and who says she has had it from you yourself Nancy was speechless I don t say there is any such person Tarrant continued The man may have lied in that particular But he has somehow got to know a good deal about you where and when your child was born where it is now where I live and so on And all this he has reported to your aunt missus Damerel To her How do you know For answer he held out missus Damerel s note of invitation then added I have been with her this afternoon She is coming to offer you her protection against the scoundrel who has ruined you and who is now living upon you What do you mean That s the form the story has taken either in mister Crewe s mind or in that of the woman who told it to him Don t they know that I am married Evidently not And they think you are having money from me That s how they explain your taking a place in a shop Nancy laughed and laughed again How ridiculous I m glad you can get amusement out of it Perhaps you can suggest how the joke began She moved a few steps then turned again to him Yes I know who the woman must be It s Beatrice French A bosom friend of yours of course Nothing of the kind But you have taken her into your confidence up to a certain point Yes I have told her And she told mister Crewe I understand that Well what does it matter Tarrant was at a loss to interpret this singular levity He had never truly believed that reading of Nancy s character by means of which he tried to persuade himself that his marriage was an unmitigated calamity and a final parting between them the best thing that could happen His memories of her and the letters she had written him coloured her personality far otherwise Yet was not the harsh judgment after all the true one It doesn t matter to you he said that people think you an unmarried mother that people are talking about you with grins and sneers Nancy reddened in angry shame Let them talk she exclaimed violently What does it matter so long as they don t know I m married So long as they don t know How came you to tell this woman Do you suppose I told her for amusement She found out what had happened at Falmouth found out simply by going down there and making inquiries because she suspected me of some secret affair with a man she wants to marry herself this mister Crewe The wonder of wonders is that no one else got to know of it in that way Any one who cared much what happened to me would have seen the all but impossibility of keeping such a secret It is a notable instance of evolutionary process that the female mind in wrath flies to just those logical ineptitudes which most surely exasperate the male intelligence Tarrant gave a laugh of irate scorn Why you told me the other day that I cared particularly whether your secret was discovered or not that I only married you in the hope of profiting by it Wouldn t any woman think so I hope not I believe there are some women who don t rush naturally to a base supposition Did I Nancy exclaimed with a vehement passion that made her breast heave Didn t I give you time enough believe in you until I could believe no longer The note of her thrilling voice went to Tarrant s heart and his head drooped That may be true he said gravely But go on with your explanation This woman came to you and told you what she had discovered Yes And you allowed her to think you unmarried What choice had I How was my child to be brought up if I lost everything Good God Nancy Did you imagine I should leave you to starve His emotion his utterance of her name caused her to examine him with a kind of wonder How did I know How could I tell at that time whether you were alive or dead I had to think of myself and the child My poor girl The words fell from him involuntarily Nancy s look became as scornful and defiant as before Oh that was nothing I ve gone through a good deal more than that Stop Tell me this Have you in your anger anger natural enough allowed yourself to speak to any one about me in the way I should never forgive In the spirit of your letter I mean Did you give this Beatrice French any ground for thinking that I made a speculation of you I said nothing of that kind Nor to any one else To no one Yet you told this woman where I was living and that I had been abroad for a long time Why Yes I told her so much about you Nancy replied Not when she first came to me but afterwards only the other day I wanted employment and didn t know how to get it except through her She promised me a place if I would disclose your name not that she knew or cared anything about you but because she still had suspicions about mister Crewe I was desperate and I told her Desperate Why How can I make you understand what I have gone through What do you care And what do I care whether you understand or not It wasn t for money and Beatrice French knew it wasn t Then it must have been that you could not bear the monotony of your life Her answer was a short careless laugh Where is this shop What do you do It s a dress supply association I advise fools about the fashions and exhibit myself as a walking fashion plate I can t see how it should interest you Whatever concerns you Nancy interests me more than anything else in the world Again she laughed What more do you want to know She was half turned from him leaning at the mantelpiece a foot on the fender You said just now that you have gone through worse things than the shame of being thought unmarried Tell me about it all Not I indeed When I was willing to tell you everything you didn t care to hear it It s too late now It s not too late happily to drag you out of this wretched slough into which you are sinking Whatever the cost that shall be done Thank you I am not disposed to let any one drag me anywhere I want no help and if I did you would be the last person I should accept it from I don t know why you came here after the agreement we made the other night Tarrant stepped towards her I came to find out whether you were telling lies about me and I should never have thought it possible but for my bad conscience I know you had every excuse for being embittered and for acting revengefully It seems you have only told lies about yourself As after all you are my wife I shan t allow that Once more she turned upon him passionately I am not your wife You married me against your will and shook me off as soon as possible I won t be bound to you I shall act as a free woman Bound to me you are and shall be as I to you You may say it fifty times and it will mean nothing How bound to you Bound to share my money I forgive you that because I have treated you ill You don t mean it either You know I am incapable of such a thought But that shall very soon be put right Your marriage shall be made known at once Known to whom To the people concerned to your guardians Don t trouble yourself she answered with a smile They know it already Tarrant half closed his eyes as he looked at her What s the use of such a silly falsehood I told you I had gone through a good deal more than you imagined I have struggled to keep my money in spite of shames and miseries and I will have it for myself and my child If you want to know the truth go to Samuel Barmby and ask him what he has had to do with me I owe no explanation to you Tarrant could see her face only in profile Marvelling at the complications she gradually revealed he felt his blood grow warm with desire of her beauty She was his wife yet guarded as by maidenhood A familiar touch would bring the colour to her cheeks the light of resentment to her eyes Passion made him glad of the estrangement which compelled a new wooing and promised on her part a new surrender You don t owe it me Nancy but if I beg you to tell me all because I have come to my senses again because I know how foolish and cruel I have been Remember what we agreed Go your way and let me go mine I had no idea of what I was agreeing to I took it for granted that your marriage was strictly a secret and that you might be free in the real sense if you chose Yes and you were quite willing because it gave you your freedom as well I am as free as I wish to be I have made a life for myself that satisfies me and now you come to undo everything I won t be tormented I have endured enough Then only one course is open to me I shall publish your marriage everywhere I shall make a home for you and have the child brought to it then come or not as you please At mention of the child Nancy regarded him with cold curiosity How are you to make a home for me I thought you had difficulty enough in supporting yourself That is no concern of yours It shall be done and in a day or two Then make your choice You think I can be forced to live with a man I don t love I shouldn t dream of living with a woman who didn t love me But you are married and a mother and the secrecy that is degrading you shall come to an end Acknowledge me or not I shall acknowledge you and make it known that I am to blame for all that has happened And what good will you do I shall do good to myself at all events I m a selfish fellow and shall be so to the end no doubt Nancy glanced at him to interpret the speech by his expression He was smiling What good will it do you to have to support me The selfishness I see in it is your wishing to take me from a comfortable home and make me poor That can t be helped And what s more you won t think it a hardship How do you know that I have borne dreadful degradations rather than lose my money That was for the child s sake not for your own He said it softly and kindly and for the first time Nancy met his eyes without defiance It was I could always have earned my own living somehow Tarrant paused a moment then spoke with look averted Is he well and properly cared for If he were not well and safe I shouldn t be away from him When will you let me see him Nancy She did not smile but there was a brightening of her countenance which she concealed Tarrant stepped to her side Dear my own love will you try to forgive me It was all my cursed laziness It would never have happened if I hadn t fallen into poverty Poverty is the devil and it overcame me How can you think that I shall be strong enough to face it she asked moving half a step away Leave me to myself I am contented I have made up my mind about what is before me and I won t go through all that again Tired of standing she dropped upon the nearest chair and lay back You can t be contented Nancy in a position that dishonours you From what you tell me it seems that your secret is no secret at all Will you compel me to go to that man Barmby and seek information from him about my own wife I have had to do worse things than that Don t torture me by such vague hints I entreat you to tell me at once the worst that you have suffered How did Barmby get to know of your marriage And why has he kept silent about it There can t be anything that you are ashamed to say No The shame is all yours I take it upon myself all of it I ought never to have left you but that baseness followed only too naturally on the cowardice which kept me from declaring our marriage when honour demanded it I have played a contemptible part in this story don t refuse to help me now that I am ready to behave more like a man Put your hand in mine and let us be friends if we mayn t be more She sat irresponsive You were a brave girl You consented to my going away because it seemed best and I took advantage of your sincerity Often enough that last look of yours has reproached me I wonder how I had the heart to leave you alone Nancy raised herself and said coldly It was what I might have expected I had only my own folly to thank You behaved as most men would This was a harder reproach than any yet Tarrant winced under it He would much rather have been accused of abnormal villainy And I was foolish continued Nancy in more ways than you knew You feared I had told Jessica Morgan of our marriage and you were right of course I denied it She has been the cause of my worst trouble In rapid sentences she told the story of her successive humiliations recounted her sufferings at the hands of Jessica and Beatrice and Samuel Barmby When she ceased there were tears in her eyes Has Barmby been here again Tarrant asked sternly Yes He has been twice and talked in just the same way and I had to sit still before him Has he said one word that No no she interrupted hastily He s only a fool not man enough to That saves me trouble said Tarrant I have only to treat him like a fool My poor darling what vile torments you have endured And you pretend that you would rather live on this fellow s interested generosity for of course he hopes to be rewarded than throw the whole squalid entanglement behind you and be a free honest woman even if a poor one I see no freedom You have lost all your love for me Well I can t complain of that But bear my name you shall and be supported by me I tell you that it was never possible for me actually to desert you and the little one never possible I shirked a duty as long as I could that s all it comes to I loafed and paltered until the want of a dinner drove me into honesty Try to forget it dear Nancy Try to forgive me my dearest She was dry eyed again and his appeal seemed to have no power over her emotions You are forgetting she said practically that I have lived on money to which I had no right and that I or you can be forced to repay it Repaid it must be whether demanded or not Where does Barmby live Perhaps I could see him to night What means have you of keeping us all alive Some of my work has been accepted here and there but there s something else I have in mind I don t ask you to become a poverty stricken wife in the ordinary way I can t afford to take a house I must put you with the child into as good lodgings as I can hope to pay for and work on by myself just seeing you as often as you will let me Even if you were willing it would be a mistake for us to live together For one thing I couldn t work under such conditions for another it would make you a slave Tell me are you willing to undertake the care of the child if nothing else is asked of you Nancy gave him a disdainful smile a smile like those of her girlhood I m not quite so feeble a creature as you think me You would rather have the child to yourself than be living away from him If you have made up your mind why trouble to ask such questions Because I have no wish to force burdens upon you You said just now that you could see little prospect of freedom in such a life as I have to offer you I thought you perhaps meant that the care of the child would I meant nothing Nancy broke in with fretful impatience Where is he our boy At Dulwich I told you that in my last letter Yes yes I thought you might have changed I couldn t have found a better kinder woman Can you guess how many answers I had to the advertisement Thirty two Of course five and twenty of them took it for granted you would pay so much a week and ask no questions They would just not have starved the baby unless you had hinted to them that you were willing to pay a lump sum for a death certificate in which case the affair would have been more or less skilfully managed Mary knew all about that She came from Falmouth and spent two days in visiting people I knew I could rely on her judgment There were only four or five people she cared to see at all and of these only one that seemed trustworthy To be sure One out of two and thirty A higher percentage than would apply to mankind at large I dare say By the bye I was afraid you might have found a difficulty in registering the birth No I went to the office myself the morning that I was leaving Falmouth and the registrar evidently knew nothing about me It isn t such a small place that everybody living there is noticed and talked of And Mary took the child straight to Dulwich Two days before I came so as to have the house ready for me Perhaps it was unfortunate Nancy that you had so good a friend But for that I should have suffered more uneasiness about you She answered with energy There is no husband in the world worth such a friend as Mary At this Tarrant first smiled then laughed Nancy kept her lips rigid It happened that he again saw her face in exact profile and again it warmed the current of his blood Some day you shall think better of that She paid no attention Watching her he asked What are you thinking of so earnestly Her answer was delayed a little but she said at length with an absent manner Horace might lend me the money to pay back what I owe Your brother If he can afford it there would be less objection to that than to any other plan I can think of But I must ask it myself you shall beg no more favours I will ask it in your presence You will do nothing of the kind Nancy replied drily If you think to please me by humiliating yourself you are very much mistaken And you mustn t imagine that I put myself into your hands to be looked after as though I had no will of my own With the past you have nothing to do with my past at all events Care for the future as you like But I must see your guardians No I won t have that She stood up to emphasise her words I must It s the only way in which I can satisfy myself Then I refuse to take a step said Nancy Leave all that to me and I will go to live where you please and never grumble however poor I am Interfere and I will go on living as now on Samuel Barmby s generosity There was no mistaking her resolution Tarrant hesitated and bit his lip How long then before you act he inquired abruptly When my new home is found I am ready to go there You will deal honestly with me You will tell every one and give up everything not strictly yours I have done with lies said Nancy Thank heaven so have I Part VI A Virtue of Necessity CHAPTER one Upon the final tempest in De Crespigny Park there followed for Arthur Peachey a calmer and happier season than he had ever known To have acted with stern resolve is always a satisfaction especially to the man conscious of weak good nature and condemned for the most part to yield In his cheap lodging at Clapham Peachey awoke each morning with a vague sense of joy which became delight as soon as he had collected his senses He was a free man No snarl greeted him as he turned his head upon the pillow he could lie and meditate could rise quietly when the moment sounded could go downstairs to a leisurely meal cheered perhaps by a letter reporting that all was well with his dear little son Simple elementary pleasures but how he savoured them after his years of sordid bondage It was the blessedness of divorce without squalid publicity It was the vast relief of widowerhood without dreary memories of death and burial In releasing himself from such companionship the man felt as though he had washed and become clean Innocent of scientific speculation he had the misfortune about this time to read in paper or magazine something on the subject of heredity the idle verbiage of some half informed scribbler It set him anxiously thinking whether his son would develop the vices of the mother s mind and from that day he read all the printed chatter regarding natural inheritance that he could lay his hands on The benefit he derived from this course of study was neither more nor less than might have been expected it supplied him with a new trouble which sometimes kept him wakeful He could only resolve that his boy should have the best education procurable for money if he starved himself in providing it He had begun to live with the utmost economy and for a twofold reason the business of Messrs Ducker Blunt company threatened a decline and this apart he desired to get out of it to obtain an interest in some more honourable concern For a long time it had been known to him that the disinfectants manufactured by his firm were far from trustworthy and of late the complaints of purchasers had become frequent With the manufacturing department he had nothing to do he tried to think himself free from responsibility for in spite of amiable qualities he was a man of business and saw a great part of life through the commercial spectacles commonly worn now a days Nevertheless conscience unsettled him One day he heard his partners joking over the legislative omission by virtue of which they were able to adulterate their disinfectants to any extent without fear of penalty their laughter grated upon him and he got out of the way If he could lay aside a few thousands of pounds assuredly his connection with the affair should be terminated So he lived for his own part on a pound a week and informed Ada through his solicitor that she must be satisfied with a certain very moderate allowance missus Peachey naturally laid herself out to give every one as much trouble as possible Insulting post cards showered upon her husband at his place of business After a few weeks she discovered his lodging and addressed the post cards thither but she made no attempt at personal molestation The loss of her child gave her not the slightest concern yet she determined to find out where the boy was living She remembered that Peachey had relatives at Canterbury and after a troublesome search succeeded in her purpose An interview with her husband s married sister proved so unsatisfactory to Ada that she had recourse to her familiar weapons rage insult and menace with the result that she was forcibly removed and made a scandal in the quiet street Then she consulted men of law and found one who encouraged her to sue for restitution of conjugal rights It came to nothing however for in the meantime she was growing tired of her solitary existence friends of course she had none and the spirit moved her to try a change of tactics She wrote a long long letter penitent tear bestained I have behaved outrageously to you dearest Arthur I must have been mad to say and do such things The doctor tells me that my health has been in a very bad state for a long time and I really don t remember half that has happened You were quite right when you told me that I should be better if I didn t live such an idle life and I have quite quite made up my mind to be an industrious and a good woman All yesterday I spent in needlework and crying Oh the tears that I have shed My darling husband what can I do to win your forgiveness Do consider how lonely I am in this house Beatrice has been horrid to me If I said all I think about her she wouldn t like to hear it but I am learning to control my tongue She lives alone in a flat and has men to spend every evening with her it s disgraceful And there s Fanny who I am sure is leading an immoral life abroad Of course I shall never speak to her again You were quite right when you said my sisters were worthless Peachey had never permitted himself any such remark I will have no one but you my dear good sweet husband So on over several pages Reading it the husband stood aghast at this new revelation of female possibilities at the end he hurriedly threw it into the fire fearing and with good reason that weakness in his own character to which the woman addressed herself Every day for a week there arrived a replica of this epistle and at length he answered It was the fatal concession Though he wrote with almost savage severity Ada replied in terms of exuberant gratitude Oh how delighted she was to see his dear handwriting once more How it reminded her of happy days when they loved each other so tenderly Then came two strophes of a sentimental drawing room song and lastly an impassioned appeal to be allowed to see her husband were it only for five minutes Another week of such besieging and the poor fellow s foolish heart gave way He would see the wretched woman and tell her that though never could he consent to live with her again he had no malicious feeling and was willing to be her friend at a distance So at six o clock one evening behold him tremulously approaching the house in De Crespigny Park tremulously because he dreaded the assault upon his emotions to which he so recklessly exposed himself He was admitted by a very young servant in a very clean cap and apron Silence possessed the dwelling he did not venture to tread with natural step He entered the drawing room and there from amid a heap of household linen which required the needle rose the penitent wife Ostentatiously she drew from her finger a thimble then advanced with head bent How kind of you Arthur How how very And she was dissolved in tears so genuine that they marked pale rillets across the bloom of her cheeks About a month after that the furniture was removed from De Crespigny Park to a much smaller house at Brixton where mister and missus Peachey took up their abode together A medical man shortly called and Ada not without secret disgust smilingly made known to her husband that she must now be very careful of her health On one point only the man had held to a rational resolve he would not allow his little son to be brought back to London away from the home where he was happy and thriving Out of mere self will Ada strove for a long time to overcome this decision finding argument and artifice of no avail she dropped the matter Peachey owed this triumph largely to the firm commonsense of his sister who plainly refused to let the little fellow quit her care for that of such a woman as he was unfortunate enough to call mother Christmas came and with it an unanticipated call from Miss Fanny French who said she had lately recovered from a serious illness in Paris the nature of her malady she did not specify it had left her haggard and thin but by no means deficient in vivacity She was dressed with tawdry extravagance wore a mass of false yellow hair had her eyebrows dyed black piquant contrast and her cheeks and lips richly carmined No veritable information as to her past and present could be gleaned from the mixture of French and English which she ceaselessly gabbled She had come over for Christmas that was all could not dream of returning to live in wretched England At Brussels and in Paris she had made hosts of friends just the right sort of people Ada told her all the news Of most interest was that which related to Nancy Lord Only a month ago it had become known that Nancy was married and the mother of a child The Barmbys found it out somehow Ada narrated She was married to a man called Tarrant some one we never heard of on the very day of her father s death and of course before she knew anything about his will Then of course it had to be kept dark or she d lose all her money Her husband hadn t a farthing She supported him and they say he lived most of the time in her house He s a regular scamp a drinking betting fellow Well it all came out and the Barmbys turned her into the street at a moment s notice serve her right Fanny shrieked with merriment And what is she doing She went on her knees to Beatrice and begged for a place at the shop if it was only a few shillings a week Nice come down for Nancy Lord wasn t it Of course Beatrice sent her off with a flea in her ear I don t know where she s living but I ve heard that her husband has gone to America and left her to shift for herself now there s nothing more to be got out of her For supplementary details of this racy narrative Fanny sought out Beatrice but to her astonishment and annoyance Beatrice would tell nothing The elder sister urged Fanny to give an account of herself and used some very plain speech of the admonitory kind What has become of that jackanapes Horace Lord asked Fanny after a contemptuous remark about sermons I don t know The question is what s going to become of you Whereupon the girl grew vituperative in two languages and made off Her relatives saw no more of her for a long time To missus Peachey was born a daughter Naturally the months preceding this event had been for her husband a renewal of martyrdom his one supporting solace lay in the thought of the little lad at Canterbury All the old troubles were revived from morning to night the house rang with brawls between mistress and servants in the paroxysms favoured by her physical condition Ada behaved like a candidate for Bedlam and more than once obliged her husband to seek temporary peace in lodgings He left home at eight o clock every morning and returned as late as possible The necessity of passing long evenings made him haunt places of entertainment and he sometimes had recourse to drink he by nature the soberest of men in fear of what awaited him on his tardy appearance at Brixton A month after Ada s confinement he once more acted a sane part and announced by letter that he would die rather than continue living with his wife As it was fine autumn weather he went down to a seaside place where his Canterbury relatives and the little boy joined him for a holiday of several weeks Again Ada was to receive an allowance She despatched a few very virulent post cards but presently grew quiet and appeared to accept the situation In early winter Fanny French came over to England She had again been ill and this time with results obviously graver Her first call was upon Beatrice who still occupied the flat at Brixton and here she unbosomed herself of a dolorous story All her money had vanished stolen most of it Fanny declared she was without resources and as any one could see in a wretched state of health Would Beatrice have compassion on her Would she lend her money till she was well enough to look round Miss French at once took the girl into her own home and had her looked after Fanny coughed in an alarming way the doctor speaking privately with Beatrice made an unpleasant report was it possible to send the patient to a mild climate for the winter months Yes Miss French could manage that and would A suitable attendant having been procured Fanny was despatched to Bournemouth whence in a day or two she wrote to her sister thus You ve been awfully kind to me and I shan t forget it when I m well again Feel a good deal fitter already Dullish place this but I ve got to put up with it I ve had a letter from Ada If you see her tell her she s a beast and I wish Arthur would wring her scraggy neck She says it s all my own fault wait till I m back again and I ll pay her a call My own fault indeed It seems to me I m very much to be pitied Walking one day along the sea front by herself Fanny observed a young man s figure a few paces in advance of her which seemed to awaken recollections Presently the young man turned and showed beyond doubt the countenance of Horace Lord He met her eyes gave a doubtful troubled look and was going past when Fanny accosted him Well don t you know me Why it is it really is How glad I am to see you But what on earth are you doing here Amusing myself comme vous voyez and you Oh doing the same They had shaken hands and were sauntering on together Anything wrong with your health Fanny asked scrutinising the pale thin face with its touch of warmth on the cheeks Oh I ve had a bit of a cold nothing to speak of You been out of sorts A little run down Over study they say Horace looked his surprise Why I didn t know you went in for that kind of thing Didn t you I ve been studying abroad for a long time Thinking of taking a place as French teacher in some tip top high school I am very glad to hear it Capital idea Sure I hope you ll be successful Thanks awf ly Tell me something about yourself Why it s two years since we saw each other isn t it Are you married yet Horace smiled and coloured No no not yet I m in business with Luckworth Crewe sort of sleeping partner just now Are you really And how s your sister The young man bent his brows uncomfortably Don t you know anything about her he asked I ve heard she s married Yes a man called Tarrant Very clever fellow he writes for the papers I say Miss French I generally have a glass of wine and a biscuit at the confectioner s about this time Will you give me the pleasure of your company Charmee Monsieur I generally go in for the same kind of thing So they repaired to the cake shop and sat talking for half an hour of trifles which made them laugh And you really didn t know me said Fanny when her glass of wine was finished Have I changed so much A good deal Not for the worse oh dear no The girl giggled Well I don t mind saying that you have changed a good deal for the better Horace flushed at the compliment I m much older he answered with a sigh as though the years of a sexagenarian weighed upon him That s just what I like in you You re so much more of a man Don t be offended They went forth again into the sunshine At the door both coughed and both pretended that it wasn t a cough at all but a voluntary little hem CHAPTER two missus Damerel was younger than ever She had spent October abroad with her friends missus and Miss Chittle and the greater part of November at Brighton with other friends Back in town she established herself at one of the various boarding houses honoured by her patronage and prepared to enjoy the social life of winter Half a year ago an unwonted depression had troubled her serene existence At the close of the London season she seemed weary and spiritless very unlike herself having no invitation for the next two months she withdrew to Whitsand and there spent some cheerless weeks Whitsand was the as yet unfashionable seaside place which had attracted the speculative eye of Luckworth Crewe For the past two years he had been trying to inspire certain men of capital with his own faith in the possibilities of Whitsand he owned a share in the new hotel just opened whenever his manifold affairs allowed him a day s holiday he spent it at Whitsand pacing the small esplanade and meditating improvements That these improvements signified the conversion of a pretty little old world spot into a hideous brand new resort of noisy hordes in no degree troubled mister Crewe s conscience For his own part he could appreciate the charms of Whitsand as it stood he was by no means insensible to natural beauty and the ancient peace which so contrasted with his life of every day but first and foremost in his mind came the necessity of making money and to fill his pockets he would no more hesitate about destroying the loveliest spot on earth than the starving hunter would stay his hand out of admiration for bird or beast It was with much delight that he heard of missus Damerel s retreat to Whitsand To the note in which she acquainted him with her arrival there he replied effusively The patronage of a few really fashionable people such as yourself would soon do wonders We must have a special paragraph in the local paper drawing attention to your being there and so on An answer by return of post rather disappointed him On no account wrote missus Damerel must her name be specially mentioned in the paper She had taken very simple lodgings very inexpensive and wished to live as quietly as possible But after seeing the place she quite agreed with mister Crewe that it had a future and if he could run down some day whilst she was here it would give her great pleasure to hear his projects explained on the spot Crewe ran down In speaking of missus Damerel as a really fashionable person he used no insincerity from their first meeting he had seen in this lady his ideal of social distinction she was in fact the only woman of skilfully pretentious demeanour with whom he had ever spoken Her distant likeness to Nancy Lord interested and attracted him her suave superiority awed his conscious roughness she seemed to him exquisitely gracious wonderfully sweet And as little by little he attained the right to think of her almost as a friend his humble admiration became blended with feelings he took particular care not to betray lest he should expose himself to ridicule That her age exceeded his own by some years he was of course aware but this fact soon dropped out of his mind and never returned to it Not only did he think missus Damerel a type of aristocratic beauty he saw in her countenance all the freshness and the promise of youth The slight mystery attaching to her position only increased his susceptibility to her charms It seemed to him very probable that she had but a moderate income perhaps she was not free from anxieties on that score But such a woman would of course marry again and marry well The thought grew troublesome and presently accounted for ebullitions of wrath accompanied by more than usually vigorous language when business matters went wrong At Whitsand missus Damerel showed herself more than ever sweetly affable The season she said had been rather too much for her she must take care of her health besides and her smile played upon Crewe s pulses there were troubles cares of which she could not speak even to so valued a friend I m afraid you re anxious about your nephew murmured the man of business though at the same time he suspected other things for the lodgings in which he found missus Damerel were certainly modest Yes I trouble a good deal about him If only dear Horace would be reconciled to me It seems such a long long time You know that we have corresponded but he refuses to see me It pains me deeply mister Crewe And after a silence There s a special reason why I wish he would be friends with me a reason that concerns his own future Why should I not tell you I am sure you will respect my confidence He will very soon become independent and then I do so fear he may make a foolish marriage Yet all the time there is a chance waiting for him which would establish his fortune and his happiness for life Did he ever speak to you of Miss Chittle I don t remember the name Such a dear sweet girl and with really large means He was introduced to her during the happy time when we saw so much of each other and she at once became interested in him Her dear mother assured me of it She is a very shy retiring girl and has refused many offers before and since then Isn t it a pity But I am losing all hope and I so fear he may have formed some other attachment Crewe went back to London resolved that Horace Lord should no longer play the fool And he was successful Horace had all but lost his resentment against missus Damerel he kept aloof out of stubborn conceit it had not dignity enough to be called pride the same feeling that still estranged him from Nancy though he would gladly have welcomed his sister s offer of affection Persuaded or commanded by Luckworth Crewe he took the train to Whitsand and remained there for several days missus Damerel wrote her friend in Farringdon Street a letter of gratitude which acted upon him like champagne In a postscript she said missus Chittle and her daughter have consented to come here for a week or two They will take rooms at the Imperial Before the end of September Horace Lord was engaged to Winifred Chittle Two years had made very little change in Miss Chittle s appearance She was still colourless and abnormally shy still had the look of one who sheds secret tears and her repugnance to Society had if possible increased Horace thought her pretty was impressed by her extreme gentleness and refinement but she obtained no power over his emotions such as that formerly exercised by Fanny French It struck him too as a very strange thing that a young lady with a large fortune should be willing to marry a man of his social insignificance My dear said missus Damerel it was a case of love at first sight But Horace who had gained some experience of life could not believe this He wooed and won yet even when Winifred accepted him he felt that she did it under some constraint Her pale face declared no happiness Had she chosen missus Damerel could have explained the mystery She knew that several years ago Winifred s name had been blighted by a scandal and that the girl s shrinking from every proposal of marriage was due in part perhaps to the memory of love betrayed in part to a sense of honour and to the suspicion that men knowing her disgrace condoned it for the sake of her wealth Interest made missus Damerel generous she admitted every excuse for Winifred and persuaded herself that in procuring Horace such a wife she was doing him only a nominal wrong The young people could live apart from that corner of Society in which Miss Chittle s name gave occasion to smiles or looks of perfunctory censure If Winifred after marriage chose to make confession why that was her own affair and Horace would be wise enough all advantages considered to take the matter philosophically That was the view of a practical minded observer To read Winifred perfectly there needed a much more subtle and sympathetic intelligence The girl had in truth conceived a liking for Horace Lord and it grew stronger when she learnt that neither by birth nor present circumstances did he belong to her own world To please her mother she was willing to take a husband but the husband must be of her own choice She wished to enter upon a wholly new life remote from the social conditions which of late years had crushed her spirit From the men who had hitherto approached her she shrank in fear Horace Lord good looking and not uneducated yet so far from formidable suggested a new hope even though he might be actuated by the ordinary motives she discerned in him a softness a pliability of nature which would harmonise with her own timid disposition To the thought of deceiving him on the subject of her past she was reconciled by a resolve to make his happiness the sole object of her existence in the future Horace was amiability itself and seemed if not to love her ardently which perhaps she did not even desire at least to regard her with an increasing affection Nothing was said about the condition of the prospective bridegroom s health though Horace had confided to missus Damerel that he suffered from a troublesome cough accompanied now and then by an alarming symptom In her boundless exultation at the end achieved missus Damerel made light of this complaint Horace was not free to marry until nearly the end of the year for though money would henceforth be no matter of anxiety he might as well secure the small inheritance presently due to him November and December he should spend at Bournemouth under the best medical care and after that if needful his wife would go with him to Madeira or some such place No wonder missus Damerel could think of nothing but the great fact that Horace had secured a fortune Her own resources were coming to an end and but for the certainty that Horace would not grudge her an ample provision she must at this moment have been racking her brains even as through the summer for help against the evil that drew near Constitutional lightness of heart had enabled her to enjoy life on a steadily and rapidly diminishing fund There had been hope in Nancy s direction as well as in her brother s but the disclosure of Nancy s marriage and Horace s persistency in unfriendliness brought missus Damerel to a sense of peril One offer of marriage she had received and declined it came from a man of advanced years and small property Another offer she might or thought she might at any moment provoke but only in direst extremity could she think of bestowing her hand upon Luckworth Crewe Crewe was in love with her an amusing fact in itself and especially so in regard to his former relations with Nancy Lord He might become a wealthy man on the other hand he might not and in any case he was a plebeian All such miseries were now dismissed from her mind She went abroad with the Chittles enjoyed herself at Brighton and came home to prepare for Horace s wedding Horace himself being at Bournemouth After her letter of gratitude to Crewe she had ceased to correspond with him she did not trouble to acquaint him with Horace s engagement and when Crewe having heard the news from his partner ventured to send her a letter of congratulation missus Damerel replied in two or three very civil but cold sentences Back in London she did not invite the man of projects to call upon her The status she had lost when fears beset her must now be recovered Let Crewe cherish a passion for her if he liked but let him understand that social reasons made it laughably hopeless Horace was to come up to London in the third week of December and to be married on New Year s Day the honeymoon would be spent at Ventnor or somewhere thereabout Afraid to lose sight of her relative for more than a week or two missus Damerel had already been twice to Bournemouth and now she decided to go for a third time just to talk quietly over the forthcoming event and whether Horace broached the subject or not to apprise him of the straits into which she was drifting Unannounced by letter she reached Bournemouth early in the afternoon and went straight to Horace s lodgings The young man had just finished luncheon and all things considered including the fact that it was a remarkably bright and warm day for the time of year he might have been expected to welcome missus Damerel cheerfully Yet on seeing her his countenance fell he betrayed an embarrassment which the lady noted with anxious suspicion Aren t you glad to see me dear boy she began with a kiss upon his cheek Yes oh yes I never dreamt of your appearing just now that was all I couldn t resist the temptation Such a morning in London Almost as fine as it is here And how is your cough Even as she made the inquiry he answered it by coughing very badly I don t think this place suits you Horace said missus Damerel gravely You re not imprudent I hope Don t go out after dark Oh it was nothing Horace maintained for several days he had hardly coughed at all But with every word he uttered missus Damerel became more convinced of something unusual in his state of mind he could not keep still and in trying to put himself at ease assumed strange postures When did you hear from Winifred she asked Yesterday no the day before He shrank from her scrutiny and an expression of annoyance began to disturb his features missus Damerel knew well enough the significance of that particular look it meant the irritation of his self will the summoning of forces to resist something he disliked There has been no difference between you I hope No oh no Horace replied wriggling under her look At that moment a servant opened the door Two ladies have called in a carriage sir and would like to see you I ll go down Excuse me for a moment aunt Who are they Horace asked missus Damerel rising with an ill concealed look of dismay Some friends I have made here I ll just go and speak to them He hurried away No sooner was he gone than missus Damerel sprang to the window where she could look down upon the carriage standing before the house it was open and in it sat two ladies one middle aged the other much younger To her vexation she could not from this distance clearly discern their faces but on glancing rapidly round the room she saw Horace s little binocular An instant brought it into focus upon the carriage and what she then saw gave missus Damerel such a shock that an exclamation escaped her Still she gazed through the glasses and only turned away when the vehicle drove on Horace came up flushed and panting It s all right They wanted me to go for a drive but I explained He saw the binocular in missus Damerel s hand and at the same moment read detection on her countenance She gazed at him he answered the look with lowering challenge Horace that was Fanny French So it was aunt What is going on between you The young man took a seat on the edge of the table and swung his leg He looked suddenly obstinate We met by accident here the other day How can I believe that Horace said missus Damerel in a voice of soft reproach And she drew near to him Be truthful with me dear Do tell me the truth Is she anything to you I have told you the truth aunt She came here as I have done for her health I haven t seen her for two years And you don t wish to renew acquaintance with her I m sure you don t He looked away and said nothing My dear do you know her character What about her The tone was startling but missus Damerel kept firm though agitated She has led the most disgraceful life I heard about her half a year after she ran away but of course I wouldn t tell you such painful things Horace reddened with anger And who is to blame for it he cried passionately Who drove her to it Oh don t don t come back to that again Horace pleaded the other How can any one drive a girl into a life of scandalous immorality It was in herself dear She took to it naturally as so many women do Remember that letter she wrote from Brussels which I sent you a copy of It was a forgery thundered Horace I have asked her She says she never wrote any such letter Then she lies as such creatures always do Bitterness of apprehension overcame missus Damerel s prudence With flashing eyes she faced the young man and dared his wrath As they stood thus the two were astonishingly like each other from forehead to chin It s no use I m not going to quarrel with you aunt Think what you like of Miss French I know the truth about her He slipped from the table and moved away I will say no more Horace You are independent and must have your own acquaintances But after you are married The other voice interrupted I had better tell you at once I shall not marry Miss Chittle I am going to write this afternoon to break it off missus Damerel went pale and stood motionless Horace you can t be so wicked as that It s better he pursued recklessly to break it off now than to marry her and make her miserable I don t love her and I have never really thought I did I was going to marry her only for her money Why she wants to marry me I don t know There s something wrong she doesn t really care for me She does I assure you she does Then I can t help it missus Damerel went close to him and touched his arm My dear her voice was so low that it seemed terror stricken you don t mean to marry any one else He drew apart she followed him Oh that would be terrible What can I say to open your eyes and show you what you are doing Horace have you no sense of honour Can you find it in your heart to cast off a girl who loves you and thinks that in so short a time she will be your wife This again is your fault he replied with a violence which proved the conflict of emotions in him But for you I should never have proposed to Winifred never dreamt of such a thing What do I want with her money I have enough of my own and I shall make more in business Why have you driven me into this Did you expect to get some profit out of it The blow struck home and missus Damerel flinched I had your happiness in view my dear My happiness that s your view of things that s why I couldn t really like you from the first You think of nothing but money Why you objected to Fanny French at first was because you wished me to marry some one richer I don t thank you for that kind of happiness I had rather marry a woman I can love And you can love such a creature as that Again she lost her self command the mere thought of Fanny s possible triumph exasperated her I won t hear her abused cried Horace with answering passion You are the last person who ought to do it Comparing her and you I can t help saying An exclamation of pain checked his random words he looked at missus Damerel and saw her features wrung with anguish You mustn t speak to me like that Once more she approached him If you only knew I can t bear it I ve always been a worldly woman but you are breaking my heart Horace My dear my dear if only out of pity for me Why should I pity you he cried impatiently Because Horace give me your hand dear let me tell you something I am your mother She sobbed and choked clinging to his arm resting her forehead against it The young man stricken with amazement stared at her speechless I am your own mother dear she went on in a quivering voice Your mother and Nancy s And neither of you can love me How can that be Horace asked with genuine perplexity How could you have married some one else She passed an arm about his neck and hid her face against him I left your father and he made me free to marry again You were divorced Horace did not mean to speak brutally in his wonderment he merely pressed for a complete explanation The answer was a sob and for some moments neither of them spoke Then the mother her face still hidden went on in a thick voice I married because I was poor for no other reason and then came the temptation I behaved wickedly I deserted my little children Don t revenge yourself upon me now darling If only I could have told you this before I did so want to but I was afraid I had to conceal half my love for you You can t imagine how I have suffered from your anger and from Nancy s coldness You don t know me I have never been able to let you see what I really think and feel I am worldly I can t live without luxuries and society and amusements but I love you my dear son and it will break my heart if you ruin yourself It s true I thought of Winifred s money but she is very fond of you Horace her mother has told me she is And it was because of my own position I have spent nearly all my husband left me it wasn t enough to supply me with an income I could only hope that something that you dear would forgive your poor mother and help her If you cast me off what shall I do There was a silence Then the young man spoke gravely You are welcome mother to half my income But you must leave me free to marry as I like Then I can t take a penny from you she answered weeping If you ruin yourself you ruin me as well The ruin would come if I married Winifred I love Fanny I love her with all my heart and soul and have never ceased to love her Tell me what you like about her it will make no difference A fit of violent coughing stopped his speech he turned away and stood by the window holding his handkerchief to his mouth missus Damerel sank upon a chair in mute misery CHAPTER three Below the hill at Harrow in a byway which has no charm but that of quietness stands a row of small plain houses built not long ago yet at a time when small houses were constructed with some regard for soundness and durability Each contains six rooms has a little strip of garden in the rear and is or was in eighteen eighty nine let at a rent of six and twenty pounds The house at the far end of the row as the inhabitants described it was then tenanted by Mary Woodruff and with her as a lodger lived missus Tarrant As a lodger seeing that she paid a specified weekly sum for her shelter and maintenance in no other respect could the wretched title apply to her To occupy furnished lodgings is to live in a house owned and ruled by servants the least tolerable status known to civilisation From her long experience at Falmouth Nancy knew enough of the petty miseries attendant upon that condition to think of it with dread when the stress of heroic crisis compelled her speedy departure from the old home It is seldom that heroic crisis bears the precise consequence presumed by the actors in it supreme moments are wont to result in some form of compromise So Nancy prepared to go forth into the wilderness of landladies babe in arm found that so dreary a self sacrifice neither was exacted of her nor would indeed be permitted she had to reckon with Mary Woodruff Mary thanks to her old master enjoyed an income more than sufficient to her needs if Nancy must needs go into lodgings inevitable perhaps as matters stood her friend was ready with kind and practical suggestion to wit that she should take and furnish a house for herself and place a portion of it at missus Tarrant s disposal To this even Tarrant could offer no objection he stipulated only that his wife should find a temporary refuge from the home she had occupied on false pretences until Mary had her new house in readiness This was managed without difficulty Nancy went to Dulwich and for several weeks dwelt with the honest woman who took care of her child Of the dealings between Nancy and her legal guardians Tarrant learned nothing save the bare fact that her marriage was avowed and all benefit under her father s will renounced He did not visit the house at Dulwich and only saw his child after the removal to Harrow On this occasion he asked Nancy what arrangements had been made concerning the money that must be reimbursed to the Messrs Barmby she replied that justice would be done but the affair was hers alone and to her must be left Tarrant himself suggested the neighbourhood of Harrow for Nancy s abode It united the conditions of being remote from Camberwell of lying beyond the great smoke area and of permitting him poor as he was to visit his wife whenever he thought fit In December Nancy had lived thus for all but a twelvemonth seeing the while none of her old acquaintances and with very little news from her old world What she heard came through Horace who after learning with astonishment the secret in his sister s life came by degrees to something like the old terms of affection with her and went over to Harrow pretty frequently Of his engagement to Winifred Chittle he at once informed Nancy who tried to be glad of it but could have little faith in anything traceable to the influence of missus Damerel With that lady the Harrow household had no direct communication Tarrant had written to her on the night of crisis civilly requesting her to keep aloof as her advice and assistance were in nowise needed She answered him with good temper and wrote kindly to Nancy after that silence on both sides It wanted a few days to Christmas with nightfall had come a roaring wind and sleety rain the house door was locked within lamps and fires burned cheerily At half past six Nancy she occupied the two front rooms sat in her parlour resting after the exertion of putting her son to bed To judge from her countenance she was well and happy The furniture about her aimed at nothing but homely comfort the pictures and books being beyond dispute her own had come from Grove Lane Save when Tarrant was here Nancy and Mary of course lived like friends who share a house eating together and generally sitting together During an hour or two each day the younger woman desired solitude for a reason understood by her companion who then looked after the baby This present evening Nancy had proposed to spend alone but after sitting idly for a few minutes she opened the door and called Mary just then occupied in teaching a young servant how to iron I shall not write after all she said when her friend came I m too tired Bring your sewing or your book here Mary was never talkative Nancy kept a longer silence than usual How she exclaimed at length do poor women with a lot of children manage It really is a mystery to me Here am I with one baby and with the constant help of two people yet he tires me out Not a troublesome baby either healthy and good tempered Yet the thought and anxiety and downright hard labour for a good twelve hours out of the twenty four I feel that a second child would be too much for me She laughed but looked seriously for the reply Poor mothers said Mary can t give the same care to their children that you give to baby The little ones grow up or they don t grow up that s what it comes to Yes that is to say only the fit survive A very good thing when other people s children are in question But I should kill myself in taking care of them if I had a large family I have known mothers who did Mary remarked It comes to this Nature doesn t intend a married woman to be anything but a married woman In the natural state of things she must either be the slave of husband and children or defy her duty She can have no time to herself no thoughts for herself It s a hard saying but who can doubt that it is Nature s law I should like to revolt against it yet I feel revolt to be silly One might as well revolt against being born a woman instead of a man Mary reflected but held her peace Then comes in money pursued Nancy and that alters the state of the case at once The wife with money says to people Come here and be my slaves Toil for me whilst I am enjoying myself in ways that Dame Nature wouldn t allow I want to read to play music to see my friends to see the world Unless you will slave for me I can t budge from nursery and kitchen Isn t it a queer thing The less sophisticated woman had a difficulty in catching Nancy s point of view She began to argue that domestic service was no slavery But it comes to that Nancy insisted And what I mean is that the thought has made me far more contented than I was at first After all one can put up with a great deal if you feel you re obeying a law of Nature Now I have brains and I should like to use them but Nature says that s not so important as bringing up the little child to whom I have given life One thought that troubles me is that every generation of women is sacrificed to the generation that follows and of course that s why women are so inferior to men But then again Nature says that women are born only to be sacrificed I always come round to that I don t like it but I am bound to believe it Children grow up said Mary and then mothers are free Free to do what To think of what they might have done in the best years of their life It was not said discontentedly Nancy s mood seemed to be singularly calm and philosophical She propped her chin on her hand and gazed at the fire Well remarked Mary with a smile you at all events are not one of the poorest women All seems to be going well and you will be able I am sure to get all the help you need Perhaps But I shall never feel quiet in my conscience I shall feel as if I had defeated Nature by a trick and fear that she ll somehow be revenged on me This was quite beyond Mary s scope of thought and she frankly said so One thing I m quite sure of Nancy she added and that is that education makes life very much harder to live That s why I don t hold with educating the poor not beyond reading and writing Without education life is very plain though it may be a struggle But from what I have seen of highly taught people I m very sure they suffer worse in their minds than the poor ever do in their bodies Nancy interrupted her Hush Was that baby Only the wind I think Not content Nancy went to the foot of the stairs Whilst she stood there listening Mary came out and said in a low voice There s a tap at the window No You must have been mistaken I m sure it was a tap on the glass She withdrew to the back sitting room and Nancy with quick step went to open the house door A great gust of wind forced it against her as soon as she turned the handle standing firm she peeped into darkness Any one there No enemy but winter and rough weather chanted a familiar voice Why what brings you here frightening lone women at this time of night Shut and lock the door for me The house will be blown out of the windows Nancy retreated to her parlour and stood there in an attitude of joyous expectation Without hurry Tarrant hung up his coat and hat in the passage then came forward wiping rain from his moustache Their eyes met in a smile frank and confident Why have you come Lionel No reason in particular The fancy took me Am I unwelcome For answer his wife s arms were thrown about him A lovers meeting with more of tenderness and scarcely less of warmth than when Nancy knocked at the door in Staple Inn Are you hungry Only for what you have given me Some tea then after that wretched journey No How s the boy He drew her upon his knee and listened laughingly whilst the newest marvels of babyhood were laughingly related Anything from Horace Not a word He must be in London now I shall write tomorrow Tarrant nodded carelessly He had the smallest interest in his wife s brother but could not help satisfaction in the thought that Horace was to be reputably and even brilliantly married From all he knew of Horace the probability had seemed that his marriage would be some culmination of folly I think you have something to tell me Nancy said presently when her hand had been fondled for a minute or two Nothing much but good as far as it goes Bunbury has asked me to write him an article every week for the first six months of ninety Column and a half at two guineas a column Three guineas a week O rare head So there s no anxiety for the first half of next year at all events said Nancy with a sigh of relief I think I can count on a margin of fifty pounds or so by midsummer towards the debt of course Nancy bit her lip in vexation but neither made nor wished to make any protest Only a week or two ago since entering upon his patrimony Horace Lord had advanced the sum necessary to repay what Nancy owed to the Barmbys However rich Horace was going to be this debt to him must be cancelled On that as on most other points Tarrant and his wife held a firm agreement of opinion Yet they wanted money the past year had been a time of struggle to make ends meet Neither was naturally disposed to asceticism and if they did not grumble it was only because grumbling would have been undignified Did you dine with the great people on Thursday Nancy asked Yes and rather enjoyed it There were one or two clever women Been anywhere else An hour at a smoking concert the other evening Pippit the actor was there and recited a piece much better than I ever heard him speak anything on the stage They told me he was drunk very possibly that accounted for it To a number of such details Nancy listened quietly with bent head She had learned to put absolute faith in all that Tarrant told her of his quasi bachelor life she suspected no concealment but the monotony of her own days lay heavy upon her whilst he talked Won t you smoke she asked rising from his knee to fetch the pipe and tobacco jar kept for him upon a shelf Slippers also she brought him and would have unlaced his muddy boots had Tarrant permitted it When he presented a picture of masculine comfort Nancy sitting opposite cautiously approached a subject of which as yet there had been no word between them Oughtn t you to get more comfortable lodgings Oh I do very well I m accustomed to the place and I like the situation He had kept his room in Great College Street though often obliged to scant his meals as the weekly rent day approached Don t you think we might make some better some more economical arrangement How Nancy took courage and spoke her thoughts It s more expensive to live separately than if we were together Tarrant seemed to give the point his impartial consideration H m no I think not Certainly not with our present arrangements And even if it were we pay for your comfort and my liberty Couldn t you have as much liberty if we were living under the same roof Of course I know that you couldn t live out here it would put a stop to your work at once But suppose we moved Mary might take a rather larger house it needn t be much larger in a part convenient for you We should be able to pay her enough to set off against her increased expenses Smoking calmly Tarrant shook his head Impracticable Do you mean that this place is too dull for you It isn t lively but I wasn t thinking of the place If you lived here it would be all I should wish That sounds so prettily from your lips Nancy that I m half ashamed to contradict it But the truth is that you can only say such things because we live apart Don t deceive yourself With a little more money this life of ours would be as nearly perfect as married life ever can be Nancy remembered a previous occasion when he spoke to the same purpose But it was in the time she did not like to think of and in spite of herself the recollection troubled her You must have more variety he added Next year you shall come into town much oftener I m not thinking of that I always like going anywhere with you but I have plenty of occupations and pleasures at home I think we ought to be under the same roof Ought Because missus Tomkins would cry haro if her husband the greengrocer wasn t at her elbow day and night Have more patience with me I didn t mean ought in the vulgar sense I have as little respect for missus Tomkins as you have I don t want to interfere with your liberty for a moment indeed it would be very foolish for I know that it would make you detest me But I so often want to speak to you and and then I can t quite feel that you acknowledge me as your wife so long as I am away Tarrant nodded I quite understand The social difficulty Well there s no doubt it is a difficulty I feel it on your account I wish it were possible for you to be invited wherever I am Some day it will be if I don t get run over in the Strand but I should like the invitations Nancy broke in but you still don t understand me Yes I think I do You are a woman and it s quite impossible for a woman to see this matter as a man does Nancy there is not one wife in fifty thousand who retains her husband s love after the first year of marriage Put aside the fools and the worthless think only of women with whom you might be compared brave sensible pure hearted they can win love but don t know how to keep it Why not put it the other way about and say that men can love to begin with but so soon grow careless Because I am myself an instance to the contrary Nancy smiled but was not satisfied The only married people Tarrant pursued who can live together with impunity are those who are rich enough and sensible enough to have two distinct establishments under the same roof The ordinary eight or ten roomed house inhabited by decent middle class folk is a gruesome sight What a huddlement of male and female They are factories of quarrel and hate those respectable brass curtain rodded sties they are full of things that won t bear mentioning If our income never rises above that we shall live to the end of our days as we do now Nancy looked appalled But how can you hope to make thousands a year I have no such hope hundreds would be sufficient I don t aim at a house in London everything there is intolerable except the fine old houses which have a history and which I could never afford For my home I want to find some rambling old place among hills and woods some house where generations have lived and died where my boy as he grows up may learn to love the old and beautiful things about him I myself never had a home most London children don t know what is meant by home their houses are only more or less comfortable lodgings perpetual change within and without Your thoughts are wonderfully like my father s sometimes said Nancy From what you have told me of him I think we should have agreed in a good many things And how unfortunate we were If he had recovered from that illness if he had lived only a few months everything would have been made easy For me altogether too easy Tarrant observed It has been a good thing for you to have to work Nancy assented I understand the change for the better in you But she smiled you have more self will than you used to have That s just where I have gained But don t think that I find it easy or pleasant to resist your wish I couldn t do it if I were not so sure that I am acting for your advantage as well as my own A man who finds himself married to a fool is a fool himself if he doesn t take his own course regardless of his wife But I am in a very different position I love you more and more Nancy because I am learning more and more to respect you I think of your happiness most assuredly as much as I think of my own But even if my own good weighed as nothing against yours I should be wise to resist you just as I do now Hugger mugger marriage is a defilement and a curse We know it from the experience of the world at large which is perhaps more brutalised by marriage than by anything else No need to test the thing once more to our own disaster What I think is that though you pay me compliments you really have a very poor opinion of me You think I should burden and worry you in endless silly ways I am not such a simpleton In however small a house there could be your rooms and mine Do you suppose I should interfere with your freedom in coming and going Whether you meant to or not you would so long as we are struggling with poverty However self willed I am I am not selfish and to see you living a monotonous imprisoned life would be a serious hindrance to me in my own living and working Of course the fact is so at present and I often enough think in a troubled way about you but you are out of my sight and that enables me to keep you out of mind If I am away from home till one or two in the morning there is no lonely wife fretting and wondering about me For work such as mine I must live as though I were not married at all But suppose we got out of our poverty urged Nancy you would be living the same life I suppose and how would it be any better for you or me that we had a large house instead of a small one Your position will be totally changed When money comes friends come You are not hiding away from Society because you are unfit for it only because you can t live as your social equals do When you have friends of your own social engagements interests on every hand I shall be able to go my own way without a pang of conscience When we come together it will be to talk of your affairs as well as of mine Living as you do now you have nothing on earth but the baby to think about a miserable state of things for a woman with a mind I know it is miserable and I m struggling tooth and nail to help you out of it Nancy sighed Then there are years of it still before me Heaven forbid Some years no doubt before we shall have a home but not before I can bring you in contact with the kind of people you ought to know You shall have a decent house socially possible somewhere out west and I of course shall still go on in lodgings He waited for Nancy s reply but she kept silence You are still dissatisfied She looked up and commanded her features to the expression which makes whatever woman lovely that of rational acquiescence On the faces of most women such look is never seen No I am content You are working hard and I won t make it harder for you Speak always like that Tarrant s face was radiant That s the kind of thing that binds man to woman body and soul With the memory of that look and speech would it be possible for me to slight you in my life apart It makes you my friend and the word friend is better to my ear than wife A man s wife is more often than not his enemy Harvey Munden was telling me of a poor devil of an author who daren t be out after ten at night because of the fool fury waiting for him at home Nancy laughed I suppose she can t trust him And suppose she can t What is the value of nominal fidelity secured by mutual degradation such as that A rational woman would infinitely rather have a husband who was often unfaithful to her than keep him faithful by such means Husband and wife should interfere with each other not a jot more than two friends of the same sex living together If a man under such circumstances worried his friend s life out by petty prying he would get his head punched A wife has no more justification in worrying her husband with jealousies How if it were the wife that excited suspicion asked Nancy Infidelity in a woman is much worse than in a man If a man really suspects his wife he must leave her that s all then let her justify herself if she can Nancy cared little to discuss this point In argument with any one else she would doubtless have maintained the equality of man and woman before the moral law but that would only have been in order to prove herself modern spirited Tarrant s dictum did not revolt her Friends are equals she said after a little thought But you don t think me your equal and you won t be satisfied with me unless I follow your guidance Tarrant laughed kindly True I am your superior in force of mind and force of body Don t you like to hear that Doesn t it do you good when you think of the maudlin humbug generally talked by men to women We can t afford to disguise that truth All the same we are friends because each has the other s interest at heart and each would be ashamed to doubt the other s loyalty The latter part of the evening they spent with Mary in whom Tarrant always found something new to admire He regarded her as the most wonderful phenomenon in nature an uneducated woman who was neither vulgar nor foolish Baby slept in a cot beside Nancy s bed For fear of waking him the wedded lovers entered their room very softly with a shaded candle Tarrant looked at the curly little head the little clenched hand and gave a silent laugh of pleasure On the breakfast table next morning lay a letter from Horace As soon as she had opened it Nancy uttered an exclamation which prepared her companion for ill news Just what I expected though I tried not to think so I write aline only to tell you that my marriage is broken off You will know the explanation before long Don t trouble yourself about it I should never have been happy with Winifred nor she with me We may not see each other for some time but I will write again soon He doesn t say whether he or she broke it off I hope it was Winifred I m afraid not said Tarrant from the tone of that letter I m afraid not too It means something wretched He writes from his London lodgings Lionel let me go back with you and see him By all means Her gravest fear Nancy would not communicate And it hit the truth CHAPTER four They parted at Baker Street Tarrant for his lodgings and the work that awaited him there Nancy to go westward by another train When she reached the house from which her brother had dated his letter it was half past ten At the door stood a cab and a servant was helping the driver to hoist a big trunk on to the top Is mister Lord still here Nancy asked of the girl He s just this minute a goin miss This is his luggage She sent her name and was quickly led up to the first floor There stood Horace ready for departure Why have you come he asked with annoyance What else could I do on hearing such news I told you I should write again and I said plainly that it was better we shouldn t see each other for some time Why will people pester me out of my life I m not a child to be hunted like this On the instant he had fallen into a state of excitement which alarmed his sister There were drops of sweat on his forehead and tears in his eyes the blood had rushed to his cheeks and he trembled violently I am so troubled about you said Nancy with anxious tenderness I have been looking forward with such hope to your marriage and now I can t tell you anything about it just now It was all missus Damerel s doing the engagement I mean It s a good thing I drew back in time But I have a train to catch I really mustn t stay talking Are you going far Horace To Bournemouth again for the present I ve given up these rooms and I m taking all my things away In a month or two I may go abroad but I ll let you know Already he was out of the room his sister had no choice but to follow him downstairs He looked so ill and behaved with such lack of self restraint that Nancy kept her eyes upon him in an awestricken gaze as though watching some one on the headlong way to destruction Pouring rain obliged her to put up her umbrella as she stepped down on to the pavement Horace having shouted a direction to the driver entered the cab You haven t even shaken hands with me Horace Nancy exclaimed standing at the window Good bye dear good bye You shouldn t have come in weather such as this Get home as fast as you can Good bye Tell the fellow to drive sharp And the cab clattered away sending spurts of mud on to Nancy s waterproof She walked on for a few paces without reflection until the vehicle disappeared round a corner Coming to herself she made for the railway again which was at only a few minutes distance and there she sat down by the fire in the waiting room Her health for the last year had been sound as in the days of girlhood it was rarely that she caught cold and weather would have been indifferent to her but for the discomfort which hindered her free movement Vexed at so futile a journey she resolved not to return home without making another effort to learn something about Horace The only person to whom she could apply was the one who would certainly be possessed of information missus Damerel At the time of Horace s engagement Nancy had heard from missus Damerel and replied to the letter she remembered her aunt s address and as the distance was not great the temptation to go there now proved irresistible Her husband would dislike to hear of such a step but he had never forbidden communication with missus Damerel By help of train and omnibus she reached her new destination in half an hour and felt a relief on learning that missus Damerel was at home But it surprised her to be conducted into a room where lamps were burning and blinds drawn close she passed suddenly from cheerless day to cosy evening missus Damerel negligently attired received her with a show of warm welcome but appeared nervous and out of spirits I am not very well she admitted and that s why I have shut out the dreadful weather Isn t it the most sensible way of getting through the worst of a London winter To pretend that there is daylight is quite ridiculous so one may as well have the comforts of night I have come to speak about Horace said Nancy at once In any case she would have felt embarrassment and it was increased by the look with which missus Damerel kept regarding her a look of confusion of shrinking of intense and painful scrutiny You know what has happened I had a letter from him this morning to say that his marriage was broken off nothing else So I came over from Harrow to see him But he had hardly a minute to speak to me He was just starting for Bournemouth And what did he tell you asked missus Damerel who remained standing or rather had risen after a pretence of seating herself Nothing at all He was very strange in his manner He said he would write You know that he is seriously ill I am afraid he must be He has grown much worse during the last fortnight Don t you suspect any reason for his throwing off poor Winifred I wondered whether he had met that girl again But it seemed very unlikely He has She was at Bournemouth for her health She too is ill consumptive like poor Horace of course a result of the life she has been leading And he is going to marry her Nancy s heart sank She could say nothing She remembered Horace s face and saw in him the victim of ruthless destiny I have done my utmost He didn t speak of me Only to say that his engagement with Winifred was brought about by you And wasn t I justified If the poor boy must die he would at least have died with friends about him and in peace I always feared just what has happened It s only a few months ago that he forgave me for being as he thought the cause of that girl s ruin and since then I have hardly dared to lose sight of him I went down to Bournemouth unexpectedly and was with him when that creature came to the door in a carriage You haven t seen her She looks what she is the vilest of the vile As if any one can be held responsible for that She was born to be what she is And if I had the power I would crush out her hateful life to save poor Horace Nancy though at one with the speaker in her hatred of Fanny French found it as difficult as ever to feel sympathetically towards missus Damerel She could not credit this worldly woman with genuine affection for Horace the vehemence of her speech surprised and troubled her she knew not how He said nothing more about me added missus Damerel after a silence Nothing at all It seemed to Nancy that she heard a sigh of relief The other s face was turned away Then missus Damerel took a seat by the fire They will be married to morrow I dare say at Bournemouth no use trying to prevent it I don t know whether you will believe me but it is a blow that will darken the rest of my life Her voice sounded slightly hoarse and she lay back in the chair with drooping head You have nothing to reproach yourself with said Nancy yielding to a vague and troublous pity And you have done as much as any one could on his behalf I shall never see him again that s the hardest thought She will poison him against me He told me I had lied to him about a letter that girl wrote from Brussels she has made him think her a spotless innocent and he hates me for the truth I told about her However short his life said Nancy he is only too likely to find out what she really is I am not sure of that She knows he is doomed and it s her interest to play a part He will die thinking the worst of me Nancy if he writes to you and says anything against me you will remember what it means My opinion of people is not affected by hearsay Nancy replied It was a remark of dubious significance and missus Damerel s averted eyes seemed to show that she derived little satisfaction from it As the silence was unbroken Nancy rose I hope you will soon get rid of your cold Thank you my dear I haven t asked how the little boy is Well I hope Very well I am glad to say And your husband he is prospering I shouldn t like to say he is prospering it seems to mean so much but I think he is doing good work and we are satisfied with the results My dear you are an admirable wife Nancy coloured for the first time a remark of missus Damerel s had given her pleasure She moved forward with hand offered for leave taking They had never kissed each other but as if overcoming diffidence missus Damerel advanced her lips then as suddenly she drew back I had forgotten I may give you my sore throat Nancy kissed her cheek That night missus Damerel was feverish and the next day she kept her bed The servant who waited upon her had to endure a good many sharp reproofs trouble did not sweeten this lady s temper yet she never lost sight of self respect and even proved herself capable of acknowledging that she was in the wrong missus Damerel possessed the elements of civilisation This illness tried her patience in no slight degree Something she had wished to do something of high moment was vexatiously postponed A whole week went by before she could safely leave the house and even then her mirror counselled a new delay But on the third day of the new year she made a careful toilette and sent for a cab the brougham she had been wont to hire being now beyond her means She drove to Farringdon Street and climbed to the office of mister Luckworth Crewe Her knowledge of Crewe s habits enabled her to choose the fitting hour for this call he had lunched and was smoking a cigar How delightful to see you here he exclaimed But why did you trouble to come If you had written or telegraphed I would have saved you the journey I haven t even a chair that s fit for you to sit down on What nonsense It s a most comfortable little room Haven t you improved it since I called I shall have to look out for a bigger place I m outgrowing this Are you really That s excellent news Ah but what sad things have been happening It s a bad business Crewe answered shaking his head I thought I should have heard from you about it The reason of his silence she perfectly understood Since Horace s engagement there had been a marked change in her demeanour towards the man of business she had answered his one or two letters with such cold formality and on the one occasion of his venturing to call had received him with so marked a reserve that Crewe as he expressed it to himself got his back up His ideas of chivalrous devotion were anything but complex he could not bend before a divinity who snubbed him if the once gracious lady chose to avert her countenance he would let her know that it didn t matter much to him after all Moreover missus Damerel s behaviour was too suggestive he could hardly be wrong in explaining it by the fact that her nephew about to be enriched by marriage might henceforth be depended upon for all the assistance she needed This in the Americanism which came naturally to Crewe s lips was playing it rather low down and he resented it The sudden ruin of Horace Lord s prospects he had learnt the course of events from Horace himself amused and gratified him How would the high and mighty missus Damerel relish this catastrophe Would she have the cheek to return to her old graciousness If so he had the game in his hands she should see that he was not to be made a fool of a second time Yet the mere announcement of her name sufficed to shatter his resolve Her smile her soft accents her polished manners laid the old spell upon him He sought to excuse himself for having forsaken her in her trial It really floored me I didn t know what to say or do I was afraid you might think I was meddling with what didn t concern me Oh how could I have thought that It has made me ill I have suffered more than I can tell you You don t look quite the thing said Crewe searching her face Have you heard all I think so He is married and that s the end of it I suppose missus Damerel winced at this blunt announcement When was it she asked in an undertone I only knew he had made up his mind Crewe mentioned the date the day after Nancy s call upon her And are they at Bournemouth Yes Will be for a month or so he says Well we won t talk of it As you say that s the end Nothing worse could have happened Has he been speaking of me again like he used to I haven t heard him mention your name She heaved a sigh and began to look round the office Let us try to forget and talk of pleasanter things It seems such a long time since you told me anything about your business You remember how we used to gossip I suppose I have been so absorbed in that poor boy s affairs it made me selfish I was so overjoyed I really could think of nothing else And now But I must and will drive it out of my mind I have been moping at home day after day in wretched solitude I wanted to write to you but I hadn t the heart scarcely the strength I kept hoping you might call if only to ask how I was Of course everything had to be explained to inquisitive people how I hate them all It s the nature of the world to mock at misfortunes such as this It would really have done me good to speak for a few minutes with such a friend as you a real friend I am going to live a quiet retired life I am sick of the world its falsity and its malice and its bitter bitter disappointments Crewe s native wit and rich store of experience availed him nothing when missus Damerel discoursed thus The silvery accents flattered his ear and crept into the soft places of his nature He felt as when a clever actress in a pathetic part wrought upon him in the after dinner mood You must bear up against it missus Damerel And I don t think a retired life would suit you at all You are made for Society Don t seek for compliments I am speaking quite sincerely Ah those were happy days that I spent at Whitsand Tell me what you have been doing Is there any hope of the pier yet Why it s as good as built cried the other Didn t you see the advertisements when we floated the company a month ago I suppose you don t read that kind of thing We shall begin at the works in early spring Look here He unrolled a large design a coloured picture of Whitsand pier as it already existed in his imagination Not content with having the mere structure exhibited Crewe had persuaded the draughtsman to add embellishments of a kind which in days to come would be his own peculiar care from end to end the pier glowed with the placards of advertisers Below on the sands appeared bathing machines and these also were covered with manifold advertisements Nay the very pleasure boats on the sunny waves declared the glory of somebody s soap of somebody s purgatives I ll make that place one of the biggest advertising stations in England see if I don t You remember the caves I m going to have them lighted with electricity and painted all round with advertisements of the most artistic kind What a brilliant idea There s something else you might like to hear of It struck me I would write a Guide to Advertising and here it is He handed a copy of the book It advertises me and brings a little grist to the mill on its own account Three weeks since I got it out and we ve sold three thousand of it Costs nothing to print the advertisements more than pay for that Price one shilling But how you do work mister Crewe It s marvellous And yet you look so well you have really a seaside colour I never ailed much since I can remember The harder I work the better I feel I too have always been rather proud of my constitution Her eyes dropped But then I have led a life of idleness Couldn t you make me useful in some way Set me to work I am convinced I should be so much happier Let me help you mister Crewe I write a pretty fair hand don t I Crewe smiled at her made a sound as if clearing his throat grasped his knee and was on the very point of momentous utterance when the door opened Turning his head impatiently he saw not the clerk whose duty it was to announce people but a lady much younger than missus Damerel and more fashionably dressed who for some reason had preferred to announce herself Why do you come in like that Crewe demanded staring at her I m engaged Are you indeed You ought to send in your name They said you had a lady here so I told them another would make no difference How do you do missus Damerel It s so long since I had the pleasure of seeing you Beatrice French stepped forward smiling ominously and eyeing first Crewe then his companion with curiosity of the frankest impertinence missus Damerel stood up We will speak of our business at another time mister Crewe Crewe red with anger turned upon Beatrice I tell you I am engaged To missus Damerel asked the intruder airily You might suppose he addressed the elder lady that this woman has some sort of hold upon me I m sure I hope not said missus Damerel for your own sake Nothing of the kind She has pestered me a good deal and it began in this way Beatrice gave him so fierce a look that his tongue faltered Before you tell that little story she interposed you had better know what I ve come about It s a queer thing that missus Damerel should be here happens more conveniently than things generally do I had something to tell you about her You may know it but most likely you don t You remember she faced the other listener when I came to see you a long time ago I said it might be worth while to find out who you really were I haven t given much thought to you since then but I ve got hold of what I wanted as I knew I should Crewe did not disguise his eagerness to hear the rest missus Damerel stood like a statue of British respectability deaf and blind to everything that conflicts with good breeding stony faced she had set her lips in the smile appropriate to one who is braving torture Do you know who she is or not Beatrice asked of Crewe He shuffled and made no reply Fanny has just told me in a letter she got it from her husband Our friend here is the mother of Horace Lord and of Nancy She ran away from her first husband and was divorced Whether she really married afterwards I don t quite know most likely not At all events she has run through her money and wants her son to set her up again For a few seconds missus Damerel bore the astonished gaze of her admirer then her expression scarcely changing she walked steadily to the door and vanished The silence was prolonged till broken by Beatrice s laugh Has she been bamboozling you old man I didn t know what was going on You had bad luck with the daughter shouldn t wonder if the mother would suit you better all said and done Crewe seated himself and gave vent to his feelings in a phrase of pure soliloquy Well I m damned I cut in just at the right time did I No malice I ve had my hit back at her and that s enough As the man of business remained absorbed in his thoughts Beatrice took a chair Presently he looked up at her and said savagely What the devil do you want Nothing Then take it and go But Beatrice smiled and kept her seat CHAPTER five Nancy stood before her husband with a substantial packet in brown paper It was after breakfast at the moment of their parting Here is something I want you to take and look at and speak about the next time you come Ho ho I don t like the look of it He felt the packet Several quires of paper here Be off or you ll miss the train Poor little girl Et tu He kissed her affectionately and went his way In the ordinary course of things Nancy would not have seen him again for ten days or a fortnight She expected a letter very soon but on the fourth evening Tarrant s fingers tapped at the window pane In his hand was the brown paper parcel done up as when he received it Nancy searched his face her own perturbed and pallid How long have you been working at this Nearly a year But not every day of course Sometimes for a week or more I could get no time You think it bad No puff not in any sense puff bad In one sense it s good But puff that s a private sense a domestic sense The question is dear can it be sold to a publisher The question is nothing of the kind You mustn t even try to sell it to a publisher Why not You mean you would be ashamed if it came out But I shouldn t put my own name to it I have written it only in the hope of making money and so helping you I ll put any name to it you like Tarrant smoked for a minute or two until his companion gave a sign of impatience He wore a very good humoured look It s more than likely you might get the thing accepted Oh then why not she interrupted eagerly with bright eyes Because it isn t literature but a little bit of Nancy s mind and heart not to be profaned by vulgar handling To sell it for hard cash would be horrible Leave that to the poor creatures who have no choice You are not obliged to go into the market But Lionel if it is a bit of my mind and heart it must be a good book You have often praised books to me just on that account because they were genuine The books I praised were literature Their authors came into the world to write It isn t enough to be genuine there must be workmanship Here and there you have a page of very decent English and you are nowhere on the level of the ordinary female novelist Indeed don t take it ill I was surprised at what you had turned out But He finished the sentence in smoke wreaths Then I ll try again I ll do better Never much better It will never be literature What does that matter I never thought myself a Charlotte Bronte or a George Eliot But so many women make money out of novels and as I had spare time I didn t see why I shouldn t use it profitably We want money and if it isn t actually disgraceful and if I don t use my own name We don t want money so badly as all that I am writing because I must do something to live by and I know of nothing else open to me except pen work Whatever trash I turned out I should be justified as a man it s my duty to join in the rough and tumble for more or less dirty ha pence You as a woman have no such duty nay it s your positive duty to keep out of the beastly scrimmage It seemed to me that I was doing something Why should a woman be shut out from the life of the world It seems to me that your part in the life of the world is very considerable You have given the world a new inhabitant and you are shaping him into a man Nancy laughed and reflected and returned to her discontent Oh every woman can do that Not one woman in a thousand can bear a sound bodied child and not one in fifty thousand can bring up rightly the child she has borne Leisure you must have but for Heaven s sake don t waste it Read enjoy sit down to the feast prepared for you I wanted to do something she persisted refusing to catch his eye I have read enough Read enough Ha then there s no more to be said His portentous solemnity overcame her Laughter lighted her face and Tarrant laying down his pipe shouted extravagant mirth Am I to burn it then You are not You are to seal it with seven seals to write upon it peche de jeunesse and to lay it away at the back of a very private drawer And when you are old you shall some day bring it out and we ll put our shaky heads together over it and drop a tear from our dim old eyes By the bye Nancy will you go with me to a music hall to morrow night A music hall Yes It would do us both good I think I feel fagged and you want a change Here s the end of March please Heaven another month shall see us rambling in the lanes somewhere meantime we ll go to a music hall Each season has its glory if we can t hear the lark let us listen to the bellow of a lion comique Do you appreciate this invitation It means that I enjoy your company which is more than one man in ten thousand can say of his wife The ordinary man when he wants to dissipate asks well not his wife And I in plain sober truth would rather have Nancy with me than anyone else You say that to comfort me after my vexation I say it because I think it The day after to morrow I want you to come over in the morning to see some pictures in Bond Street And the next day we ll go to the theatre You can t afford it Mind your own business I remembered this morning that I was young and that I shall not be so always Doesn t that ever come upon you The manuscript fruit of such persevering toil was hidden away and its author spoke of it no more But she suffered a grave disappointment Once or twice a temptation flashed across her mind if she secretly found a publisher and if her novel achieved moderate success she might alter the title would not Tarrant forgive her for acting against his advice It was nothing more than advice often enough he had told her that he claimed no coercive right that their union if it were to endure must admit a genuine independence on both sides But herein as on so many other points she subdued her natural impulse and conformed to her husband s idea of wifehood It made her smile to think how little she preserved of that same genuine independence but the smile had no bitterness Meanwhile nothing was heard of Horace The winter passed and June had come before Nancy again saw her brother s handwriting It was on an ordinary envelope posted as she saw by the office stamp at Brighton the greater her surprise to read a few lines which coldly informed her that Horace s wife no longer lived She took cold one evening a fortnight ago and died after three days illness Nancy tried to feel glad but she had little hope of any benefit to her brother from this close of a sordid tragedy She answered his letter and begged that as soon as he felt able to do so he would come and see her A month s silence on Horace s part had led her to conclude that he would not come when without warning he presented himself at her door It was morning and he stayed till nightfall but talked very little Sitting in the same place hour after hour he seemed overcome with a complete exhaustion which made speech too great an effort and kept his thoughts straying idly Fanny s name did not pass his lips when Nancy ventured an inquiry concerning her he made an impatient gesture and spoke of something else His only purpose in coming it appeared was to ask for information about the Bahamas I can t get rid of my cough and I m afraid it may turn to something dangerous You said I remember that people with weak chests wintered in the Bahamas Lionel can tell you all about it He ll be here to morrow Come and have a talk with him No He moved pettishly Tell me as much as you know yourself I don t feel well enough to meet people Looking at him with profound compassion Nancy thought it very doubtful whether he would see another winter But she told him all she could remember about Nassau and encouraged him to look forward with pleasure and hopefulness to a voyage thither How are you going to live till then What do you mean he answered with a startled and irritated look I m not so bad as all that I meant how are you going to arrange your life Nancy hastened to explain Oh I have comfortable lodgings But you oughtn t to be quite alone I mean it must be so cheerless She made a proposal that he should have a room in this little house and use it as a home whenever he chose but Horace so fretted under the suggestion that it had to be abandoned His behaviour was that of an old man enfeebled in mind and body Once or twice his manner of speaking painfully reminded Nancy of her father during the last days of his life With a peevish sort of interest he watched his little nephew toddling about the room but did not address a word to the child A cab was sent for to convey him to the railway station Nancy had known few such melancholy days as this On the morning when by agreement she was to go into town to see her brother there arrived a note from him He had been advised to try a health resort in Switzerland and was already on the way Sorry he could not let Nancy know before would visit her on his return Thus in the style of telegraphy as though he wrote in hot haste From Switzerland came two letters much more satisfactory in tone and contents The first written in July announced a distinct improvement of health No details being supplied Nancy could only presume that her brother was living alone at the hotel from which he dated The second communication a month later began thus I think I forgot to tell you that I came here with missus Damerel She will stay till the end of the summer and then perhaps go with me to the Bahamas if that seems necessary But I am getting wonderfully well and strong missus Damerel is kinder to me than any one in the world ever was I shall tell you more about her some day The writer went on to describe a project he had of taking a small farm in Devonshire and living upon it as a country gentleman Tarrant warned his wife not to build hopes upon this surprising report and a few weeks brought news that justified him Horace wrote that he had suffered a very bad attack and was only now sufficiently recovered to hold a pen I don t know what we shall do but I am in good hands No one was ever better nursed night and day More before long Indeed it was not long A day or two after Nancy s return from a seaside holiday Mary brought in a telegram It came from missus Damerel Your brother died at ten o clock last night suddenly and without pain I am posting a letter he had written for you When the promised letter arrived it was found to bear a date two months ago An unwonted tenderness marked the opening words MY DEAREST SISTER What I am going to write is not to be sent to you at once Sometimes I feel afraid that I can t live very long so I have been making a will and I want you to know why I have left you only half of what I have to leave The other half will go to some one who has an equal claim on me though you don t know it She has asked me to tell you If I get thoroughly well again there will be no need of this letter and I shall tell you in private something that will astonish you very much But if I were to die it will be best for you to learn in this way that missus Damerel is much more to us than our mother s sister she is our own mother She told me at the time when I was behaving like an idiot at Bournemouth It ought to have been enough to stop me She confessed that she had done wrong when you and I were little children that was how she came to marry again whilst father was still alive Though it seemed impossible I have come to love her for her great kindness to me I know that I could trust you dearest Nancy to let her share whatever you have but it will be better if I provide for her in my will She has been living on a small capital and now has little left What I can give her is little enough but it will save her from the worst extremities And I beg you dear sister to forgive her fault if only for my sake because she has been so loving to a silly and useless fellow I may as well let you know about my wife s death She was consumptive but seemed to get much better at Bournemouth then she wanted to go to Brighton We lived there at a boardinghouse and she behaved badly very badly She made acquaintances I didn t like and went about with them in spite of my objections Like an obstinate fool I had refused to believe what people told me about her and now I found it all out for myself Of course she only married me because I had money One evening she made up her mind to go with some of her friends in a boat by moonlight We quarrelled about it but she went all the same The result was that she got inflammation of the lungs and died I don t pretend to be sorry for her and I am thankful to have been released from misery so much sooner than I deserved And now let me tell you how my affairs stand At the first reading Nancy gave but slight attention to this concluding paragraph Even the thought of her brother s death was put aside by the emotions with which she learnt that her mother still lived After brooding over the intelligence for half a day she resolved to question Mary who perhaps during so long a residence in Grove Lane had learnt something of the trouble that darkened her master s life The conversation led to a disclosure by Mary of all that had been confided to her by mister Lord the time had come for a fulfilment of her promise to the dead man CHAPTER six Horace s letter Nancy sent by post to her husband requesting him to let her know his thoughts about it in writing before they again met Of her own feeling she gave no sign I want you to speak of it just as if it concerned a stranger plainly and simply All I need say is that I never even suspected the truth Tarrant did not keep her long in suspense and his answer complied in reasonable measure with the desire she had expressed The disclosure has of course pained you Equally of course you wish it were not necessary to let me know of it you are in doubt as to how it will affect me you perhaps fear that I shall never mind about phrasing First then a word on that point Be assured once for all that nothing external to yourself can ever touch the feeling which I now have for you One word is too often profaned I will say simply that I hold you in higher regard that any other human being Try not to grieve my dearest It is an old story in both senses You wish to know how I view the matter Well if a wife cannot love her husband it is better she should not pretend to do so if she love some one else her marriage is at an end and she must go Simple enough provided there be no children Whether it is ever permissible for a mother to desert her children I don t know I will only say that in you yourself I can find nothing more admirable than the perfect love which you devote to your child Forsake it you could not In short act as feeling dictates Your mother lives that fact cannot be ignored In your attitude towards her do not consult me at all whatever your heart approves I shall find good and right Only don t imagine that your feeling of to day is final I would say make no resolve they are worth little in any concern of life Write to me again and say when you wish to see me After reading this Nancy moved about with the radiance of a great joy on her countenance She made no haste to reply she let a day elapse then in the silence of a late hour took pen and paper When do I wish to see you Always in every moment of my day And yet I have so far conquered the unreasonable female do you remember saying that that I would rather never see you again than bring you to my side except when it was your pleasure to be with me Come as soon as you can as soon as you will My mother how shall I word it She is nothing to me I don t feel that Nature bids me love her I could pardon her for leaving my father like you I see nothing terrible in that but like you I know that she did wrong in abandoning her little children and her kindness to Horace at the end cannot atone for it I don t think she has any love for me We shall not see each other at all events that is how I feel about it at present But I am very glad that Horace made provision for her that of course was right if he had not done it it would have been my duty I had better tell you that Mary has known my mother s story for a long time but not that she still lived My father told her just before his death and exacted her promise that if it seemed well she would repeat everything to me You shall know more about it though it is bad all through My dear father had reason bitterly to regret his marriage long before she openly broke it But come and see me and tell me what is to be done now that we are free to look round There is no shame in taking what poor Horace has given us You see that there will be at least three thousand pounds for our share apart from the income we shall have from the business He was sure to come on the evening of the morrow Nancy went out before breakfast to post her letter light hearted in the assurance that her husband s days of struggle were over that her child s future no longer depended upon the bare hope that its father would live and thrive by a profession so precarious as that of literature she gave little thought to the details of the new phase of life before her Whatever Tarrant proposed would be good in her sight Probably he would wish to live in the country he might discover the picturesque old house of which he had so often spoken In any case they would now live together He had submitted her to a probation and his last letter declared that he was satisfied with the result Midway in the morning whilst she was playing with her little boy rain kept them in the house a knock at the front door announced some unfamiliar visit Mary came to the parlour with a face of surprise Who is it Miss Morgan What Jessica Mary handed an envelope addressed to missus Tarrant It contained a sheet of paper on which was written in pencil I beg you to see me if only for a minute Yes I will see her said Nancy when she had frowned in brief reflection Mary led away the little boy and a moment after introduced Jessica Morgan At the appearance of her former friend Nancy with difficulty checked an exclamation Miss Morgan wore the garb of the Salvation Army Harmonious therewith were the features shadowed by the hideous bonnet a face hardly to be recognised bloodless all but fleshless the eyes set in a stare of weak minded fanaticism She came hurriedly forward and spoke in a quick whisper I was afraid you would refuse to see me Why have you come I was impelled I had a duty to perform Coldly Nancy invited her to sit down but the visitor shook her head I mustn t take a seat in your house I am unwelcome we can t pretend to be on terms of friendliness I have come first of all her eyes wandered as she spoke inspecting the room to humble myself before you to confess that I was a dishonourable friend to make known with my lips that I betrayed your secret Nancy interrupted the low hurrying panting voice which distressed her ear as much as the facial expression that accompanied it did her eyes There s no need to tell me I knew it at the time and you did me no harm Indeed it was a kindness She drew away but Jessica moved after her I supposed you knew But it is laid upon me to make a confession before you I have to ask your pardon most humbly and truly Do you mean that some one has told you to do this Oh no A gleam of infinite conceit shot over the humility of Jessica s countenance I am answerable only to my own soul In the pursuit of an ideal which I fear you cannot understand I subdue my pride and confess how basely I behaved to you Will you grant me your forgiveness She clasped her gloveless hands before her breast and the fingers writhed together If it is any satisfaction to you replied Nancy overcome with wonder and pity I will say those words But don t think that I take upon myself Only say them I ask your pardon say you grant it Nancy uttered the formula and with bowed head Jessica stood for a minute in silence her lips moved And now she said at length I must fulfil the second part of the duty which has brought me here Her attitude changed to one of authority and her eyes fixed themselves on Nancy s regarding her with the mild but severe rebuke of a spiritual superior Having acknowledged my wrong doing I must remind you of your own Let me ask you first of all have you any religious life Nancy s eyes had turned away but at these words they flashed sternly upon the speaker I shall let you ask no such question I expected it Jessica sighed patiently You are still in the darkness out of which I have been saved If you have nothing more to say than this I must refuse to talk any longer There is a word I must speak pursued Jessica If you will not heed it now it will remain in your memory and bear fruit at the appointed time I alone know of the sin which poisons your soul and the experiences through which I have passed justify me in calling you to repentance Nancy raised her hand Stop That is quite enough Perhaps you are behaving conscientiously I will try to believe it But not another word or I shall speak as I don t wish to It is enough You know very well what I refer to Don t imagine that because you are now a married woman Nancy stepped to the door and threw it open Leave the house she said in an unsteady tone You said you were unwelcome and it was true Take yourself out of my sight Jessica put her head back murmured some inaudible words and with a smile of rancorous compassion went forth into the rain On recovering from the excitement of this scene Nancy regretted her severity the poor girl in the hideous bonnet had fallen very low and her state of mind called for forbearance The treachery for which Jessica sought pardon was easy to forgive not so however the impertinent rebuke which struck at a weak place in Nancy s conscience Just when the course of time and favour of circumstances seemed to have completely healed that old wound Jessica with her crazy malice grotesquely disguised came to revive the half forgotten pangs the shame and the doubt that had seemed to be things gone by It would have become her Nancy felt to treat her hapless friend of years ago in a spirit of gentle tolerance that she could not do so proved her and she recognised the fact still immature still a backward pupil in the school of life And in the Jubilee year I thought myself a decidedly accomplished person Never mind Her husband would come this evening Of him she could learn without humiliation His arrival was later than of wont Only at eleven o clock when with disappointment she had laid aside her book to go to bed did Tarrant s rap sound on the window I had given you up said Nancy Yet you are quite good tempered Why not It is the pleasant custom of wives to make a husband uncomfortable if he comes late Then I am no true wife laughed Nancy Something much better Tarrant muttered as he threw off his overcoat He began to talk of ordinary affairs and nearly half an hour elapsed before any mention was made of the event that had bettered their prospects Nancy looked over a piece of his writing in an evening paper which he had brought but she could not read it with attention The paper fell to her lap and she sat silent Clearly Tarrant would not be the first to speak of what was in both their minds The clock ticked the rain pattered without the journalist smoked his pipe and looked thoughtfully at the ceiling Are you sorry Nancy asked that I am no longer penniless Ah to be sure We must speak of that No I m not sorry If I get run over you and the boy Can make ourselves comfortable and forget you to be sure But for the present and until you do get run over You wish to make changes Don t you In one or two respects perhaps But leave me out of the question You have an income of your own to dispose of nothing oppressively splendid I suppose What do you think of doing What do you advise No no Make your own suggestion Nancy smiled hesitated and said at length I think we ought to take a house In London That s as you wish Not at all As you wish Do you want society In moderation And first of all yours Tarrant met her eyes Of my society you have quite as much as is good for you he answered amiably That you should wish for acquaintances is reasonable enough Take a house somewhere in the western suburbs One or two men I know have decent wives and you shall meet them But you You won t live with me You know my view of that matter Nancy kept her eyes down and reflected Will it be known to everybody that we don t live together Well answered Tarrant with a laugh by way of example I should rather like it to be known but as I know you wouldn t like it let the appearances be as ordinary as you please Again Nancy reflected She had a struggle with herself Just one question she said at length Look me in the face Are you ever so little ashamed of me He regarded her steadily smiling Not in the least You were you used to be Before I knew you and before I knew myself When in fact you were a notable young lady of Camberwell and I He paused to puff at his pipe And you A notable young fool of nowhere at all End of Project Gutenberg s In the Year of Jubilee by George Gissing END OF
