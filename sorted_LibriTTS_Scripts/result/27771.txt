none	none	do we mean by that Is The Wind in the Willows a children s book Is Alice in Wonderland Is Treasure Island These are masterpieces which we read with pleasure as children but with how much more pleasure when we are grown up In any case what do we mean by children A boy of three a girl of six a boy of ten a girl of fourteen are they all to like the same thing And is a book suitable for a boy of twelve any more likely to please a boy of twelve than a modern novel is likely to please a man of thirty seven even if the novel be described truly as suitable for a man of thirty seven I confess that I cannot grapple with these difficult problems But I am very sure of this that no one can write a book which children will like unless he write it for himself first That being so I shall say boldly that this is a story for grown ups How grown up I did not realise until I received a letter from an unknown reader a few weeks after its first publication a letter which said that he was delighted with my clever satires of the Kaiser mister Lloyd George and mister Asquith but he could not be sure which of the characters were meant to be mister Winston Churchill and mister Bonar Law Would I tell him on the enclosed postcard I replied that they were thinly disguised on the title page as Messrs Hodder Stoughton In fact it is not that sort of book But as you see I am still finding it difficult to explain just what sort of book it is Perhaps no explanation is necessary Read in it what you like read it to whomever you like be of what age you like it can only fall into one of two classes Either you will enjoy it or you won t It is that sort of book A A Milne CONTENTS I The King of Euralia has a Visitor to Breakfast II The Chancellor of Barodia has a Long Walk Home III The King of Euralia Draws his Sword IV The Princess Hyacinth Leaves it to the Countess V Belvane Indulges her Hobby VI There are no Wizards in Barodia VII The Princess Receives a Letter and Writes One VIII Prince Udo Sleeps Badly IX They are Afraid of Udo X Charlotte Patacake Astonishes the Critics XI Watercress Seems to go with the Ears XII We Decide to Write to Udo s

none	none	and then the outrageous thing happened It was all because of a birthday present to the King of Barodia and the present was nothing less than a pair of seven league boots The King being a busy man it was a week or more before he had an opportunity of trying those boots Meanwhile he used to talk about them at meals and he would polish them up every night before he went to bed When the great day came for the first trial of them to be made he took a patronising farewell of his wife and family ignored the many eager noses pressed against the upper windows of the Palace and sailed off The motion as perhaps you know is a little disquieting at first but one soon gets used to it After that it is fascinating He had gone some two thousand miles before he realised that there might be a difficulty about finding his way back The difficulty proved at least as great as he had anticipated For the rest of that day he toured backwards and forwards across the country and it was by the merest accident that a very angry King shot in through an open pantry window in the early hours of the morning He removed his boots and went softly to bed It was of course a lesson to him He decided that in the future he must proceed by a recognised route sailing lightly from landmark to landmark Such a route his Geographers prepared for him an early morning constitutional of three hundred miles or so to be taken ten times before breakfast He gave himself a week in which to recover his nerve and then started out on the first of them Illustration Most extraordinary said the King Now the Kingdom of Euralia adjoined that of Barodia but whereas Barodia was a flat country Euralia was a land of hills It was natural then that the Court Geographers in search of landmarks should have looked towards Euralia and over Euralia accordingly about the time when cottage and castle alike were breakfasting the King of Barodia soared and dipped and soared and dipped again A mother s tender hand said the King of Euralia is er never good gracious What s that There was a sudden rush of air something came for a moment between his Majesty and the sun and then all was quiet again What was it asked Hyacinth slightly alarmed Most extraordinary said the King It left in my mind an impression of ginger whiskers and large boots Do we know anybody like that The King of Barodia said Hyacinth has red whiskers but
83_11691_000045_000000	train-clean-100	 I don t know 
none	none	about his boots But what could he have been doing up there Unless There was another rush of wind in the opposite direction once more the sun was obscured and this time plain for a moment for all to see appeared the rapidly dwindling back view of the King of Barodia on his way home to breakfast Merriwig rose with dignity You re quite right Hyacinth he said sternly it was the King of Barodia Hyacinth looked troubled He oughtn t to come over anybody s breakfast table quite so quickly as that Ought he Father A lamentable display of manners my dear I shall withdraw now and compose a stiff note to him The amenities must be observed Looking as severe as a naturally jovial face would permit him and wondering a little if he had pronounced amenities right he strode to the library The library was his Majesty s favourite apartment Here in the mornings he would discuss affairs of state with his Chancellor or receive any distinguished visitors who were to come to his kingdom in search of adventure Here in the afternoon with a copy of What to say to a Wizard or some such book taken at random from the shelves he would give himself up to meditation And it was the distinguished visitors of the morning who gave him most to think about in the afternoon There were at this moment no fewer than seven different Princes engaged upon seven different enterprises to whom in the event of a successful conclusion he had promised the hand of Hyacinth and half his kingdom No wonder he felt that she needed the guiding hand of a mother The stiff note to Barodia was not destined to be written He was still hesitating between two different kinds of nib when the door was flung open and the fateful name of the Countess Belvane was announced The Countess Belvane What can I say which will bring home to you that wonderful terrible fascinating woman Mastered as she was by overweening ambition utterly unscrupulous in her methods of achieving her purpose none the less her adorable humanity betrayed itself in a passion for diary keeping and a devotion to the simpler forms of lyrical verse That she is the villain of the piece I know well in his Euralia Past and Present the eminent historian Roger Scurvilegs does not spare her but that she had her great qualities I should be the last to deny She had been writing poetry that morning and she wore green She always wore green when the Muse was upon her a pleasing habit which whether as a warning or an inspiration modern poets might do well to imitate She carried an enormous diary under her arm and in her mind several alternative ways of putting down her reflections on her way to the Palace Good morning dear Countess said the King rising only too gladly from his nibs an early visit You don t mind your Majesty said the Countess anxiously There was a point in our conversation yesterday about which I was not quite certain What were we talking about yesterday Oh your Majesty said the Countess affairs of state and she gave him that wicked innocent impudent and entirely scandalous look which he never could resist and you couldn t either for that matter Affairs of state of course smiled the King Why I made a special note of it in my diary She laid down the enormous volume and turned lightly over the pages Here we are Thursday His Majesty did me the honour to consult me about the future of his daughter the Princess Hyacinth Remained to tea and was very I can t quite make this word out Let me look said the King his rubicund face becoming yet more rubicund It looks like charming he said casually Fancy said Belvane Fancy my writing that I put down just what comes into my head at the time you know She made a gesture with her hand indicative of some one who puts down just what comes into her head at the time and returned to her diary Remained to tea and was very charming Mused afterwards on the mutability of life She looked up at him with wide open eyes I often muse when I m alone she said The King still hovered over the diary Have you any more entries like like that last one May I look Oh your Majesty I m afraid it s quite private She closed the book quickly I just thought I saw some poetry said the King Just a little ode to a favourite linnet It wouldn t interest your Majesty I adore poetry said the King who had himself written a rhymed couplet which could be said either forwards or backwards and in the latter position was useful for removing enchantments According to the eminent historian Roger Scurvilegs it had some vogue in Euralia and went like this Bo boll bill bole Wo woll will wole A pleasing idea temperately expressed The Countess of course was only pretending Really she was longing to read it It s quite a little thing she said Hail to thee blithe linnet Bird thou clearly art That from bush or in it Pourest thy full heart And leads the feathered choir in song Taking the treble part Beautiful said the King and one must agree with him Many years after another poet called Shelley plagiarised the idea but handled it in a more artificial and to my way of thinking decidedly inferior manner Was it a real bird said the King An old favourite Was it pleased about it Alas your Majesty it died without hearing it Poor bird said his Majesty I think it would have liked it Meanwhile Hyacinth innocent of the nearness of a mother remained on the castle walls and tried to get on with her breakfast But she made little progress with it After all it is annoying continually to look up from your bacon or whatever it is and see a foreign monarch passing overhead Eighteen more times the King of Barodia took Hyacinth in his stride At the end of the performance feeling rather giddy she went down to her father She found him alone in the library a foolish smile upon his face but no sign of a letter to Barodia in front of him Have you sent the Note yet she asked Note Note he said bewildered what oh you mean the Stiff Note to the King of Barodia I m just planning it my love The exact shade of stiffness combined with courtesy is a little difficult to hit I shouldn t be too courteous said Hyacinth he came over eighteen more times after you d gone Eighteen eighteen eight my dear it s outrageous I ve never had such a crowded breakfast before It s positively insulting Hyacinth This is no occasion for Notes We will talk to him in a language that he will understand And he went out to speak to the Captain of his Archers CHAPTER II THE CHANCELLOR OF BARODIA HAS A LONG WALK HOME Once more it was early morning on the castle walls The King sat at his breakfast table a company of archers drawn up in front of him Now you all understand he said When the King of Baro when a certain well when I say when I want you all to fire your arrows into the air You are to take no aim you are just to shoot your arrows upwards and er I want to see who gets highest Should anything er should anything brush up against them on their way not of course that it s likely well in that case er in that case something will er brush up against them After all what should Quite so Sire said the Captain or rather not at all Very well To your places Each archer fitted an arrow to his bow and took up his position A look out man had been posted Everything was ready The King was decidedly nervous He wandered from one archer to another asking after this man s wife and family praising the polish on that man s quiver or advising him to stand with his back a little more to the sun Now and then he would hurry off to the look out man on a distant turret point out Barodia on the horizon to him and hurry back again The look out knew all about it Royalty over he bellowed suddenly When roared the King and a cloud of arrows shot into the air Well done cried Hyacinth clapping her hands I mean how could you You might have hurt him Hyacinth said the King turning suddenly you here I have just come up Did you hit him Hit who The King of Barodia of course The King of My dear child what could the King of Barodia be doing here My archers were aiming at a hawk that they saw in the distance He beckoned to the Captain Did you hit that hawk he asked With one shot only Sire In the whisk in the tail feathers The King turned to Hyacinth With one shot only in the whisk in the tail feathers he said What was it my dear that you were saying about the King of Barodia Oh Father you are bad You hit the poor man right in the whisker His Majesty of Barodia And in the whisker My dear child this is terrible But what can he have been doing up there Dear dear this is really most unfortunate I must compose a note of apology about this I should leave the first note to him said Hyacinth Yes yes you re right No doubt he will wish to explain how he came to be there Just a moment dear He went over to his archers who were drawn up in line again You may take your men down now he said to the Captain Yes your Majesty His Majesty looked quickly round the castle walls and then leant confidentially towards the Captain Er which was the man who er he fingered his cheek er quite so The one on the left Ah yes He went to the man on the left and put a bag of gold into his hand You have a very good style with the bow my man Your wrist action is excellent I have never seen an arrow go so high The company saluted and withdrew The King and Hyacinth sat down to breakfast A little mullet my dear he said The Hereditary Grand Chancellor of Barodia never forgot that morning nor did he allow his wife to forget it His opening That reminds me dear of the day when though the signal of departure for any guests allowed no escape for his family They had to have it And indeed it was a busy day for him Summoned to the Palace at nine o clock he found the King nursing a bent whisker and in the very vilest of tempers His Majesty was for war at once the Chancellor leant towards the Stiff Note At least your Majesty he begged let me consult the precedents first There is no precedent said the King coldly for such an outrage as this Not precisely Sire but similar unfortunate occurrences have occurred It was worse than an occurrence I should have said an outrage your Majesty Your late lamented grandfather was unfortunate enough to come beneath the spell of the King of Araby under which he was compelled or perhaps I should say preferred to go about on his hands and knees for several weeks Your Majesty may recall how the people in their great loyalty adopted a similar mode of progression Now although your Majesty s case is not precisely on all fours Not at all on all fours said the King coldly An unfortunate metaphor I should say that although your Majesty s case is not parallel the procedure adopted in your revered grandfather s case I don t care what you do with your whiskers I don t care what anybody does with his whiskers said the King still soothing his own tenderly I want the King of Euralia s blood He looked round the Court To any one who will bring me the head of the King I will give the hand of my daughter in marriage There was a profound silence Which daughter said a cautious voice at last The eldest said the King There was another profound silence Illustration He found the King nursing a bent whisker and in the very vilest of tempers My suggestion your Majesty said the Chancellor is that for the present there should be merely an exchange of Stiff Notes and that meanwhile we scour the kingdom for an enchanter who shall take some pleasant revenge for us upon his Majesty of Euralia For instance Sire a king whose head has been permanently fixed on upside down lacks somewhat of that regal dignity which alone can command the respect of his subjects A couple of noses again placed at different angles so they cannot both be blown together Yes yes said the King impatiently I ll think of the things if once you can find the enchanter But they are not so common nowadays Besides enchanters are delicate things to work with They have a habit of forgetting which side they are on The Chancellor s mouth drooped piteously Well said the King condescendingly I ll tell you what we ll do You may send one Stiff Note and then we will declare war Thank you your Majesty said the Chancellor So the Stiff Note was dispatched It pointed out that his Majesty of Barodia while in the act of taking his early morning constitutional had been severely insulted by an arrow This arrow though fortunately avoiding the more vital parts of his Majesty s person went so far as to wound a favourite whisker For this the fullest reparation must be made and so forth and so on Euralia s reply was not long delayed It expressed the deepest concern at the unhappy accident which had overtaken a friendly monarch On the morning in question his Majesty had been testing his archers in a shooting competition at a distant hawk which competition it might interest his Majesty of Barodia to know had been won by Henry Smallnose a bowman of considerable promise In the course of the competition it was noticed that a foreign body of some sort brushed up against one of the arrows but as this in no way affected the final placing of the competitors little attention was paid to it His Majesty of Barodia might rest assured that the King had no wish to pursue the matter farther Indeed he was always glad to welcome his Barodian Majesty on these occasions Other shooting competitions would be arranged from time to time and if his Majesty happened to be passing at the moment the King of Euralia hoped that he would come down and join them Trusting that her Majesty and their Royal Highnesses were well and so on and so forth The Grand Chancellor of Barodia read this answer to his Stiff Note with a growing feeling of uneasiness It was he who had exposed his Majesty to this fresh insult and unless he could soften it in some way his morning at the Palace might be a painful one As he entered the precincts he wondered whether the King would be wearing the famous boots and whether they kicked seven leagues as easily as they strode them He felt more and more that there were notes which you could break gently and notes which you couldn t Five minutes later as he started on his twenty one mile walk home he realised that this was one of the ones which you couldn t This then was the real reason of the war between Euralia and Barodia I am aware that in saying this I differ from the eminent historian Roger Scurvilegs In Chapter IX of his immortal work Euralia Past and Present he attributes the quarrel between the two countries to quite other causes The King of Barodia he says demanded the hand of the Princess Hyacinth for his eldest son The King of Euralia made some commonplace condition as that his Royal Highness should first ride his horse up a glassy mountain in the district a condition which his Majesty of Barodia strongly resented I am afraid that Roger is incurably romantic I have had to speak to him about it before There was nothing of the sentimental in the whole business and the facts are exactly as I have narrated them CHAPTER III THE KING OF EURALIA DRAWS HIS SWORD No doubt you have already guessed that it was the Countess Belvane who dictated the King of Euralia s answer Left to himself Merriwig would have said Serve you jolly well right for stalking over my kingdom His repartee was never very subtle Hyacinth would have said Of course we re awfully sorry but a whisker isn t very bad is it and you really oughtn t to come to breakfast without being asked The Chancellor would have scratched his head for a long time and then said Referring to Chap VII Para two hundred fifty nine of the King s Regulations we notice But Belvane had her own way of doing things and if you suggest that she wanted to make Barodia s declaration of war inevitable well the story will show whether you are right in supposing that she had her reasons It came a little hard on the Chancellor of Barodia but the innocent must needs suffer for the ambitions of the unprincipled a maxim I borrow from Euralia Past and Present Roger in his moral vein Well said Merriwig to the Countess that s done it It really is war asked Belvane It is Hyacinth is looking out my armour at this moment What did the King of Barodia say He didn t say anything He wrote W A R in red on a dirty bit of paper pinned it to my messenger s ear and sent him back again How very crude said the Countess Oh I thought it was er rather forcible said the King awkwardly Secretly he had admired it a good deal and wished that he had been the one to do it Of course said the Countess with a charming smile that sort of thing depends so very much on who does it Now from your Majesty it would have seemed dignified He must have been very angry said the King picking up first one and then another of a number of swords which lay in front of him I wish I had seen his face when he got my Note So do I sighed the Countess She wished it much more than the King It is the tragedy of writing a good letter that you cannot be there when it is opened a maxim of my own the thought never having occurred to Roger Scurvilegs who was a dull correspondent The King was still taking up and putting down his swords It s very awkward he muttered I wonder if Hyacinth He went to the door and called Hyacinth Coming Father called back Hyacinth from a higher floor The Countess rose and curtsied deeply Good morning your Royal Highness Good morning Countess said Hyacinth brightly She liked the Countess you couldn t help it but rather wished she didn t Oh Hyacinth said the King come and tell me about these swords Which is my magic one Hyacinth looked at him blankly Oh Father she said I don t know at all Does it matter very much My dear child of course it matters Supposing I am fighting the King of Barodia and I have my magic sword then I m bound to win Supposing I haven t then I m not bound to Supposing you both had magic swords said Belvane It was the sort of thing she would say The King looked up slowly at her and began to revolve the idea in his mind Well really he said I hadn t thought of that Upon my word I He turned to his daughter Hyacinth what would happen if we both had magic swords I suppose you d go on fighting for ever said Hyacinth Or until the magic wore out of one of them said Belvane innocently There must be something about it somewhere said the King whose morning was in danger of being quite spoilt by this new suggestion I d ask the Chancellor to look it up only he s so busy just now He d have plenty of time while the combat was going on said Belvane thoughtfully Wonderful creature she saw already the Chancellor hurrying up to announce that the King of Euralia had won at the very moment when he lay stretched on the ground by a mortal thrust from his adversary The King turned to his swords again Well anyway I m going to be sure of mine he said Hyacinth haven t you any idea which it is He added in rather a hurt voice Naturally I left the marking of my swords to you His daughter examined the swords one by one Here it is she cried It s got M on it for magic Or Merriwig said the Countess to her diary The expression of joy on the King s face at his daughter s discovery had just time to appear and fade away again You are not being very helpful this morning Countess he said severely Instantly the Countess was on her feet her diary thrown to the floor no never thrown laid gently on the floor and herself hands clasped at her breast a figure of reproachful penitence before him Oh your Majesty forgive me if your Majesty had only asked me I didn t know your Majesty wanted me I thought her Royal Highness But of course I ll find your Majesty s sword for you Did she stroke his head as she said this I have often wondered It would be like her impudence and her motherliness and her and in fact like her Euralia Past and Present is silent upon the point Roger Scurvilegs who had only seen Belvane at the unimpressionable age of two would have had it against her if he could so perhaps there is nothing in it There she said and she picked out the magic sword almost at once Illustration Try it on me cried the Countess Then I ll get back to my work said Hyacinth cheerfully and left them to each other The King smiling happily girded on his sword But a sudden doubt assailed him Are you sure it s the one Try it on me cried the Countess superbly falling on her knees and stretching up her arms to him The toe of her little shoe touched her diary its presence there uplifted her Even as she knelt she saw herself describing the scene How do you spell offered she wondered I think the King was already in love with her though he found it so difficult to say the decisive words But even so he could only have been in love a week or two a fortnight in the last forty years and he had worn a sword since he was twelve In a crisis it is the old love and not the greater love which wins Roger s but I think I agree with him and instinctively the King drew his sword If it were magic a scratch would kill Now he would know Her enemies said that the Countess could not go pale she had her faults but this was not one of them She whitened as she saw the King standing over her with drawn sword A hundred thoughts chased each other through her mind She wondered if the King would be sorry afterwards she wondered what the minstrels would sing of her and if her diary would ever be made public most of all she wondered why she had been such a fool such a melodramatic fool The King came to himself with a sudden start Looking slightly ashamed he put his sword back in its scabbard coughed once or twice to cover his confusion and held his hand out to the Countess to assist her to rise Don t be absurd Countess he said As if we could spare you at a time like this Sit down and let us talk matters over seriously A trifle bewildered by the emotions she had gone through Belvane sat down the beloved diary clasped tightly in her arms Life seemed singularly sweet just then the only drawback being that the minstrels would not be singing about her after all Still one cannot have everything The King walked up and down the room as he talked I am going away to fight he said and I leave my dear daughter behind In my absence her Royal Highness will of course rule the country I want her to feel that she can lean upon you Countess for advice and support I know that I can trust you for you have just given me a great proof of your devotion and courage Oh your Majesty said Belvane deprecatingly but feeling very glad that it hadn t been wasted Hyacinth is young and inexperienced She needs a a A mother s guiding hand said Belvane softly The King started and looked away It was really too late to propose now he had so much to do before the morrow Better leave it till he came back from the war You will have no official position he went on hastily other than your present one of Mistress of the Robes but your influence on her will be very great The Countess had already decided on this However there is a look of modest resignation to an unsought duty which is suited to an occasion of this kind and the Countess had no difficulty in supplying it I will do all that I can your Majesty to help gladly but will not the Chancellor The Chancellor will come with me He is no fighter but he is good at spells He looked round to make sure that they were alone and then went on confidentially He tells me that he has discovered in the archives of the palace a Backward Spell of great value Should he be able to cast this upon the enemy at the first onslaught he thinks that our heroic army would have no difficulty in advancing But there will be other learned men said Belvane innocently so much more accustomed to affairs than us poor women so much better able What nonsense I m talking she said to herself to advise her Royal Highness Men like that said the King I shall want with me also If I am to invade Barodia properly I shall need every man in the kingdom Euralia must be for the time a country of women only He turned to her with a smile and said gallantly That will be er It is er not er One may well er It was so obvious from his manner that something complimentary was struggling to the surface of his mind that Belvane felt it would be kinder not to wait for it Oh your Majesty she said you flatter my poor sex Not at all said the King trying to remember what he had said He held out his hand Well Countess I have much to do I too your Majesty She made him a deep curtsey and clasping tightly the precious diary withdrew The King who still seemed worried about something returned to his table and took up his pen Here Hyacinth discovered him ten minutes later His table was covered with scraps of paper and her eyes lighting casually upon one of them she read these remarkable words In such a land I should be a most contented subject She looked at some of the others They were even shorter That dear Countess would be my A country in which even a King Lucky country The last was crossed out and Bad written against it Whatever are these Father said Hyacinth The King jumped up in great confusion Nothing dear nothing he said I was just er Of course I shall have to address my people and I was just jotting down a few However I shan t want them now He swept them together screwed them up tight and dropped them into a basket And what became of them you ask Did they light the fires of the Palace next morning Well now here s a curious thing In Chapter X of Euralia Past and Present I happened across these words The King and all the men of the land having left to fight the wicked Barodians Euralia was now a country of women only a country in which even a King might be glad to be a subject Now what does this mean Is it another example of literary theft I have already had to expose Shelley Must I now drag into the light of day a still worse plagiarism by Roger Scurvilegs The waste paper baskets of the Palace were no doubt open to him as to so many historians But should he not have made acknowledgments I do not wish to be hard on Roger That I differ from him on many points of historical fact has already been made plain and will be made still more plain as my story goes on But I have a respect for the man and on some matters particularly those concerning Prince Udo of Araby s first appearance in Euralia I have to rely entirely upon him for my information Moreover I have never hesitated to give him credit for such of his epigrams as I have introduced into this book and I like to think that he would be equally punctilious to others We know his romantic way no doubt the thought occurred to him independently Let us put it at that anyhow Belvane meanwhile was getting on The King had drawn his sword on her and she had not flinched As a reward she was to be the power behind the throne Not necessarily behind the throne said Belvane to herself CHAPTER IV THE PRINCESS HYACINTH LEAVES IT TO THE COUNTESS It is now time to introduce Wiggs to you and I find myself in a difficulty at once What was Wiggs s position in the Palace This story is hard to tell for I have to piece it together from the narratives of others and to supply any gaps in their stories from my knowledge of how the different characters might be expected to act Perhaps therefore it is a good moment in which to introduce to you the authorities upon whom I rely First and foremost of course comes Roger Scurvilegs His monumental work Euralia Past and Present in seventeen volumes towers upon my desk as I write By the merest chance I picked it up in a metaphorical sense at that little shop near I forget its name but it s the third bookshop on the left as you come into London from the New Barnet end Upon him I depend for the broad lines of my story and I have already indicated my opinion of the value of his work Secondly come the many legends and ballads handed on to me years ago by my aunt by marriage one of the Cornish Smallnoses She claims to be a direct descendant of that Henry Smallnose whose lucky shot brought about the events which I am to describe I say she claims to be and one cannot doubt a lady s word in these matters certainly she used to speak about Henry with that mixture of pride and extreme familiarity which comes best from a relation In all matters not touching Henry I feel that I can rely upon her in its main lines her narrative is strictly confirmed by Scurvilegs and she brought to it a picturesqueness and an appreciation of the true character of Belvane which is lacking in the other but her attitude towards Henry Smallnose was absurd Indeed she would have had him the hero of the story This makes Roger and myself smile We give him credit for the first shot and then we drop him Thirdly Belvane herself Women like Belvane never die and I met her or a reincarnation of her at a country house in Shropshire last summer I forget what she calls herself now but I recognised her at once and as I watched her the centuries rolled away and she and I were in Euralia that pleasant country together Stayed to tea and was very charming Would she have said that of me I wonder But I m getting sentimental Roger s great fault These then are my authorities I consult them and I ask myself What was Wiggs Roger speaks of her simply as an attendant upon the Princess Now we know that the Princess was seventeen Wiggs then would be about the same age a lady in waiting perhaps even a little older Why not you say The Lady Wiggs maid of honour to her Royal Highness the Princess Hyacinth eighteen and a bit tall and stately Since she is to endanger Belvane s plans let her be something of a match for the wicked woman Yes but you would never talk like that if you had heard one of my aunt s stories Nor if you had seen Belvane would you think that any grown up woman could be a match for her Wiggs was a child I feel it in my bones In all the legends and ballads handed down to me by my aunt she appears to me as a little girl Alice in a fairy story Roger or no Roger I must have her a child And even Roger cannot keep up the farce that she is a real lady in waiting In one place he tells us that she dusts the throne of the Princess can you see her ladyship eighteen last February doing that At other times he allows her to take orders from the Countess I ask you to imagine a maid of honour taking orders from any but her own mistress Conceive her dignity A little friend then of Hyacinth s let us say ready to do anything for anybody who loved or appeared to love her mistress The King had departed for the wars His magic sword girded to his side his cloak of darkness not worn but rolled up behind him lest the absence of his usual extensive shadow should disturb his horse he rode at the head of his men to meet the enemy Hyacinth had seen him off from the Palace steps Five times he had come back to give her his last instructions and a sixth time for his sword but now he was gone and she was alone on the castle walls with Wiggs Saying good bye to fathers is very tiring said Hyacinth I do hope he ll be all right Wiggs although we oughtn t to mention it to anybody and although he s only just gone we do think it will be rather fun being Queen don t we It must be lovely said Wiggs gazing at her with large eyes Can you really do whatever you like now 
4137_11701_000035_000000	train-clean-100	Hyacinth nodded 
none	none	I always did whatever I liked she said But now I really can do it Could you cut anybody s head off Easily said the Princess confidently I should hate to cut anybody s head off So should I Wiggs Let s decide to have no heads off just at present till we re more used to it Wiggs still kept her eyes fixed upon the Princess Which is stronger she asked you or a Fairy I knew you were going to ask something horrid like that said Hyacinth pretending to be angry She looked quickly round to see that nobody was listening and then whispered in Wiggs s ear I am O oh said Wiggs How lovely Isn t it Did you ever hear the story of Father and the Fairy His Majesty His Majesty the King of Euralia It happened in the forest one day just after he became King Did you ever hear the story I expect not Well then you must hear it But there will be too many inverted commas in it if I let Hyacinth tell you so I shall tell you myself Illustration Five times he had come back to give her his last instructions It was just after he became King He was so proud that he used to go about saying I am the King I am the King And sometimes The King am I The King I am He was saying this one day in the forest when a Fairy overheard him So she appeared in front of him and said I believe you are the King I am the King said Merriwig I am the King I am the And yet said the Fairy what is a King after all It is a very powerful thing to be a King said Merriwig proudly Supposing I were to turn you into a a small sheep Then where would you be The King thought anxiously for a moment I should like to be a small sheep he said The Fairy waved her wand Then you can be one she said until you own that a Fairy is much more powerful than a King So all at once he was a small sheep Well said the Fairy Well said the King Which is more powerful a King or a Fairy A King said Merriwig Besides being more woolly he added There was silence for a little Merriwig began to eat some grass I don t think much of Fairies he said with his mouth full I don t think they re very powerful The Fairy looked at him angrily They can t make you say things you don t want to say he explained The Fairy stamped her foot Be a toad she said waving her wand A nasty horrid crawling toad I ve always wanted began Merriwig to be a toad he ended from lower down Well said the Fairy I don t think much of Fairies said the King I don t think they re very powerful He waited for the Fairy to look at him but she pretended to be thinking of something else After waiting a minute or two he added They can t make you say things you don t want to say The Fairy stamped her foot still more angrily and moved her wand a third time Be silent she commanded And stay silent for ever There was no sound in the forest The Fairy looked at the blue sky through the green roof above her she looked through the tall trunks of the trees to the King s castle beyond her eyes fell upon the little glade on her left upon the mossy bank on her right but she would not look down to the toad at her feet No she wouldn t She wouldn t And yet It was too much for her She could resist no longer She looked at the nasty horrid crawling toad the dumb toad at her feet that was once a King And catching her eye the toad winked Some winks are more expressive than others The Fairy knew quite well what this one meant It meant I don t think much of Fairies I don t think they re very powerful They can t make you say things you don t want to say The Fairy waved her wand in disgust Oh be a King again she said impatiently and vanished And so that is the story of how the King of Euralia met the Fairy in the forest Roger Scurvilegs tells it well indeed almost as well as I do but he burdens it with a moral You must think it out for yourself I shall not give it to you Wiggs didn t bother about the moral Her elbows on her knees her chin resting on her hands she gazed at the forest and imagined the scene to herself How wonderful to be a King like that she thought That was a long time ago explained Hyacinth Father must have been rather lovely in those days she added It was a very bad Fairy said Wiggs It was a very stupid one I wouldn t have given in to Father like that But there are good Fairies aren t there I met one once You child Where I don t know if it would have made any difference to Euralian history if Wiggs had been allowed to tell about her Fairy then as it was she didn t tell the story till later on when Belvane happened to be near I regret to say that Belvane listened It was the sort of story that always got overheard she explained afterwards as if that were any excuse On this occasion she was just too early to overhear but in time to prevent the story being told without her The Countess Belvane said an attendant and her ladyship made a superb entry Good morning Countess said Hyacinth Good morning your Royal Highness Ah Wiggs sweet child she added carelessly putting out a hand to pat the sweet child s head but missing it Wiggs was just telling me a story said the Princess Sweet child said Belvane feeling vaguely for her with the other hand Could I interrupt the story with a little business your Royal Highness At a nod from the Princess Wiggs withdrew Well said Hyacinth nervously Belvane had always a curious effect on the Princess when they were alone together There was something about her large manner which made Hyacinth feel like a schoolgirl who has been behaving badly alarmed and apologetic I feel like this myself when I have an interview with my publishers and Roger Scurvilegs upon the same subject drags in a certain uncle of his before whom so he says he always appears at his worst It is a common experience Just one or two little schemes to submit to your Majesty said the Countess How silly of me I mean your Royal Highness Of course your Royal Highness may not like them at all but in case your Royal Highness did I just well I just wrote them out She unfolded one by one a series of ornamental parchments They are beautifully written said the Princess Belvane blushed at the compliment She had a passion for coloured inks and rulers In her diary the day of the week was always underlined in red the important words in the day s doings being frequently picked out in gold On taking up the diary you saw at once that you were in the presence of somebody The first parchment was headed SCHEME FOR ECONOMY IN REALM Economy caught the eye in pale pink The next parchment was headed SCHEME FOR SAFETY OF REALM Safety clamoured to you in blue The third parchment was headed SCHEME FOR ENCOURAGEMENT OF LITERATURE IN REALM Encouragement of Literature had got rather cramped in the small quarters available for it A heading Belvane felt should be in one line she had started in letters too big for it and the fact that the green ink was giving out made it impossible to start afresh There were ten parchments altogether By the end of the third one the Princess began to feel uncomfortable By the end of the fifth one she knew that it was a mistake her ever having come into the Royal Family at all By the end of the seventh she decided that if the Countess would forgive her this time she would never be naughty again By the end of the ninth one she was just going to cry The tenth one was in a very loud orange and was headed SCHEME FOR ASSISTING CALISTHENICS IN REALM Yes said the Princess faintly I think it would be a good idea I thought if your Royal Highness approved said Belvane 
4137_11702_000053_000005	train-clean-100	we might 
none	none	just Hyacinth felt herself blushing guiltily she couldn t think why I leave it to you Countess she murmured I am sure you know best It was a remark which she would never have made to her Father CHAPTER V BELVANE INDULGES HER HOBBY In a glade in the forest the Countess Belvane was sitting her throne a fallen log her courtiers that imaginary audience which was always with her For once in her life she was nervous she had an anxious morning in front of her I can tell you the reason at once Her Royal Highness was going to review her Royal Highness s Army of Amazons see Scheme II Safety of Realm In half an hour she would be here And why not you say Could anything be more gratifying I will tell you why not There was no Army of Amazons In order that her Royal Highness should not know the sad truth Belvane drew their pay for them Twas better thus In any trouble Belvane comforted herself by reading up her diary She undid the enormous volume and idly turning the pages read some of the more delightful extracts to herself Monday June first she read Became bad She gave a sigh of resignation to the necessity of being bad Roger Scurvilegs is of the opinion that she might have sighed a good many years before According to him she was born bad Tuesday June second she read on Realised in the privacy of my heart that I was destined to rule the country Wednesday June third Decided to oust the Princess Thursday June fourth Began ousting What a confession for any woman even for one who had become bad last Monday No wonder Belvane s diary was not for everybody Let us look over her shoulder and read some more of the wicked woman s confessions Friday June fifth Made myself a Oh that s quite private However we may read this Thought for the week Beware lest you should tumble down In reaching for another s crown An admirable sentiment which Roger Scurvilegs would have approved although he could not have rhymed it so neatly The Countess turned on a few more pages and prepared to write up yesterday s events Tuesday June twenty third she said to herself Now what happened Acclaimed with enthusiasm outside the Palace how do you spell enthusiasm She bit the end of her pencil and pondered She turned back the pages till she came to the place Yes she said thoughtfully It had three s s last time so it s z s turn She wrote enthuzziazm lightly in pencil later on it would be picked out in gold She closed the diary hastily Somebody was coming It was Wiggs Oh if you please your Ladyship her Royal Highness sent me to tell you that she would be here at eleven o clock to review her new army It was the last thing of which Belvane wanted reminding Ah Wiggs sweet child she said you find me overwhelmed She gave a tragic sigh Leader of the Corps de Ballet she indicated with her toe how this was done Commander in Chief of the Army of Amazons here she saluted and it was certainly the least she could do for the money Warden of the Antimacassars and Grand Mistress of the Robes I have a busy life Just come and dust this log for her Royal Highness All this work wears me out Wiggs but it is my duty and I do it Woggs says you make a very good thing out of it said Wiggs innocently as she began to dust It must be nice to make very good things out of things The Countess looked coldly at her It is one thing to confide to your diary that you are bad it s quite another to have Woggsseses shouting it out all over the country I don t know what Woggs is said Belvane sternly but send it to me at once As soon as Wiggs was gone Belvane gave herself up to her passions She strode up and down the velvety sward saying to herself Bother Bother Bother Bother Her outbreak of violence over she sat gloomily down on the log and abandoned herself to despair Her hair fell in two plaits down her back to her waist on second thoughts she arranged them in front if one is going to despair one may as well do it to the best advantage Suddenly a thought struck her I am alone she said Dare I soliloquise I will It is a thing I have not done for weeks Oh what a She got up quickly Nobody could soliloquise on a log like that she said crossly She decided she could do it just as effectively when standing With one pale hand raised to the skies she began again Oh what a Did you call me Mum said Woggs appearing suddenly Bother said Belvane She gave a shrug of resignation Another time she told herself She turned to Woggs Woggs must have been quite close at hand to have been found by Wiggs so quickly and I suspect her of playing in the forest when she ought to have been doing her lessons or mending stockings or whatever made up her day s work Woggs I find nearly as difficult to explain as Wiggs it is a terrible thing for an author to have a lot of people running about his book without any invitation from him at all However since Woggs is there we must make the best of her I fancy that she was a year or two younger than Wiggs and of rather inferior education Witness her low innuendo about the Lady Belvane and the fact that she called a Countess Mum Come here said Belvane Are you what they call Woggs Please Mum said Woggs nervously The Countess winced at the Mum but went on bravely What have you been saying about me N Nothing Mum Belvane winced again and said Do you know what I do to little girls who say things about me I cut their heads off I She tried to think of something very alarming I I stop their jam for tea I I am most annoyed with them Woggs suddenly saw what a wicked thing she had done Oh please Mum she said brokenly and fell on her knees Don t call me Mum burst out Belvane It s so ugly Why do you suppose I ever wanted to be a countess at all Woggs if it wasn t so as not to be called Mum any more I don t know Mum said Woggs Belvane gave it up The whole morning was going wrong anyhow Come here child she sighed and listen You have been a very naughty girl but I m going to let you off this time and in return I ve something you are going to do for me Yes Mum said Woggs Belvane barely shuddered now A sudden brilliant plan had come to her Her Royal Highness is about to review her Army of Amazons It is a sudden idea of her Royal Highness s and it comes at an unfortunate moment for it so happens that the Army is er What was the Army doing Ah yes manoeuvring in a distant part of the country But we must not disappoint her Royal Highness What then shall we do Woggs I don t know Mum said Woggs stolidly Not having expected any real assistance from her the Countess went on I will tell you You see yonder tree Armed to the teeth you will march round and round it giving the impression to one on this side of a large army passing For this you will be rewarded Here is She felt in the bag she carried No on second thoughts I will owe it to you Now you quite understand Yes Mum said Woggs Very well then Run along to the Palace and get a sword and a helmet and a bow and an arrow and an an arrow and anything you like and then come back here and wait behind those bushes When I clap my hands the army will begin to march Woggs curtsied and ran off It is probable that at this point the Countess would have resumed her soliloquy but we shall never know for the next moment the Princess and her Court were seen approaching from the other end of the glade Belvane advanced to meet them Good morning your Royal Highness she said a beautiful day is it not Beautiful Countess With the Court at her back Hyacinth for the moment was less nervous than usual but almost at the first words of the Countess she felt her self confidence oozing from her Did I say I was like this with my publishers And Roger s dragged in Uncle one can t explain it The Court stood about in picturesque attitudes while Belvane went on Your Royal Highness s brave Women Defenders the Home Defence Army of Amazons here she saluted one soon gets into the knack of it and it gives an air of efficiency have looked forward to this day for weeks How their hearts fill with pride at the thought of being reviewed by your Royal Highness She had paid or rather received the money for the Army so often that she had quite got to believe in its existence She even kept a roll of the different companies it meant more delightful red ink for one thing and wrote herself little notes recommending Corporal Gretal Hottshott for promotion to sergeant I know very little about armies I m afraid said Hyacinth I ve always left that to my father But I think it s a sweet idea of yours to enrol the women to defend me It s a little expensive is it not Your Royal Highness armies are always expensive The Princess took her seat and beckoned Wiggs with a smile to her side The Court in attitudes even more picturesque than before grouped itself behind her Is your Royal Highness ready Quite ready Countess The Countess clapped her hands There was a moment s hesitation and then armed to the teeth Amazon after Amazon marched by An impressive scene However Wiggs must needs try to spoil it Why it s Woggs she cried Silly child said Belvane in an undertone giving her a push The Princess looked round inquiringly The absurd creature explained the Countess thought she recognized a friend in your Royal Highness s gallant Army How clever of her They all look exactly alike to me Belvane was equal to the occasion The uniform and discipline of an army have that effect rather she said It has often been noticed I suppose so said the Princess vaguely Oughtn t they to march in fours I seem to remember when I came to reviews with Father Ah your Royal Highness that was an army of men With women well we found that if they marched side by side they would talk all the time The Court which had been resting on the right leg with the left knee bent now rested on the left leg with the right knee bent Woggs also was getting tired The last company of the Army of Amazons was not marching with the abandon of the first company Illustration Armed to the teeth Amazon after Amazon marched by I think I should like them to halt now so that I can address them said Hyacinth Belvane was taken aback for the moment I am afraid your your Royal Highness she stammered her brain working busily all the time that that would be contrary to to to the spirit of er the King s Regulations An army an army in marching order must er march She made a long forward movement with her hand Must march she repeated with an innocent smile I see said Hyacinth blushing guiltily again Belvane gave a loud cough The last veteran but two of the Army looked inquiringly at her and passed The last veteran but one came in and was greeted with a still louder cough Rather tentatively the last veteran of all entered and met such an unmistakable frown that it was obvious that the march past was over Woggs took off her helmet and rested in the bushes That is all your Royal Highness said Belvane one hundred fifty eight marches past two hundred seventeen reported sick making six hundred twenty two nine are on guard at the Palace six hundred thirty two and nine make eight hundred fifteen Add twenty eight under age and we bring it up to the round thousand Wiggs opened her mouth to say something but decided that her mistress would probably wish to say it instead Hyacinth however merely looked unhappy Belvane came a little nearer I er forgot if I mentioned to your Royal Highness that we are paying out today One silver piece a day and several days in the week multiplied by how many did I say comes to ten thousand pieces of gold She produced a document beautifully ruled If your Royal Highness would kindly initial here Mechanically the Princess signed Thank you your Royal Highness And now perhaps I had better go and see about it at once She curtsied deeply and then remembering her position saluted and marched off Now Roger Scurvilegs would see her go without a pang he would then turn over to his next chapter beginning Meanwhile the King and leave you under the impression that the Countess Belvane was a common thief I am no such chronicler as that At all costs I will be fair to my characters Belvane then had a weakness She had several of which I have already told you but this is another one She had a passion for the distribution of largesse I know an old gentleman who plays bowls every evening He trundles his skip or whatever he calls it to one end of the green toddles after it and trundles it back again Think of him for a moment and then think of Belvane on her cream white palfrey tossing a bag of gold to right of her and flinging a bag of gold to left of her as she rides through the cheering crowds upon my word I think hers is the more admirable exercise And I assure you no less exacting When once one has got into this habit of flinging or tossing money to give it in any ordinary way to slide it gently into the palm is unbearable Which of us who has in an heroic moment flung half a crown to a cabman can ever be content afterwards to hold out a handful of three penny bits and coppers to him One must always be flinging So it was with Belvane The largesse habit had got hold of her It is an expensive habit but her way of doing it was less expensive than most The people were taxed to pay for the Amazon Army the pay of the Amazon Army was flung back at them could anything be fairer True it brought her admiration and applause But what woman does not like admiration Is that an offence If it is it is something very different from the common theft of which Roger Scurvilegs would accuse her Let us be fair CHAPTER VI THERE ARE NO WIZARDS IN BARODIA Meanwhile the King of Euralia was prosecuting the war with utmost vigour So says Roger in that famous chapter of his and certainly Merriwig was very busy On the declaration of war the Euralian forces in accordance with custom had marched into Barodia However hot ran the passion between them the two Kings always preserved the elementary courtesies of war The last battle had taken place in Euralian territory this time therefore Barodia was the scene of the conflict To Barodia then King Merriwig had led his army Suitable pasture land had been allotted them as a camping ground and amid the cheers of the Barodian populace the Euralians made their simple preparations for the night The two armies had now been sitting opposite to each other for some weeks but neither side had been idle On the very first morning Merriwig had put on his Cloak of Darkness and gone to the enemy s camp to explore the situation Unfortunately the same idea had occurred at the same moment to the King of Barodia He also had his Cloak of Darkness Half way across to the utmost astonishment of both the two Kings had come violently into contact Realising that they had met some unprecedented enchantment they had hurried home after the recoil to consult their respective Chancellors The Chancellors could make nothing of it They could only advise their Majesties to venture another attempt on the following morning But by a different route said the Chancellors whereby the Magic Pillar shall be avoided So by the more southerly path the two Kings ventured out next morning Half way across there was another violent collision and both Kings sat down suddenly to think it out Wonder of wonders said Merriwig There is a magic wall stretching between the two armies He stood up and holding up his hand said impressively Bo boll bill bole Wo woll Mystery of mysteries cried the King of Barodia It can He stopped suddenly Both Kings coughed They were remembering with some shame their fright of yesterday Who are you said the King of Barodia Merriwig saw that there was need to dissemble His Majesty s swineherd he said in what he imagined might be a swineherd s voice Er so am I said the King of Barodia rather feebly There was
83_11691_000061_000001	train-clean-100	 obviously 
none	none	nothing for it but for them to discuss swine Merriwig was comfortably ignorant of the subject The King of Barodia knew rather less than that Er how many have you asked the latter Seven thousand said Merriwig at random Er so have I said the King of Barodia still more feebly Couples explained Merriwig Mine are ones said the King of Barodia determined to be independent at last Each King was surprised to find how easy it was to talk to an expert on his own subject The King of Barodia indeed began to feel reckless Well he said I must be getting back It s er milking time So must I said Merriwig By the way he added what do you feed yours on The King of Barodia was not quite sure if it was apple sauce or not He decided that perhaps it wasn t That s a secret he said darkly Been handed down from generation to generation Merriwig could think of nothing better to say to this than Ah He said it very impressively and with a word of farewell returned to his camp He was in brilliant form over the wassail bowl that night as he drew a picture of his triumphant dissimulation It is only fair to say that the King of Barodia was in brilliant form too For several weeks after this the battle raged Sometimes the whole Euralian army would line up outside its camp and call upon the Barodians to fight at other times the Barodian army would form fours in full view of the Euralians in the hope of provoking a conflict At intervals the two Chancellors would look up old spells scour the country for wizards or send each other insulting messages At the end of a month it was difficult to say which side had obtained the advantage A little hill surmounted by a single tree lay half way between the two camps Thither one fine morning came the two Kings and the two Chancellors on bloody business bent The phrase is Roger s Their object was nothing less than to arrange that personal fight between the two monarchs which was always a feature of Barodo Euralian warfare The two Kings having shaken hands their Chancellors proceeded to settle the details I suppose said the Chancellor of Barodia that your Majesties will wish to fight with swords Certainly said the King of Barodia promptly so promptly that Merriwig felt certain that he had a Magic Sword too Cloaks of Darkness are not allowed of course said the Chancellor of Euralia Why have you got one said each King quickly to the other Merriwig was the first to recover himself
4137_11702_000054_000001	train-clean-100	 I have one 
none	none	naturally he said It s a curious thing that the only one of my subjects who has one is my er swineherd That s funny said the King of Barodia My swineherd has one too Of course said Merriwig they are almost a necessity to swineherding Particularly in the milking season said the King of Barodia They looked at each other with added respect Not many Kings in those days had the technicalities of such a humble trade at their fingers ends The Chancellor of Barodia has been referring to the precedents It was after the famous conflict between the two grandfathers of your Majesties that the use of the Magic Cloak in personal combats was discontinued Great grandfathers said the Chancellor of Euralia Grandfathers I think Great grandfathers if I am not mistaken Their tempers were rising rapidly and the Chancellor of Barodia was just about to give the Chancellor of Euralia a push when Merriwig intervened Never mind about that he said impatiently Tell us what happened when our our ancestors fought It happened in this way your Majesty Your Majesty s grandfather Great grandfather said a small voice The Chancellor cast one bitter look at his opponent and went on The ancestors of your two Majesties arranged to settle the war of that period by personal combat The two armies were drawn up in full array In front of them the two monarchs shook hands Drawing their swords and casting their Magic Cloaks around them they Well said Merriwig eagerly It is rather a painful story your Majesty Go on I shan t mind Well your Majesty drawing their swords and casting their Magic Cloaks around them they h r m returned to the wassail bowl Dear dear said Merriwig Illustration When the respective armies returned to camp they found their Majesties asleep When the respective armies who had been waiting eagerly the whole of the afternoon for some result of the combat returned to camp they found their Majesties Asleep said the Chancellor of Euralia hastily Asleep agreed the Chancellor of Barodia The excuse of their two Majesties that they had suddenly forgotten the day though naturally accepted at the time was deemed inadequate by later historians By Roger and myself anyway Some further details were discussed and then the conference closed The great fight was fixed for the following morning The day broke fine At an early hour Merriwig was up and practising thrusts upon a suspended pillow At intervals he would consult a little book entitled Sword Play for Sovereigns and then return to his pillow At breakfast he was nervous but talkative After breakfast he wrote a tender letter to Hyacinth and a still more tender one to the Countess Belvane and burnt them He repeated his little rhyme Bo Boll Bill Bole several times to himself until he was word perfect It was just possible that it might be useful His last thoughts as he rode on to the field were of his great grandfather Without admiring him he quite saw his point The fight was a brilliant one First Merriwig aimed a blow at the King of Barodia s head which the latter parried Then the King of Barodia aimed a blow at his adversary s head which Merriwig parried This went on three or four times and then Merriwig put into practice a remarkable trick which the Captain of his Bodyguard had taught him It was his turn to parry but instead of doing this he struck again at his opponent s head and if the latter in sheer surprise had not stumbled and fallen there might have been a very serious ending to the affair Noon found them still at it cut and parry cut and parry at each stroke the opposing armies roared their applause When darkness put an end to the conflict honours were evenly divided It was a stiff but proud King of Euralia who received the congratulations of his subjects that night so proud that he had to pour out his heart to somebody He write to his daughter MY DEAR HYACINTH You will be glad to hear that your father is going on well and that Euralia is as determined as ever to uphold its honour and dignity To day I fought the King of Barodia and considering that most unfairly he was using a Magic Sword I think I may say that I did well The Countess Belvane will be interested to hear that I made four thousand six hundred thirty eight strokes at my opponent and parried four thousand six hundred thirty seven strokes from him This is good for a man of my age Do you remember that magic ointment my aunt used to give me Have we any of it left I played a very clever trick the other day by pretending to be a swineherd I talked to a real one I met for quite a long time about swine without his suspecting me The Countess might be interested to hear this It would have been very awkward for me if it had been found out who I was I hope you are getting along all right Do you consult the Countess Belvane at all I think she would be able to advise you in any difficulties A young girl needs a guiding hand and I think the Countess would be able to advise you in any difficulties Do you consult her at all I am afraid this is going to be a long war There doesn t seem to be a wizard in the country at all and without one it is a little difficult to know how to go on I say my spell every now and then you remember the one Bo boll bill bole Wo woll will wole and it certainly keeps off dragons but we don t seem to get any nearer defeating the enemy s army You might tell the Countess Belvane that about my spell she would be interested To morrow I go on with my fight with the King of Barodia I feel quite confident now that I can hold him He parries well but his cutting is not very good I am glad the Countess found my sword for me tell her that it has been most useful I must now close as I must go to bed so as to be ready for my fight to morrow Good bye dear I am always YOUR LOVING FATHER P S I hope you are not finding your position too difficult If you are in any difficulties you should consult the Countess Belvane I think she would be able to advise you Don t forget about that ointment Perhaps the Countess might know about some other kind It s for stiffness I am afraid this is going to be a long war The King sealed up the letter and despatched it by special messenger the next morning It came to Hyacinth at a critical moment We shall see in the next chapter what effect it had upon her CHAPTER VII THE PRINCESS RECEIVES A LETTER AND WRITES ONE The Princess Hyacinth came in from her morning s ride in a very bad temper She went straight up to her favourite seat on the castle walls and sent for Wiggs Wiggs she said
83_11691_000007_000000	train-clean-100	 what s the matter 
none	none	with me Wiggs looked puzzled She had been dusting the books in the library and when you dust books you simply must stop every now and then to take just one little peep inside and then you look inside another one and another one and by the time you have finished dusting your head is so full of things you have seen that you have to be asked questions very slowly indeed I m pretty aren t I went on Hyacinth That was an easy one Lovely said Wiggs with a deep breath And I m not unkind to anybody Unkind said Wiggs indignantly Then why oh Wiggs I know it s silly of me but it hurts me that my people are so much fonder of the Countess than of me Oh I m sure they re not your Royal Highness Well they cheer her much louder than they cheer me Wiggs tried to think of a way of comforting her mistress but her head was still full of the last book she had dusted Why should they be so fond of her demanded Hyacinth Perhaps because she s so funny said Wiggs Funny Is she funny said the Princess coldly She doesn t make me laugh Well it was funny of her to make Woggs march round and round that tree like that wasn t it Like what You don t mean The Princess s eyes were wide open with astonishment Was that Woggs all the time Yes your Royal Highness Wasn t it lovely and funny of her The Princess looked across to the forest and nodded to herself Yes That s it Wiggs I don t believe there has ever been an Army at all And I pay them every week She added solemnly There are moments when I don t believe that woman is quite honest Do you mean she isn t good asked Wiggs in awe Hyacinth nodded I m never good said Wiggs firmly
4137_11701_000071_000000	train-clean-100	 What do you mean 
none	none	silly You re the best little girl in Euralia I m not I do awful things sometimes Do you know what I did yesterday Something terrible smiled Hyacinth I tore my apron You baby That isn t being bad said Hyacinth absently She was still thinking of that awful review The Countess says it is The Countess Do you know why I want to be very good said Wiggs coming up close to the Princess Why dear Because then I could dance like a fairy Is that how it s done asked the Princess rather amused The Countess must dance very heavily She suddenly remembered something and added Why of course child you were going to tell me about a fairy you met weren t you That was weeks ago though Tell me now It will help me to forget things which make me rather angry It was a simple little story There must have been many like it in the books which Wiggs had been dusting but these were simple times and the oldest story always seemed new Wiggs had been by herself in the forest A baby rabbit had run past her terrified a ferret in pursuit Wiggs had picked the little fluffy thing up in her arms and comforted it the ferret had slowed down walked past very indifferently with its hands as it were in its pockets hesitated a moment and then remembered an important letter which it had forgotten to post Wiggs was left alone with the baby rabbit and before she knew where she was the rabbit was gone and there was a fairy in front of her Illustration The rabbit was gone and there was a fairy in front of her You have saved my life said the fairy That was a wicked magician after me and if he had caught me then he would have killed me Please your Fairiness I didn t know fairies could die said Wiggs They can when they take on animal shape or human shape He could not hurt me now but before She shuddered I m so glad you re all right now said Wiggs politely Thanks to you my child I must reward you Take this ring When you have been good for a whole day you can have one good wish when you have been bad for a whole day you can have one bad wish One good wish and one bad wish that is all it will allow anybody to have With these words she vanished and left Wiggs alone with the ring So ever after that Wiggs tried desperately hard to be good and have the good wish but it was difficult work Something always went wrong she tore her apron or read books when she ought to have been dusting or Well you or I would probably have given it up at once and devoted ourselves to earning the bad wish But Wiggs was a nice little girl And oh I do so want to be good said Wiggs earnestly to the Princess so that I could wish to dance like a fairy She had a sudden anxiety That is a good wish isn t it It s a lovely wish but I m sure you could dance now if you tried I can t said Wiggs I always dance like this She jumped up and danced a few steps Wiggs was a dear little girl but her dancing reminded you of a very dusty road going up hill all the way with nothing but suet puddings waiting for you on the top Something like that It isn t really graceful is it she said candidly as she came to rest Well I suppose the fairies do dance better than that So that s why I want to be good so as I can have my wish I really must see this ring said the Princess It sounds fascinating She looked coldly in front of her and added Good morning Countess How long had the woman been there Good morning your Royal Highness I ventured to come up unannounced Ah sweet child She waved a caressing hand at Wiggs Even if she had overheard anything it had only been child s talk 
4137_11701_000083_000003	train-clean-100	What is it 
none	none	asked the Princess She took a firm hold of the arms of her chair She would not not not give way to the Countess this time The merest matter of business your Royal Highness Just this scheme for the Encouragement of Literature Your Royal Highness very wisely decided that in the absence of the men on the sterner business of fighting it was the part of us women to encourage the gentler arts and for this purpose there was some talk of a competition and er Ah yes said Hyacinth nervously I will look into that to morrow A competition said Belvane gazing vaguely over Hyacinth s head Some sort of a money prize she added as if in a trance There should certainly be some sort of a prize agreed the Princess Why not she asked herself if one is to encourage literature Bags of gold murmured Belvane to herself Bags and bags of gold Big bags of silver and little bags of gold She saw herself tossing them to the crowd Well we ll go into that to morrow said Hyacinth hastily I have it all drawn up here said Belvane Your Royal Highness has only to sign It saves so much trouble she added with a disarming smile She held the document out all in the most beautiful colours Mechanically the Princess signed Thank you your Royal Highness She smiled again and added And now perhaps I had better see about it at once The Guardian of Literature took a dignified farewell of her Sovereign and withdrew Hyacinth looked at Wiggs in despair There she said That s me I don t know what it is about that woman but I feel just a child in front of her Oh Wiggs Wiggs I feel so lonely sometimes with nothing but women all around me I wish I had a man here to help me Are all the men fighting in all the countries Not all the countries There s Araby Don t you remember oh but of course you wouldn t know anything about it But Father was just going to ask Prince Udo of Araby to come here on a visit when the war broke out Oh I wish I wish Father were back again She laid her head on her arms and whether she would have shed a few royal tears or had a good homely cry I cannot tell you For at that moment an attendant came in Hyacinth was herself again at once There is a messenger approaching on a horse your Royal Highness she announced Doubtless from His Majesty s camp With a shriek of delight and an entire lack of royal dignity the Princess followed by the faithful Wiggs rushed down to receive him Meanwhile what of the Countess She was still in the Palace and more than that she was in the Throne Room of the Palace and more even than that she was on the Throne of the Throne Room of the Palace She couldn t resist it The door was open as she came down from her interview with the Princess and she had to go in There was a woman in there tidying up who looked questioningly at Belvane as she entered You may leave said the Countess with dignity Her Royal Highness sent me in here to wait for her The woman curtsied and withdrew The Countess then uttered these extraordinary words When I am Queen in Euralia they shall leave me backwards Her subsequent behaviour was even more amazing She stood by the side of the door and putting her hand to her mouth said shrilly Ter rum ter rum terrumty umty um Then she took her hand away and announced loudly Her Majesty Queen Belvane the First after which she cheered slightly Then in came Her Majesty a very proper dignified gracious Queen none of your seventeen year old chits Bowing condescendingly from side to side she made her way to the Throne and with a sweep of her train she sat down Courtiers were presented to her representatives from foreign countries Prince Hanspatch of Tregong Prince Ulric the Duke of Highanlow Ah my dear Prince Hanspatch she cried stretching out her hand to the right of her and you dear Prince Ulric with a graceful movement of the left arm towards him and dear Duke you also Her right hand which Prince Hanspatch had by now finished with went out to the Duke of Highanlow that he too might kiss it But it was arrested in mid air She felt rather than saw that the Princess was watching her in amazement from the doorway Without looking round she stretched out again first one arm and then the other Then as if she had just seen the Princess she jumped up in a pretty confusion Oh your Royal Highness she cried you caught me at my physical exercises She gave a self conscious little laugh My physical exercises a forearm movement Once again she stretched out her arm Building up the er building up building up Her voice died away for the Princess still looked coldly at her Charming Countess she said I am sorry to interrupt you but I have some news for you You will like to know that I am inviting Prince Udo of Araby here on a visit I feel we want a little outside help in our affairs Prince Udo cried the Countess Here Have you any objection said Hyacinth She found it easier to be stern now for the invitation had already been sent off by the hand of the King s Messenger Nothing that the Countess could say could influence her No objection your Royal Highness but it seems so strange And then the expense Men are such hearty eaters Besides she looked with a charming smile from the Princess to Wiggs we were all getting on so nicely together Of course if he just dropped in for afternoon tea one day He will make a stay of some months I hope There were no wizards in Barodia and therefore the war would be a long one It was this which had decided Hyacinth Of course said Belvane whatever your Royal Highness wishes but I do think that His Majesty My dear Countess said Hyacinth with a smile the invitation has already gone so there s nothing more to be said is there Had you finished your exercises Yes Then Wiggs will you conduct her ladyship downstairs She turned and left her The Countess watched her go and then stood tragically in the middle of the room clasping her diary to her breast This is terrible she said I feel years older She held out her diary at arm s length and said in a gloomy voice What an entry for to morrow The thought cheered her up a little She began to consider plans How could she circumvent this terrible young man who was going to put them all in their places She wished that All at once she remembered something Wiggs she said what was it I heard you saying to the Princess about a wish Oh that s my ring said Wiggs eagerly If you ve been good for a whole day you can have a good wish And my wish is that A wish said Belvane to herself Well I wish that A sudden thought struck her You said that you had to be good for a whole day first Yes Belvane mused I wonder what they mean by good she said Of course explained Wiggs if you ve been bad for a whole day you can have a bad wish But I should hate to have a bad wish wouldn t you Simply hate it child said Belvane Er may I have a look at that ring Here it is said Wiggs I always wear it round my neck The Countess took it from her Listen she said Wasn t that the Princess calling you Run along quickly child She almost pushed her from the room and closed the door on her Alone again she paced from end to end of the great chamber her left hand nursing her right elbow her chin in her right hand If you are good for a day she mused you can have a good wish If you are bad for a day you can have a bad wish Yesterday I drew ten thousand pieces of gold for the Army the actual expenses were what I paid what I owe Woggs I suppose that is what narrow minded people call being bad I suppose this Prince Udo would call it bad I suppose he thinks he will marry the Princess and throw me into prison She flung her head back proudly Never Standing in the middle of the great Throne Room she held the ring up in her two hands and wished I wish she said and there was a terrible smile in her eyes I wish that something very very humorous shall happen to Prince Udo on his journey CHAPTER VIII PRINCE UDO SLEEPS BADLY Everybody likes to make a good impression on his first visit but there were moments just before his arrival in Euralia when Prince Udo doubted whether the affair would go as well as he had hoped You shall hear why He had been out hunting with his friend the young Duke Coronel and was returning to the Palace when Hyacinth s messenger met him He took the letter from him broke the seals and unrolled it Wait a moment Coronel he said to his friend This is going to be an adventure of some sort and if it s an adventure I shall want you with me I m in no hurry said Coronel and he got off his horse and gave it into the care of an attendant The road crossed a stream here Coronel sat up on the little stone bridge and dropped pebbles idly into the water The Prince read his letter Plop Plop Plop Plop The Prince looked up from his letter How many days journey is it to Euralia he asked Coronel How long did it take the messenger to come answered Coronel without looking up Plop I might have thought of that myself said Udo only this letter has rather upset me He turned to the messenger How long has it Isn t the letter dated said Coronel Plop Udo paid no attention to this interruption and finished his question to the messenger A week sire Ride on to the castle and wait for me I shall have a message for you What is it said Coronel when the messenger had gone An adventure I think so I think we may call it that Coronel With me in it Yes I think you will be somewhere in it 
83_11691_000011_000000	train-clean-100	Coronel stopped 
none	none	dropping his pebbles and turned to the Prince May I hear about it Udo help out the letter then feeling that a lady s letter should be private drew it back again He prided himself always on doing the correct thing It s from Princess Hyacinth of Euralia he said she doesn t say much Her father is away fighting and she is alone and she is in some trouble or other It ought to make rather a good adventure Coronel turned away and began to drop his pebbles into the stream again Well I wish you luck he said If it s a dragon don t forget that But you re coming too said Udo in dismay I must have you with me Doing what What Doing what said Coronel again Well said Prince Udo awkwardly er well you well He felt that it was a silly question for Coronel to have asked Coronel knew perfectly well what he would be doing all the time In Udo s absence he would be telling Princess Hyacinth stories of his Royal Highness s matchless courage and wisdom An occasional discussion also with the Princess upon the types of masculine beauty leading up to casual mention of Prince Udo s own appearance would be quite in order When Prince Udo was present Coronel would no doubt find the opportunity of drawing Prince Udo out an opportunity of which a stranger could not so readily avail himself But of course you couldn t very well tell Coronel that A man of any tact would have seen it at once Of course he said don t come if you don t like But it would look rather funny if I went quite unattended and and her Royal Highness is said to be very beautiful he added lamely Coronel laughed There are adventures and adventures to sit next to a very beautiful Princess and discuss with her the good looks of another man was not the sort of adventure that Coronel was looking for He tossed the remainder of his pebbles into the stream and stood up Of course if your Royal Highness wishes
4137_11701_000056_000000	train-clean-100	 Don t be a fool Coronel 
none	none	said his Royal Highness rather snappily Well then I ll come with my good friend Udo if he wants me I do want you Very well that settles it After all he added to himself there may be two dragons Two dragons would be one each But from all accounts there were not two Princesses So three days later the friends set out with good hearts upon the adventure The messenger had been sent back to announce their arrival they gave him three days start and hoped to gain two days upon him In the simple fashion of those times so it would seem from Roger Scurvilegs they set out with no luggage and no clear idea of where they were going to sleep at night This after all is the best spirit in which to start a journey It is the Gladstone bag which has killed romance They started on a perfect summer day and they rode past towers and battlements and by the side of sparkling streams and came out into the sunlight again above sleepy villages and as they rode Coronel sang aloud and Udo tossed his sword into the air and caught it again As evening fell they came to a woodman s cottage at the foot of a high hill and there they decided to rest for the night An old woman came out to welcome them Good evening your Royal Highness she said Illustration As evening fell they came to a woodman s cottage at the foot of a high hill You know me said Udo more pleased than surprised I know all who come into my house said the old woman solemnly and all who go away from it This sort of conversation made Coronel feel creepy There seemed to be a distinction between the people who came to the house and the people who went away from it which he did not like Can we stay here the night my good woman said Udo You have hurt your hand she said taking no notice of his question It s nothing said Udo hastily On one occasion he had caught his sword by the sharp end by mistake a foolish thing to have done Ah well since you won t want hands where you re going it won t matter much It was the sort of thing old women said in those days and Udo did not pay much attention to it Yes yes he said but can you give my friend and myself a bed for to night Seeing that you won t be travelling together long come in and welcome She opened the door and they followed her in As they crossed the threshold Udo half turned round and whispered over his shoulder to Coronel Probably a fairy Be kind to her How can one be kind to one s hostess said Coronel It s she who has to be kind to us Well you know what I mean don t be rude to her My dear Udo this to me the pride of Araby the favourite courtier of his Majesty the Oh all right said Udo Sit down and rest yourselves said the old woman There ll be something in the pot for you directly Good said Udo He looked approvingly at the large cauldron hanging over the fire It was a big fireplace for such a small room So he thought when he first looked at it but as he gazed the room seemed to get bigger and bigger and the fireplace to get farther and farther away until he felt that he was in a vast cavern cut deep into the mountainside He rubbed his eyes and there he was in the small kitchen again and the cauldron was sending out a savoury smell There ll be something in it for all tastes went on the old woman even for Prince Udo s I m not so particular as all that said Udo mildly The room had just become five hundred yards long again and he was feeling quiet Not now but you will be She filled them a plate each from the pot and pulling their chairs up to the table they fell to heartily This is really excellent said Udo as he put down his spoon and rested for a moment You d think you d always like that wouldn t you she said I always shall be fond of anything so perfectly cooked Ah remarked the old woman thoughtfully Udo was beginning to dislike her particular style of conversation It seemed to carry the merest suggestion of a hint that something unpleasant was going to happen to him Nothing apparently was going to happen to Coronel He tried to drag Coronel into the conversation in case the old woman had anything over for him My friend and I he said hope to be in Euralia the day after to morrow No harm in hoping was the answer Dear me is something going to happen to us on the way Depends what you call us Coronel pushed back his chair and got up I know what s going to happen to me he said I m going to sleep Well said Udo getting up too we ve got a long day before us to morrow and apparently we are in for an adventure er we are in for an adventure of some sort He looked anxiously at the old woman but she made no sign And so let s to bed This way said the old woman and by the light of a candle she led them upstairs Udo slept badly He had a feeling just as you have that something was going to happen to him and it was with some surprise that he woke up in the morning to find himself much as he was when he went to bed He looked at himself in the glass he invited Coronel to gaze at him but neither could discover that anything was the matter After all said Udo I don t suppose she meant anything These old women get into a way of talking like that If anybody is going to be turned into anything it s much more likely to be you Is that why you brought me with you asked Coronel I suppose that by this time they had finished their dressing Roger Scurvilegs tells us nothing on such important matters no doubt from modesty Next morning they rose he says and disappoints us of a picture of Udo brushing his hair They rose and went down to breakfast The old woman was in a less cryptic mood at breakfast She was particularly hospitable to Udo and from some secret store produced an unending variety of good things for him to eat To Coronel it almost looked as if she were fattening him up for something but this suggestion was received with such bad grace by Udo that he did not pursue the subject As soon as breakfast was over they started off again From one of the many bags of gold he carried Udo had offered some acknowledgment to the old woman but she had refused to take it Nay nay she said I shall be amply rewarded before the day is out And she seemed to be smiling to herself as if she knew of some joke which the Prince and Coronel did not yet share I like to day said Coronel as they rode along There s a smell of adventure in the air Red roofs green trees blue sky white road I could fall in love to day Who with said Udo suspiciously Any one that old woman if you like Oh don t talk of her said the Prince with a shudder Coronel hadn t you a sense of being out of some joke that she was in Perhaps we shall be in it before long I could laugh very easily on a morning like this Oh I can see a joke as well as any one said Udo Don t be afraid that I shan t laugh too No doubt it will make a good story whatever it is to tell to the Princess Hyacinth Coronel he added solemnly the thought having evidently only just occurred to him I am all impatience to help that poor girl in her trouble And as if to show his impatience he suddenly gave the reins a shake and cantered ahead of his companion Smiling to himself Coronel followed at his leisure They halted at mid day in a wood and made a meal from some provisions which the old woman had given them and after they had eaten Udo lay down on a mossy bank and closed his eyes I m sleepy he said I had a restless night Let s stay here awhile after all there s no hurry Personally said Coronel I m all impatience to help that I tell you I had a very bad night said Udo crossly Oh well I shall go off and look for dragons Coronel the Dragon Slayer Good bye Only half an hour said Udo Right With a nod to the Prince he strolled off among the trees CHAPTER IX THEY ARE AFRAID OF UDO This is a painful chapter for me to write Mercifully it is to be a short one Later on I shall become used to the situation inclined even to dwell upon its humorous side but for the moment I cannot see beyond the sadness of it That to a Prince of the Royal House of Araby and such an estimable young man as Udo those things should happen 
83_11691_000000_000004	train-clean-100	Roger Scurvilegs frankly breaks down over it 
none	none	That abominable woman he says meaning of course Belvane and he has hysterics for more than a page 
83_11691_000001_000000	train-clean-100	Let us describe it calmly 
none	none	Coronel came back from his stroll in the same casual way in which he had started and dropped down lazily upon the grass to wait until Udo was ready to mount He was not thinking of Udo 
83_11691_000002_000002	train-clean-100	He was wondering if Princess Hyacinth had an attendant of surpassing beauty or a dragon of surpassing malevolence if in fact there were any adventures in Euralia for a humble fellow like himself 
83_11691_000003_000000	train-clean-100	 Coronel said a small voice behind him 
none	none	He turned round indifferently Hullo Udo where are you he said
83_11691_000005_000001	train-clean-100	 Isn t it time we were starting 
83_11691_000006_000000	train-clean-100	 We aren t starting said the voice 
none	none	What s the matter 
83_11691_000007_000001	train-clean-100	What are you hiding in the bushes for Whatever s the matter Udo 
83_11691_000008_000000	train-clean-100	 I m not very well 
83_11691_000009_000000	train-clean-100	 My poor Udo what s happened 
none	none	He jumped up and made towards him Stop shrieked the voice
83_11691_000010_000001	train-clean-100	 I command you 
none	none	Coronel stopped Your Royal Highness s commands he began rather coldly There was an ominous sniffing from the bushes
83_11691_000014_000000	train-clean-100	 Coronel said an unhappy voice at last I think I m coming out 
none	none	Wondering what it all meant Coronel waited in silence
83_11691_000016_000000	train-clean-100	 Yes I am coming out Coronel said the voice 
83_11691_000016_000001	train-clean-100	 But you mustn t be surprised if I don t look very well 
83_11691_000016_000002	train-clean-100	I m I m Coronel here I am said Udo pathetically and he stepped out 
83_11691_000017_000000	train-clean-100	Coronel didn t know whether to laugh or to cry 
83_11691_000018_000000	train-clean-100	Poor Prince Udo 
none	none	Illustration Coronel here I am said Udo pathetically and he stepped out He had the head and the long ears of a rabbit and in some unfortunate way a look of the real Prince Udo in spite of it He had the mane and the tail of a lion In between the tail and the mane it is difficult to say what he was save that there was an impression of magnificence about his person such magnificence anyhow as is given by an astrakhan trimmed fur coat 
83_11691_000021_000000	train-clean-100	Coronel decided that it was an occasion for tact 
83_11691_000022_000000	train-clean-100	 Ah here you are he said cheerfully 
none	none	Shall we get along
83_11691_000023_000000	train-clean-100	 Don t be a fool Coronel said Udo almost crying 
none	none	Don t pretend that you can t see that I ve got 
83_11691_000024_000001	train-clean-100	a tail 
none	none	Why bless my soul so you have A tail 
83_11691_000024_000002	train-clean-100	Well think of that 
none	none	Udo showed what he thought of it by waving it peevishly
83_11691_000026_000000	train-clean-100	 This is not a time for tact he said 
83_11691_000026_000001	train-clean-100	 Tell me what I look like 
83_11691_000027_000000	train-clean-100	Coronel considered for a moment 
83_11691_000028_000000	train-clean-100	 Really frankly he asked 
none	none	Y yes said Udo nervously
83_11691_000030_000000	train-clean-100	 Then frankly your Royal Highness looks funny 
none	none	Very funny said Udo wistfully Very funny said Coronel His Highness sighed
83_11691_000034_000000	train-clean-100	 I was afraid so he said 
83_11691_000034_000001	train-clean-100	 That s the cruel part about it 
83_11691_000034_000002	train-clean-100	Had I been a lion there would have been a certain pathetic splendour about my position 
83_11691_000034_000003	train-clean-100	Isolated cut off suffering in regal silence He waved an explanatory paw 
83_11691_000034_000004	train-clean-100	 Even in the most hideous of beasts there might be a dignity He meditated for a moment 
83_11691_000034_000005	train-clean-100	 Have you ever seen a yak Coronel he asked 
none	none	Never I saw one once in Barodia It is not a beautiful animal Coronel but as a yak I should not have been entirely unlovable 
83_11691_000036_000002	train-clean-100	One does not laugh at a yak Coronel and where one does not laugh one may come to love 
83_11691_000036_000003	train-clean-100	What does my head look like 
83_11691_000037_000000	train-clean-100	 It looks striking 
83_11691_000038_000000	train-clean-100	 I haven t seen it you see 
none	none	To one who didn t know your Royal Highness it would convey the impression of a rabbit Udo laid his head between his paws and wept A r rabbit he sobbed So undignified so lacking in true pathos so And not even a whole rabbit he added bitterly
83_11691_000042_000000	train-clean-100	 How did it happen 
83_11691_000043_000000	train-clean-100	 I don t know Coronel 
83_11691_000043_000001	train-clean-100	I just went to sleep and woke up feeling rather funny and 
none	none	He sat up suddenly and stared at Coronel
83_11691_000043_000003	train-clean-100	 It was that old woman did it 
83_11691_000043_000004	train-clean-100	You mark my words Coronel she did it 
none	none	Why should she I don t know 
83_11691_000045_000001	train-clean-100	I was very polite to her 
83_11691_000045_000002	train-clean-100	Don t you remember my saying to you Be polite to her because she s probably a fairy You see I saw through her disguise at once 
83_11691_000045_000003	train-clean-100	Coronel what shall we do 
83_11691_000045_000004	train-clean-100	Let s hold a council of war and think it over 
83_11691_000046_000000	train-clean-100	So they held a council of war 
83_11691_000047_000000	train-clean-100	Prince Udo put forward two suggestions 
none	none	The first was that Coronel should go back on the morrow and kill the old woman 
83_11691_000049_000000	train-clean-100	The second was that Coronel should go back that afternoon and kill the old woman 
83_11691_000050_000000	train-clean-100	Coronel pointed out that as she had turned Prince Udo into into a a Quite so said Udo it was likely that she alone could turn him back again and that in that case he had better only threaten her 
none	none	I want somebody killed said Udo rather naturally Suppose said Coronel you stay here for two days while I go back and see the old witch and make her tell me what she knows She knows something I m certain Then we shall see better what to do Udo mused for a space Why didn t they turn you into anything he asked
83_11691_000055_000000	train-clean-100	 Really I don t know 
83_11691_000055_000001	train-clean-100	Perhaps because I m too unimportant 
83_11691_000056_000000	train-clean-100	 Yes that must be it He began to feel a little brighter Obviously that s it He caressed a whisker with one of his paws They were afraid of me 
83_11691_000057_000000	train-clean-100	He began to look so much happier that Coronel thought it was a favourable moment in which to withdraw 
none	none	Shall I go now your Royal Highness
83_11691_000059_000000	train-clean-100	 Yes yes you may leave me 
83_11691_000060_000000	train-clean-100	 And shall I find you here when I come back 
none	none	You may or you may not Coronel you may or you may not Afraid of me he murmured to himself Obviously
83_11691_000062_000000	train-clean-100	 And if I don t 
83_11691_000063_000000	train-clean-100	 Then return to the Palace 
83_11691_000064_000000	train-clean-100	 Good bye your Royal Highness 
none	none	Udo waved a paw at him
83_11691_000066_000000	train-clean-100	 Good bye good bye 
none	none	Coronel got on his horse and rode away As soon as he was out of earshot he began to laugh 
83_11691_000067_000002	train-clean-100	Spasm after spasm shook him 
none	none	No sooner had he composed himself to gravity than a remembrance of Udo s appearance started him off again
83_11691_000068_000000	train-clean-100	 I couldn t have stayed with him a moment longer he thought 
83_11691_000068_000001	train-clean-100	 I should have burst 
none	none	Poor Udo 
83_11691_000068_000003	train-clean-100	However we ll soon get him all right 
83_11691_000069_000000	train-clean-100	That evening he reached the place where the cottage had stood but it was gone 
83_11691_000069_000001	train-clean-100	Next morning he rode back to the wood 
83_11691_000069_000002	train-clean-100	Udo was gone too He returned to the Palace and began to think it out 
83_11691_000070_000000	train-clean-100	Left to himself Udo very soon made up his mind 
83_11691_000070_000001	train-clean-100	There were three courses open to him 
none	none	He might stay where he was till he was restored to health 
83_11691_000072_000000	train-clean-100	This he rejected at once 
none	none	When you have the head of a rabbit the tail of a lion and the middle of a woolly lamb the need for action of some kind is imperative All the blood of your diverse ancestors calls to you to be up and doing He might go back to Araby To Araby where he was so well known so respected so popular To Araby where he rode daily among his father s subjects that they might have the pleasure of cheering him 
83_11691_000074_000002	train-clean-100	How awkward for everybody 
none	none	On to Euralia then Why not 
83_11691_000076_000001	train-clean-100	The Princess Hyacinth had called for him 
83_11691_000076_000002	train-clean-100	What devotion it showed if he came to her even now in his present state of bad health She was in trouble enchanters wizards what nots 
83_11691_000076_000003	train-clean-100	Already then he had suffered in her service so at least he would say and so possibly it might be 
83_11691_000076_000004	train-clean-100	Coronel had thought him funny but women had not much sense of humour as a rule 
83_11691_000076_000005	train-clean-100	Probably as a child Hyacinth had kept rabbits or lambs 
none	none	She would find him strokable And the lion in him in his tail his fierce mane she would find that inspiring 
83_11691_000076_000007	train-clean-100	Women like to feel that there is something fierce untamable in the man they love well there it was 
83_11691_000077_000000	train-clean-100	It was not as if he had Coronel with him 
none	none	Coronel and he in his present health could never have gone into Euralia together the contrast was too striking but he alone Hyacinth s only help Surely she would appreciate his magnanimity Also as he had told himself a moment ago there was quite a chance that it was a Euralian enchanter who had put this upon him to prevent him helping Hyacinth If so he had better go to Euralia in order to deal with that enchanter For the moment he did not see exactly how to deal with him but no doubt he would think of some tremendously cunning device later on 
83_11691_000079_000000	train-clean-100	To Euralia then with all dispatch 
83_11691_000080_000000	train-clean-100	He trotted off 
none	none	As Coronel had said they were evidently afraid of him CHAPTER X CHARLOTTE PATACAKE ASTONISHES THE CRITICS The Lady Belvane sits in her garden She is very happy An enormous quill pen taken from a former favourite goose and coloured red is in her right hand The hair of her dark head held on one side touches the paper whereon she writes and her little tongue peeps out between her red lips Her left hand taps the table one two one two one two one two one two She is composing Wonderful woman You remember that scene with the Princess Hyacinth I feel we want a little outside help in our affairs A fortnight of suspense before Prince Udo arrived What had the ring done to him At the best even if there would be no Udo at all to interfere nevertheless she knew that she had lost her footing at the Palace She and the Princess would now be open enemies At the worst those magic rings were so untrustworthy a Prince still powerful and now seriously annoyed might be leagued against her Yet she composed And what is she writing She is entering for the competition in connection with the Encouragement of Literature Scheme the last scheme which the Princess had signed I like to think of her peacefully writing at a time when her whole future hung in the balance Roger sneers at her Even now he says she was hoping to wring a last bag full of gold from her wretched country I deny emphatically that she was doing anything of the sort She was entering for a duly authorised competition under the pen name of Charlotte Patacake The fact that the Countess Belvane according to the provisions of the scheme was sole judge of the competition is beside the point Belvane s opinion of Charlotte Patacake s poetry was utterly sincere and uninfluenced in any way by monetary considerations If Patacake were rewarded the first prize it would be because Belvane honestly thought she was worth it One other fact by way of defence against Roger s slanders As judge Belvane had chosen the subject of the prize poems Now Belvane and Patacake both excelled in the lighter forms of lyrical verse yet the subject of the poem was to be epic The Barodo Euralian War no less How many modern writers would be as fair THE BARODO EURALIAN WAR This line is written in gold and by itself would obtain a prize in any local competition King Merriwig the First rode out to war As many other kings had done before Five hundred men behind him marched to fight There follows a good deal of scratching out and then comes a sudden inspiration this sublimely simple line Left right left right left right left right left right One can almost hear the men moving What gladsome cheers assailed the balmy air They came from north from south from everywhere No wight that stood upon that sacred scene Could gaze upon the sight unmoved I ween No wight that stood upon that sacred spot Could gaze upon the sight unmoved I wot It is not quite clear whether the last couplet is an alternative to the couplet before or is purposely added in order to strengthen it Looking over her left shoulder it seems to me that there is a line drawn through the first one but I cannot see very clearly because of her hair which will keep straying over the page Why do they march so fearless and so bold The answer is not very quickly told To put it shortly the Barodian king Insulted Merriwig like anything King Merriwig the dignified and wise Who saw him flying over with surprise As did his daughter Princess Hyacinth This was as far as she had got She left the table and began to walk round her garden There is nothing like it for assisting thought However to day it was not helping much she went three times round and still couldn t think of a rhyme for Hyacinth Plinth was a little difficult to work in besides she reminded herself I don t quite know what it means Belvane felt as I do about poetry that however incomprehensible it may be to the public the author should be quite at ease with it She added up the lines she had written already seventeen If she stopped there it would be the only epic that had stopped at the seventeenth line She sighed stretched her arms and looked up at the sky The weather was all against her It was the ideal largesse morning Twenty minutes later she was on her cream white palfrey Twenty one minutes later Henrietta Crossbuns had received a bag of gold neatly under the eye as she bobbed to her Ladyship To this extent only did H Crossbuns leave her mark upon Euralian history but it was a mark which lasted for a full month Hyacinth knew nothing of all this She did not even know that Belvane was entering for the prize poem She had forgotten her promise to encourage literature in the realm And why Ah ladies can you not guess why She was thinking of Prince Udo of Araby What did he look like Was he dark or fair Did his hair curl naturally or not Was he wondering at all what she looked like Wiggs had already decided that he was to fall in love with her Royal Highness and marry her I think said Wiggs that he ll be very tall and have lovely blue eyes and golden hair This is what they were like in all the books she had ever dusted like this were the seven Princes now pursuing perilous adventures in distant countries to whom the King had promised Hyacinth s hand Prince Hanspatch of Tregong Prince Ulric the Duke of Highanlow and all the rest of them Poor Prince Ulric In the moment of victory he was accidentally fallen upon by the giant whom he was engaged in undermining and lost all appetite for adventure thereby Indeed in his latter years he was alarmed by anything larger than a goldfish and lived a life of strictest seclusion Illustration Twenty one minutes later Henrietta Crossbuns was acknowledging a bag of gold I think he ll be dark said Hyacinth Her own hair was corn coloured Poor Prince Hanspatch of Tregong I ve just remembered about him no I haven t it was the Duke of Highanlow Poor Duke of Highanlow A misunderstanding with a wizard having caused his head to face the wrong way round he was so often said good bye to at the very moment of arrival that he gradually lost his enthusiasm for social enterprises and confined himself to his own palace where his acrobatic dexterity in supplying himself with soup was a constant source of admiration to his servants However it was Prince Udo of whom they were thinking now The Messenger had returned from Araby his Royal Highness must be expected on the morrow I do hope he ll be comfortable in the Purple Room said Hyacinth I wonder if it wouldn t have been better to have left him in the Blue Room after all They had had him in the Blue Room two days ago until Hyacinth thought that perhaps he would be more comfortable in the Purple Room after all The Purple Room has the best view said Wiggs helpfully And it gets the sun Wiggs don t forget to put some flowers there And have you given him any books I gave him two said Wiggs Quests for Princes and Wild Animals at Home Oh I m sure he ll like those Now let s think what we shall do when he comes He ll arrive some time in the afternoon Naturally he will want a little refreshment Would he like a picnic in the forest asked Wiggs I don t think any one wants a picnic after a long journey I love picnics Yes dear but you see Prince Udo s much older than you and I expect he s had so many picnics that he s tired of them I suppose really I ought to receive him in the Throne Room but that s so so Stuffy said Wiggs That s just it We should feel uncomfortable with each other the whole time I think I shall receive him up here I never feel so nervous in the open air Will the Countess be here asked Wiggs No said the Princess coldly At least she corrected herself she will not be invited Good afternoon Countess It was like her thought Hyacinth to arrive at that very moment Belvane curtsied low Good afternoon your Royal Highness I am here purely on a matter of business I thought it my duty to inform your Royal Highness of the result of the Literature prize She spoke meekly and as one who forgave Hyacinth for her unkindness towards her Certainly Countess I shall be glad to hear The Countess unrolled a parchment The prize has been won she said by she held the parchment a little closer to her eyes by Charlotte Patacake Oh yes Who is she A most deserving woman your Royal Highness If she is the woman I m thinking of a most deserving person to whom the money will be more than welcome Her poem shows a sense of values combined with er breadth and er distance such as I have seldom seen equalled The er technique is only excelled by the shall I say tempermentality the boldness of the colouring by the how shall I put it the firmness of the outline In short In short said the Princess you like it Your Royal Highness it is unique But naturally you will wish to hear it for yourself It is only some twelve hundred lines long I will declaim it to your Royal Highness She held the manuscript out at the full length of her left arm struck an attitude with the right arm and began in her most thrilling voice King Merriwig the First rode out to war As many other kings Yes Countess but another time I am busy this afternoon As you know I think the Prince Udo of Araby arrives to morrow and Belvane s lips were still moving and her right arm swayed up and down What gladsome cheers assailed the balmy air she murmured to herself and her hand when up to heaven They come from north from south she pointed in the directions mentioned from everywhere No wight that stood He will be received privately up here by myself in the first place and afterwards Could gaze upon the sight unmoved I wot whispered Belvane and placed her hand upon her breast to show that anyhow it had been too much for her Why do they march so I beg your Royal Highness s pardon I was so carried away by this wonderful poem I do beg of your Royal Highness to read it The Princess waved the manuscript aside I am not unmindful of the claims of literature Countess and I shall certainly read the poem another time Meanwhile I can I hope trust you to see that the prize is awarded to the rightful winner What I am telling you now is that the Prince Udo is arriving to morrow Belvane looked innocently puzzled Prince Udo Udo would that be Prince Udo of Carroway your Royal Highness A tall man with three legs Prince Udo of Araby said Hyacinth severely I think I have already mentioned him to your ladyship He will make a stay of some months But how delightful your Royal Highness to see a man again We were all getting so dull together We want a man to wake us up a little don t we Wiggs I will go and give orders about his room at once your Royal Highness You will wish him to be in the Purple Room of course That settled it He will be in the Blue Room said Hyacinth decidedly Certainly your Royal Highness Fancy Wiggs a man again I will go and see about it now if I may have your Royal Highness s leave to withdraw A little mystified by Belvane s manner Hyacinth inclined her head and the Countess withdrew CHAPTER XI WATERCRESS SEEMS TO GO WITH THE EARS Wiggs gave a parting pat to the tablecloth and stood looking at it with her head on one side Now then she said have we got everything What about sardines said Woggs in her common way I don t know what she s doing in this scene at all but Roger Scurvilegs insists on it I don t think a Prince would like sardines said Wiggs If I d been on a long journey I d love sardines It is a very long journey from Araby isn t it Awful long Why it s taken him nearly a week Perhaps she added hopefully he s had something on the way Perhaps he took some sandwiches with him said Woggs thinking that this would be a good thing to do What do you think he ll be like Woggs Woggs though for a long time Like the King she said Only different she added as an afterthought Up came the Princess for the fifth time that afternoon all excitement Well she said is everything ready Yes your Royal Highness Except Woggs and me didn t quite know about sardines The Princess laughed happily I think there will be enough there for him It all looks very nice She turned round and discovered behind her the last person she wanted to see just then The last person she wanted to see just then curtsied effectively Forgive me your Royal Highness she said profusely but I thought I had left Charlotte Patacake s priceless manuscript up here No evidently I was mistaken your Royal Highness I will withdraw your Royal Highness as I know your Royal Highness would naturally wish to receive his Royal Highness alone Listening to this speech one is impressed with Woggs method of calling everybody Mum Not at all Countess said Hyacinth coldly We would prefer you to stay and help us receive his Royal Highness He is a little late I think Belvane looked unspeakably distressed Oh I do hope that nothing has happened to him on the way she exclaimed I ve an uneasy feeling that something may have occurred Illustration Princess Hyacinth gave a shriek and faltered slowly backwards What could have happened to him asked Hyacinth not apparently very much alarmed Oh your Royal Highness it s just a sort of silly feeling of mine There may be nothing in it There was a noise of footsteps from below a man s voice was heard The Princess and the Countess both extremely nervous but from entirely different reasons arranged suitable smiles of greeting upon their faces Wiggs and Woggs stood in attitudes of appropriate meekness by the table The Court Painter could have made a beautiful picture of it His Royal Highness Prince Udo of Araby announced the voice of an attendant A nervous moment said Belvane to herself Can the ring have failed to act Udo trotted in It hasn t said Belvane Princess Hyacinth gave a shriek and faltered slowly backwards Wiggs who was familiar with these little accidents in the books which she dusted and Woggs who had a natural love for any kind of animal stood their ground Whatever is it murmured Hyacinth It was as well that Belvane was there Allow me to present to your Royal Highness she said stepping forward his Royal Highness Prince Udo of Araby Prince Udo said Hyacinth all unwilling to believe it I m afraid so said Udo gloomily He had thought over this meeting a good deal in the last two or three days and he realised now that he had underestimated the difficulties of it Hyacinth remembered that she was a Princess and a woman I m delighted to welcome your Royal Highness to Euralia she said Won t you sit down I mean up er down How did rabbits sit Or whatever he was Udo decided to sit up Thank you You ve no idea how difficult it is to talk on four legs to somebody higher up It strains the neck so There was an awkward silence Nobody quite knew what to say Except Belvane She turned to Udo with her most charming smile Did you have a pleasant journey she asked sweetly No said Udo coldly Oh do tell us what happened to you cried Hyacinth Did you meet some terrible enchanter on the way Oh I am so dreadfully sorry When one is not feeling very well there is a certain type of question which is always annoying Can t you see what s happened to me said Udo crossly I don t know how it happened I had come two days journey from Araby when Please your Royal Highness said Wiggs is this your tail in the salt She took it out gave it a shake and handed it back to him Oh thank you thank you two days journey from Araby when I woke up one afternoon and found myself like this I ask you to imagine my annoyance My first thought naturally was to return home and hide myself but I told myself Princess that you wanted me The Princess could not help being touched by this said as it was with a graceful movement of the ears and a caressing of the right whisker but she wondered a little what she would do with him now that she had got him Er what are you put in Belvane kindly knowing how men are always glad to talk about themselves Udo had caught sight of a well covered table and was looking at it with a curious mixture of hope and resignation Very very hungry he said speaking with the air of one who knows The Princess whose mind had been travelling woke up suddenly Oh I was forgetting my manners she said with a smile for which the greediest would have forgiven her Let us sit down and refresh ourselves May I present to your Royal Highness the Countess Belvane Do I shake hands or pat him murmured that mistress of Court etiquette for once at a loss Udo placed a paw over his heart and bowed profoundly Charmed he said gallantly and coming from a cross between a lion a rabbit and a woolly lamb the merest suggestion of gallantry has a most pleasing effect They grouped themselves round the repast A little sherbet your Royal Highness said Hyacinth who presided over the bowl Udo was evidently longing to say yes but hesitated I wonder if I dare It s very good sherbet said Wiggs to encourage him I m sure it is my dear But the question is Do I like sherbet You can t help knowing if you like sherbet Don t bother him Wiggs said Hyacinth a venison sandwich dear Prince The question is Do I like venison sandwiches I do announced Woggs to any one who was interested You see explained Udo I really don t know what I like They were all surprised at this particularly Woggs Belvane who was enjoying herself too much to wish to do anything but listen said nothing and it was the Princess who obliged Udo by asking him what he meant It was a subject upon which he was longing to let himself go to somebody Well he said expanding himself a little so that Wiggs had to remove his tail this time from the custard what am I Nobody ventured to offer an opinion Am I a hare Then put me next to the red currant jelly or whatever it is that hares like The anxious eye of the hostess wandered over the table Am I a lion went on Udo developing his theme Then pass me Wiggs Oh please don t be a lion said Wiggs gently as she stroked his mane But haven t you a feeling for anything asked Hyacinth I have a great feeling of emptiness I yearn for something only I don t quite know what I hope it isn t sardines whispered Wiggs to Woggs But what have you been eating on the way asked the Princess Oh grass and things chiefly I thought I should be safe with grass And were you er safe asked Belvane with a great show of anxiety Udo coughed and said nothing I know it s silly of me said Hyacinth but I still don t quite understand I should have thought that if you were a a Quite so said Udo then you would have known by instinct what a a Exactly said Udo Likes to eat Ah I thought you d think that That s just what I thought when this when I began to feel unwell But I ve worked it out since and it s all wrong This is interesting said Belvane settling herself more comfortably Do go on Well when He coughed and looked round at them coyly This is really rather a delicate subject Not at all murmured Hyacinth Well it s like this When an enchanter wants to annoy you he generally turns you into an animal of some kind Belvane achieved her first blush since she was seventeen It is a humorous way they have she said But suppose you really were an animal altogether it wouldn t annoy you at all An elephant isn t annoyed at being an elephant he just tries to be a good elephant and he d be miserable if he couldn t do things with his trunk The annoying thing is to look like an elephant to have the very complicated er inside of an elephant and yet all the time really to be a man They were all intensely interested Woggs thought that it was going to lead up to a revelation of what sort of animal Prince Udo really was but in this she was destined to be disappointed After all there were advantages in Udo s present position As a man he had never been listened to so attentively Now suppose for a moment I am a lion I have the er delicate apparatus of a lion but the beautiful thoughts and aspirations of a Prince Thus there is one er side of me which craves for raw beef but none the less there is a higher side of me he brought his paw up towards his heart which well you know how you d feel about it yourself The Princess shuddered I should she said with conviction Belvane was interested but thought it all a little crude You see the point went on Udo A baby left to itself doesn t know what is good for it Left to itself it would eat anything Now turn a man suddenly into an animal and he is in exactly the same state as that baby I hadn t thought of it like that said Hyacinth I ve had to think of it Now let us proceed further with the matter Udo was thoroughly enjoying himself He had not had such a time since he had given an address on Beetles to all the leading citizens of Araby at his coming of age Suppose again that I am a lion I know from what I have read or seen that raw meat agrees best with the lion s er organisation and however objectionable it might look I should be foolish not to turn to it for sustenance But if you don t quite know what animal you re supposed to be see how difficult the problem becomes It s a question of trying all sorts of horrible things in order to find out what agrees with you His eyes took on a faraway look a look in which the most poignant memories seem to be reflected I ve been experimenting he said for the last three days They all gazed sadly and sympathetically at him Except Belvane She of course wouldn t What went best she asked brightly Oddly enough said Udo cheering up a little banana fritters Have you ever kept any animal who lived entirely on banana fritters Never smiled the Princess Well that s the animal I probably am He sighed and added There were one or two animals I wasn t For a little while he seemed to be revolving bitter memories and then went on I don t suppose any of you here have any idea how very prickly thistles are when they are going down Er may I try a watercress sandwich It doesn t suit the tail but it seems to go with the ears He took a large bite and added through the leaves I hope I don t bore you Princess with my little troubles Hyacinth clasped his paw impulsively My dear Prince Udo I m only longing to help We must think of some way of getting this horrible enchantment off you There are so many wise books in the library and my father has composed a spell which oh I m sure we shall soon have you all right again Udo took another sandwich Very good of you Princess to say so You understand how annoying a little indisposition of this kind is to a man of my temperament He beckoned to Wiggs How do you make these he asked in an undertone Gracefully undulating Belvane rose from her seat Well she said I must go and see that the stable she broke off in a pretty confusion How silly of me I mean the Royal Apartment is prepared Have I your Royal Highness s leave to withdraw She had And Wiggs dear you too had better run along and see if you can help You may leave the watercress sandwiches she added as Wiggs hesitated for a moment With a grateful look at her Royal Highness Udo helped himself to another one CHAPTER XII WE DECIDE TO WRITE TO UDO S FATHER Now my dear Princess said Udo as soon as they were alone Let me know in what way I can help you Oh Prince Udo said Hyacinth earnestly it is so good of you to have come I feel that this this little accident is really my fault for having asked you here Not at all dear lady It is the sort of little accident that might have happened to anybody anywhere If I can still be of assistance to you pray inform me Though my physical powers may not for the moment be quite what they were I flatter myself that my mental capabilities are in no way diminished He took another bite of his sandwich and wagged his head wisely at her Let s come over here said Hyacinth She moved across to an old stone seat in the wall Udo following with the plate and made room for him by her side There is of course a way of indicating to a gentleman that he may sit next to you on the Chesterfield and tell you what he has been doing in town lately and there is also another way of patting the sofa for Fido to jump up and be a good dog and lie down sir Hyacinth achieved something very tactful in between and Udo jumped up gracefully Now we can talk said Hyacinth You noticed that lady the Countess Belvane whom I presented to you Udo nodded What did you think of her Udo was old enough to know what to say to that I hardly looked at her he said And he added with a deep bow Naturally when your Royal Highness oh I beg your pardon are my ears in your way It s all right said Hyacinth rearranging her hair Well it was because of that woman that I sent for you But I can t marry her like this your Royal Highness Hyacinth turned a startled face towards him Udo perceived that he had blundered To hide his confusion he took another sandwich and ate it very quickly I want your help against her said Hyacinth a little distantly she is plotting against me Oh your Royal Highness now I see said Udo and he wagged his head as much as to say You ve come to the right man this time Illustration Now we can talk said Hyacinth I don t trust her said Hyacinth impressively Well now Princess I m not surprised I ll tell you something about that woman Oh what Well when I was announced just now what happened You yourself Princess were not unnaturally a little alarmed those two little girls were surprised and excited but what of this Countess Belvane What did she do What did she do Nothing said Udo impressively She was neither surprised nor alarmed Why now I come to think of it I don t believe she was And yet said Udo half pathetically half proudly Princes don t generally look like this Now why wasn t she surprised Hyacinth looked bewildered Did she know you were sending for me Udo went on Yes Because you had found out something about her Yes Then depend upon it she s done it What a mind that woman must have But how could she do it exclaimed Hyacinth Of course it s just the sort of thing she would do if she could Udo didn t answer He was feeling rather annoyed with Belvane and had got off his seat and was trotting up and down so as not to show his feelings before a lady How could she do it implored Hyacinth Oh she s in with some enchanter or somebody said Udo impatiently as he trotted past Suddenly he had an idea He stopped in front of her If only I were sure I was a lion He tried to roar exclaimed hastily that it was only a practice one and roared again No I don t think I m a lion after all he admitted sadly Well said Hyacinth we must think of a plan We must think of a plan said Udo and he came and sat meekly beside her again He could conceal it from himself no longer that he was not a lion The fact depressed him I suppose I have been weak went on Hyacinth but ever since the men went away she has been the ruling spirit of the country I think she is plotting against me I know she is robbing me I asked you here so that you could help me to find her out Udo nodded his head importantly We must watch her he announced We must watch her agreed Hyacinth It may take months Did you say months said Udo turning to her excitedly Yes why Well it s he gave a deprecating little cough I know it s very silly of me but oh well let s hope it will be all right Why whatever is the matter Udo was decidedly embarrassed He wriggled He drew little circles with his hind paw on the ground and he shot little coy glances at her Well I and he gave a little nervous giggle I have a sort of uneasy feeling that I may be one of those animals he gave another conscious little laugh that have to go to sleep all through the winter It would be very annoying if I his paw became very busy here if I had to dig a little hole in the ground just when the plot was thickening Oh but you won t said Hyacinth in distress They were both silent for a moment thinking of the awful possibilities Udo s tail had fallen across Hyacinth s lap and she began to play with it absently Anyway she said hopefully it s only July now Ye es said Udo I suppose I should get er busy about November We ought to find out something before then First of all we d better Oh He started up in dismay I ve just had a horrible thought Don t I have to collect a little store of nuts and things Surely I should have to start that pretty soon said Udo thoughtfully You know I shouldn t be very handy at it Climbing about after nuts he went on dreamily what a life for a Oh don t pleaded Hyacinth Surely only squirrels do that Yes yes Now if I were a squirrel I should may I have my tail for a moment Oh I m so sorry said Hyacinth very much confused as she realised the liberty she had been taking and she handed his tail back to him Not at all said Udo He took it firmly in his right hand Now then he said we shall see Watch this Sitting on his back legs he arched his tail over his head and letting go of it suddenly began to nibble at a sandwich held in his two front paws A pretty picture for an artist But a bad model The tail fell with a thud to the ground There said Udo triumphantly That proves it I m not a squirrel
4137_11701_000044_000000	train-clean-100	 Oh I m so glad said Hyacinth 
none	none	completely convinced as any one would have been by this demonstration Yes well that s all right then Now we can make our plans First of all we d better He stopped suddenly and Hyacinth saw that he was gazing at his tail Yes she said encouragingly He picked up his tail and held it out in front of him There was a large knot in the middle of it Now what have I forgotten he said rubbing his head thoughtfully Poor Hyacinth Oh dear Prince Udo I m so sorry I m afraid I did that without thinking Udo the gallant gentleman was not found wanting A lover s knot he said with a graceful incli no he stopped in time But really those ears of his made ordinary politeness quite impossible Oh Udo said Hyacinth impulsively if only I could help you to get back to your proper form again Yes if only said Udo becoming practical again but how are we going to do it Just one more watercress sandwich he said apologetically they go with the ears so well I shall threaten the Countess said Hyacinth excitedly I shall tell her that unless she makes the enchanter restore you to your proper form I shall put her in prison Udo was not listening He had gone off into his own thoughts Banana fritters and watercress sandwiches he was murmuring to himself I suppose I must be the only animal of the kind in the world Of course went on Hyacinth half to herself she might get the people on her side the ones that she s bribed And if she did That s all right that s all right said Udo grandly Leave her to me There s something about your watercress that inspires me to do terrible deeds I feel a new whatever I am One gathers reluctantly from this speech that Udo had partaken too freely Of course said Hyacinth I could write to my father who might send some of his men back but I shouldn t like to do that I shouldn t like him to think that I had failed him Extraordinary how I take to these things said Udo allowing himself a little more room on the seat Perhaps I am a rabbit after all I wonder what I should look like behind wire netting He took another bite and went on I wonder what I should do if I saw a ferret I suppose you haven t got a ferret on you Princess I beg your pardon Prince I m afraid I was thinking of something else What did you say Nothing nothing One s thoughts run on He put his hand out for the plate and discovered that it was empty He settled himself more comfortably and seemed to be about to sink into slumber when his attention was attracted suddenly by the knot in his tail He picked it up and began lazily to undo it I wish I could lash my tail he murmured mine seems to be one of the tails that don t lash He began very gingerly to feel the tip of it I wonder if I ve got a sting anywhere He closed his eyes muttering Sting Countess neck sting all over neck sting lots stings and fell peacefully asleep It was a disgraceful exhibition Roger Scurvilegs tries to slur it over talks about the great heat of the sun and the notorious effect of even one or two watercress sandwiches on an empty on a man who has had nothing to eat for several days This is to palter with the facts The effect of watercress sandwiches upon Udo s arrangements however furnished we have all just seen for ourselves but what Roger neglects to lay stress upon is the fact that it was the effect of twenty one or twenty two watercress sandwiches There is no denying that it was a disgraceful exhibition If I had been there I should certainly have written to his father about it Hyacinth looked at him uneasily Her first feeling was one of sympathy Poor fellow she thought he s had a hard time lately But it is a strain on the sympathy to gaze too long on a mixture of lion rabbit and woolly lamb particularly when the rabbit part has its mouth open and is snoring gently Besides what could she do with him She had two of them on her hands now the Countess and the Prince Belvane was in an even better position than before She could now employ Udo to help her in her plots against the Princess Grant to me so and so or I ll keep the enchantment for ever on his Royal Highness And what could a poor girl do Well she would have to come to some decision in the future Meanwhile the difficulties of the moment were enough The most obvious difficulty was his bedroom Was it quite the sort of room he wanted now Hyacinth realised suddenly that to be hostess to such a collection of animals as Udo was would require all the tact she possessed Perhaps he would tell her what he wanted when he woke up Better let him sleep peacefully now She looked at him smiled in spite of herself and went quickly down into the Palace CHAPTER XIII PINK RHYMES WITH THINK Udo awoke 
3909-11695-0000	train-other-500	slightly refreshed and decided to take a firm line with the Countess at once He had no difficulty about finding his way down to her The Palace seemed to be full of servants
3909-11695-0001	train-other-500	all apparently busy about something which brought them for a moment in sight of the newly arrived Prince and then whisked them off hand to mouth and shoulders shaking By one of these
3909-11695-0002	train-other-500	with more control over her countenance than the others
none	none	 an annoyed Udo 
3909-11695-0003	train-other-500	was led into Belvane s garden She was walking up and down the flagged walk between her lavender hedges and as he came in she stopped
none	none	 and rested her elbows on her sundial and looked mockingly at him waiting for him to speak Between the showers I mark the hours said the sundial 
3909-11695-0004	train-other-500	on the suggestion of Belvane one wet afternoon but for the moment the Countess was in the way
none	none	 Ah here we are said Udo in rather a nasty voice Here we are said Belvane sweetly All of us Suddenly she began to laugh Oh Prince Udo she said you ll be the death of me Count me as one more of your victims It is easy to be angry with any one who will laugh at you all the time 
3909-11695-0005	train-other-500	but difficult to be effective particularly when
none	none	 but we need not dwell upon Udo s 
3909-11695-0006	train-other-500	handicap again I don t see anything to laugh at he said stiffly To intelligent people the outside appearance is not everything
3909-11695-0007	train-other-500	But it can be very funny can t it said Belvane coaxingly I wished for something humorous to happen to you
none	none	 but I never thought Ah said Udo 
3909-11695-0008	train-other-500	now we ve got it
none	none	 He spoke with an air of a clever cross examiner 
3909-11695-0009	train-other-500	who has skilfully extracted an admission from a reluctant witness This sort of tone goes best with one of those keen legal faces perhaps
3909-11695-0010	train-other-500	that is why Belvane laughed again
none	none	 You practically confess that you did it went on Udo magnificently 
3909-11695-0011	train-other-500	Did what Turned me into a a A rabbit said Belvane innocently
none	none	 A foolish observation like this always pained Udo What makes you think I m a rabbit 
3909-11695-0012	train-other-500	he asked I don t mind what you are but you ll never dare show yourself in the country like this Be careful woman don t drive me too far
3909-11695-0013	train-other-500	Beware lest you rouse the lion in me Where asked Belvane with a child like air
none	none	 With a gesture full of dignity and good breeding Udo called attention to his tail That said the Countess is not the part of the lion that I m afraid of For the moment Udo was nonplussed 
3909-11695-0014	train-other-500	but he soon recovered himself Even supposing just for the sake of argument that I am a rabbit I still have something up my sleeve I ll come and
3909-11695-0015	train-other-500	eat your young carnations Belvane adored her garden but she was sustained by the thought that it was only July just now She pointed this out to him
3909-11695-0016	train-other-500	It needn t necessarily be carnations he warned her I don t want to put my opinion against one who has forgive me inside knowledge on the subject
3909-11695-0017	train-other-500	but I think I have nothing in my garden at this moment
none	none	 that would agree with a rabbit I don t mind if it doesn t agree with me said Udo 
3909-11695-0018	train-other-500	heroically This was more serious Her dear garden in which she composed ruined by the mastications machinations what was the word
none	none	 of an enemy The thought was unbearable You aren t a rabbit 
3909-11695-0019	train-other-500	she said hastily you aren t really a rabbit Because because you don t woffle your nose properly I could
none	none	 said Udo simply 
3909-11695-0020	train-other-500	I m just keeping it back that s all
none	none	 Show me how cried Belvane clasping her hands eagerly together It was not what he had come into the garden for and it accorded ill with the dignity of the Royal House of Araby but somehow one got led on by this wicked woman Like this said Udo 
3909-11695-0021	train-other-500	The Countess looked at him critically with her head on one side No she said that s quite wrong Naturally I m a little out of practice
3909-11695-0022	train-other-500	I m sorry said Belvane I m afraid I can t pass you
none	none	 Udo couldn t think what had happened to the conversation With a great effort he extracted himself from it Enough of this Countess he said sternly I have your admission that it was you 
3909-11695-0023	train-other-500	who put this enchantment on me It was I I wasn t going to have you here interfering with my plans Your plans to rob the Princess
none	none	 Belvane felt that it was useless to explain the principles of largesse throwing to Udo There will always be men like Udo 
3909-11695-0024	train-other-500	and Roger Scurvilegs who take these narrow matter of fact views One merely wastes time in arguing with them My plans she repeated
3909-11695-0025	train-other-500	Very well I shall go straight to the Princess and she will unmask you before the people Belvane smiled happily One does not often get such a chance
none	none	 And who she asked sweetly will unmask your Royal Highness before the people so that they may see the true Prince Udo 
3909-11695-0026	train-other-500	underneath What do you mean
none	none	 said Udo 
3909-11695-0027	train-other-500	though he was beginning to guess That noble handsome countenance which is so justly the pride of Araby
none	none	 how shall we show that to the people They ll form such a mistaken idea of it if they all see you like this won t they Udo was quite sure now that he understood Hyacinth had understood at the very beginning Illustration He forgot his manners and made a jump towards her Illustration She glided gracefully behind the sundial in a pretty affectation of alarm You mean that if the Princess Hyacinth falls in with your plans you will restore me to my proper form but that otherwise 
3909-11695-0028	train-other-500	you will leave me like this One s actions are very much misunderstood sighed Belvane I ve no doubt that that is how it will appear
none	none	 to future historians To Roger certainly It was too much for Udo 
3909-11695-0029	train-other-500	He forgot his manners and made a jump towards her She glided gracefully behind the sundial in a pretty affectation of alarm and the next moment
none	none	 Udo decided 
3909-11695-0030	train-other-500	that the contest between them
none	none	 was not to be settled 
3909-11695-0031	train-other-500	by such rough and tumble methods as these The fact that his tail had caught in something helped him to decide Belvane was up to him in an instant There there she said soothingly
4137_11702_000016_000001	train-clean-100	 There there 
none	none	she said soothingly Let me undo it for your Royal Highness 
3909-11695-0032	train-other-500	She talked pleasantly as she worked at it Every little accident teaches us something Now if you d been a rabbit this wouldn t have happened No
3909-11695-0033	train-other-500	I m not even a rabbit
none	none	 said Udo sadly I m just nothing Belvane stood up and made him a deep curtsey You are his Royal Highness Prince Udo of Araby Your Royal Highness s straw is prepared When will your Royal Highness be pleased to retire It was a little unkind I think 
3909-11695-0034	train-other-500	I should not record it of her were not Roger so insistent Now
none	none	 said Udo 
3909-11695-0035	train-other-500	and lolloped sadly off It was his one really dignified moment in Euralia On his way to his apartment
none	none	 he met Wiggs 
3909-11695-0036	train-other-500	Wiggs he said solemnly if ever you can do
none	none	 anything to annoy that woman such as making her an apple pie bed or anything like that I wish you d do it Whereupon he retired for the night 
3909-11695-0037	train-other-500	Into the mysteries of his toilet we had perhaps better not inquire As the chronicler of these simple happenings many years ago
none	none	 it is my duty to be impartial These are the facts I should say and it is for your nobilities to judge of them Thus and thus my characters have acted how say you my lords and ladies I confess that this attitude is beyond me I have a fondness for all my people 
3909-11695-0038	train-other-500	and I would not have you misunderstand any of them But with regard to one of them there is no need for me to say anything in her defence About her at any rate
3909-11695-0039	train-other-500	we agree I mean Wiggs
none	none	 We take the same view as Hyacinth 
3909-11695-0040	train-other-500	she was the best little girl in Euralia It will come then as a shock to you as it did to me on the morning after I had staggered home with Roger s seventeen volumes
3909-11695-0041	train-other-500	to learn that on her day Wiggs could be as bad as anybody I mean really bad To tear your frock to read books which you ought to be dusting
none	none	 these are accidents which may happen to anybody Far otherwise was Wiggs s fall She adopted in fact the infamous suggestion of Prince Udo 
3909-11695-0042	train-other-500	Three nights later with malice aforethought and to the comfort of the King s enemies and the prejudice of the safety of the realm she made
3909-11695-0043	train-other-500	an apple pie bed for the Countess It was the most perfect apple pie bed ever made Cox himself could not have improved upon it
3909-11695-0044	train-other-500	Newton has seen nothing like it It took Wiggs a whole morning and the results though private that is the worst of an apple pie bed
3909-11695-0045	train-other-500	were beyond expectation After wrestling for half an hour the Countess spent the night in a garden hammock composing a bitter Ode
3909-11695-0046	train-other-500	to Melancholy Of course Wiggs caught it in the morning the Countess suspected what she could not prove Wiggs now
none	none	 in for a thoroughly bad week 
3909-11695-0047	train-other-500	realised that it was her turn again What should she do An inspiration came to her She had been really bad the day before it was a pity to waste such perfect badness as that
none	none	 Why not have the one bad wish 
3909-11695-0048	train-other-500	to which the ring entitled her She drew the ring out from its hiding place round her neck I wish she said holding it up I wish that the Countess Belvane she stopped
3909-11695-0049	train-other-500	to think of something that would really annoy her I wish that the Countess
none	none	 shall never be able to write another rhyme again 
3909-11695-0050	train-other-500	She held her breath expecting a thunderclap or some other outward token
none	none	 of the sudden death of Belvane s muse Instead she was struck by the extraordinary silence of the place She had a horrid feeling that everybody else was dead and realising all at once that she was a very wicked little 
3909-11695-0051	train-other-500	girl she ran up to her room and gave herself up to tears MAY YOU DEAR SIR OR MADAM REPENT AS QUICKLY However
3909-11695-0052	train-other-500	this is not a moral work An hour later Wiggs came into Belvane s garden eager to discover in what way her inability to rhyme would manifest itself
3909-11695-0053	train-other-500	It seemed that she had chosen the exact moment In the throes of composition Belvane had quite forgotten the apple pie bed so absorbing is our profession
none	none	 She welcomed Wiggs eagerly and taking her hand led her towards the roses I have just been talking to my dear roses she said Listen Whene er I take 
3909-11695-0054	train-other-500	my walks about I like to see the roses out I like them yellow white and pink But crimson are the best I think
none	none	 The butterfly 
3909-11695-0055	train-other-500	But we shall never know about the butterfly It may be that Wiggs has lost us here a thought on lepidoptera which the world can ill spare for she interrupted breathlessly
none	none	 When did you write that I was just making it up when you came in dear child These thoughts often come to me as I walk up and down my beautiful garden The 
3909-11695-0056	train-other-500	butterfly But Wiggs had let go her hand and was running back to the Palace She wanted to be alone to think this out What had happened
3909-11695-0057	train-other-500	That it was truly a magic ring as the fairy had told her she had no doubt that her wish was a bad one that she had been bad enough to earn it she was
3909-11695-0058	train-other-500	equally certain What then had happened There was only one answer to her question The bad wish had been granted to someone else To whom
3909-11695-0059	train-other-500	She had lent the ring to nobody True
none	none	 she had told the Princess all about it 
3909-11695-0060	train-other-500	but Suddenly she remembered
none	none	 The Countess had had it in her hands for a moment Yes and she had sent her out of the room and So many thoughts crowded into Wiggs s mind at this moment that she felt she must share them with somebody She ran off to find the Princess CHAPTER XIV WHY CAN T YOU BE LIKE WIGGS Hyacinth was with Udo in the library Udo spent much of his time in the library nowadays for surely in one of those many books was to be found some Advice to a Gentleman in Temporary Difficulties suitable to a case like his Hyacinth kept him company sadly It had been such a brilliant idea inviting him to Euralia how she wished now that she had never done it Well Wiggs she said with a gentle smile what have you been doing with yourself all the morning Udo looked up from his mat and nodded to her I ve found out said Wiggs excitedly it was the Countess who did it Udo surveyed her with amazement The Princess Hyacinth he said has golden hair One discovers these things gradually And he returned to his book Wiggs looked bewildered He means dear said Hyacinth that it is quite obvious that the Countess did it and we have known about it for days Udo wore as far as his face would permit the slightly puffy expression of one who has just said something profoundly ironical and is feeling self conscious about it Oh h said Wiggs in such a disappointed voice that it seemed as if she were going to cry Hyacinth like the dear that she was made haste to comfort her We didn t really know she said we only guessed it But now that you have found out I shall be able to punish her properly No don t come with me she said as she rose and moved towards the door stay here and help his Royal Highness Perhaps you can find the book that he wants you ve read more of them than I have I expect Left alone with the Prince Wiggs was silent for a little looking at him rather anxiously Do you know all about the Countess she asked at last If there s anything I don t know it must be very bad Then you know that it s all my fault that you are like this Oh dear Prince Udo I am so dreadfully sorry What do you mean your fault Because it was my ring that did it Udo scratched his head in a slightly puzzled but quite a nice way 
4137_11702_000056_000001	train-clean-100	Tell me all about it 
none	none	from the beginning he said You have found out something after all I believe So Wiggs told her story from the beginning How the fairy had given her a ring how the Countess had taken it from her for five minutes and had a bad wish on it and how Wiggs had found her out that very morning Udo was intensely excited by the story He trotted up and down the library muttering to himself He stopped in front of Wiggs as soon as she had finished Is the ring still going he asked I mean can you have another wish on it Yes just one Then wish her to be turned into a He tried to think of something that would meet the case What about a spider he said thoughtfully But that s a bad wish said Wiggs Yes but it s her turn Oh but I m only allowed a good wish now She added rapturously And I know what it s going to be So did Udo At least he thought he did Oh you dear he said casting an affectionate look on her Yes that s it That I might be able to dance like a fairy Udo could hardly believe his ears and they were adequate enough for most emergencies But how is that going to help me he said tapping his chest with his paw But it s my ring said Wiggs And so of course I m going to wish that I can dance like a fairy I ve always meant to as soon as I ve been good for a day first The child was absurdly selfish Udo saw that he would have to appeal to her in another way Of course he began I ve nothing to say against dancing as dancing but I think you ll get tired of it Just as I shall get tired of lettuce Wiggs understood now You mean that I might wish you to be a Prince again Well said Udo casually it just occurred to me as an example of what might be called the Good Wish Then I shall never be able to dance like a fairy Neither shall I if it comes to that said Udo Really the child was very stupid Oh it s too cruel said Wiggs stamping her foot I did so want to be able to dance Udo glanced gloomily into the future To live for ever behind wire netting he mused to be eternally frightened by pink eyed ferrets to be offered bran mash bran mash bran mash wherever one visited week after week month after month year after year century after how long do rabbits live But Wiggs was not to be moved I won t give up my wish she said passionately Udo got on to his four legs with dignity Keep your wish he said There are plenty of other ways of getting out of enchantments I ll learn up a piece of poetry by our Court Poet Sacharino and recite it backwards when the moon is new Something like that I can do this quite easily by myself Keep your wish He went slowly out His tail looking more like a bell rope than ever followed him solemnly The fluffy part that you pull was for a moment left behind then with a jerk it was gone and Wiggs was left alone I won t give up my wish cried Wiggs again I ll wish it now before I m sorry She held the ring up I wish that She stopped suddenly Poor Prince Udo he seems very unhappy I wonder if it is a good wish to wish to dance when people are unhappy She thought this out for a little and then made her great resolve Yes she said I ll wish him well again Once more she held the ring up in her two hands I wish she said that Prince Udo I know what you re going to say It was no good her wishing her good wish because she had been a bad girl the day before making the Countess an apple pie bed and all disgraceful How could she possibly suppose She didn t She remembered just in time Oh bother said Wiggs standing in the middle of the room with the ring held above her head I ve got to be good for a day first Bother So the next day was Wiggs s Good Day The legend of it was handed down for years afterwards in Euralia It got into all the Calendars July twentieth it was marked with a red star in Roger s portentous volumes it had a chapter devoted to it There was some talk about it being made into a public holiday he tells us but this fell through Euralian mothers used to scold their naughty children with the words Why can t you be like Wiggs and the children used to tell each other that there never was a real Wiggs and that it was only a made up story for parents However you have my word for it that it was true She began by getting up at five o clock in the morning and after dressing herself very neatly and being particularly careful to wring out her sponge she made her own bed and tidied up the room For a moment she thought of waking the grown ups in the Palace and letting them enjoy the beautiful morning too but a little reflection showed her that this would not be at all a kindly act so having dusted the Throne Room and performed a few simple physical exercises she went outside and attended to the smaller domestic animals Illustration When anybody of superior station or age came into the room she rose and curtsied At breakfast she had three helps of something very nutritious which the Countess said would make her grow but only one help of everything else She sat up nicely all the time and never pointed to anything or drank with her mouth full After breakfast she scattered some crumbs on the lawn for the robins and then got to work again First she dusted and dusted and dusted then she swept and swept and swept then she sewed and sewed and sewed When anybody of superior station or age came into the room she rose and curtsied and stood with her hands behind her back while she was being spoken to When anybody said I wonder where I put my so and so she jumped up and said Let me fetch it even if it was upstairs After dinner she made up a basket of provisions and took them to the old women who lived near the castle to some of them she sang or read aloud and when at one cottage she was asked Now won t you give me a little dance she smiled bravely and said I m afraid I don t dance very well I think that was rather sweet of her if I had been the fairy I should have let her off the rest of the day When she got back to the Palace she drank two glasses of warm milk with the skin on and then went and weeded the Countess s lawn and once when she trod by accident on a bed of flowers she left the footprint there instead of scraping it over hastily and pretending that she hadn t been near the place as you would have done And at half past six she kissed everybody good night including Udo and went to bed So ended July the Twentieth perhaps the most memorable day in Euralian history Udo and Hyacinth spent the great day peacefully in the library A gentleman for all his fur Udo had not told the Princess about Wiggs s refusal to help him Besides a man has his dignity To be turned into a mixture of three animals by a woman of thirty and to be turned back again by a girl of ten is to be too much the plaything of the sex It was time he did something for himself Now then how did that bit of Sacharino s go Let me see He beat time with a paw Blood for something something some Something like that Blood for er blood for er No it s gone again I know there was a bit of blood in it I m sure you ll get it soon said Hyacinth It sounds as thought it s going to be just the sort of thing that s wanted Oh I shall get it all right Some of the words have escaped me for the moment that s all Blood er blood You must have heard of it Princess it s about blood for he who something you must know the one I mean I know I ve heard of it said the Princess wrinkling her forehead only I can t quite think of it for the moment It s about a a Yes that s it said Udo Then they both looked up at the ceiling with their heads on one side and murmured to themselves But noon came and still they hadn t thought of it After a simple meal they returned to the library I think I d better write to Coronel said Udo and ask him about it I thought you said his name was Sacharino Oh this is not the poet it s just a friend of mine but he s rather good at this sort of thing The trouble is that it takes such a long time for a letter to get there and back At the word letter Hyacinth started suddenly Oh Prince Udo she cried I can never forgive myself I ve just remembered the very thing Father told me in his letter that a little couplet he once wrote was being very useful for er removing things What sort of things said Udo not too hopefully Oh enchantments and things Udo was a little annoyed at the and things as those turning him back into a Prince again was as much in the day s work as removing rust from a helmet It goes like this said Hyacinth Bo boll bill bole Wo woll will wole It sounds as though it would remove anything she added with a smile Udo sat up rather eagerly I ll try he said Is there any particular action that goes with it I ve never heard of any I expect you ought to say it as if you meant it Udo sat up on his back paws and gesticulating freely with his right paw declaimed Bo boll bill bole Wo woll will wole He fixed his eyes on his paws waiting for the transformation He waited And waited Nothing happened It must be all right said Hyacinth anxiously because I m sure Father would know Try saying it more like this She repeated the lines in a voice so melting yet withal so dignified that the very chairs might have been expected to get up and walk out Udo imitated her as well as he could At about the time when Wiggs was just falling asleep he repeated it in his fiftieth different voice I m sorry said Hyacinth perhaps it isn t so good as Father thought it was There s just one chance said Udo It s possible it may have to be said on an empty stomach I ll try it to morrow before breakfast Upstairs Wiggs was dreaming of the dancing that she had given up for ever And what Belvane was doing I really don t know CHAPTER XV THERE IS A LOVER WAITING FOR HYACINTH So the next morning before breakfast Wiggs went up on to the castle walls and wished She looked over the meadows and across the peaceful stream that wandered through them to the forest where she had met her fairy and she gave a little sigh Good bye dancing she said and then she held the ring up and went on bravely Please I was a very good girl all yesterday and I wish that Prince Udo may be well again For a full minute there was silence Then from the direction of Udo s room below there came these remarkable words Take the beastly stuff away and bring me a beefsteak and a flagon of sack Between smiles and tears Wiggs murmured He sounds all right I am g glad And then she could bear it no longer She hurried down and out of the Palace away away from Udo and the Princess and the Countess and all their talk to the cool friendly forest there to be alone and to think over all that she had lost It was very quiet in the forest At the foot of her own favourite tree a veteran of many hundred summers who stood sentinel over an open glade that dipped to a gurgling brook and climbed gently away from it she sat down On the soft green yonder she might have danced an enchanted place and now never never never How long had she sat there It must have been a long time because the forest had been so quiet and now it was so full of sound The trees were murmuring something to her and the birds were singing it and the brook was trying to tell it too but it would keep chuckling over the very idea so that you could hardly hear what it was saying and there were rustlings in the grass Get up get up everything was calling to her dance dance She got up a little frightened Everything seemed so strangely beautiful She had never felt it like this before Yes she would dance She must say Thank you for all this somehow perhaps they would excuse her if it was not very well expressed This will just be for Thank you she said as she got up I shall never dance again Illustration And then she danced And then she danced Where are you Hyacinth There is a lover waiting for you somewhere my dear It is the first of Spring The blackbird opens his yellow beak and whistles cool and clear There is blue magic in the morning the sky deep blue above melts into white where it meets the hills The wind waits for you up yonder will you go to meet it Ah stay here The hedges have put on their green coats for you misty green are the tall elms from which the rooks are chattering Along the clean white road between the primrose banks he comes Will you be round this corner or the next He is looking for you Hyacinth She rested breathless and then danced again It is summer afternoon All the village is at rest save one Cuck oo comes from the deep dark trees Cuck oo he calls again and flies away to send back the answer The fields all green and gold sleep undisturbed by the full river which creeps along them The air is heavy with the scent of may Where are you Hyacinth Is not this the trysting place I have waited for you so long She stopped and the watcher in the bushes moved silently away his mind aflame with fancies Wiggs went back to the Palace to tell everybody that she could dance Shall we tell her how it happened said Udo jauntily I just recited a couple of lines poetry you know backwards and well here I am O oh said Wiggs CHAPTER XVI BELVANE ENJOYS HERSELF The entrance of an attendant into his room that morning to bring him his early bran mash had awakened Udo As soon as she was gone he jumped up shook the straw from himself and said in a very passion of longing Bo boll bill bole Wo woll will wole He felt it was his last chance Exhausted by his effort he fell back on the straw and dropped asleep again It was nearly an hour later that he became properly awake Into his feelings I shall not enter at any length I leave that to Roger Scurvilegs Between ourselves Roger is a bit of a snob The degradation to a Prince of Araby to be turned into an animal so ludicrous the delight of a Prince of Araby at regaining his own form it is this that he chiefly dwells upon Really I think you or I would have been equally delighted I am sure we can guess how Udo felt about it He strutted about the room he gazed at himself in every glass he held out his hand to an imaginary Hyacinth with Ah dear Princess and how are we this morning Never had he felt so handsome and so sure of himself It was in the middle of one of his pirouettings that he caught sight of the unfortunate bran mash and uttered the remarkable words which I have already recorded The actual meeting with Hyacinth was even better than he had expected Hardly able to believe that it was true she seized his hands impulsively and cried Oh Prince Udo oh my dear I am so glad Udo twirled his moustache and felt a very gay dog indeed At breakfast where Udo did himself extremely well they discussed plans The first thing was to summon the Countess into their presence An attendant was sent to fetch her If you would like me to conduct the interview said Udo I ve no doubt that I think I shall be all right now that you are with me I shan t feel so afraid of her now The attendant came in again Her ladyship is not yet down your Royal Highness Tell her that I wish to see her directly she is down said the Princess The attendant withdrew You were telling me about this army of hers said Udo One of my ideas I had a good many while I was er in retirement was that she could establish the army properly at her own expense and that she herself should be perpetual orderly sergeant Isn t that a nice thing to be asked Hyacinth innocently It s a horrible thing to be Another of my ideas was that The attendant came in again Her ladyship is a little indisposed and is staying in bed for the present Oh Did her ladyship say when she thought of getting up Her ladyship didn t seem to think of getting up at all to day Her ladyship told me to say that she didn t seem to know when she d get up again The attendant withdrew and Hyacinth and Udo standing together in a corner discussed the matter anxiously I don t quite see what we can do said Hyacinth We can t pull her out of bed Besides she may really be ill Supposing she stays there for ever Of course said Udo It would be rather You see if we We might possibly Good morning all said Belvane sweeping into the room She dropped a profound curtsey to the Princess Your Royal Highness And dear Prince Udo looking his own charming self again She had made a superb toilet In her flowing gold brocade cut square in front to reveal the whitest of necks with her black hair falling in two braids to her knees and twined with pearls which were caught up in loops at her waist she looked indeed a Queen while Hyacinth and Udo taken utterly by surprise seemed to be two conspirators whom she had caught in the act of plotting against her Illustration Good morning said Belvane I I thought you weren t well Countess said Hyacinth trying to recover herself I not well cried Belvane clasping her hands to her breast I thought it was his Royal Highness who Ah but he s looking a true Prince now She turned her eyes upon him and there was in that look so much of admiration humour appeal impudence I don t know what and Roger cannot tell us either that Udo forgot entirely what he was going to say and could only gaze at her in wonder Her mere entry dazzled him There is no knowing with a woman like Belvane and I believe she had purposely kept herself plain during these last few days so that she might have the weapon of her beauty to fall back upon in case anything went wrong Things had indeed gone wrong Udo had become a man again and it was against the man that this last weapon was directed Udo himself was only too ready The fact that he was once more attractive to women meant as much as anything to him To have been attractive to Hyacinth would have contented most of us but Udo felt a little uncomfortable with her He could not forget the last few days nor the fact that he had once been an object of pity to her Now Belvane had not pitied him Hyacinth had got control of herself by this time Enough of this Countess she said with dignity We have not forgotten the treason which you were plotting against the State we have not forgotten your base attack upon our guest Prince Udo I order you now to remain within the confines of the Palace until we shall have decided what to do with you You may leave us Belvane dropped her eyes meekly I am at your Royal Highness s commands I shall be in my garden when your Royal Highness wants me She raised her eyes gave one fleeting glance to Prince Udo and withdrew A hateful woman said Hyacinth What shall we do with her I think said Udo that I had better speak to her seriously first I have no doubt that I can drag from her the truth of her conspiracy against you There may be others in it in which case we shall have to proceed with caution on the other hand it may be just misplaced zeal on her part in which case Was it misplaced zeal which made her turn you into a Udo held up his hand hastily I have not forgotten that he said Be sure that I shall exact full reparation Let me see which is the way to her garden Hyacinth did not know quite what to make of her guest At the moment when she first saw him in his proper form the improvement on his late appearance had been so marked that he had seemed almost the handsome young Prince of her dreams Every minute after that had detracted from him His face was too heavy his manner was too pompous one of these days he would be too fat Moreover he was just a little too sure of his position in her house She had wanted his help but she did not want so much of it as she seemed to be likely to get Udo feeling that it was going to be rather a nice day went into Belvane s garden He had been there once before it seemed to him a very much prettier garden this morning and the woman who was again awaiting him much more desirable Belvane made room for him on the seat next to her This is where I sit when I write my poetry she said I don t know if your Royal Highness is fond of poetry Extremely said Udo I have never actually written any or indeed read much but I have a great admiration for those who er admire it But it was not to talk about poetry that I came out here Countess No said Belvane But your Royal Highness must have read the works of Sacharino the famous bard of Araby Sacharino of course Blood for something something He who something I mean it s a delightful little thing Everybody knows it But it was to talk about something very different that I Blood for blood and shoon for shoon He who runs may read my rune quoted Belvane softly It is perhaps Sacharino s most perfect gem That s it cried Udo excitedly I knew I knew it if only I could He broke off suddenly remembering the circumstances in which he had wanted it He coughed importantly and explained for the third time that he had not come to talk to her about poetry But of course I think his most noble poem of all went on Belvane apparently misunderstanding him is the ode to your Royal Highness upon your coming of age Let me see how does it begin Prince Udo so dashing and bold Is apparently eighteen years old It is eighteen years since This wonderful Prince Was born in the Palace I m told These Court Poets said Udo with an air of unconcern flatter one of course If he expected a compliment he was disappointed There I cannot judge said Belvane until I know your Royal Highness better She looked at him out of the corner of her eyes Is your Royal Highness very dashing I er well er one that is to say He waded on uncomfortably feeling less dashing every moment He should have realised at once that it was an impossible question to answer Your Royal Highness said Belvane modestly must not be too dashing with us poor Euralians For the fourth time Udo explained that he had come there to speak to her severely and that Belvane seemed to have mistaken his purpose Oh forgive me Prince Udo she begged I quite thought that you had come out to commune soul to soul with a fellow lover of the beautiful N no said Udo not exactly Then what is it she cried clasping her hands eagerly together I know it will be something exciting Udo stood up He felt that he could be more severe a little farther off He moved a few yards away and then turned round towards her resting his elbow on the sundial Countess he began sternly ten days ago as I was starting on my journey hither I was suddenly Just a moment said Belvane whispering eagerly to herself rather than to him and she jumped up with a cushion from the seat where she was sitting and ran across and arranged it under his elbow He would have been so uncomfortable she murmured and she hurried back to her seat again and sat down and gazed at him with her elbows on her knees and her chin resting on her hands Now go on telling me she said breathlessly Udo opened his mouth with the obvious intention of obeying her but no words came He seemed to have lost the thread of his argument He felt a perfect fool stuck up there with his elbow on a cushion just as if he were addressing a public meeting He looked at his elbow as if he expected to find a glass of water there ready and Belvane divined his look and made a movement as if she were about to get it for him It would be just like her He flung the cushion from him Oh mind my roses cried Belvane and came down angrily to her Belvane looked at him with wide innocent eyes You you oh don t look like that Like that said Belvane looking like it again Don t do it shouted Udo and he turned and kicked the cushion down the flagged path Stop it Belvane stopped it Do you know she said I m rather frightened of you when you re angry with me I am angry Very very angry Excessively annoyed I thought you were she sighed And you know very well why She nodded her head at him It s my dreadful temper she said I do such thoughtless things when I lose my temper She sighed again and looked meekly at the ground Er well you shouldn t said Udo weakly It was the slight to my sex that made me so angry I couldn t bear to think that we women couldn t rule ourselves for such a short time and that a man had to be called in to help us She looked up at him shyly Of course I didn t know then what the man was going to be like But now that I know Suddenly she held her arms out to him beseechingly Stay with us Prince Udo and help us Men are so wise so brave so so generous They know nothing of the little petty feelings of revenge that women indulge Really Countess we er you er Of course there is a good deal in what you say and I er Won t you sit down again Prince Udo Udo sat down next to her And now said Belvane let s talk it over comfortably as friends should Of course began Udo I quite see your point You hadn t seen me you didn t know anything about me to you I might have been just any man I knew a little about you when you came here Beneath the er outward mask I saw how brave and dignified you were But even if I could have got you back into your proper form again I think I should have been afraid to because I didn t know then how generous how forgiving you were It seemed to be quite decided that Udo was forgiving her When a very beautiful woman thanks you humbly for something you have not yet given her there is only one thing for a gentleman to do Udo patted her hand reassuringly Oh thank you your Royal Highness She gave herself a little shake and jumped up And now shall I show you my beautiful garden A garden with you in it dear Countess is always beautiful he said gallantly And it was not bad I think for a man who had been living on watercress and bran mash only the day before They wandered round the garden together Udo was now quite certain it was going to be a nice day It was an hour later when he came into the library Hyacinth greeted him eagerly Well she said Udo nodded his head wisely I have spoken to her about her conduct to me he said There will be no more trouble in that direction I fancy She explained her conduct to me very fully and I have decided to overlook it this time But her robberies her plots her conspiracy against me Udo looked blankly at her for a moment and then pulled himself together I am speaking to her about that this afternoon he said CHAPTER XVII THE KING OF BARODIA DROPS THE WHISKER HABIT King Merriwig sat in his tent his head held well back his eyes gazing upwards His rubicund cheeks were for the moment a snowy white A hind of the name of Carlo had him firmly by the nose Yet King Merriwig neither struggled nor protested he was in fact being shaved The Court Barber was in his usual conversational mood He released his Majesty s nose for a moment and as he turned to sharpen his razor remarked Terrible war this Terrible agreed the King Don t seem no end to it like Well well said Merriwig we shall see The barber got to work again Do you know what I should do to the King of Barodia if I had him here Merriwig did not dare to speak but he indicated with his right eye that he was interested in the conversation I d shave his whiskers off said Carlo firmly The King gave a sudden jerk and for the moment there were signs of a battle upon the snow then the King leant back again and in another minute or so the operation was over It will soon be all right said Carlo mopping at his Majesty s chin Your Majesty shouldn t have moved It was my own fault Carlo you gave me a sudden idea that s all You re welcome your Majesty As soon as he was alone the King took out his tablets On these he was accustomed to record any great thoughts which occurred to him during the day He now wrote in them these noble words Jewels of wisdom may fall from the meanest of hinds He struck a gong to summon the Chancellor into his presence I have a great idea he told the Chancellor The Chancellor hid his surprise and expressed his pleasure To night I propose to pay a secret visit to his Majesty the King of Barodia Which of the many tents yonder have my spies located as the royal one The big on in the centre above which the Royal Arms fly I thought as much Indeed I have often seen his Majesty entering it But one prefers to do these things according to custom Acting on the information given me by my trusty spies I propose to enter the King of Barodia s tent at the dead of night and The Chancellor shuddered in anticipation And shave his whiskers off The Chancellor trembled with delight Your Majesty he said in a quavering voice forty years man and boy have I served your Majesty and your Majesty s late lamented father and never have I heard such a beautiful plan Merriwig struggled with himself for a moment but his natural honesty was too much for him It was put into my head by a remark of my Court Barber s he said casually But of course the actual working out of it has been mine Jewels of wisdom said the Chancellor sententiously may fall from the meanest of hinds I suppose said Merriwig taking up his tablets and absently scratching out the words written thereon there is nothing in the rules against it By no means your Majesty In the annuals of Euralia there are many instances of humour similar to that which your Majesty suggests humour if I may say so which while evidencing to the ignorant only the lighter side of war has its roots in the most fundamental strategical considerations Merriwig regarded him with admiration This was indeed a Chancellor The very words he answered which I said to myself when the idea came to me The fact I said that this will help us to win the war must not disguise from us the fact that the King of Barodia will look extremely funny without his whiskers To night I shall sally forth and put my plan into practice At midnight then he started out The Chancellor awaited his return with some anxiety This might well turn out to be the decisive stroke or strokes of the war For centuries past the ruling monarchs of Barodia had been famous for their ginger whiskers As lost as the King of Barodia without his whiskers was indeed a proverb of those times A King without a pair and at such a crisis in his country s fortunes It was inconceivable At the least he would have to live in retirement until they grew again and without the leadership of their King the Barodian army would become a rabble The Chancellor was not distressed at the thought he was looking forward to his return to Euralia where he kept a comfortable house It was not that his life in the field was uninteresting he had as much work to do as any man It was part of his business for instance to test the pretentions of any new wizard or spell monger who was brought into the camp Such and such a quack would seek an interview on the pretext that for five hundred crowns he could turn the King of Barodia into a small black pig He would be brought before the Chancellor You say that you can turn a man into a small black pig the Chancellor would ask Yes your lordship It came to me from my grandmother Then turn me the Chancellor would say simply The so called wizard would try As soon as the incantation was over the Chancellor surveyed himself in the mirror Then he nodded to a couple of soldiers and the impostor was tied backwards on to a mule and driven with jeers out of the camp There were many such impostors who at least made a mule out of it and the Chancellor s life did not lack excitement But he yearned now for the simple comforts of his home He liked pottering about his garden when his work at the Palace was finished he liked over the last meal of the day to tell his wife all the important things he had been doing since he had seen her and to impress her with the fact that he was the holder of many state secrets which she must not attempt to drag from him A woman of less tact would have considered the subject closed at this point but she knew that he was only longing to be persuaded However as she always found the secrets too dull to tell any one else no great harm was done Just help me off with this cloak said a voice in front of him The Chancellor felt about until his hands encountered a solid body He undid the cloak and the King stood revealed before him Thanks Well I ve done it It went to my heart to do it at the last moment so beautiful they were but I nerved myself to it Poor soul he slept like a lamb through it all I wonder what he ll say when he wakes up Did you bring them back with you asked the Chancellor excitedly My dear Chancellor what a question He produced them from his pocket In the morning we ll run them up on the flagstaff for all Barodia to see He won t like that said the Chancellor chuckling I don t quite see what he can do about it said Merriwig The King of Barodia didn t quite see either A fit of sneezing woke him up that morning and at the same moment he felt a curious draught about his cheeks He put his hand up and immediately knew the worst Hullo there he bellowed to the sentry outside the door Your Majesty said the sentry coming in with alacrity Illustration The tent seemed to swim before his eyes and he knew no more The King bobbed down again at once Send the Chancellor to me said an angry voice from under the bedclothes When the Chancellor came in it was to see the back only of his august monarch Chancellor said the King prepare yourself for a shock Yes sir said the Chancellor trembling exceedingly You are about to see something which no man in the history of Barodia has ever seen before The Chancellor not having the least idea what to expect waited nervously The next moment the tent seemed to swim before his eyes and he knew no more When he came to the King was pouring a jug of water down his neck and murmuring rough words of comfort in his ear Oh your Majesty said the poor Chancellor your Majesty I don t know what to say your Majesty He mopped at himself as he spoke and the water trickled from him on to the floor Pull yourself together said the King sternly We shall want all your wisdom which is notoriously not much to help us in this crisis Your Majesty who has dared to do this grievous thing You fool how should I know Do you think they did it while I was awake The Chancellor stiffened a little He was accustomed to being called a fool but that was by a man with a terrifying pair of ginger whiskers From the rather fat and uninspiring face in front of him he was inclined to resent it What does your Majesty propose to do he asked shortly I propose to do the following Upon you rests the chief burden The Chancellor did not look surprised It will be your part to break the news as gently as possible to my people You will begin by saying that I am busy with a great enchanter who has called to see me and that therefore I am unable to show myself to my people this morning Later on in the day you will announce that the enchanter has shown me how to defeat the wicked Euralians you will dwell upon the fact that this victory as assured by him involves an overwhelming sacrifice on my part but that for the good of my people I am willing to endure it Then you will solemnly announce that the sacrifice I am making have indeed already made is nothing less than What are all those fools cheering for out there A mighty roar of laughter rose to the sky Here what s it all about Just go and look The Chancellor went to the door of the tent and saw He came back to the King striving to speak casually Just a humorous emblem that the Euralians have raised over their camp he said It wouldn t amuse your Majesty I am hardly in a mood for joking said the King Let us return to business As I was saying you will announce to the people that the enormous sacrifice which their King is prepared to make for them consists of There they go again I must really see what it is Just pull the door back so that I may see without being seen It it really wouldn t amuse your Majesty Are you implying that I have no sense of humour said the King sternly Oh no sire but there are certain jokes jokes in the poorest of taste that would naturally not appeal to so delicate a palate as your Majesty s This er strikes me as one of them Of that I am the best judge said the King coldly Open the door at once The Chancellor opened the door and there before the King s eyes flaunting themselves in the breeze beneath the Royal Standard of Euralia waved his own beloved whiskers The King of Barodia was not a lovable man and his daughters were decidedly plain but there are moments when one cannot help admiring him This was one of them You may shut the door he said to the Chancellor The instructions which I gave to you just now he went on in the same cold voice are cancelled Let me think for a moment He began to walk up and down his apartment You may think too he added kindly If you have anything not entirely senseless to suggest you may suggest it He continued his pacings Suddenly he came to a dead stop He was standing in front of a large mirror For the first time since he was seventeen he had seen his face without whiskers His eyes still fixed on his reflection he beckoned the Chancellor to approach Come here he said clutching him by the arm You see that He pointed to the reflection That is what I look like The mirror hasn t made a mistake of any kind That is really and truly what I look like Yes sire For a little while the King continued to gaze fascinated at his reflection and then he turned on the Chancellor You coward he said You weak kneed jelly souled paper livered imitation of a man You cringe to a King who looks like that Why you ought to kick me The Chancellor remembered that he had one kick owing to him He drew back his foot and then a thought occurred to him You might kick me back he pointed out I certainly should said the King The Chancellor hesitated a moment I think he said that these private quarrels in the face of the common enemy are to be deplored The King looked at him gave a short laugh and went on walking up and down That face again he sighed as he came opposite the mirror No it s no good I can never be King like this I shall abdicate But your Majesty this is a very terrible decision Could not your Majesty live in retirement until your Majesty had grown your Majesty s whiskers again Surely this is The King came to a stand opposite him and looked down on him gravely Chancellor he said those whiskers which you have just seen fluttering in the breeze have been for more than forty years my curse For more than forty years I have had to live up to those whiskers behaving not as my temperament which is a kindly indeed a genial one bade me to behave but as those whiskers insisted I should behave Arrogant hasty tempered over bearing these are the qualities which have been demanded of the owner of those whiskers I played a part which was difficult at first of late it has alas been more easy Yet it has never been my true nature that you have seen He paused and looked silently at himself in the glass But your Majesty said the Chancellor eagerly why choose this moment to abdicate Think how your country will welcome this new King whom you have just revealed to me And yet he added regretfully it would not be quite the same The King turned round to him There spoke a true Barodian he said It would not be the same Barodians have come to expect certain qualities from their rulers and they would be lost without them A new King might accustom them to other ways but they are used to me and they would not like me different No Chancellor I shall abdicate Do not wear so sad a face for me I am looking forward to my new life with the greatest of joy The Chancellor was not looking sad for him he was looking sad for himself thinking that perhaps a new King might like changes in Chancellors equally with changes in manners or whiskers But what will you do he asked I shall be a simple subject of the new King earning my living by my own toil The Chancellor raised his eyebrows at this I suppose you think said the King haughtily that I have not the intelligence to earn my own living The Chancellor with a cough remarked that the very distinguished qualities which made an excellent King did not always imply the corresponding er and so on That shows how little you know about it Just to give one example I happen to know that I have in me the makings of an excellent swineherd A swineherd The man who er herds the swine It may surprise you to hear that posing as a swineherd I have conversed with another of the profession upon his own subject without his suspecting the truth It is just such a busy outdoor life as I should enjoy One herds and one milks and one milks and er herds and so it goes on day after day A happy smile the first the Chancellor had ever seen there spread itself over his features He clapped the Chancellor playfully on the back and added I shall simply love it The Chancellor was amazed What a story for his dinner parties when the war was over How will you announce it he asked and his tone struck a happy mean between the tones in which you address a monarch and a pig minder respectively That will be your duty Now that I have shaken off the curse of those whiskers I am no longer a proud man but even a swineherd would not care for it to get about that he had been forcibly shaved while sleeping That this should be the last incident recorded of me in Barodian history is unbearable You will announce therefore that I have been slain in fair combat though at the dead of night by the King of Euralia and that my whiskers fly over his royal tent as a symbol of his victory He winked at the Chancellor and added It might as well get about that some one had stolen my Magic Sword that evening The Chancellor was speechless with admiration and approval of the plan Like his brother of Euralia he too was longing to get

none	none	The war had arisen over a personal insult to the King If the King was no longer King why should the war go on I think said the future swineherd that I shall send a Note over to the King of Euralia telling him my decision To night when it is dark I shall steal away and begin my new life There seems to be no reason why the people should not go back to their homes to morrow By the way that guard outside there knows that I wasn t killed last night that s rather awkward I think said the Chancellor who was already picturing his return home and was not going to be done out of it by a common sentry I think I could persuade him that you were killed last night Oh well then that s all right He drew a ring from his finger Perhaps this will help him to be persuaded Now leave me while I write to the King of Euralia It was a letter which Merriwig was decidedly glad to get It announced bluntly that the war was over and added that the King of Barodia proposed to abdicate His son would rule in his stead but he was a harmless fool and the King of Euralia need not bother about him The King would be much obliged if he would let it get about that the whiskers had been won in a fair fight this would really be more to the credit of both of them Personally he was glad to be rid of the things but one has one s dignity He was now retiring into private life and if it were rumoured abroad that he had been killed by the King of Euralia matters would be much more easy to arrange Merriwig slept late after his long night abroad and he found this Note waiting for him when he awoke He summoned the Chancellor at once What have you done about those er trophies he asked They are fluttering from your flagstaff sire at this moment Ah And what do my people say They are roaring with laughter sire at the whimsical nature of the jest Yes but what do they say Some say that your Majesty with great cunning ventured privily in the night and cut them off while he slept others that with great bravery you defeated him in mortal combat and carried them away as the spoils of the victor Oh And what did you say The Chancellor looked reproachful Naturally your Majesty I have not spoken with them Ah well I have been thinking it over in the night and I remember now that I did kill him You understand Your Majesty s skill in sword play will be much appreciated by the people Quite so said the King hastily Well that s all I m getting up now And we re all going home to morrow The Chancellor went out rubbing his hands with delight CHAPTER XVIII THE VETERAN OF THE FOREST ENTERTAINS TWO VERY YOUNG PEOPLE Do you remember the day when the Princess Hyacinth and Wiggs sat upon the castle walls and talked of Udo s coming The Princess thought he would be dark and Wiggs thought he would be fair and he was to have the Purple Room or was it the Blue and anyhow he was to put the Countess in her place and bring happiness to Euralia That seemed a long time ago to Hyacinth now as once more she sat on the castle walls with Wiggs She was very lovely She longed to get rid of that outside help in our affairs which she had summoned so recklessly They were two against one now Belvane actively against her was bad enough but Belvane in the background with Udo as her mouthpiece Udo specially asked in to give the benefit of his counsel this was ten times worse What do you do Wiggs she asked when you are very lonely and nobody loves you Dance said Wiggs promptly But if you don t want to dance Wiggs tried to remember those dark ages about a week ago when she couldn t dance I used to go into the forest she said and sit under my own tree and by and by everybody loved you I wonder if they d love me Of course they would Shall I show you my special tree Yes but don t come with me tell me where it is I want to be unhappy alone So Wiggs told her how you followed her special path which went in at the corner of the forest until by and by the trees thinned on either side and it widened into a glade and you went downhill and crossed the brook at the bottom and went up the other side until it was all trees again and the first and the biggest and the oldest and the loveliest was hers And you turned round and sat with your back against it and looked across to where you d come from and then you knew that everything was all right I shall find it said Hyacinth as she got up Thank you dear She found it she sat there and her heart was very bitter at first against Udo and against Belvane and even against her father for going away and leaving her but by and by the peace of the place wrapped itself around her and she felt that she would find a way out of her difficulties somehow Only she wished that her father would come back because he loved her and she felt that it would be nice to be loved again It is beautiful isn t it said a voice from behind her She turned suddenly as a tall young man stepped out from among the trees Oh who are you please she asked amazed at his sudden appearance His dress told her nothing but his face told her things which she was glad to know My name he said is Coronel It is a pretty name Yes but don t be lead away by it It belongs to nobody very particular Do you mind if I sit down I generally sit down here about this time Oh do you live in the forest I have lived here for the last week He gave her a friendly smile and added You re late aren t you Late Yes I ve been expecting you for the last seven days How did you know there was any me at all smiled Hyacinth With a movement of his hand Coronel indicated the scene in front of him There had to be somebody for whom all this was made It wanted somebody to say thank you to it now and then Haven t you been doing that all this week Me I wouldn t presume No it s your glade and you ve neglected it shamefully There s a little girl who comes here said Hyacinth I wonder if you have seen her Coronel turned away There were secret places in his heart into which Hyacinth could not come yet She danced he said shortly There was silence between them for a little but a comfortable silence as if they were already old friends You know said Hyacinth looking down at him as he lay at her feet you ought not to be here at all really I wish I could think that said Coronel I had a horrible feeling that duty called me here I love those places where one really oughtn t to be at all don t you I love being here sighed Hyacinth Wiggs was quite right Seeing him look up at her she added Wiggs is the little girl who dances you know She would be right said Coronel looking away from her Hyacinth felt strangely rested It seemed that never again would anything trouble her never again would she have only her own strength to depend upon Who was he But it did not matter He might go away and she might never see him again but she was no longer afraid of the world I thought she said that all the men of Euralia were away fighting So did I said Coronel What are you then A Prince from a distant country an enchanter a spy sent from Barodia a travelling musician you see I give you much to choose from You leave me nothing to be but what I am Coronel And I am Hyacinth He knew of course but he made no sign Hyacinth he said and he held out his hand Coronel she answered as she took it The brook chuckled to itself as it hurried past below them Hyacinth got up with a little sigh of contentment Well I must be going she said Must you really be going asked Coronel I wasn t saying good bye you know Illustration She turned round and went off daintily down the hill I really must It s a surprising thing about the view from here said Coronel that it looks just as nice to morrow To morrow about the same time That s a very extraordinary thing smiled Hyacinth Yes but it s one of those things that you don t want to take another person s word for You think I ought to see for myself Well perhaps I will Give me a whistle if I happen to be passing said Coronel casually and tell me what you think Good bye Hyacinth Good bye Coronel She nodded her head confidently at him and then turned round and went off daintily down the hill Coronel stared after her What is Udo doing he murmured to himself But perhaps she doesn t like animals A whole day to wait How endless If he had known that Udo now on two legs again was at that moment in Belvane s garden trying to tell her for the fifth time that week about his early life in Araby he would have been still more surprised We left Coronel if you remember in Araby For three or four days he remained there wondering how Udo was getting on and feeling more and more that he ought to do something about it On the fourth day he got on to his horse and rode off again He simply must see what was happening If Udo wanted to help then he would be there to give it if Udo was all right again then he could go comfortably back to Araby To tell the truth Coronel was a little jealous of his friend A certain Prince Perivale who had stayed at his uncle s court had once been a suitor for Hyacinth s hand but losing a competition with the famous seven headed bull of Euralia which Merriwig had arranged for him had made no further headway with his suit This Prince had had a portrait of Hyacinth specially done for him by his own Court Painter a portrait which Coronel had seen It was for this reason that he had at first objected to accompanying Udo to Euralia and it was for this reason that he persuaded himself very readily that the claims of friendship called him there now For the last week he had been waiting in the forest Now that he was there he was not quite sure how to carry out his mission So far there had been no sign of Udo either on four legs or on two it seemed probable that unless Coronel went to the Palace and asked for him there would be no sign And if he went to the Palace and Udo was all right and the Princess Hyacinth was in love with him then the worst would have happened He would have to stay there and help admire Udo an unsatisfying prospect to a man in love For he told himself by this time that he was in love with Hyacinth although he had never seen her So he had waited in the forest hoping for something to turn up and first Wiggs had come and now at last Hyacinth He was very glad that he had waited She was there on the morrow I knew you d come said Coronel It looks just as beautiful doesn t it I think it s even more beautiful said Hyacinth You mean those little white clouds That was my idea putting those in I thought you d like them I wondered what you did all day Does it keep you very busy Oh said Coronel I have time for singing Why do you sing Because I am young and the forest is beautiful I have been singing this morning too Why asked Coronel eagerly Because the war with Barodia is over Oh said Coronel rather taken aback That doesn t interest you Yet if you were a Euralian But it interests me extremely Let us admire the scene for a moment while I think Look there is another of my little clouds Coronel wondered what would happen now If the King were coming back then Udo would be wanted no longer save as a suitor for Hyacinth s hand If then he returned it would show that But suppose he was still an animal It was doubtful if he would go back to Araby as an animal And then there was another possibility perhaps he had never come to Euralia at all Here were a lot of questions to be answered and here next to him was one who could answer them But he must go carefully Ninety seven ninety eight ninety nine a hundred he said aloud There I ve finished my thinking and you ve finished your looking And what have you decided smiled Hyacinth Decided said Coronel rather startled Oh no I wasn t deciding anything I was just thinking I was thinking about animals So was I How very curious and also how wrong of you You were supposed to be admiring my clouds What sort of animals were you thinking about Oh all sorts I was thinking about rabbits Do you care for rabbits at all Not very much Neither do I They re so loppity Do you like lions I think their tails are rather silly said Hyacinth Yes perhaps they are Now a woolly lamb I am not very fond of woolly lambs just now No Well they re not very interesting It s a funny thing he went on casually trying to steal a glance at her that we should be talking about those three animals because I once met somebody who was a mixture of all three together at the same time So did I said Hyacinth gravely But he saw her mouth trembling and suddenly she turned round and caught his eye and then they burst out laughing together Poor Udo said Coronel and how is he looking now He is all right again now All right again Then why isn t he But I m very glad he isn t I didn t like him said Hyacinth blushing a little And then she went on bravely But I think he found he didn t like me first He wants humouring said Coronel It s my business to humour him it isn t yours Hyacinth looked at him with a new interest Now I know who you are she said He talked about you once What did he say asked Coronel obviously dying to know He said you were good at poetry Coronel was a little disappointed He would have preferred Hyacinth to have been told that he was good at dragons However they had met now and it did not matter Princess he said suddenly I expect you wonder what I am doing here I came to see if Prince Udo was in need of help and also to see if you were in need of help Prince Udo was my friend but if he has not been a friend of yours then he is no longer a friend of mine Tell me what has been happening here and then tell me if in any way I can help you You called me Hyacinth yesterday she said and it is still my name Hyacinth said Coronel taking her hand tell me if you want me at all Thank you Coronel You see Coronel it s like this And sitting beneath Wiggs s veteran of the forest with Coronel lying at her feet she told him everything It seems easy enough he said when she had finished You want Udo pushed out and the Countess put in her place I can do the one while you do the other Yes but how do I push Prince Udo out That s what I m going to do Yes but Coronel dear if I could put the Countess in her place shouldn t I have done it a long time ago I don t think you quite know the sort of person she is And I don t quite know what her place is either which makes it rather had to put her into it You see I don t think I told you that that Father is rather fond of her I thought you said Udo was They both are Then how simple We simply kill Udo and and well anyhow there s one part of it done Yes but what about the other part Coronel thought for a moment Would it be simpler if we did it the other way around he said Killed the Countess and put Udo in his place Father wouldn t like that at all and he s coming back to morrow Coronel didn t quite see the difficulty If the King was in love with the Countess he would marry her whatever Hyacinth did And what was the good of putting her in her place for one day if her next place was to be on the throne Hyacinth guessed what he was thinking Oh don t you see she cried she doesn t know that the King is coming back to morrow And if I can only just show her I don t mind if it s only for an hour that I am not afraid of her and that she has got to take her orders from me then I shan t mind so much all that has happened these last weeks But if she is to have disregarded me all the time if she is to have plotted against me from the very moment my father went away and if nothing is to come to her for it but that she marries my father and becomes Queen of Euralia then I can have no pride left and I will be a Princess no longer I must see this Belvane said Coronel thoughtfully Oh Coronel Coronel cried Hyacinth if you fall in love with her too I think I shall die of shame With her Hyacinth he said turning to her in amazement Yes you I didn t you never I Her voice trailed away she could not meet his gaze any longer she dropped her eyes and the next moment his arms were round her and she knew that she would never be alone again CHAPTER XIX UDO BEHAVES LIKE A GENTLEMAN
4137_11701_000002_000000	train-clean-100	 And now said Coronel we d better decide what to do 
4137_11701_000003_000000	train-clean-100	 But I don t mind what we do now said Hyacinth happily 
4137_11701_000003_000001	train-clean-100	 She may have the throne and Father and Udo and and anything else she can get and I shan t mind a bit 
none	none	You see I have got you now Coronel and I can never be jealous of anybody again
4137_11701_000004_000000	train-clean-100	 That s what makes it so jolly 
4137_11701_000004_000001	train-clean-100	We can do what we like and it doesn t matter if it doesn t come off 
4137_11701_000004_000002	train-clean-100	So just for fun let s think of something to pay her out 
4137_11701_000005_000000	train-clean-100	 I feel I don t want to hurt anybody to day 
4137_11701_000006_000000	train-clean-100	 All right we won t hurt her we ll humour her 
4137_11701_000006_000001	train-clean-100	We will be her most humble obedient servants 
4137_11701_000006_000002	train-clean-100	She shall have everything she wants 
4137_11701_000007_000000	train-clean-100	 Including Prince Udo smiled Hyacinth 
4137_11701_000008_000000	train-clean-100	 That s a splendid idea 
none	none	We ll make her have Udo 
4137_11701_000008_000002	train-clean-100	It will annoy your father but one can t please everybody 
4137_11701_000008_000003	train-clean-100	Oh I can see myself enjoying this 
4137_11701_000009_000000	train-clean-100	They got up and wandered back along Wiggs s path hand in hand 
4137_11701_000010_000000	train-clean-100	 I m almost afraid to leave the forest said Hyacinth in case something happens 
4137_11701_000011_000000	train-clean-100	 What should happen 
4137_11701_000012_000000	train-clean-100	 I don t know but all our life together has been in the forest and I m just a little afraid of the world 
4137_11701_000013_000000	train-clean-100	 I will be very close to you always Hyacinth 
4137_11701_000014_000000	train-clean-100	 Be very close Coronel she whispered and then they walked out together 
4137_11701_000015_000000	train-clean-100	If any of the servants at the Palace were surprised to see Coronel they did not show it 
4137_11701_000015_000001	train-clean-100	After all that was their business 
4137_11701_000016_000000	train-clean-100	 Prince Coronel will be staying here said the Princess 
none	none	Prepare a room for him and some refreshment for us both And if they discussed those things in the servants halls of those days as why should they not no doubt they told each other that the Princess Hyacinth bless her pretty face had found her man at last Why you only had to see her looking at him 
4137_11701_000016_000003	train-clean-100	But I get no assistance from Roger at this point he pretends that he has a mind far above the gossip of the lower orders 
4137_11701_000017_000000	train-clean-100	 I say said Coronel as they went up the grand staircase I am not a Prince you know 
4137_11701_000017_000001	train-clean-100	Don t say I have deceived you 
none	none	You are my Prince said Hyacinth proudly
4137_11701_000019_000000	train-clean-100	 My dear I am a king among men to day and you are my queen but that s in our own special country of two 
4137_11701_000020_000000	train-clean-100	 If you are so particular said Hyacinth with a smile Father will make you a proper Prince directly he comes back 
4137_11701_000021_000000	train-clean-100	 Will he 
4137_11701_000021_000001	train-clean-100	That s what I m wondering 
4137_11701_000021_000002	train-clean-100	You see he doesn t know yet about our little present to the Countess 
4137_11701_000022_000000	train-clean-100	But it is quite time we got back to Belvane we have left her alone too long 
4137_11701_000022_000001	train-clean-100	It was more than Udo did 
4137_11701_000022_000002	train-clean-100	Just now he was with her in her garden telling her for the fifth time an extraordinarily dull story about an encounter of his with a dragon apparently in its dotage to which Belvane was listening with an interest which surprised even the narrator 
none	none	And then said Udo I jumped quickly to the right and whirling my no wait a bit that was later I jumped quickly to my left yes I remember it now it was my left I jumped quickly to my left and whirling my 
4137_11701_000024_000000	train-clean-100	He stopped suddenly at the expression on Belvane s face 
4137_11701_000024_000001	train-clean-100	She was looking over his shoulder at something behind him 
4137_11701_000025_000000	train-clean-100	 Why whoever is this she said getting to her feet 
4137_11701_000026_000000	train-clean-100	Before Udo had completely cleared his mind of his dragon the Princess and Coronel were upon them 
4137_11701_000027_000000	train-clean-100	 Ah Countess I thought we should find you together said Hyacinth archly 
none	none	Let me present to you my friend the Duke Coronel 
4137_11701_000027_000002	train-clean-100	Coronel this is Countess Belvane a very dear and faithful friend of mine Prince Udo of course you know 
4137_11702_000061_000000	train-clean-100	 Udo of course 
none	none	you know His Royal Highness and the Countess are well it isn t generally known at present so perhaps I oughtn t to say anything 
4137_11701_000028_000000	train-clean-100	Coronel made a deep bow to the astonished Belvane 
none	none	Illustration Let me present to you my friend the Duke Coronel
4137_11701_000030_000000	train-clean-100	 Your humble servant he said 
none	none	You will I am sure forgive me if I say how glad I am to hear your news 
4137_11701_000030_000002	train-clean-100	Udo is one of my oldest friends he turned and clapped that bewildered Highness on the back aren t you Udo and I can think of no one more suitable in every way He bowed again and turned back to the Prince 
none	none	Well Udo you re looking splendid 
4137_11701_000030_000004	train-clean-100	A different thing Countess from when I last saw him 
4137_11701_000030_000005	train-clean-100	Let me see that must have been just the day before he arrived in Euralia 
none	none	Ah what a miracle worker True Love is 
4137_11701_000031_000000	train-clean-100	I think one of the things which made Belvane so remarkable was that she was never afraid of remaining silent when she was not quite sure what to say 
none	none	She waited therefore while she considered what all this meant who Coronel was what he was doing there even whether a marriage with Udo was not after all the best that she could hope for now 
4137_11701_000032_000000	train-clean-100	Meanwhile Udo of course blundered along gaily 
4137_11701_000033_000000	train-clean-100	 We aren t exactly Princess I mean What are you doing here Coronel I didn t know Princess that you The Countess and I were just having a little I was just telling her what you said about How did you get here Coronel 
4137_11701_000034_000000	train-clean-100	 Shall we tell him said Coronel with a smile at Hyacinth 
none	none	Hyacinth nodded
4137_11701_000036_000000	train-clean-100	 I rode said Coronel 
4137_11701_000036_000001	train-clean-100	 It s a secret he added 
4137_11701_000037_000000	train-clean-100	 But I didn t know that you 
4137_11701_000038_000000	train-clean-100	 We find that we have really known each other a very long time explained Hyacinth 
4137_11701_000039_000000	train-clean-100	 And hearing that there was to be a wedding added Coronel 
4137_11701_000040_000000	train-clean-100	Belvane made up her mind 
none	none	Coronel was evidently a very different man from Udo 
4137_11701_000040_000002	train-clean-100	If he stayed in Euralia as adviser more than adviser she guessed to Hyacinth her own position would not be in much doubt And as for the King it might be months before he came back and when he did come would he remember her 
4137_11701_000040_000003	train-clean-100	But to be Queen of Araby was no mean thing 
none	none	We didn t want it to be known yet she said shyly but you have guessed our secret your Royal Highness She looked modestly at the ground and feeling for her reluctant lover s hand went on Udo and I here she squeezed the hand and finding it was Coronel s took Udo s boldly without any more maidenly nonsense Udo and I love each other
4137_11701_000042_000000	train-clean-100	 Say something Udo prompted Coronel 
none	none	Er yes said Udo very unwillingly and deciding he would explain it all afterwards 
4137_11701_000043_000001	train-clean-100	Whatever his feelings for the Countess he was not going to be rushed into a marriage 
none	none	Oh I m so glad said Hyacinth I felt somehow that it must be coming because you ve seen so much of each other lately 
4137_11701_000044_000002	train-clean-100	Wiggs and I have often talked about it together 
4137_11701_000045_000000	train-clean-100	 What has happened to the child thought Belvane 
none	none	She isn t a child at all she s grown up
4137_11701_000046_000000	train-clean-100	 There s no holding Udo once he begins volunteered Coronel 
4137_11701_000046_000001	train-clean-100	 He s the most desperate lover in Araby 
4137_11701_000047_000000	train-clean-100	 My father will be so excited when he hears said Hyacinth 
4137_11701_000047_000001	train-clean-100	 You know of course that his Majesty comes back to morrow with all his army 
4137_11701_000048_000000	train-clean-100	She did not swoon or utter a cry 
4137_11701_000048_000001	train-clean-100	She did not plead the vapours or the megrims 
4137_11701_000048_000002	train-clean-100	She took unflinching what must have been the biggest shock in her life 
4137_11701_000049_000000	train-clean-100	 Then perhaps I had better see that everything is ready in the Palace she said if your Royal Highness will excuse me And with a curtsey she was gone 
4137_11701_000050_000000	train-clean-100	Coronel exchanged a glance with Hyacinth 
4137_11701_000050_000001	train-clean-100	 I m enjoying this he seemed to say 
4137_11701_000051_000000	train-clean-100	 Well she announced I must be going in too 
4137_11701_000051_000001	train-clean-100	There ll be much to see about 
4137_11701_000052_000000	train-clean-100	Coronel was left alone with the most desperate lover in Araby 
4137_11701_000053_000000	train-clean-100	 And now said the Prince tell me what you are doing here 
4137_11701_000054_000000	train-clean-100	Coronel put his arm in Udo s and walked him up and down the flagged path 
4137_11701_000055_000000	train-clean-100	 Your approaching marriage he said is the talk of Araby Naturally I had to come here to see for myself what she was like 
4137_11701_000055_000001	train-clean-100	My dear Udo she s charming I congratulate you 
none	none	Don t be a fool Coronel 
4137_11701_000056_000001	train-clean-100	I haven t the slightest intention of marrying her 
4137_11701_000057_000000	train-clean-100	 Then why have you told everybody that you are going to 
none	none	You know quite well I haven t told anybody There hasn t been a single word about it mentioned until you pushed your way in just now Ah well perhaps you hadn t heard about it But the Princess knows the Countess knows and I know yes I think you may take our word for it that it s true
4137_11701_000060_000000	train-clean-100	 I haven t the slightest intention what do you keep clinging to my arm like this for 
4137_11701_000061_000000	train-clean-100	 My dear Udo I m so delighted to see you again 
none	none	Don t turn your back on old friendships just because you have found a nobler and a truer Oh very well if you re going to drop all your former friends go on then But when I m married there will always be a place for Understand once and for all said Udo angrily that I am not getting married 
4137_11701_000062_000001	train-clean-100	No don t take my arm we can talk quite well like this 
4137_11701_000063_000000	train-clean-100	 I am sorry Udo said Coronel meekly we seem to have made a mistake 
4137_11701_000063_000001	train-clean-100	But you must admit we found you in a very compromising position 
4137_11701_000064_000000	train-clean-100	 It wasn t in the least compromising protested Udo indignantly 
4137_11701_000064_000001	train-clean-100	 As a matter of fact I was just telling her about that dragon I killed in Araby last year 
none	none	Ah and who would listen to a hopeless story like that but the woman one was going to marry
4137_11701_000066_000000	train-clean-100	 Once more I am not going to marry her 
4137_11701_000067_000000	train-clean-100	 Well you must please yourself but you have compromised her severely with that story 
4137_11701_000067_000001	train-clean-100	Poor innocent girl 
4137_11701_000067_000002	train-clean-100	Well let s forget about it And now tell me how do you like Euralia 
4137_11701_000068_000000	train-clean-100	 I am returning to Araby this afternoon said Udo stiffly 
none	none	Well perhaps you re right 
4137_11701_000069_000001	train-clean-100	I hope that nothing will happen to you on the way 
4137_11701_000070_000000	train-clean-100	Udo who was about to enter the Palace turned round with a startled look 
none	none	What do you mean
4137_11701_000072_000000	train-clean-100	 Well something happened on the way here 
4137_11701_000072_000001	train-clean-100	By the by how did that happen 
4137_11701_000072_000002	train-clean-100	You never told me 
4137_11701_000073_000000	train-clean-100	 Your precious Countess whom you expect me to marry 
4137_11701_000074_000000	train-clean-100	 How very unkind of her 
none	none	A nasty person to annoy He was silent for a moment and then added thoughtfully I suppose it is rather annoying to think you re going to marry somebody whom you love very much and then find you re not going to 
4137_11701_000075_000000	train-clean-100	Udo evidently hadn t thought of this 
4137_11701_000075_000001	train-clean-100	He tried to show that he was not in the least frightened 
4137_11701_000076_000000	train-clean-100	 She couldn t do anything 
none	none	It was only by a lucky chance she did it last time
4137_11701_000077_000000	train-clean-100	 Yes but of course the chance might come again 
none	none	You d have the thing hanging over you always 
4137_11701_000077_000002	train-clean-100	She s clever you know and I should never feel quite safe if she were my enemy 
4137_11701_000077_000003	train-clean-100	Lovely flowers aren t they 
4137_11701_000077_000004	train-clean-100	What s the name of this one 
4137_11701_000078_000000	train-clean-100	Udo dropped undecidedly into a seat 
4137_11701_000078_000001	train-clean-100	This wanted thinking out 
4137_11701_000078_000002	train-clean-100	The Countess what was wrong with her after all 
4137_11701_000078_000003	train-clean-100	And she evidently adored him 
4137_11701_000078_000004	train-clean-100	Of course that was not surprising the question was was it fair to disappoint one who had perhaps some little grounds for After all he had been no more gallant than was customary from a Prince and a gentleman to a beautiful woman 
none	none	It was her own fault if she had mistaken his intentions 
4137_11701_000078_000006	train-clean-100	Of course he ought to have left Euralia long ago 
4137_11701_000078_000007	train-clean-100	But he had stayed on and well decidedly she was beautiful perhaps he had paid rather too much attention to that 
4137_11701_000078_000008	train-clean-100	And he had certainly neglected the Princess a little 
4137_11701_000078_000009	train-clean-100	After all again why not marry the Countess 
4137_11701_000078_000010	train-clean-100	It was absurd to suppose there was anything in Coronel s nonsense but one never knew 
none	none	Not that he was marrying her out of fear 
4137_11701_000078_000012	train-clean-100	No certainly not 
none	none	It was simply a chivalrous whim on his part 
4137_11701_000078_000014	train-clean-100	The poor woman had misunderstood him and she should not be disappointed 
4137_11701_000079_000000	train-clean-100	 She seems fond of flowers said Coronel 
4137_11701_000079_000001	train-clean-100	 You ought to make the Palace garden look beautiful between you 
4137_11701_000080_000000	train-clean-100	 Now understand clearly Coronel I m not in the least frightened by the Countess 
4137_11701_000081_000000	train-clean-100	 My dear Udo what a speech for a lover 
4137_11701_000081_000001	train-clean-100	Of course you re not 
4137_11701_000081_000002	train-clean-100	After all what you bore with such patience and dignity once you can bear again 
4137_11701_000082_000000	train-clean-100	 That subject is distasteful to me 
4137_11701_000082_000001	train-clean-100	I must ask you not to refer to it 
4137_11701_000082_000002	train-clean-100	If I marry the Countess 
4137_11701_000083_000000	train-clean-100	 You ll be a very lucky man put in Coronel 
4137_11701_000083_000001	train-clean-100	 I happen to know that the King of Euralia however she s chosen you it seems 
4137_11701_000083_000002	train-clean-100	Personally I can t make out what she sees in you 
none	none	What is it
4137_11701_000084_000000	train-clean-100	 I should have thought it was quite obvious said Udo with dignity Well Coronel I think perhaps you are right and that it s my duty to marry her 
4137_11701_000085_000000	train-clean-100	Coronel shook him solemnly by the hand 
4137_11701_000086_000000	train-clean-100	 I congratulate your Royal Highness 
4137_11701_000086_000001	train-clean-100	I will announce your decision to the Princess 
none	none	She will be much amu much delighted And he turned into the Palace 
4137_11701_000087_000000	train-clean-100	Pity him you lovers 
none	none	He had not seen Hyacinth for nearly ten minutes 
4137_11702_000001_000000	train-clean-100	CHAPTER XX
none	none	 CORONEL KNOWS A GOOD STORY WHEN HE HEARS IT I quote with slight alterations from an epic by Charlotte Patacake a contemporary poet of the country King Merriwig the First rode back from war As many other Kings had done before Five hundred men behind him were in sight Left right left right left right left right left right 
4137_11702_000005_000000	train-clean-100	So far as is known this was her only work but she built up some reputation on it and Belvane who was a good judge had a high opinion of her genius 
4137_11702_000006_000000	train-clean-100	To be exact there were only four hundred and ninety nine men 
4137_11702_000006_000001	train-clean-100	Henry Smallnose a bowman of considerable promise had been left behind in the enemy s country the one casualty of war 
4137_11702_000006_000002	train-clean-100	While spying out the land in the early days of the invasion he had been discovered by the Chief Armourer of Barodia at full length on the wet grass searching for tracks 
none	none	The Chief Armourer a kindly man had invited him to his cottage dried him and given him a warming drink and had told him that if ever his spying took him that way again he was not to stand on ceremony but come in and pay him a visit 
4137_11702_000006_000004	train-clean-100	Henry having caught a glimpse of the Chief Armourer s daughter had accepted without any false pride and had frequently dropped in to supper thereafter 
4137_11702_000006_000005	train-clean-100	Now that the war was over he found that he could not tear himself away With King Merriwig s permission he was settling in Barodia and with the Chief Armourer s permission he was starting on his new life as a married man 
none	none	As the towers of the castle came in sight Merriwig drew a deep breath of happiness Home again The hardships of the war were over the spoils of victory wrapped up in tissue paper were in his pocket days of honoured leisure were waiting for him 
4137_11702_000007_000003	train-clean-100	He gazed at each remembered landmark of his own beloved country his heart overflowing with thankfulness 
none	none	Never again would he leave Euralia 
4137_11702_000008_000000	train-clean-100	How good to see Hyacinth again 
4137_11702_000008_000001	train-clean-100	Poor little Hyacinth left all alone but there she had had the Countess Belvane a woman of great experience to help her 
none	none	Belvane 
4137_11702_000008_000003	train-clean-100	Should he risk it 
none	none	How much had she thought of him while he was away Hyacinth would be growing up and getting married soon 
4137_11702_000008_000006	train-clean-100	Life would be lonely in Euralia then unless Should he risk it 
none	none	What would Hyacinth say 
4137_11702_000010_000000	train-clean-100	She was waiting for him at the gates of the castle 
4137_11702_000010_000001	train-clean-100	She had wanted Coronel to wait with her but he had refused 
none	none	Illustration As the towers of the Castle came in sight Merriwig drew a deep breath of happiness
4137_11702_000012_000000	train-clean-100	 We must offer the good news to him gradually he said 
4137_11702_000012_000001	train-clean-100	 When a man has just come back from a successful campaign he doesn t want to find a surprise like this waiting for him 
4137_11702_000012_000002	train-clean-100	Just think we don t even know why the war is over he must be longing to tell you that 
none	none	Oh he ll have a hundred things to tell you first but then when he says And what s been happening here while I ve been away 
4137_11702_000045_000001	train-clean-100	Nothing much I suppose 
4137_11702_000012_000004	train-clean-100	Nothing much I suppose then you can say 
4137_11702_000013_000000	train-clean-100	 Then I shall say Nothing much only Coronel And such a clever 
4137_11702_000014_000000	train-clean-100	 Oh I have my ideas said Coronel 
4137_11702_000014_000001	train-clean-100	 Well I ll be out of the way somewhere 
4137_11702_000014_000002	train-clean-100	I think I ll go for a walk in the forest 
4137_11702_000014_000003	train-clean-100	Or shall I stay here in the Countess s garden and amuse myself with Udo 
4137_11702_000014_000004	train-clean-100	Anyhow I ll give you an hour alone together first 
4137_11702_000015_000000	train-clean-100	The cavalcade drew up in front of the castle 
4137_11702_000015_000001	train-clean-100	Handkerchiefs fluttered to them from the walls trumpets were blown hounds bayed 
4137_11702_000015_000002	train-clean-100	Down the steps came Hyacinth all blue and gold and flung herself into her father s arms 
4137_11702_000016_000000	train-clean-100	 My dear child said Merriwig as he patted her soothingly 
none	none	There there 
4137_11702_000016_000002	train-clean-100	It s your old father come back again 
none	none	H r m 
4137_11702_000016_000004	train-clean-100	There there He patted her again as though it were she and not himself who was in danger of breaking down 
none	none	My little Hyacinth 
4137_11702_000016_000006	train-clean-100	My own little girl 
none	none	Oh Father I am glad to have you back
4137_11702_000018_000000	train-clean-100	 There there my child 
none	none	Now I must just say a few words to my men and then we can tell each other all that has been happening 
4137_11702_000019_000000	train-clean-100	He took a step forward and addressed his troops 
none	none	Men of Euralia cheers We have returned from a long and arduous conflict cheers to the embraces loud cheers of our mothers and wives and daughters prolonged cheering as the case may be hear hear In honour of our great victory I decree that from now onwards to morrow shall be observed as a holiday throughout Euralia terrific cheering 
4137_11702_000020_000003	train-clean-100	I bid you all now return to your homes and I hope that you will find as warm a welcome there as I have found in mine Here he turned and embraced his daughter again and if his eye travelled over her shoulder in the direction of Belvane s garden it is a small matter and one for which the architect of the castle no doubt was principally to blame 
none	none	There was another storm of cheers the battle cry of Euralia Ho ho Merriwig was shouted from five hundred throats and the men dispersed happily to their homes 
4137_11702_000021_000001	train-clean-100	Hyacinth and Merriwig went into the Palace 
4137_11702_000022_000000	train-clean-100	 Now Father said Hyacinth later on when Merriwig had changed his clothes and refreshed himself you ve got to tell me all about it 
4137_11702_000022_000001	train-clean-100	I can hardly believe it s really over 
none	none	Yes yes 
4137_11702_000023_000001	train-clean-100	It s all over said Merriwig heartily 
none	none	We shan t have any trouble in that direction again I fancy
4137_11702_000024_000000	train-clean-100	 Do tell me did the King of Barodia apologise 
none	none	He did better than that he abdicated Why Well said Merriwig remembering just in time I er killed him Oh Father how rough of you
4137_11702_000029_000000	train-clean-100	 I don t think it hurt him very much my dear 
none	none	It was more a shock to his feelings than anything else 
4137_11702_000029_000002	train-clean-100	See I have brought these home for you 
4137_11702_000030_000000	train-clean-100	He produced from his pocket a small packet in tissue paper 
4137_11702_000031_000000	train-clean-100	 Oh how exciting 
4137_11702_000031_000001	train-clean-100	Whatever can it be 
4137_11702_000032_000000	train-clean-100	Merriwig unwrapped the paper and disclosed a couple of ginger whiskers neatly tied up with blue ribbon 
none	none	Father He picked out the left one fons et origo if he had known any Latin of the war and held it up for Hyacinth s inspection
4137_11702_000035_000000	train-clean-100	 There you can see the place where Henry Smallnose s arrow bent it By the way he added Henry is marrying and settling down in Barodia 
none	none	It is curious he went on how after a war one s thoughts turn to matrimony He glanced at his daughter to see how she would take this but she was still engrossed with the whiskers
4137_11702_000036_000000	train-clean-100	 What am I going to do with them Father 
4137_11702_000036_000001	train-clean-100	I can t plant them in the garden 
4137_11702_000037_000000	train-clean-100	 I thought we might run them up the flagstaff as we did in Barodia 
4137_11702_000038_000000	train-clean-100	 Isn t that a little unkind now that the poor man s dead 
4137_11702_000039_000000	train-clean-100	Merriwig looked round him to see that there were no eavesdroppers 
4137_11702_000040_000000	train-clean-100	 Can you keep a secret he asked mysteriously 
4137_11702_000041_000000	train-clean-100	 Of course said Hyacinth deciding at once that it would not matter if she only told Coronel 
4137_11702_000042_000000	train-clean-100	 Well then listen 
none	none	He told her of his secret journey to the King of Barodia s tent he told her of the King of Barodia s letter he told her more fully of his early duel with the King he told her everything that he had said and done and everything that everybody else had said and done to him and his boyish pleasure in it all was so evident and so innocent that even a stranger would have had nothing more reproachful for him than a smile 
4137_11702_000043_000001	train-clean-100	To Hyacinth he seemed the dearest of fathers and the most wonderful of kings 
4137_11702_000044_000000	train-clean-100	And by and by the moment came of which Coronel had spoken 
none	none	And now said Merriwig tell me what you have all been doing with yourselves here Nothing much I suppose 
4137_11702_000046_000000	train-clean-100	He waited nervously wondering if Hyacinth would realise that all was meant to include more particularly Belvane 
4137_11702_000047_000000	train-clean-100	Hyacinth drew a stool up to her father s chair and sat down very close to him 
none	none	Father she said stroking his hand where it rested on his knee I have got some news for you Nothing about the Coun nothing serious I hope said Merriwig in alarm
4137_11702_000050_000000	train-clean-100	 It s rather serious but it s rather nice 
none	none	Father dear would you mind very much if I got married soon My dear you shall get married as soon as you like 
4137_11702_000051_000001	train-clean-100	Let me see there were six or seven Princes who came about it only the other day I sent them off on adventures of some kind but dear me yes they ought to have been back by now 
4137_11702_000051_000002	train-clean-100	I suppose you haven t heard anything of them 
4137_11702_000052_000000	train-clean-100	 No Father said Hyacinth with a little smile 
none	none	Ah well no doubt they were unsuccessful 
4137_11702_000053_000001	train-clean-100	No matter dear we can easily find you plenty more suitors 
4137_11702_000053_000002	train-clean-100	Indeed the subject has been very near my thoughts lately 
4137_11702_000053_000003	train-clean-100	We ll arrange a little competition and let them know in the neighbouring countries there ll be no lack of candidates 
4137_11702_000053_000004	train-clean-100	Let me see there s that seven headed bull he s getting a little old now but he was good enough for the last one 
none	none	We might
4137_11702_000054_000000	train-clean-100	 I don t want a suitor said Hyacinth softly 
none	none	I have one 
4137_11702_000055_000000	train-clean-100	Merriwig leant forward with eagerness 
4137_11702_000056_000000	train-clean-100	 My dear this is indeed news 
none	none	Tell me all about it 
4137_11702_000056_000002	train-clean-100	Upon what quest did you send him 
4137_11702_000057_000000	train-clean-100	Hyacinth had felt this coming 
4137_11702_000057_000001	train-clean-100	Had she lived in modern times she would have expected the question What is his income A man must prove his worth in some way 
4137_11702_000058_000000	train-clean-100	 I haven t sent him away at all yet she said he s only just come He s been very kind to me and I m sure you ll love him 
none	none	Well well we ll arrange something for him 
4137_11702_000059_000001	train-clean-100	Perhaps that bull I was speaking of By the way who is he 
none	none	He comes from Araby and his name is Udo of course 
4137_11702_000061_000001	train-clean-100	Why didn t I think of him 
4137_11702_000061_000002	train-clean-100	An excellent arrangement my dear 
4137_11702_000062_000000	train-clean-100	 It isn t Udo I m afraid Father 
4137_11702_000062_000001	train-clean-100	It s Coronel 
4137_11702_000063_000000	train-clean-100	 And who might Coronel be said the King rather sternly 
4137_11702_000064_000000	train-clean-100	 He s he s well he s Here he is Father She ran up to him impulsively as he came in at the door 
4137_11702_000064_000001	train-clean-100	 Oh Coronel you re just in time do tell Father who you are 
4137_11702_000065_000000	train-clean-100	Coronel bowed profoundly to the King 
4137_11702_000066_000000	train-clean-100	 Before I explain myself your Majesty he said may I congratulate your Majesty on your wonderful victory over the Barodians 
4137_11702_000066_000001	train-clean-100	From the little I have gathered outside it is the most remarkable victory that has ever occurred 
4137_11702_000066_000002	train-clean-100	But of course I am longing to hear the full story from your Majesty s own lips 
4137_11702_000066_000003	train-clean-100	Is it a fact that your Majesty made his way at dead of night to the King of Barodia s own tent and challenged him to mortal combat and slew him There was an eagerness very winning in his eyes as he asked it he seemed to be envying the King such an adventure an adventure after his own heart 
4137_11702_000067_000000	train-clean-100	Merriwig was in an awkward position 
4137_11702_000067_000001	train-clean-100	He wondered for a moment whether to order his daughter out of the room 
4137_11702_000067_000002	train-clean-100	 Leave us my child he would say 
4137_11702_000067_000003	train-clean-100	 These are matters for men to discuss But Hyacinth would know quite well why she had been sent out and would certainly tell Coronel the truth of the matter afterwards 
none	none	It really looked as if Coronel would have to be let into the secret too He cleared his throat noisily by way of preparation
4137_11702_000069_000000	train-clean-100	 There are certain state reasons he said with dignity why that story has been allowed to get about 
none	none	Pardon your Majesty 
4137_11702_000070_000001	train-clean-100	I have no wish to 
4137_11702_000071_000000	train-clean-100	 But as you know so much you may as well know all 
4137_11702_000071_000001	train-clean-100	It happened like this Once more he told the story of his midnight visit and of the King s letter to him 
none	none	But your Majesty cried Coronel it is more wonderful than the other Never was such genius of invention such brilliance and daring of execution
4137_11702_000073_000000	train-clean-100	 So you like it said Merriwig trying to look modest 
4137_11702_000074_000000	train-clean-100	 I love it 
4137_11702_000075_000000	train-clean-100	 I knew he d love it put in Hyacinth 
4137_11702_000075_000001	train-clean-100	 It s just the sort of story that Coronel would love 
none	none	Tell him about how you fought the King at the beginning of the war and how you pretended to be a swineherd and how Could any father have resisted 
4137_11702_000076_000001	train-clean-100	In a little while Hyacinth and Coronel were seated eagerly at his feet and he was telling once more the great story of his adventures 
4137_11702_000077_000000	train-clean-100	 Well well said the King at the end of it when he had received their tribute of admiration 
4137_11702_000077_000001	train-clean-100	 Those are just a few of the little adventures that happen in war time He turned to Coronel 
none	none	And so you I understand wish to marry my daughter
4137_11702_000078_000000	train-clean-100	 Does that surprise your Majesty 
4137_11702_000079_000000	train-clean-100	 Well no it doesn t 
4137_11702_000079_000001	train-clean-100	And she I understand wishes to marry you

4137_11702_000081_000000	train-clean-100	 That said Coronel simply is much more surprising 
4137_11702_000082_000000	train-clean-100	Merriwig however was not so sure of that 
4137_11702_000082_000001	train-clean-100	He liked the look of Coronel he liked his manner and he saw at once that he knew a good story when he heard one 
4137_11702_000083_000000	train-clean-100	 Of course he said you ll have to win her 
4137_11702_000084_000000	train-clean-100	 Anything your Majesty sets me to do 
4137_11702_000084_000001	train-clean-100	It s as well he added with a disarming smile that you cannot ask for the whiskers of the King of Barodia 
none	none	There is only one man who could have got those 
4137_11702_000085_000000	train-clean-100	Truly an excellent young man 
4137_11702_000086_000000	train-clean-100	 Well we ll arrange something said Merriwig looking pleased Perhaps your Prince Udo would care to be a competitor too 
none	none	Hyacinth and Coronel interchanged a smile Alas Father she said his Royal Highness is not attracted by my poor charms
4137_11702_000089_000000	train-clean-100	 Wait till he has seen them my dear said Merriwig with a chuckle 
none	none	He has seen them Father What 
4137_11702_000091_000001	train-clean-100	You invited him here 
none	none	Tell me about this Hyacinth 
4137_11702_000091_000003	train-clean-100	He came to stay with you and he never 
4137_11702_000092_000000	train-clean-100	 His Royal Highness put in Coronel has given his affections to another 
4137_11702_000093_000000	train-clean-100	 Aha 
4137_11702_000093_000001	train-clean-100	So that s the secret 
4137_11702_000093_000002	train-clean-100	Now I wonder if I can guess who she is What do you say to the Princess Elvira of Tregong 
4137_11702_000093_000003	train-clean-100	I know his father had hopes in that direction 
4137_11702_000094_000000	train-clean-100	Hyacinth looked round at Coronel as if appealing for his support 
4137_11702_000094_000001	train-clean-100	He took a step towards her 
4137_11702_000095_000000	train-clean-100	 No it s not the Princess Elvira said Hyacinth a little nervously 
4137_11702_000096_000000	train-clean-100	The King laughed good humouredly 
none	none	Ah well you must tell me he said 
4137_11702_000098_000000	train-clean-100	Hyacinth put out her hand and Coronel pressed it encouragingly 
none	none	His Royal Highness Prince Udo she said is marrying the Countess Belvane CHAPTER XXI A SERPENT COMING AFTER UDO Belvane had now had twenty four hours in which to think it over Whatever her faults she had a sense of humour She could not help smiling to herself as she thought of that scene in the garden However much she regretted her too hasty engagement she was sure Udo regretted it still more If she gave him the least opportunity he would draw back from it Then why not give him the opportunity My dear Prince Udo I m afraid I mistook the nature of my feelings said of course with downcast head and a maidenly blush Exit Udo with haste enter King Merriwig It would be so easy Ah but then Hyacinth would have won Hyacinth had forced the engagement upon her even if it only lasted for twenty four hours so long as it was a forced engagement Hyacinth would have had the better of her for that time But if she welcomed the engagement if she managed in some way to turn it to account to make it appear as if she had wanted it all the time then Hyacinth s victory would be no victory at all but a defeat Marry Udo then as if willingly Yes but that was too high a price to pay She was by this time thoroughly weary of him and besides she had every intention of marrying the King of Euralia To pretend to marry him until she brought the King in open conflict with him and then having led the King to her feet to dismiss the rival who had served her turn that was her only wise course She did not come to this conclusion without much thought She composed an Ode to Despair an Elegy to an Unhappy Woman and a Triolet to Interfering Dukes before her mind was made up She also considered very seriously what she would look like in a little cottage in the middle of the forest dressed in a melancholy grey and holding communion only with the birds and trees a life of retirement away from the vain world a life into which no man came It had its attractions but she decided that grey did not suit her She went down to her garden and sent for Prince Udo At about the moment when the King was having the terrible news broken to him Udo was protesting over the sundial that he loved Belvane and Belvane only and that he was looking forward eagerly to the day when she would make him the happiest of men So afraid was he of what might happen to him on the way back to Araby The Countess Belvane cried Merriwig Prince Udo marry the Countess Belvane I never heard such a thing in my life He glared at them one after the other as if it were their fault as indeed it was Why didn t you tell me this before Hyacinth It was only just announced Father Who announced it Well er Udo did said Coronel I never heard of anything so ridiculous in my life I won t have it But Father don t you think she d make a very good Queen She d make a wonderful that has nothing to do with it What I feel so strongly about is this For month after month I am fighting in a strange country After extraordinary scenes of violence and peril I come back to my own home to enjoy the er fruits of victory No sooner do I get inside my door than I have all this thrust upon me All what Father said Hyacinth innocently All this said the King with a circular movement of his hand It s too bad upon my word it is I won t have it Now mind Hyacinth I won t have it But Father how can I help it Merriwig paid no attention to her I come home he went on indignantly fresh from the er spoils of victory to what I thought was my own peaceful er home And what do I find Somebody here wants to marry somebody there and somebody else over there wants to marry somebody else over here it s impossible to mention any person s name in even the most casual way without being told they are going to get married or some nonsense of that sort I m very much upset about it Oh Father said Hyacinth penitently Won t you see the Countess yourself and talk to her To think that for weeks I have been looking forward to my return home and that now I should be met with this It has quite spoilt my day Father cried Hyacinth coming towards him with outstretched hands Let me send for her ladyship began Coronel perhaps she No no said Merriwig waving them away I am very much displeased with you both What I have to do I can do quite well by myself He strode out and slammed the door behind him Hyacinth and Coronel looked at each other blankly My dear said Coronel you never told me he was as fond of her as that But I had no idea Coronel what can we do now about it Oh I want him to marry her now He s quite right she ll make a wonderful Queen Oh my dear I feel I want everybody to be as happy as we re going to be They can t be that but we ll do our best for them I can manage Udo all right I only have to say rabbits to him and he ll do anything for me Hyacinth I don t believe I ve ever kissed you in this room yet have I Let s begin now Merriwig came upon the other pair of lovers in Belvane s garden They were sharing a seat there and Udo was assuring the Countess that he was her own little Udo Wudo and that they must never be away from each other again The King put his hand in front of his eyes for a moment as if he could hardly bear it Why it s his Majesty said Belvane jumping up She gave him a deep curtsey and threw in a bewitching smile on the top of it formality or friendliness he could take his choice Prince Udo of Araby your Majesty She looked shyly at him and added Perhaps you have heard I have said the King gloomingly How do you do he added in a melancholy voice Udo declared that he was in excellent health at present and would have gone into particulars about it had not the King interrupted Well Countess he said this is strange news to come back to Shall I disturb you if I sit down with you for little Oh your Majesty you would honour us Udo dear have you seen the heronry lately Yes said Udo It looks so sweet just about this time of the afternoon It does said Udo Belvane gave a little shrug and turned to the King I m so longing to hear all your adventures she murmured confidingly I got all your messages it was so good of you to remember me Ah said Merriwig reproachfully and what do I find when I come back I find He broke off and indicated in pantomime with his eyebrows that he could explain better what he had found if Udo were absent Udo dear said Belvane turning to him have you seen the kennels lately Yes said Udo They look rather sweet just about this time said Merriwig Don t they said Udo But I am so longing to hear said Belvane how your Majesty defeated the King of Barodia Was it your Majesty s wonderful spell which overcame the enemy You remember that Remember it Oh your Majesty Bo boll Udo dear wouldn t you like to see the armoury No said Udo There are a lot of new things in it that I brought back from Barodia said Merriwig hopefully A lot of new things explained Belvane I ll see them later on said Udo I dare say they d look better in the evening Then you shall show me your Majesty said Belvane Udo dear you can wait for me here The two of them moved off down the path together Udo taken by surprise and as soon as they were out of sight tiptoed across the lawn to another garden seat Belvane leading the way with her finger to her lips and Merriwig following with an exaggerated caution which even Henry Smallnose would have thought overdone He is a little slow isn t he that young man said the King as they sat down together I mean he didn t seem to understand He s such a devoted lover your Majesty He can t bear to be out of my sight for a moment Oh Belvane this is a sad homecoming For month after month I have been fighting and toiling and planning and plotting and then Oh Belvane we were all so happy together before the war Belvane remembered that once she and the Princess and Wiggs had been so happy together and that Udo s arrival had threatened to upset it all One way and another Udo had been a disturbing element in Euralia But it would not do to let him go just yet Aren t we still happy together she asked innocently There s her Royal Highness with her young Duke and I have my dear Udo and your Majesty has the the Lord Chancellor and all your Majesty s faithful subjects His Majesty gave a deep sigh Illustration Belvane leading the way with her finger to her lips Illustration Merriwig following with an exaggerated caution I am a very lonely man Belvane When Hyacinth leaves me I shall have nobody left Belvane decided to risk it Your Majesty should marry again she said gently He looked unutterable things at her He opened his mouth with the intention of doing his best to utter some of them when Not before Udo said Belvane softly Merriwig got up indignantly and scowled at the Prince as the latter hurried over the lawn towards them Well really said Merriwig I never knew such a place One simply can t Ah your Royal Highness have you seen our armoury I should say he corrected himself as he caught Belvane s reproachful look have we seen our armoury We have Her ladyship was much interested I have no doubt your Majesty He turned to Belvane You will be interested in our armoury at home dear She gave a quick glance at the King to see that he was looking and then patted Udo s hand tenderly Home she said lovingly how sweet it sounds The King shivered as if in pain and strode quickly from them Your Majesty sent for me said Coronel The King stopped his pacings and looked round as Coronel came into the library Ah yes yes he said quickly Now sit down there and make yourself comfortable I want to talk to you about this marriage Which one your Majesty Which one Why of course yours that is to say Belvane s or rather He came to a stop in front of Coronel and looked at him earnestly Well in a way both Coronel nodded You want to marry my daughter Merriwig went on Now it is customary as you know that to the person to whom I give my daughter I give also half my kingdom Naturally before I make this sacrifice I wish to be sure that the man to whom well of course you understand That he is worthy of the Princess Hyacinth said Coronel Of course he couldn t be he added with a smile And worthy of half the kingdom amended Merriwig That he should prove himself this is also I think customary Anything that your Majesty suggests I am sure of it He drew up a chair next to Coronel s and sitting down in it placed his hand upon his knees and explained the nature of the trial which was awaiting the successful suitor In the ordinary way he began I should arrange something for you with a dragon or what not in it The knowledge that some such ordeal lies before him often enables a suitor to discover before it is too late that what he thought was true love is not really the genuine emotion In your case I feel that an ordeal of this sort is not necessary Coronel inclined his head gracefully I do not doubt your valour and from you therefore I ask a proof of your cunning In these days cunning is perhaps the quality of all others demanded of a ruler We had an excellent example of that he went on carelessly in the war with Barodia that is just over where the whole conflict was settled by a little idea which A very wonderful idea your Majesty Well well said Merriwig looking very pleased It just happened to come off that s all But that is what I mean when I say that cunning may be of even more importance than valour In order to win the hand of my daughter and half my kingdom it will be necessary for you to show a cunning almost more than human He paused and Coronel did his best in the interval to summon up a look of superhuman guile into his very frank and pleasant countenance You will prove yourself worthy of what you ask me for said Merriwig solemnly by persuading Prince Udo to return to Araby alone Coronel gasped The thing was so easy that it seemed almost a shame to accept it as the condition of his marriage To persuade Udo to do what he was only longing to do did not call for any superhuman qualities of any kind For a moment he had an impulse to tell the King so but he suppressed it After all he thought if the King wants cunning and if I make a great business of doing something absurdly easy then he is getting it Merriwig simple man mistook his emotions I see he said that you are appalled by the difficulty of the ordeal in front of you You may well be so You have known his Royal Highness longer than I have but even in our short acquaintance I have discovered that he takes a hint with extraordinary slowness To bring it home to him with the right mixture of tact and insistence that Araby needs his immediate presence alone may well tax the most serpentine of minds I can but try it said the serpentine one simply The King jumped up and shook him warmly by the hand You think you can do it he said excitedly If Prince Udo does not start back to Araby to morrow Alone said Merriwig Alone then I shall have failed in my task My dear said the King to his daughter as she kissed him good night that evening I believe you are going to marry a very wise young man Of course I am Father I only hope you ll be as happy with him as I shall be with as I was with your mother Though how he s going to bring it off he added to himself is more than I can think CHAPTER XXII THE SEVENTEEN VOLUMES GO BACK AGAIN King Merriwig of Eastern Euralia sat at breakfast on his castle walls He lifted the gold cover from the gold dish in front of him selected a trout and conveyed it carefully to his gold plate When you have an aunt But I need not say that again King Coronel of Western Euralia sat at breakfast on his castle walls He lifted the gold cover from the gold dish in front of him selected a trout and conveyed it carefully to his gold plate When your wife s father has an aunt Prince Udo of Araby sat at breakfast But one must draw the line somewhere I refuse to follow Udo through any more meals Indeed I think there has been quite enough eating and drinking in this book already Quite enough of everything in fact but the time has nearly come to say good bye Let us speed the Prince of Araby first His departure from Euralia was sudden five minutes conversation with Coronel convinced him that there had been a mistake about Belvane s feelings for him and that he could leave for Araby in perfect safety You must come and see us again said Merriwig heartily as he shook him by the hand Yes do said Hyacinth There are two ways of saying this sort of thing and theirs was the second way So was Udo s when he answered that he would be delighted It was just a week later that the famous double wedding was celebrated in Euralia As an occasion for speech making by King Merriwig and largesse throwing by Queen Belvane it demanded and got a whole chapter to itself in Roger s History I have Roger on my side at last The virtues he denied to the Countess he cannot but allow to the Queen Nor could Hyacinth resist her any longer Belvane upon her palfrey laughter in her eyes and roses in her cheeks her lips slightly parted with eagerness as she flings her silver to the crowd adorably conscious of her childishness and yet glorifying in it could have no enemies that day She is a dear said Hyacinth to Coronel She will make a wonderful Queen I know a Queen worth two of her said Coronel But you do admire her don t you Not particularly Oh Coronel you must said Hyacinth but she felt very happy all the same They rode off the next day to their kingdom The Chancellor had had an exciting week for seven successive evenings he had been extremely mysterious and reserved to his wife but now his business was finished and King Merriwig reigned over Eastern Euralia and King Coronel over the West Let us just take a look at Belvane s diary before we move on to the last scene Thursday September fifteenth it says Became good Now for the last scene King Merriwig sat in Belvane s garden They had spent the morning revising their joint book of poetry for publication The first set of verses was entirely Merriwig s own It went like this Bo boll bill bole Wo woll will wole A note by the authors called attention to the fact that it could be begun from either end The rest of the poems were mainly by Belvane Merriwig s share in them consisting of a Capital or an I like that when they were read out to him but an epic commonly attributed to Charlotte Patacake had crept in somehow A person to see your Majesty said a flunkey appearing suddenly What sort of person asked Merriwig A sort of person your Majesty See him here dear said Belvane as she got up I have things to do in the Palace She left him and by and by the flunkey returned with the stranger He was a pleasant looking person with a round clean shaven face something in the agricultural way to judge from his clothes Well said Merriwig I desire to be your Majesty s swineherd said the other What do you know of swineherding I have a sort of natural aptitude for it your Majesty although I have never actually been one My own case exactly Now then let me see how would you The stranger took out a large red handkerchief and wiped his forehead You propose to ask me a few questions your Majesty Well naturally I Let me beg of you not to By all you hold sacred let me implore you not to confuse me with questions He drew himself up and thumped his chest with his fist I have a feeling for swineherding it is enough Merriwig began to like the man it was just how he felt about the thing himself I once carried on a long technical conversation with a swineherd he said reminiscently and we found we had much in common It is an inspiring life It was in just that way said the stranger that I discovered my own natural bent towards it How very odd Do you know there s something about your face that I seem to recognise The stranger decided to be frank I owe this face to you he said simply Merriwig looked startled In short said the other I am the late King of Barodia Merriwig gripped his hand Illustration He was a pleasant looking person with a round clean shaven face My dear fellow he said My very dear fellow of course you are Dear me how it brings it all back And may I say what an improvement Really I m delighted to see you You must tell me all about it But first some refreshment At the word refreshment the late King of Barodia broke down altogether and it was only Merriwig s hummings and hawings and thumpings on the back and later on the refreshment itself which kept him from bursting into tears My dear friend he said as he wiped his mouth for the last time you have saved me But what does it all mean asked Merriwig in bewilderment Listen and I will tell you He told himself of the great resolution to which he had come on that famous morning when he awoke to find himself whiskerless Barodia had no more use for him now as a King and he on his side was eager to carve out for himself a new life as a swineherd I had a natural gift he said plaintively an instinctive feeling for it I know I had Whatever they said about it afterwards and they said many hard things I was certain that I had that feeling I had proved it you know there couldn t be any mistake Well Ah but they laughed at me They asked me confusing questions niggling little questions about the things swine ate and and things like that The great principles of swineherding the what I may call the art of herding swine the whole theory of shepherding pigs in a broad minded way all this they ignored They laughed at me and turned me out with jeers and blows to starve Merriwig patted him sympathetically and pressed some more food on him I ranged over the whole of Barodia Nobody would take me in It is a terrible thing my dear Merriwig to begin to lose faith in yourself I had to tell myself at last that perhaps there was something about Barodian swine which made them different from those of any other country As a last hope I came to Euralia if here too I was spurned then I should know that Just a moment said Merriwig breaking in eagerly Who was this swineherd that you talked to I talked to so many said the other sadly They all scoffed at me No but the first one the one that showed you that you had a bent towards it Didn t you say that Oh that one That was at the beginning of our war Do you remember telling me that your swineherd had an invisible cloak It was he that Merriwig looked at him sadly and shook his head My poor friend he said it was me They gazed at each other earnestly Each of them was going over in his mind the exact details of that famous meeting Yes they murmured together it was us The King of Barodia s mind raced on through all the bitter months that had followed he shivered as he thought of the things he had said the things that had been said to him seemed of small account now Not even a swineherd he remarked Come come said Merriwig look on the bright side you can always be a King again The late King of Barodia shook his head It s a come down to a man with any pride he said No I ll stick to my own job After all I ve been learning these last weeks at any rate I know that what I do know isn t worth knowing and that s something Then stay with me said Merriwig heartily My swineherd will teach you your work and when he retires you can take it on Do you mean it Of course I do I shall be glad to have you about the place In the evening when the pigs are asleep you can come in and have a chat with us Bless you said the new apprentice bless you your Majesty They shook hands on it My dear said Merriwig to Belvane that evening you haven t married a very clever fellow I discovered this afternoon that I m not even as clever as I thought I was You don t want cleverness in a King said Belvane smiling lovingly at him or in a husband What do you want then Just dearness said Belvane And now my story is done With a sigh I unload the seventeen volumes of Euralian History from my desk carrying them one by one across the library and placing them carefully in the shelf which has been built for them For some months they have stood a rampart between me and the world behind which I have lived in far off days with Merriwig and Hyacinth and my Lady Belvane The rampart is gone and in the bright light of to day which streams on to my desk the vision slowly fades Once on a time Yet I see one figure clearly still He is tall and thin with a white peaked face of which the long inquisitive nose is the outstanding feature His hair is lank and uncared for his russet smock tied in at the waist wants brushing his untidy cross gartered hose shows up the meagerness of his legs No knightly figure this yet I look upon him very tenderly For it is Roger Scurvilegs on his way to the Palace for news To Roger too I must say good bye I say it not without remorse for I feel that I have been hard upon the man to whom I owe so much Perhaps it will not be altogether good bye in his seventeen volumes there are many other tales to be found Next time if there be a next time I owe it to Roger to stand aside and let him tell the story more in his own way I think he would like that But it shall not be a story about Belvane I saw Belvane or some one like her at a country house in Shropshire last summer and I know that Roger can never do her justice Illustration Roger Scurvilegs End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Once on a Time by A A Milne END
