AFTERWORD THE SMOKY GOD OR A VOYAGE TO THE INNER WORLD He is the God who sits in the center on the navel of the earth and he is the interpreter of religion to all mankind PLATO PART ONE AUTHOR S FOREWORD I FEAR the seemingly incredible story which I am about to relate will be regarded as the result of a distorted intellect superinduced possibly by the glamour of unveiling a marvelous mystery rather than a truthful record of the unparalleled experiences related by one Olaf Jansen whose eloquent madness so appealed to my imagination that all thought of an analytical criticism has been effectually dispelled Marco Polo will doubtless shift uneasily in his grave at the strange story I am called upon to chronicle a story as strange as a Munchausen tale It is also incongruous that I a disbeliever should be the one to edit the story of Olaf Jansen whose name is now for the first time given to the world yet who must hereafter rank as one of the notables of earth I freely confess his statements admit of no rational analysis but have to do with the profound mystery concerning the frozen North that for centuries has claimed the attention of scientists and laymen alike However much they are at variance with the cosmographical manuscripts of the past these plain statements may be relied upon as a record of the things Olaf Jansen claims to have seen with his own eyes A hundred times I have asked myself whether it is possible that the world s geography is incomplete and that the startling narrative of Olaf Jansen is predicated upon demonstrable facts The reader may be able to answer these queries to his own satisfaction however far the chronicler of this narrative may be from having reached a conviction Yet sometimes even I am at a loss to know whether I have been led away from an abstract truth by the ignes fatui of a clever superstition or whether heretofore accepted facts are after all founded upon falsity It may be that the true home of Apollo was not at Delphi but in that older earth center of which Plato speaks where he says Apollo s real home is among the Hyperboreans in a land of perpetual life where mythology tells us two doves flying from the two opposite ends of the world met in this fair region the home of Apollo Indeed according to Hecataeus Leto the mother of Apollo was born on an island in the Arctic Ocean far beyond the North Wind It is not my intention to attempt a discussion of the theogony of the deities nor the cosmogony of the world My simple duty is to enlighten the world concerning a heretofore unknown portion of the universe as it was seen and described by the old Norseman Olaf Jansen Interest in northern research is international Eleven nations are engaged in or have contributed to the perilous work of trying to solve Earth s one remaining cosmological mystery There is a saying ancient as the hills that truth is stranger than fiction and in a most startling manner has this axiom been brought home to me within the last fortnight It was just two o clock in the morning when I was aroused from a restful sleep by the vigorous ringing of my door bell The untimely disturber proved to be a messenger bearing a note scrawled almost to the point of illegibility from an old Norseman by the name of Olaf Jansen After much deciphering I made out the writing which simply said Am ill unto death Come The call was imperative and I lost no time in making ready to comply Perhaps I may as well explain here that Olaf Jansen a man who quite recently celebrated his ninety fifth birthday has for the last half dozen years been living alone in an unpretentious bungalow out Glendale way a short distance from the business district of Los Angeles California It was less than two years ago while out walking one afternoon that I was attracted by Olaf Jansen s house and its homelike surroundings toward its owner and occupant whom I afterward came to know as a believer in the ancient worship of Odin and Thor There was a gentleness in his face and a kindly expression in the keenly alert gray eyes of this man who had lived more than four score years and ten and withal a sense of loneliness that appealed to my sympathy Slightly stooped and with his hands clasped behind him he walked back and forth with slow and measured tread that day when first we met I can hardly say what particular motive impelled me to pause in my walk and engage him in conversation He seemed pleased when I complimented him on the attractiveness of his bungalow and on the well tended vines and flowers clustering in profusion over its windows roof and wide piazza I soon discovered that my new acquaintance was no ordinary person but one profound and learned to a remarkable degree a man who in the later years of his long life had dug deeply into books and become strong in the power of meditative silence I encouraged him to talk and soon gathered that he had resided only six or seven years in Southern California but had passed the dozen years prior in one of the middle Eastern states Before that he had been a fisherman off the coast of Norway in the region of the Lofoden Islands from whence he had made trips still farther north to Spitzbergen and even to Franz Josef Land When I started to take my leave he seemed reluctant to have me go and asked me to come again Although at the time I thought nothing of it I remember now that he made a peculiar remark as I extended my hand in leave taking You will come again he asked Yes you will come again some day I am sure you will and I shall show you my library and tell you many things of which you have never dreamed things so wonderful that it may be you will not believe me I laughingly assured him that I would not only come again but would be ready to believe whatever he might choose to tell me of his travels and adventures In the days that followed I became well acquainted with Olaf Jansen and little by little he told me his story so marvelous that its very daring challenges reason and belief The old Norseman always expressed himself with so much earnestness and sincerity that I became enthralled by his strange narrations Then came the messenger s call that night and within the hour I was at Olaf Jansen s bungalow He was very impatient at the long wait although after being summoned I had come immediately to his bedside I must hasten he exclaimed while yet he held my hand in greeting I have much to tell you that you know not and I will trust no one but you I fully realize he went on hurriedly that I shall not survive the night The time has come to join my fathers in the great sleep I adjusted the pillows to make him more comfortable and assured him I was glad to be able to serve him in any way possible for I was beginning to realize the seriousness of his condition The lateness of the hour the stillness of the surroundings the uncanny feeling of being alone with the dying man together with his weird story all combined to make my heart beat fast and loud with a feeling for which I have no name Indeed there were many times that night by the old Norseman s couch and there have been many times since when a sensation rather than a conviction took possession of my very soul and I seemed not only to believe in but actually see the strange lands the strange people and the strange world of which he told and to hear the mighty orchestral chorus of a thousand lusty voices For over two hours he seemed endowed with almost superhuman strength talking rapidly and to all appearances rationally Finally he gave into my hands certain data drawings and crude maps These said he in conclusion I leave in your hands If I can have your promise to give them to the world I shall die happy because I desire that people may know the truth for then all mystery concerning the frozen Northland will be explained There is no chance of your suffering the fate I suffered They will not put you in irons nor confine you in a mad house because you are not telling your own story but mine and I thanks to the gods Odin and Thor will be in my grave and so beyond the reach of disbelievers who would persecute Without a thought of the farreaching results the promise entailed or foreseeing the many sleepless nights which the obligation has since brought me I gave my hand and with it a pledge to discharge faithfully his dying wish As the sun rose over the peaks of the San Jacinto far to the eastward the spirit of Olaf Jansen the navigator the explorer and worshiper of Odin and Thor the man whose experiences and travels as related are without a parallel in all the world s history passed away and I was left alone with the dead And now after having paid the last sad rites to this strange man from the Lofoden Islands and the still farther Northward Ho the courageous explorer of frozen regions who in his declining years after he had passed the four score mark had sought an asylum of restful peace in sun favored California I will undertake to make public his story But first of all let me indulge in one or two reflections Generation follows generation and the traditions from the misty past are handed down from sire to son but for some strange reason interest in the ice locked unknown does not abate with the receding years either in the minds of the ignorant or the tutored With each new generation a restless impulse stirs the hearts of men to capture the veiled citadel of the Arctic the circle of silence the land of glaciers cold wastes of waters and winds that are strangely warm Increasing interest is manifested in the mountainous icebergs and marvelous speculations are indulged in concerning the earth s center of gravity the cradle of the tides where the whales have their nurseries where the magnetic needle goes mad where the Aurora Borealis illumines the night and where brave and courageous spirits of every generation dare to venture and explore defying the dangers of the Farthest North One of the ablest works of recent years is Paradise Found or the Cradle of The Human Race at the North Pole by William F Warren In his carefully prepared volume mister Warren almost stubbed his toe against the real truth but missed it seemingly by only a hair s breadth if the old Norseman s revelation be true doctor Orville Livingston Leech scientist in a recent article says The possibilities of a land inside the earth were first brought to my attention when I picked up a geode on the shores of the Great Lakes The geode is a spherical and apparently solid stone but when broken is found to be hollow and coated with crystals The earth is only a larger form of a geode and the law that created the geode in its hollow form undoubtedly fashioned the earth in the same way In presenting the theme of this almost incredible story as told by Olaf Jansen and supplemented by manuscript maps and crude drawings entrusted to me a fitting introduction is found in the following quotation In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth and the earth was without form and void And also God created man in his own image Therefore even in things material man must be God like because he is created in the likeness of the Father A man builds a house for himself and family The porches or verandas are all without and are secondary The building is really constructed for the conveniences within Olaf Jansen makes the startling announcement through me an humble instrument that in like manner God created the earth for the within that is to say for its lands seas rivers mountains forests and valleys and for its other internal conveniences while the outside surface of the earth is merely the veranda the porch where things grow by comparison but sparsely like the lichen on the mountain side clinging determinedly for bare existence Take an egg shell and from each end break out a piece as large as the end of this pencil Extract its contents and then you will have a perfect representation of Olaf Jansen s earth The distance from the inside surface to the outside surface according to him is about three hundred miles The center of gravity is not in the center of the earth but in the center of the shell or crust therefore if the thickness of the earth s crust or shell is three hundred miles the center of gravity is one hundred and fifty miles below the surface In their log books Arctic explorers tell us of the dipping of the needle as the vessel sails in regions of the farthest north known In reality they are at the curve on the edge of the shell where gravity is geometrically increased and while the electric current seemingly dashes off into space toward the phantom idea of the North Pole yet this same electric current drops again and continues its course southward along the inside surface of the earth s crust In the appendix to his work Captain Sabine gives an account of experiments to determine the acceleration of the pendulum in different latitudes This appears to have resulted from the joint labor of Peary and Sabine He says The accidental discovery that a pendulum on being removed from Paris to the neighborhood of the equator increased its time of vibration gave the first step to our present knowledge that the polar axis of the globe is less than the equatorial that the force of gravity at the surface of the earth increases progressively from the equator toward the poles According to Olaf Jansen in the beginning this old world of ours was created solely for the within world where are located the four great rivers the Euphrates the Pison the Gihon and the Hiddekel These same names of rivers when applied to streams on the outside surface of the earth are purely traditional from an antiquity beyond the memory of man On the top of a high mountain near the fountain head of these four rivers Olaf Jansen the Norseman claims to have discovered the long lost Garden of Eden the veritable navel of the earth and to have spent over two years studying and reconnoitering in this marvelous within land exuberant with stupendous plant life and abounding in giant animals a land where the people live to be centuries old after the order of Methuselah and other Biblical characters a region where one quarter of the inner surface is water and three quarters land where there are large oceans and many rivers and lakes where the cities are superlative in construction and magnificence where modes of transportation are as far in advance of ours as we with our boasted achievements are in advance of the inhabitants of darkest Africa The distance directly across the space from inner surface to inner surface is about six hundred miles less than the recognized diameter of the earth In the identical center of this vast vacuum is the seat of electricity a mammoth ball of dull red fire not startlingly brilliant but surrounded by a white mild luminous cloud giving out uniform warmth and held in its place in the center of this internal space by the immutable law of gravitation This electrical cloud is known to the people within as the abode of The Smoky God They believe it to be the throne of The Most High Olaf Jansen reminded me of how in the old college days we were all familiar with the laboratory demonstrations of centrifugal motion which clearly proved that if the earth were a solid the rapidity of its revolution upon its axis would tear it into a thousand fragments The old Norseman also maintained that from the farthest points of land on the islands of Spitzbergen and Franz Josef Land flocks of geese may be seen annually flying still farther northward just as the sailors and explorers record in their log books No scientist has yet been audacious enough to attempt to explain even to his own satisfaction toward what lands these winged fowls are guided by their subtle instinct However Olaf Jansen has given us a most reasonable explanation The presence of the open sea in the Northland is also explained Olaf Jansen claims that the northern aperture intake or hole so to speak is about fourteen hundred miles across In connection with this let us read what Explorer Nansen writes on page two hundred eighty eight of his book I have never had such a splendid sail On to the north steadily north with a good wind as fast as steam and sail can take us an open sea mile after mile watch after watch through these unknown regions always clearer and clearer of ice one might almost say How long will it last The eye always turns to the northward as one paces the bridge It is gazing into the future But there is always the same dark sky ahead which means open sea Again the Norwood Review of England in its issue of May ten eighteen eighty four says We do not admit that there is ice up to the Pole once inside the great ice barrier a new world breaks upon the explorer the climate is mild like that of England and afterward balmy as the Greek Isles Some of the rivers within Olaf Jansen claims are larger than our Mississippi and Amazon rivers combined in point of volume of water carried indeed their greatness is occasioned by their width and depth rather than their length and it is at the mouths of these mighty rivers as they flow northward and southward along the inside surface of the earth that mammoth icebergs are found some of them fifteen and twenty miles wide and from forty to one hundred miles in length Is it not strange that there has never been an iceberg encountered either in the Arctic or Antarctic Ocean that is not composed of fresh water Modern scientists claim that freezing eliminates the salt but Olaf Jansen claims differently Ancient Hindoo Japanese and Chinese writings as well as the hieroglyphics of the extinct races of the North American continent all speak of the custom of sun worshiping and it is possible in the startling light of Olaf Jansen s revelations that the people of the inner world lured away by glimpses of the sun as it shone upon the inner surface of the earth either from the northern or the southern opening became dissatisfied with The Smoky God the great pillar or mother cloud of electricity and weary of their continuously mild and pleasant atmosphere followed the brighter light and were finally led beyond the ice belt and scattered over the outer surface of the earth through Asia Europe North America and later Africa Australia and South America one one The following quotation is significant It follows that man issuing from a mother region still undetermined but which a number of considerations indicate to have been in the North has radiated in several directions that his migrations have been constantly from North to South M le Marquis G de Saporta in Popular Science Monthly October eighteen eighty three page seven hundred fifty three It is a notable fact that as we approach the Equator the stature of the human race grows less But the Patagonians of South America are probably the only aborigines from the center of the earth who came out through the aperture usually designated as the South Pole and they are called the giant race Olaf Jansen avers that in the beginning the world was created by the Great Architect of the Universe so that man might dwell upon its inside surface which has ever since been the habitation of the chosen They who were driven out of the Garden of Eden brought their traditional history with them The history of the people living within contains a narrative suggesting the story of Noah and the ark with which we are familiar He sailed away as did Columbus from a certain port to a strange land he had heard of far to the northward carrying with him all manner of beasts of the fields and fowls of the air but was never heard of afterward On the northern boundaries of Alaska and still more frequently on the Siberian coast are found boneyards containing tusks of ivory in quantities so great as to suggest the burying places of antiquity From Olaf Jansen s account they have come from the great prolific animal life that abounds in the fields and forests and on the banks of numerous rivers of the Inner World The materials were caught in the ocean currents or were carried on ice floes and have accumulated like driftwood on the Siberian coast This has been going on for ages and hence these mysterious bone yards On this subject William F Warren in his book already cited pages two hundred ninety seven and two hundred ninety eight says The Arctic rocks tell of a lost Atlantis more wonderful than Plato s The fossil ivory beds of Siberia excel everything of the kind in the world From the days of Pliny at least they have constantly been undergoing exploitation and still they are the chief headquarters of supply The remains of mammoths are so abundant that as Gratacap says the northern islands of Siberia seem built up of crowded bones Another scientific writer speaking of the islands of New Siberia northward of the mouth of the River Lena uses this language Large quantities of ivory are dug out of the ground every year Indeed some of the islands are believed to be nothing but an accumulation of drift timber and the bodies of mammoths and other antediluvian animals frozen together From this we may infer that during the years that have elapsed since the Russian conquest of Siberia useful tusks from more than twenty thousand mammoths have been collected But now for the story of Olaf Jansen I give it in detail as set down by himself in manuscript and woven into the tale just as he placed them are certain quotations from recent works on Arctic exploration showing how carefully the old Norseman compared with his own experiences those of other voyagers to the frozen North Thus wrote the disciple of Odin and Thor PART TWO OLAF JANSEN S STORY MY name is Olaf Jansen I am a Norwegian although I was born in the little seafaring Russian town of Uleaborg on the eastern coast of the Gulf of Bothnia the northern arm of the Baltic Sea My parents were on a fishing cruise in the Gulf of Bothnia and put into this Russian town of Uleaborg at the time of my birth being the twenty seventh day of October eighteen eleven My father Jens Jansen was born at Rodwig on the Scandinavian coast near the Lofoden Islands but after marrying made his home at Stockholm because my mother s people resided in that city When seven years old I began going with my father on his fishing trips along the Scandinavian coast Early in life I displayed an aptitude for books and at the age of nine years was placed in a private school in Stockholm remaining there until I was fourteen After this I made regular trips with my father on all his fishing voyages My father was a man fully six feet three in height and weighed over fifteen stone a typical Norseman of the most rugged sort and capable of more endurance than any other man I have ever known He possessed the gentleness of a woman in tender little ways yet his determination and will power were beyond description His will admitted of no defeat I was in my nineteenth year when we started on what proved to be our last trip as fishermen and which resulted in the strange story that shall be given to the world but not until I have finished my earthly pilgrimage I dare not allow the facts as I know them to be published while I am living for fear of further humiliation confinement and suffering First of all I was put in irons by the captain of the whaling vessel that rescued me for no other reason than that I told the truth about the marvelous discoveries made by my father and myself But this was far from being the end of my tortures After four years and eight months absence I reached Stockholm only to find my mother had died the previous year and the property left by my parents in the possession of my mother s people but it was at once made over to me All might have been well had I erased from my memory the story of our adventure and of my father s terrible death Finally one day I told the story in detail to my uncle Gustaf Osterlind a man of considerable property and urged him to fit out an expedition for me to make another voyage to the strange land At first I thought he favored my project He seemed interested and invited me to go before certain officials and explain to them as I had to him the story of our travels and discoveries Imagine my disappointment and horror when upon the conclusion of my narrative certain papers were signed by my uncle and without warning I found myself arrested and hurried away to dismal and fearful confinement in a madhouse where I remained for twenty eight years long tedious frightful years of suffering I never ceased to assert my sanity and to protest against the injustice of my confinement Finally on the seventeenth of October eighteen sixty two I was released My uncle was dead and the friends of my youth were now strangers Indeed a man over fifty years old whose only known record is that of a madman has no friends I was at a loss to know what to do for a living but instinctively turned toward the harbor where fishing boats in great numbers were anchored and within a week I had shipped with a fisherman by the name of Yan Hansen who was starting on a long fishing cruise to the Lofoden Islands Here my earlier years of training proved of the very greatest advantage especially in enabling me to make myself useful This was but the beginning of other trips and by frugal economy I was in a few years able to own a fishing brig of my own For twenty seven years thereafter I followed the sea as a fisherman five years working for others and the last twenty two for myself During all these years I was a most diligent student of books as well as a hard worker at my business but I took great care not to mention to anyone the story concerning the discoveries made by my father and myself Even at this late day I would be fearful of having any one see or know the things I am writing and the records and maps I have in my keeping When my days on earth are finished I shall leave maps and records that will enlighten and I hope benefit mankind The memory of my long confinement with maniacs and all the horrible anguish and sufferings are too vivid to warrant my taking further chances In eighteen eighty nine I sold out my fishing boats and found I had accumulated a fortune quite sufficient to keep me the remainder of my life I then came to America For a dozen years my home was in Illinois near Batavia where I gathered most of the books in my present library though I brought many choice volumes from Stockholm Later I came to Los Angeles arriving here March four nineteen oh one The date I well remember as it was President McKinley s second inauguration day I bought this humble home and determined here in the privacy of my own abode sheltered by my own vine and fig tree and with my books about me to make maps and drawings of the new lands we had discovered and also to write the story in detail from the time my father and I left Stockholm until the tragic event that parted us in the Antarctic Ocean I well remember that we left Stockholm in our fishing sloop on the third day of April eighteen twenty nine and sailed to the southward leaving Gothland Island to the left and Oeland Island to the right A few days later we succeeded in doubling Sandhommar Point and made our way through the sound which separates Denmark from the Scandinavian coast In due time we put in at the town of Christiansand where we rested two days and then started around the Scandinavian coast to the westward bound for the Lofoden Islands My father was in high spirit because of the excellent and gratifying returns he had received from our last catch by marketing at Stockholm instead of selling at one of the seafaring towns along the Scandinavian coast He was especially pleased with the sale of some ivory tusks that he had found on the west coast of Franz Joseph Land during one of his northern cruises the previous year and he expressed the hope that this time we might again be fortunate enough to load our little fishing sloop with ivory instead of cod herring mackerel and salmon We put in at Hammerfest latitude seventy one degrees and forty minutes for a few days rest Here we remained one week laying in an extra supply of provisions and several casks of drinking water and then sailed toward Spitzbergen For the first few days we had an open sea and a favoring wind and then we encountered much ice and many icebergs A vessel larger than our little fishing sloop could not possibly have threaded its way among the labyrinth of icebergs or squeezed through the barely open channels These monster bergs presented an endless succession of crystal palaces of massive cathedrals and fantastic mountain ranges grim and sentinel like immovable as some towering cliff of solid rock standing silent as a sphinx resisting the restless waves of a fretful sea After many narrow escapes we arrived at Spitzbergen on the twenty threed of June and anchored at Wijade Bay for a short time where we were quite successful in our catches We then lifted anchor and sailed through the Hinlopen Strait and coasted along the North East Land two two It will be remembered that Andree started on his fatal balloon voyage from the northwest coast of Spitzbergen A strong wind came up from the southwest and my father said that we had better take advantage of it and try to reach Franz Josef Land where the year before he had by accident found the ivory tusks that had brought him such a good price at Stockholm Never before or since have I seen so many sea fowl they were so numerous that they hid the rocks on the coast line and darkened the sky For several days we sailed along the rocky coast of Franz Josef Land Finally a favoring wind came up that enabled us to make the West Coast and after sailing twenty four hours we came to a beautiful inlet One could hardly believe it was the far Northland The place was green with growing vegetation and while the area did not comprise more than one or two acres yet the air was warm and tranquil It seemed to be at that point where the Gulf Stream s influence is most keenly felt three three Sir John Barrow Bart F R S in his work entitled Voyages of Discovery and Research Within the Arctic Regions says on page fifty seven mister Beechey refers to what has frequently been found and noticed the mildness of the temperature on the western coast of Spitzbergen there being little or no sensation of cold though the thermometer might be only a few degrees above the freezing point The brilliant and lively effect of a clear day when the sun shines forth with a pure sky whose azure hue is so intense as to find no parallel even in the boasted Italian sky On the east coast there were numerous icebergs yet here we were in open water Far to the west of us however were icepacks and still farther to the westward the ice appeared like ranges of low hills In front of us and directly to the north lay an open sea four four Captain Kane on page two hundred ninety nine quoting from Morton s Journal on Monday the twenty sixth of December says As far as I could see the open passages were fifteen miles or more wide with sometimes mashed ice separating them But it is all small ice and I think it either drives out to the open space to the north or rots and sinks as I could see none ahead to the north My father was an ardent believer in Odin and Thor and had frequently told me they were gods who came from far beyond the North Wind There was a tradition my father explained that still farther northward was a land more beautiful than any that mortal man had ever known and that it was inhabited by the Chosen five five We find the following in Deutsche Mythologie page seven hundred seventy eight from the pen of Jakob Grimm Then the sons of Bor built in the middle of the universe the city called Asgard where dwell the gods and their kindred and from that abode work out so many wondrous things both on the earth and in the heavens above it There is in that city a place called Illidskjalf and when Odin is seated there upon his lofty throne he sees over the whole world and discerns all the actions of men My youthful imagination was fired by the ardor zeal and religious fervor of my good father and I exclaimed Why not sail to this goodly land The sky is fair the wind favorable and the sea open Even now I can see the expression of pleasurable surprise on his countenance as he turned toward me and asked My son are you willing to go with me and explore to go far beyond where man has ever ventured I answered affirmatively Very well he replied May the god Odin protect us and quickly adjusting the sails he glanced at our compass turned the prow in due northerly direction through an open channel and our voyage had begun six six Hall writes on page two hundred eighty eight On the twenty third of January the two Esquimaux accompanied by two of the seamen went to Cape Lupton They reported a sea of open water extending as far as the eye could reach The sun was low in the horizon as it was still the early summer Indeed we had almost four months of day ahead of us before the frozen night could come on again Our little fishing sloop sprang forward as if eager as ourselves for adventure Within thirty six hours we were out of sight of the highest point on the coast line of Franz Josef Land We seemed to be in a strong current running north by northeast Far to the right and to the left of us were icebergs but our little sloop bore down on the narrows and passed through channels and out into open seas channels so narrow in places that had our craft been other than small we never could have gotten through On the third day we came to an island Its shores were washed by an open sea My father determined to land and explore for a day This new land was destitute of timber but we found a large accumulation of drift wood on the northern shore Some of the trunks of the trees were forty feet long and two feet in diameter seven seven Greely tells us in vol one page one hundred that Privates Connell and Frederick found a large coniferous tree on the beach just above the extreme high water mark It was nearly thirty inches in circumference some thirty feet long and had apparently been carried to that point by a current within a couple of years A portion of it was cut up for fire wood and for the first time in that valley a bright cheery camp fire gave comfort to man After one day s exploration of the coast line of this island we lifted anchor and turned our prow to the north in an open sea eight eight doctor Kane says on page three hundred seventy nine of his works I cannot imagine what becomes of the ice A strong current sets in constantly to the north but from altitudes of more than five hundred feet I saw only narrow strips of ice with great spaces of open water from ten to fifteen miles in breadth between them It must therefore either go to an open space in the north or dissolve I remember that neither my father nor myself had tasted food for almost thirty hours Perhaps this was because of the tension of excitement about our strange voyage in waters farther north my father said than anyone had ever before been Active mentality had dulled the demands of the physical needs Instead of the cold being intense as we had anticipated it was really warmer and more pleasant than it had been while in Hammerfest on the north coast of Norway some six weeks before nine nine Captain Peary s second voyage relates another circumstance which may serve to confirm a conjecture which has long been maintained by some that an open sea free of ice exists at or near the Pole On the second of November says Peary the wind freshened up to a gale from north by west lowered the thermometer before midnight to five degrees whereas a rise of wind at Melville Island was generally accompanied by a simultaneous rise in the thermometer at low temperatures May not this he asks be occasioned by the wind blowing over an open sea in the quarter from which the wind blows And tend to confirm the opinion that at or near the Pole an open sea exists We both frankly admitted that we were very hungry and forthwith I prepared a substantial meal from our well stored larder When we had partaken heartily of the repast I told my father I believed I would sleep as I was beginning to feel quite drowsy Very well he replied I will keep the watch I have no way to determine how long I slept I only know that I was rudely awakened by a terrible commotion of the sloop To my surprise I found my father sleeping soundly I cried out lustily to him and starting up he sprang quickly to his feet Indeed had he not instantly clutched the rail he would certainly have been thrown into the seething waves A fierce snow storm was raging The wind was directly astern driving our sloop at a terrific speed and was threatening every moment to capsize us There was no time to lose the sails had to be lowered immediately Our boat was writhing in convulsions A few icebergs we knew were on either side of us but fortunately the channel was open directly to the north But would it remain so In front of us girding the horizon from left to right was a vaporish fog or mist black as Egyptian night at the water s edge and white like a steam cloud toward the top which was finally lost to view as it blended with the great white flakes of falling snow Whether it covered a treacherous iceberg or some other hidden obstacle against which our little sloop would dash and send us to a watery grave or was merely the phenomenon of an Arctic fog there was no way to determine ten ten On page two hundred eighty four of his works Hall writes From the top of Providence Berg a dark fog was seen to the north indicating water At ten a m three of the men Kruger Nindemann and Hobby went to Cape Lupton to ascertain if possible the extent of the open water On their return they reported several open spaces and much young ice not more than a day old so thin that it was easily broken by throwing pieces of ice upon it By what miracle we escaped being dashed to utter destruction I do not know I remember our little craft creaked and groaned as if its joints were breaking It rocked and staggered to and fro as if clutched by some fierce undertow of whirlpool or maelstrom Fortunately our compass had been fastened with long screws to a crossbeam Most of our provisions however were tumbled out and swept away from the deck of the cuddy and had we not taken the precaution at the very beginning to tie ourselves firmly to the masts of the sloop we should have been swept into the lashing sea Above the deafening tumult of the raging waves I heard my father s voice Be courageous my son he shouted Odin is the god of the waters the companion of the brave and he is with us Fear not To me it seemed there was no possibility of our escaping a horrible death The little sloop was shipping water the snow was falling so fast as to be blinding and the waves were tumbling over our counters in reckless white sprayed fury There was no telling what instant we should be dashed against some drifting ice pack The tremendous swells would heave us up to the very peaks of mountainous waves then plunge us down into the depths of the sea s trough as if our fishing sloop were a fragile shell Gigantic white capped waves like veritable walls fenced us in fore and aft This terrible nerve racking ordeal with its nameless horrors of suspense and agony of fear indescribable continued for more than three hours and all the time we were being driven forward at fierce speed Then suddenly as if growing weary of its frantic exertions the wind began to lessen its fury and by degrees to die down At last we were in a perfect calm The fog mist had also disappeared and before us lay an iceless channel perhaps ten or fifteen miles wide with a few icebergs far away to our right and an intermittent archipelago of smaller ones to the left I watched my father closely determined to remain silent until he spoke Presently he untied the rope from his waist and without saying a word began working the pumps which fortunately were not damaged relieving the sloop of the water it had shipped in the madness of the storm He put up the sloop s sails as calmly as if casting a fishing net and then remarked that we were ready for a favoring wind when it came His courage and persistence were truly remarkable On investigation we found less than one third of our provisions remaining while to our utter dismay we discovered that our water casks had been swept overboard during the violent plungings of our boat Two of our water casks were in the main hold but both were empty We had a fair supply of food but no fresh water I realized at once the awfulness of our position Presently I was seized with a consuming thirst It is indeed bad remarked my father However let us dry our bedraggled clothing for we are soaked to the skin Trust to the god Odin my son Do not give up hope The sun was beating down slantingly as if we were in a southern latitude instead of in the far Northland It was swinging around its orbit ever visible and rising higher and higher each day frequently mist covered yet always peering through the lacework of clouds like some fretful eye of fate guarding the mysterious Northland and jealously watching the pranks of man Far to our right the rays decking the prisms of icebergs were gorgeous Their reflections emitted flashes of garnet of diamond of sapphire A pyrotechnic panorama of countless colors and shapes while below could be seen the green tinted sea and above the purple sky PART THREE BEYOND THE NORTH WIND I TRIED to forget my thirst by busying myself with bringing up some food and an empty vessel from the hold Reaching over the side rail I filled the vessel with water for the purpose of laving my hands and face To my astonishment when the water came in contact with my lips I could taste no salt I was startled by the discovery Father I fairly gasped the water the water it is fresh What Olaf exclaimed my father glancing hastily around Surely you are mistaken There is no land You are going mad But taste it I cried And thus we made the discovery that the water was indeed fresh absolutely so without the least briny taste or even the suspicion of a salty flavor We forthwith filled our two remaining water casks and my father declared it was a heavenly dispensation of mercy from the gods Odin and Thor We were almost beside ourselves with joy but hunger bade us end our enforced fast Now that we had found fresh water in the open sea what might we not expect in this strange latitude where ship had never before sailed and the splash of an oar had never been heard eleven eleven In vol I page one hundred ninety six Nansen writes It is a peculiar phenomenon this dead water We had at present a better opportunity of studying it than we desired It occurs where a surface layer of fresh water rests upon the salt water of the sea and this fresh water is carried along with the ship gliding on the heavier sea beneath it as if on a fixed foundation The difference between the two strata was in this case so great that while we had drinking water on the surface the water we got from the bottom cock of the engine room was far too salt to be used for the boiler We had scarcely appeased our hunger when a breeze began filling the idle sails and glancing at the compass we found the northern point pressing hard against the glass In response to my surprise my father said I have heard of this before it is what they call the dipping of the needle We loosened the compass and turned it at right angles with the surface of the sea before its point would free itself from the glass and point according to unmolested attraction It shifted uneasily and seemed as unsteady as a drunken man but finally pointed a course Before this we thought the wind was carrying us north by northwest but with the needle free we discovered if it could be relied upon that we were sailing slightly north by northeast Our course however was ever tending northward twelve twelve In volume II pages eighteen and nineteen Nansen writes about the inclination of the needle Speaking of Johnson his aide One day it was November twenty four he came in to supper a little after six o clock quite alarmed and said There has just been a singular inclination of the needle in twenty four degrees And remarkably enough its northern extremity pointed to the east We again find in Peary s first voyage page sixty seven the following It had been observed that from the moment they had entered Lancaster Sound the motion of the compass needle was very sluggish and both this and its deviation increased as they progressed to the westward and continued to do so in descending this inlet Having reached latitude seventy three degrees they witnessed for the first time the curious phenomenon of the directive power of the needle becoming so weak as to be completely overcome by the attraction of the ship so that the needle might now be said to point to the north pole of the ship The sea was serenely smooth with hardly a choppy wave and the wind brisk and exhilarating The sun s rays while striking us aslant furnished tranquil warmth And thus time wore on day after day and we found from the record in our logbook we had been sailing eleven days since the storm in the open sea By strictest economy our food was holding out fairly well but beginning to run low In the meantime one of our casks of water had been exhausted and my father said We will fill it again But to our dismay we found the water was now as salt as in the region of the Lofoden Islands off the coast of Norway This necessitated our being extremely careful of the remaining cask I found myself wanting to sleep much of the time whether it was the effect of the exciting experience of sailing in unknown waters or the relaxation from the awful excitement incident to our adventure in a storm at sea or due to want of food I could not say I frequently lay down on the bunker of our little sloop and looked far up into the blue dome of the sky and notwithstanding the sun was shining far away in the east I always saw a single star overhead For several days when I looked for this star it was always there directly above us It was now according to our reckoning about the first of August The sun was high in the heavens and was so bright that I could no longer see the one lone star that attracted my attention a few days earlier One day about this time my father startled me by calling my attention to a novel sight far in front of us almost at the horizon It is a mock sun exclaimed my father I have read of them it is called a reflection or mirage It will soon pass away But this dull red false sun as we supposed it to be did not pass away for several hours and while we were unconscious of its emitting any rays of light still there was no time thereafter when we could not sweep the horizon in front and locate the illumination of the so called false sun during a period of at least twelve hours out of every twenty four Clouds and mists would at times almost but never entirely hide its location Gradually it seemed to climb higher in the horizon of the uncertain purply sky as we advanced It could hardly be said to resemble the sun except in its circular shape and when not obscured by clouds or the ocean mists it had a hazy red bronzed appearance which would change to a white light like a luminous cloud as if reflecting some greater light beyond We finally agreed in our discussion of this smoky furnace colored sun that whatever the cause of the phenomenon it was not a reflection of our sun but a planet of some sort a reality thirteen thirteen Nansen on page three hundred ninety four says To day another noteworthy thing happened which was that about mid day we saw the sun or to be more correct an image of the sun for it was only a mirage A peculiar impression was produced by the sight of that glowing fire lit just above the outermost edge of the ice According to the enthusiastic descriptions given by many Arctic travelers of the first appearance of this god of life after the long winter night the impression ought to be one of jubilant excitement but it was not so in my case We had not expected to see it for some days yet so that my feeling was rather one of pain of disappointment that we must have drifted farther south than we thought So it was with pleasure I soon discovered that it could not be the sun itself The mirage was at first a flattened out glowing red streak of fire on the horizon later there were two streaks the one above the other with a dark space between and from the maintop I could see four or even five such horizontal lines directly over one another all of equal length as if one could only imagine a square dull red sun with horizontal dark streaks across it One day soon after this I felt exceedingly drowsy and fell into a sound sleep But it seemed that I was almost immediately aroused by my father s vigorous shaking of me by the shoulder and saying Olaf awaken there is land in sight I sprang to my feet and oh joy unspeakable There far in the distance yet directly in our path were lands jutting boldly into the sea The shore line stretched far away to the right of us as far as the eye could see and all along the sandy beach were waves breaking into choppy foam receding then going forward again ever chanting in monotonous thunder tones the song of the deep The banks were covered with trees and vegetation I cannot express my feeling of exultation at this discovery My father stood motionless with his hand on the tiller looking straight ahead pouring out his heart in thankful prayer and thanksgiving to the gods Odin and Thor In the meantime a net which we found in the stowage had been cast and we caught a few fish that materially added to our dwindling stock of provisions The compass which we had fastened back in its place in fear of another storm was still pointing due north and moving on its pivot just as it had at Stockholm The dipping of the needle had ceased What could this mean Then too our many days of sailing had certainly carried us far past the North Pole And yet the needle continued to point north We were sorely perplexed for surely our direction was now south fourteen fourteen Peary s first voyage pages sixty nine and seventy says On reaching Sir Byam Martin s Island the nearest to Melville Island the latitude of the place of observation was seventy five degrees nine twenty three and the longitude one hundred three degrees forty four thirty seven the dip of the magnetic needle eighty eight degrees twenty five fifty six west in the longitude of ninety one degrees forty eight where the last observations on the shore had been made to one hundred sixty five degrees fifty nine east at their present station so that we had says Peary in sailing over the space included between these two meridians crossed immediately northward of the magnetic pole and had undoubtedly passed over one of those spots upon the globe where the needle would have been found to vary one hundred eighty degrees or in other words where the North Pole would have pointed to the south We sailed for three days along the shoreline then came to the mouth of a fjord or river of immense size It seemed more like a great bay and into this we turned our fishing craft the direction being slightly northeast of south By the assistance of a fretful wind that came to our aid about twelve hours out of every twenty four we continued to make our way inland into what afterward proved to be a mighty river and which we learned was called by the inhabitants Hiddekel We continued our journey for ten days thereafter and found we had fortunately attained a distance inland where ocean tides no longer affected the water which had become fresh The discovery came none too soon for our remaining cask of water was well nigh exhausted We lost no time in replenishing our casks and continued to sail farther up the river when the wind was favorable Along the banks great forests miles in extent could be seen stretching away on the shore line The trees were of enormous size We landed after anchoring near a sandy beach and waded ashore and were rewarded by finding a quantity of nuts that were very palatable and satisfying to hunger and a welcome change from the monotony of our stock of provisions It was about the first of September over five months we calculated since our leave taking from Stockholm Suddenly we were frightened almost out of our wits by hearing in the far distance the singing of people Very soon thereafter we discovered a huge ship gliding down the river directly toward us Those aboard were singing in one mighty chorus that echoing from bank to bank sounded like a thousand voices filling the whole universe with quivering melody The accompaniment was played on stringed instruments not unlike our harps It was a larger ship than any we had ever seen and was differently constructed fifteen fifteen Asiatic Mythology page two hundred forty Paradise found from translation by Sayce in a book called Records of the Past we were told of a dwelling which the gods created for the first human beings a dwelling in which they became great and increased in numbers and the location of which is described in words exactly corresponding to those of Iranian Indian Chinese Eddaic and Aztecan literature namely in the center of the earth Warren At this particular time our sloop was becalmed and not far from the shore The bank of the river covered with mammoth trees rose up several hundred feet in beautiful fashion We seemed to be on the edge of some primeval forest that doubtless stretched far inland The immense craft paused and almost immediately a boat was lowered and six men of gigantic stature rowed to our little fishing sloop They spoke to us in a strange language We knew from their manner however that they were not unfriendly They talked a great deal among themselves and one of them laughed immoderately as though in finding us a queer discovery had been made One of them spied our compass and it seemed to interest them more than any other part of our sloop Finally the leader motioned as if to ask whether we were willing to leave our craft to go on board their ship What say you my son asked my father They cannot do any more than kill us They seem to be kindly disposed I replied although what terrible giants They must be the select six of the kingdom s crack regiment Just look at their great size We may as well go willingly as be taken by force said my father smiling for they are certainly able to capture us Thereupon he made known by signs that we were ready to accompany them Within a few minutes we were on board the ship and half an hour later our little fishing craft had been lifted bodily out of the water by a strange sort of hook and tackle and set on board as a curiosity There were several hundred people on board this to us mammoth ship which we discovered was called The Naz meaning as we afterward learned Pleasure or to give a more proper interpretation Pleasure Excursion ship If my father and I were curiously observed by the ship s occupants this strange race of giants offered us an equal amount of wonderment There was not a single man aboard who would not have measured fully twelve feet in height They all wore full beards not particularly long but seemingly short cropped They had mild and beautiful faces exceedingly fair with ruddy complexions The hair and beard of some were black others sandy and still others yellow The captain as we designated the dignitary in command of the great vessel was fully a head taller than any of his companions The women averaged from ten to eleven feet in height Their features were especially regular and refined while their complexion was of a most delicate tint heightened by a healthful glow sixteen sixteen According to all procurable data that spot at the era of man s appearance upon the stage was in the now lost Miocene continent which then surrounded the Arctic Pole That in that true original Eden some of the early generations of men attained to a stature and longevity unequaled in any countries known to postdiluvian history is by no means scientifically incredible Wm F Warren Paradise Found p two hundred eighty four Both men and women seemed to possess that particular ease of manner which we deem a sign of good breeding and notwithstanding their huge statures there was nothing about them suggesting awkwardness As I was a lad in only my nineteenth year I was doubtless looked upon as a true Tom Thumb My father s six feet three did not lift the top of his head above the waist line of these people Each one seemed to vie with the others in extending courtesies and showing kindness to us but all laughed heartily I remember when they had to improvise chairs for my father and myself to sit at table They were richly attired in a costume peculiar to themselves and very attractive The men were clothed in handsomely embroidered tunics of silk and satin and belted at the waist They wore knee breeches and stockings of a fine texture while their feet were encased in sandals adorned with gold buckles We early discovered that gold was one of the most common metals known and that it was used extensively in decoration Strange as it may seem neither my father nor myself felt the least bit of solicitude for our safety We have come into our own my father said to me This is the fulfillment of the tradition told me by my father and my father s father and still back for many generations of our race This is assuredly the land beyond the North Wind We seemed to make such an impression on the party that we were given specially into the charge of one of the men Jules Galdea and his wife for the purpose of being educated in their language and we on our part were just as eager to learn as they were to instruct At the captain s command the vessel was swung cleverly about and began retracing its course up the river The machinery while noiseless was very powerful The banks and trees on either side seemed to rush by The ship s speed at times surpassed that of any railroad train on which I have ever ridden even here in America It was wonderful In the meantime we had lost sight of the sun s rays but we found a radiance within emanating from the dull red sun which had already attracted our attention now giving out a white light seemingly from a cloud bank far away in front of us It dispensed a greater light I should say than two full moons on the clearest night In twelve hours this cloud of whiteness would pass out of sight as if eclipsed and the twelve hours following corresponded with our night We early learned that these strange people were worshipers of this great cloud of night It was The Smoky God of the Inner World The ship was equipped with a mode of illumination which I now presume was electricity but neither my father nor myself were sufficiently skilled in mechanics to understand whence came the power to operate the ship or to maintain the soft beautiful lights that answered the same purpose of our present methods of lighting the streets of our cities our houses and places of business It must be remembered the time of which I write was the autumn of eighteen twenty nine and we of the outside surface of the earth knew nothing then so to speak of electricity The electrically surcharged condition of the air was a constant vitalizer I never felt better in my life than during the two years my father and I sojourned on the inside of the earth To resume my narrative of events The ship on which we were sailing came to a stop two days after we had been taken on board My father said as nearly as he could judge we were directly under Stockholm or London The city we had reached was called Jehu signifying a seaport town The houses were large and beautifully constructed and quite uniform in appearance yet without sameness The principal occupation of the people appeared to be agriculture the hillsides were covered with vineyards while the valleys were devoted to the growing of grain I never saw such a display of gold It was everywhere The door casings were inlaid and the tables were veneered with sheetings of gold Domes of the public buildings were of gold It was used most generously in the finishings of the great temples of music Vegetation grew in lavish exuberance and fruit of all kinds possessed the most delicate flavor Clusters of grapes four and five feet in length each grape as large as an orange and apples larger than a man s head typified the wonderful growth of all things on the inside of the earth The great redwood trees of California would be considered mere underbrush compared with the giant forest trees extending for miles and miles in all directions In many directions along the foothills of the mountains vast herds of cattle were seen during the last day of our travel on the river We heard much of a city called Eden but were kept at Jehu for an entire year By the end of that time we had learned to speak fairly well the language of this strange race of people Our instructors Jules Galdea and his wife exhibited a patience that was truly commendable One day an envoy from the Ruler at Eden came to see us and for two whole days my father and myself were put through a series of surprising questions They wished to know from whence we came what sort of people dwelt without what God we worshiped our religious beliefs the mode of living in our strange land and a thousand other things The compass which we had brought with us attracted especial attention My father and I commented between ourselves on the fact that the compass still pointed north although we now knew that we had sailed over the curve or edge of the earth s aperture and were far along southward on the inside surface of the earth s crust which according to my father s estimate and my own is about three hundred miles in thickness from the inside to the outside surface Relatively speaking it is no thicker than an egg shell so that there is almost as much surface on the inside as on the outside of the earth The great luminous cloud or ball of dull red fire fiery red in the mornings and evenings and during the day giving off a beautiful white light The Smoky God is seemingly suspended in the center of the great vacuum within the earth and held to its place by the immutable law of gravitation or a repellant atmospheric force as the case may be I refer to the known power that draws or repels with equal force in all directions The base of this electrical cloud or central luminary the seat of the gods is dark and non transparent save for innumerable small openings seemingly in the bottom of the great support or altar of the Deity upon which The Smoky God rests and the lights shining through these many openings twinkle at night in all their splendor and seem to be stars as natural as the stars we saw shining when in our home at Stockholm excepting that they appear larger The Smoky God therefore with each daily revolution of the earth appears to come up in the east and go down in the west the same as does our sun on the external surface In reality the people within believe that The Smoky God is the throne of their Jehovah and is stationary The effect of night and day is therefore produced by the earth s daily rotation I have since discovered that the language of the people of the Inner World is much like the Sanskrit After we had given an account of ourselves to the emissaries from the central seat of government of the inner continent and my father had in his crude way drawn maps at their request of the outside surface of the earth showing the divisions of land and water and giving the name of each of the continents large islands and the oceans we were taken overland to the city of Eden in a conveyance different from anything we have in Europe or America This vehicle was doubtless some electrical contrivance It was noiseless and ran on a single iron rail in perfect balance The trip was made at a very high rate of speed We were carried up hills and down dales across valleys and again along the sides of steep mountains without any apparent attempt having been made to level the earth as we do for railroad tracks The car seats were huge yet comfortable affairs and very high above the floor of the car On the top of each car were high geared fly wheels lying on their sides which were so automatically adjusted that as the speed of the car increased the high speed of these fly wheels geometrically increased Jules Galdea explained to us that these revolving fan like wheels on top of the cars destroyed atmospheric pressure or what is generally understood by the term gravitation and with this force thus destroyed or rendered nugatory the car is as safe from falling to one side or the other from the single rail track as if it were in a vacuum the fly wheels in their rapid revolutions destroying effectually the so called power of gravitation or the force of atmospheric pressure or whatever potent influence it may be that causes all unsupported things to fall downward to the earth s surface or to the nearest point of resistance The surprise of my father and myself was indescribable when amid the regal magnificence of a spacious hall we were finally brought before the Great High Priest ruler over all the land He was richly robed and much taller than those about him and could not have been less than fourteen or fifteen feet in height The immense room in which we were received seemed finished in solid slabs of gold thickly studded with jewels of amazing brilliancy The city of Eden is located in what seems to be a beautiful valley yet in fact it is on the loftiest mountain plateau of the Inner Continent several thousand feet higher than any portion of the surrounding country It is the most beautiful place I have ever beheld in all my travels In this elevated garden all manner of fruits vines shrubs trees and flowers grow in riotous profusion In this garden four rivers have their source in a mighty artesian fountain They divide and flow in four directions This place is called by the inhabitants the navel of the earth or the beginning the cradle of the human race The names of the rivers are the Euphrates the Pison the Gihon and the Hiddekel seventeen seventeen And the Lord God planted a garden and out of the ground made the Lord God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for food The Book of Genesis The unexpected awaited us in this palace of beauty in the finding of our little fishing craft It had been brought before the High Priest in perfect shape just as it had been taken from the waters that day when it was loaded on board the ship by the people who discovered us on the river more than a year before We were given an audience of over two hours with this great dignitary who seemed kindly disposed and considerate He showed himself eagerly interested asking us numerous questions and invariably regarding things about which his emissaries had failed to inquire At the conclusion of the interview he inquired our pleasure asking us whether we wished to remain in his country or if we preferred to return to the outer world providing it were possible to make a successful return trip across the frozen belt barriers that encircle both the northern and southern openings of the earth My father replied It would please me and my son to visit your country and see your people your colleges and palaces of music and art your great fields your wonderful forests of timber and after we have had this pleasurable privilege we should like to try to return to our home on the outside surface of the earth This son is my only child and my good wife will be weary awaiting our return I fear you can never return replied the Chief High Priest because the way is a most hazardous one However you shall visit the different countries with Jules Galdea as your escort and be accorded every courtesy and kindness Whenever you are ready to attempt a return voyage I assure you that your boat which is here on exhibition shall be put in the waters of the river Hiddekel at its mouth and we will bid you Jehovah speed Thus terminated our only interview with the High Priest or Ruler of the continent PART FOUR IN THE UNDER WORLD WE learned that the males do not marry before they are from seventy five to one hundred years old and that the age at which women enter wedlock is only a little less and that both men and women frequently live to be from six to eight hundred years old and in some instances much older eighteen eighteen Josephus says God prolonged the life of the patriarchs that preceded the deluge both on account of their virtues and to give them the opportunity of perfecting the sciences of geometry and astronomy which they had discovered which they could not have done if they had not lived six hundred years because it is only after the lapse of six hundred years that the great year is accomplished Flammarion Astronomical Myths Paris p twenty six During the following year we visited many villages and towns prominent among them being the cities of Nigi Delfi Hectea and my father was called upon no less than a half dozen times to go over the maps which had been made from the rough sketches he had originally given of the divisions of land and water on the outside surface of the earth I remember hearing my father remark that the giant race of people in the land of The Smoky God had almost as accurate an idea of the geography of the outside surface of the earth as had the average college professor in Stockholm In our travels we came to a forest of gigantic trees near the city of Delfi Had the Bible said there were trees towering over three hundred feet in height and more than thirty feet in diameter growing in the Garden of Eden the Ingersolls the Tom Paines and Voltaires would doubtless have pronounced the statement a myth Yet this is the description of the California sequoia gigantea but these California giants pale into insignificance when compared with the forest Goliaths found in the within continent where abound mighty trees from eight hundred to one thousand feet in height and from one hundred to one hundred and twenty feet in diameter countless in numbers and forming forests extending hundreds of miles back from the sea The people are exceedingly musical and learned to a remarkable degree in their arts and sciences especially geometry and astronomy Their cities are equipped with vast palaces of music where not infrequently as many as twenty five thousand lusty voices of this giant race swell forth in mighty choruses of the most sublime symphonies The children are not supposed to attend institutions of learning before they are twenty years old Then their school life begins and continues for thirty years ten of which are uniformly devoted by both sexes to the study of music Their principal vocations are architecture agriculture horticulture the raising of vast herds of cattle and the building of conveyances peculiar to that country for travel on land and water By some device which I cannot explain they hold communion with one another between the most distant parts of their country on air currents All buildings are erected with special regard to strength durability beauty and symmetry and with a style of architecture vastly more attractive to the eye than any I have ever observed elsewhere About three fourths of the inner surface of the earth is land and about one fourth water There are numerous rivers of tremendous size some flowing in a northerly direction and others southerly Some of these rivers are thirty miles in width and it is out of these vast waterways at the extreme northern and southern parts of the inside surface of the earth in regions where low temperatures are experienced that fresh water icebergs are formed They are then pushed out to sea like huge tongues of ice by the abnormal freshets of turbulent waters that twice every year sweep everything before them We saw innumerable specimens of bird life no larger than those encountered in the forests of Europe or America It is well known that during the last few years whole species of birds have quit the earth A writer in a recent article on this subject says nineteen nineteen Almost every year sees the final extinction of one or more bird species Out of fourteen varieties of birds found a century since on a single island the West Indian island of saint Thomas eight have now to be numbered among the missing Is it not possible that these disappearing bird species quit their habitation without and find an asylum in the within world Whether inland among the mountains or along the seashore we found bird life prolific When they spread their great wings some of the birds appeared to measure thirty feet from tip to tip They are of great variety and many colors We were permitted to climb up on the edge of a rock and examine a nest of eggs There were five in the nest each of which was at least two feet in length and fifteen inches in diameter After we had been in the city of Hectea about a week Professor Galdea took us to an inlet where we saw thousands of tortoises along the sandy shore I hesitate to state the size of these great creatures They were from twenty five to thirty feet in length from fifteen to twenty feet in width and fully seven feet in height When one of them projected its head it had the appearance of some hideous sea monster The strange conditions within are favorable not only for vast meadows of luxuriant grasses forests of giant trees and all manner of vegetable life but wonderful animal life as well One day we saw a great herd of elephants There must have been five hundred of these thunder throated monsters with their restlessly waving trunks They were tearing huge boughs from the trees and trampling smaller growth into dust like so much hazel brush They would average over one hundred feet in length and from seventy five to eighty five in height It seemed as I gazed upon this wonderful herd of giant elephants that I was again living in the public library at Stockholm where I had spent much time studying the wonders of the Miocene age I was filled with mute astonishment and my father was speechless with awe He held my arm with a protecting grip as if fearful harm would overtake us We were two atoms in this great forest and fortunately unobserved by this vast herd of elephants as they drifted on and away following a leader as does a herd of sheep They browsed from growing herbage which they encountered as they traveled and now and again shook the firmament with their deep bellowing twenty twenty Moreover there were a great number of elephants in the island and there was provision for animals of every kind Also whatever fragrant things there are in the earth whether roots or herbage or woods or distilling drops of flowers or fruits grew and thrived in that land The Cratylus of Plato There is a hazy mist that goes up from the land each evening and it invariably rains once every twenty four hours This great moisture and the invigorating electrical light and warmth account perhaps for the luxuriant vegetation while the highly charged electrical air and the evenness of climatic conditions may have much to do with the giant growth and longevity of all animal life In places the level valleys stretched away for many miles in every direction The Smoky God in its clear white light looked calmly down There was an intoxication in the electrically surcharged air that fanned the cheek as softly as a vanishing whisper Nature chanted a lullaby in the faint murmur of winds whose breath was sweet with the fragrance of bud and blossom After having spent considerably more than a year in visiting several of the many cities of the within world and a great deal of intervening country and more than two years had passed from the time we had been picked up by the great excursion ship on the river we decided to cast our fortunes once more upon the sea and endeavor to regain the outside surface of the earth We made known our wishes and they were reluctantly but promptly followed Our hosts gave my father at his request various maps showing the entire inside surface of the earth its cities oceans seas rivers gulfs and bays They also generously offered to give us all the bags of gold nuggets some of them as large as a goose s egg that we were willing to attempt to take with us in our little fishing boat In due time we returned to Jehu at which place we spent one month in fixing up and overhauling our little fishing sloop After all was in readiness the same ship Naz that originally discovered us took us on board and sailed to the mouth of the river Hiddekel After our giant brothers had launched our little craft for us they were most cordially regretful at parting and evinced much solicitude for our safety My father swore by the Gods Odin and Thor that he would surely return again within a year or two and pay them another visit And thus we bade them adieu We made ready and hoisted our sail but there was little breeze We were becalmed within an hour after our giant friends had left us and started on their return trip The winds were constantly blowing south that is they were blowing from the northern opening of the earth toward that which we knew to be south but which according to our compass s pointing finger was directly north For three days we tried to sail and to beat against the wind but to no avail Whereupon my father said My son to return by the same route as we came in is impossible at this time of year I wonder why we did not think of this before We have been here almost two and a half years therefore this is the season when the sun is beginning to shine in at the southern opening of the earth The long cold night is on in the Spitzbergen country What shall we do I inquired There is only one thing we can do my father replied and that is to go south Accordingly he turned the craft about gave it full reef and started by the compass north but in fact directly south The wind was strong and we seemed to have struck a current that was running with remarkable swiftness in the same direction In just forty days we arrived at Delfi a city we had visited in company with our guides Jules Galdea and his wife near the mouth of the Gihon river Here we stopped for two days and were most hospitably entertained by the same people who had welcomed us on our former visit We laid in some additional provisions and again set sail following the needle due north On our outward trip we came through a narrow channel which appeared to be a separating body of water between two considerable bodies of land There was a beautiful beach to our right and we decided to reconnoiter Casting anchor we waded ashore to rest up for a day before continuing the outward hazardous undertaking We built a fire and threw on some sticks of dry driftwood While my father was walking along the shore I prepared a tempting repast from supplies we had provided There was a mild luminous light which my father said resulted from the sun shining in from the south aperture of the earth That night we slept soundly and awakened the next morning as refreshed as if we had been in our own beds at Stockholm After breakfast we started out on an inland tour of discovery but had not gone far when we sighted some birds which we recognized at once as belonging to the penguin family They are flightless birds but excellent swimmers and tremendous in size with white breast short wings black head and long peaked bills They stand fully nine feet high They looked at us with little surprise and presently waddled rather than walked toward the water and swam away in a northerly direction twenty one twenty one The nights are never so dark at the Poles as in other regions for the moon and stars seem to possess twice as much light and effulgence In addition there is a continuous light the varied shades and play of which are amongst the strangest phenomena of nature Rambrosson s Astronomy The events that occurred during the following hundred or more days beggar description We were on an open and iceless sea The month we reckoned to be November or December and we knew the so called South Pole was turned toward the sun Therefore when passing out and away from the internal electrical light of The Smoky God and its genial warmth we would be met by the light and warmth of the sun shining in through the south opening of the earth We were not mistaken twenty two twenty two The fact that gives the phenomenon of the polar aurora its greatest importance is that the earth becomes self luminous that besides the light which as a planet is received from the central body it shows a capability of sustaining a luminous process proper to itself Humboldt There were times when our little craft driven by wind that was continuous and persistent shot through the waters like an arrow Indeed had we encountered a hidden rock or obstacle our little vessel would have been crushed into kindling wood At last we were conscious that the atmosphere was growing decidedly colder and a few days later icebergs were sighted far to the left My father argued and correctly that the winds which filled our sails came from the warm climate within The time of the year was certainly most auspicious for us to make our dash for the outside world and attempt to scud our fishing sloop through open channels of the frozen zone which surrounds the polar regions We were soon amid the ice packs and how our little craft got through the narrow channels and escaped being crushed I know not The compass behaved in the same drunken and unreliable fashion in passing over the southern curve or edge of the earth s shell as it had done on our inbound trip at the northern entrance It gyrated dipped and seemed like a thing possessed twenty three twenty three Captain Sabine on page one hundred five in Voyages in the Arctic Regions says The geographical determination of the direction and intensity of the magnetic forces at different points of the earth s surface has been regarded as an object worthy of especial research To examine in different parts of the globe the declination inclination and intensity of the magnetic force and their periodical and secular variations and mutual relations and dependencies could be duly investigated only in fixed magnetical observatories One day as I was lazily looking over the sloop s side into the clear waters my father shouted Breakers ahead Looking up I saw through a lifting mist a white object that towered several hundred feet high completely shutting off our advance We lowered sail immediately and none too soon In a moment we found ourselves wedged between two monstrous icebergs Each was crowding and grinding against its fellow mountain of ice They were like two gods of war contending for supremacy We were greatly alarmed Indeed we were between the lines of a battle royal the sonorous thunder of the grinding ice was like the continued volleys of artillery Blocks of ice larger than a house were frequently lifted up a hundred feet by the mighty force of lateral pressure they would shudder and rock to and fro for a few seconds then come crashing down with a deafening roar and disappear in the foaming waters Thus for more than two hours the contest of the icy giants continued It seemed as if the end had come The ice pressure was terrific and while we were not caught in the dangerous part of the jam and were safe for the time being yet the heaving and rending of tons of ice as it fell splashing here and there into the watery depths filled us with shaking fear Finally to our great joy the grinding of the ice ceased and within a few hours the great mass slowly divided and as if an act of Providence had been performed right before us lay an open channel Should we venture with our little craft into this opening If the pressure came on again our little sloop as well as ourselves would be crushed into nothingness We decided to take the chance and accordingly hoisted our sail to a favoring breeze and soon started out like a race horse running the gauntlet of this unknown narrow channel of open water PART FIVE 
7988-114070-0000	train-other-500	AMONG THE ICE PACKS FOR the next forty five days our time was employed in dodging icebergs and hunting channels indeed
7988-114070-0001	train-other-500	had we not been favored with a strong south wind and a small boat I doubt if this story could have ever been given to the world At last there came a morning when my father said My son I think we are to see home
7988-114070-0002	train-other-500	We are almost through the ice See the open water lies before us However there were a few icebergs that had floated far northward
7988-114070-0003	train-other-500	into the open water still ahead of us on either side stretching away for many miles Directly in front of us and by the compass which had now righted itself due north there was an open sea
7988-114070-0004	train-other-500	What a wonderful story we have to tell to the people of Stockholm continued my father
none	none	 while a look of pardonable elation 
7988-114070-0005	train-other-500	lighted up his honest face And think of the gold nuggets stowed away in the hold I spoke kind words of praise to my father not alone for his fortitude and endurance
none	none	 but also for his courageous daring as a discoverer and for having made the voyage that now promised a successful end 
7988-114070-0006	train-other-500	I was grateful too that he had gathered the wealth of gold we were carrying home
7988-114070-0007	train-other-500	While congratulating ourselves on the goodly supply of provisions and water we still had on hand and on the dangers we had escaped we were startled by hearing a most terrific explosion caused by the tearing apart of a huge mountain of ice
7988-114070-0008	train-other-500	It was a deafening roar like the firing of a thousand cannon We were sailing at the time with great speed and happened to be near a monstrous iceberg which to all appearances was as immovable as a rockbound island
7988-114070-0009	train-other-500	It seemed however that the iceberg had split and was breaking apart whereupon the balance of the monster along which we were sailing was destroyed and it began dipping from us
7988-114070-0010	train-other-500	My father quickly anticipated the danger before I realized its awful possibilities The iceberg extended down into the water many hundreds of feet and as it tipped over the portion
none	none	 coming up out of the water caught our fishing craft like a lever on a fulcrum 
7988-114070-0011	train-other-500	and threw it into the air as if it had been a foot ball Our boat fell back on the iceberg that by this time had changed the side next to us for the top My father was still in the boat having become entangled in the rigging while I was thrown some twenty feet away
7988-114070-0012	train-other-500	I quickly scrambled to my feet and shouted to my father who answered All is well Just then a realization dawned upon me Horror upon horror The blood froze in my veins
none	none	 The iceberg was still in motion and its great weight and force in toppling over would cause it to submerge temporarily 
7988-114070-0013	train-other-500	I fully realized what a sucking maelstrom it would produce amid the worlds of water on every side They would rush into the depression in all their fury like white fanged wolves eager for human prey
7988-114070-0014	train-other-500	In this supreme moment of mental anguish I remember glancing at our boat which was lying on its side and wondering if it could possibly right itself and if my father could escape Was this the end of our struggles and adventures
7988-114070-0015	train-other-500	Was this death All these questions flashed through my mind in the fraction of a second and a moment later I was engaged in a life and death struggle
7988-114070-0016	train-other-500	The ponderous monolith of ice sank below the surface and the frigid waters gurgled around me in frenzied anger I was in a saucer with the waters pouring in on every side A moment more and I lost consciousness
7988-114070-0017	train-other-500	When I partially recovered my senses
none	none	 and roused from the swoon of a half drowned man 
7988-114070-0018	train-other-500	I found myself wet stiff and almost frozen lying on the iceberg But there was no sign of my father or of our little fishing sloop The monster berg had recovered itself and with its new balance
7988-114070-0019	train-other-500	lifted its head perhaps fifty feet above the waves The top of this island of ice was a plateau perhaps half an acre in extent I loved my father well and was grief stricken at the awfulness of his death
none	none	 I railed at fate 
7988-114070-0020	train-other-500	that I too had not been permitted to sleep with him in the depths of the ocean Finally
none	none	 I climbed to my feet and looked about me 
7988-114070-0021	train-other-500	The purple domed sky above the shoreless green ocean beneath and only an occasional iceberg discernible My heart sank in hopeless despair
7988-114070-0022	train-other-500	I cautiously picked my way across the berg toward the other side hoping that our fishing craft had righted itself Dared I think it possible that my father still lived
none	none	 It was but a ray of hope that flamed up in my heart But the anticipation warmed my blood in my veins and started it rushing 
7988-114070-0023	train-other-500	like some rare stimulant through every fiber of my body I crept close to the precipitous side of the iceberg and peered far down hoping still hoping Then I made a circle of the berg
7988-114070-0024	train-other-500	scanning every foot of the way and thus I kept going around and around One part of my brain was certainly becoming maniacal while the other part I believe and do
none	none	 to this day was perfectly rational I was conscious of having made the circuit a dozen times and while one part of my intelligence knew in all reason there was not a vestige of hope yet some strange fascinating 
7988-114070-0025	train-other-500	aberration bewitched and compelled me still to beguile myself with expectation The other part of my brain seemed to tell me that while there was no possibility of my father being alive
none	none	 yet if I quit making the circuitous pilgrimage if I paused for a single moment it would be acknowledgment of defeat and should I do this 
7988-114070-0026	train-other-500	I felt that I should go mad Thus hour after hour I walked around and around afraid to stop and rest yet physically powerless to continue much longer
7988-114070-0027	train-other-500	Oh horror of horrors to be cast away in this wide expanse of waters without food or drink and only a treacherous iceberg for an abiding place My heart sank within me
7988-114070-0028	train-other-500	and all semblance of hope was fading into black despair Then the hand of the Deliverer was extended and the death like stillness of a solitude rapidly becoming unbearable was suddenly broken by the firing of a signal gun
7988-114070-0029	train-other-500	I looked up in startled amazement when I saw less than a half mile away a whaling vessel bearing down toward me with her sail full set Evidently my continued activity on the iceberg had attracted their attention
7988-114070-0030	train-other-500	On drawing near they put out a boat and descending cautiously to the water s edge I was rescued and a little later lifted on board the whaling ship I found it was a Scotch whaler The Arlington
none	none	 She had cleared from Dundee in September and started immediately for the Antarctic in search of whales The captain Angus MacPherson seemed kindly disposed but in matters of discipline 
7988-114070-0032	train-other-500	as I soon learned possessed of an iron will When I attempted to tell him that I had come from the inside of the earth the captain and mate looked at each other shook their heads and insisted on my being put in a bunk under strict surveillance of the ship s physician
7988-114070-0033	train-other-500	I was very weak for want of food and had not slept for many hours However after a few days rest I got up one morning and dressed myself without asking permission of the physician or anyone else and told them that I was as sane as anyone
7988-114070-0034	train-other-500	The captain sent for me and again questioned me concerning where I had come from and how I came to be alone on an iceberg in the far off Antarctic Ocean I replied that I had
none	none	 just come from the inside of the earth and proceeded to tell him how my father and myself had gone in by way of Spitzbergen 
7988-114070-0035	train-other-500	and come out by way of the South Pole country whereupon I was put in irons I afterward heard the captain tell the mate that I was as crazy as a March hare and that I must remain in confinement until I was rational enough to give a truthful account of myself
7988-114070-0036	train-other-500	Finally after much pleading and many promises I was released from irons I then and there decided to invent some story that would satisfy the captain
none	none	 and never again refer to my trip to the land of The Smoky God at least until I was safe among friends 
7988-114070-0037	train-other-500	Within a fortnight I was permitted to go about and take my place as one of the seamen A little later the captain asked me for an explanation I told him that my experience had been so horrible that I was fearful of my memory
7988-114070-0038	train-other-500	and begged him to permit me to leave the question unanswered until some time in the future I think you are recovering considerably he said but you are not sane yet by a good deal
7988-114070-0039	train-other-500	Permit me to do such work as you may assign I replied and if it does not compensate you sufficiently I will pay you immediately after I reach Stockholm to the last penny Thus the matter rested
7988-114070-0040	train-other-500	On finally reaching Stockholm as I have already related I found that my good mother had gone to her reward more than a year before I have also told how later the treachery of a relative
7988-114070-0041	train-other-500	landed me in a madhouse where I remained for twenty eight years
none	none	 seemingly unending years and 
7988-114070-0042	train-other-500	still later after my release how I returned to the life of a fisherman following it sedulously for twenty seven years then how I came to America and
7988-114070-0043	train-other-500	finally to Los Angeles California But all this can be of little interest to the reader
none	none	 Indeed it seems to me the climax of my wonderful travels and strange adventures was reached when the Scotch sailing vessel took me from an iceberg on the Antarctic Ocean PART SIX CONCLUSION IN concluding this history of my adventures I wish to state that I firmly believe science is yet in its infancy concerning the cosmology of the earth There is so much that is unaccounted for by the world s accepted knowledge of to day and will ever remain so until the land of The Smoky God is known and recognized by our geographers It is the land from whence came the great logs of cedar that have been found by explorers in open waters far over the northern edge of the earth s crust and also the bodies of mammoths whose bones are found in vast beds on the Siberian coast Northern explorers have done much Sir John Franklin De Haven Grinnell Sir John Murray Kane Melville Hall Nansen Schwatka Greely Peary Ross Gerlache Bernacchi Andree Amsden Amundson and others have all been striving to storm the frozen citadel of mystery I firmly believe that Andree and his two brave companions Strindberg and Fraenckell who sailed away in the balloon Oreon from the northwest coast of Spitzbergen on that Sunday afternoon of July eleven eighteen ninety seven are now in the within world and doubtless are being entertained as my father and myself were entertained by the kind hearted giant race inhabiting the inner Atlantic Continent Having in my humble way devoted years to these problems I am well acquainted with the accepted definitions of gravity as well as the cause of the magnetic needle s attraction and I am prepared to say that it is my firm belief that the magnetic needle is influenced solely by electric currents which completely envelop the earth like a garment and that these electric currents in an endless circuit pass out of the southern end of the earth s cylindrical opening diffusing and spreading themselves over all the outside surface and rushing madly on in their course toward the North Pole And while these currents seemingly dash off into space at the earth s curve or edge yet they drop again to the inside surface and continue their way southward along the inside of the earth s crust toward the opening of the so called South Pole twenty four twenty four mister Lemstrom concluded that an electric discharge which could only be seen by means of the spectroscope was taking place on the surface of the ground all around him and that from a distance it would appear as a faint display of Aurora the phenomena of pale and flaming light which is some times seen on the top of the Spitzbergen Mountains The Arctic Manual page seven hundred thirty nine As to gravity no one knows what it is because it has not been determined whether it is atmospheric pressure that causes the apple to fall or whether one hundred fifty miles below the surface of the earth supposedly one half way through the earth s crust there exists some powerful loadstone attraction that draws it Therefore whether the apple when it leaves the limb of the tree is drawn or impelled downward to the nearest point of resistance is unknown to the students of physics Sir James Ross claimed to have discovered the magnetic pole at about seventy four degrees latitude This is wrong the magnetic pole is exactly one half the distance through the earth s crust Thus if the earth s crust is three hundred miles in thickness which is the distance I estimate it to be then the magnetic pole is undoubtedly one hundred and fifty miles below the surface of the earth it matters not where the test is made And at this particular point one hundred and fifty miles below the surface gravity ceases becomes neutralized and when we pass beyond that point on toward the inside surface of the earth a reverse attraction geometrically increases in power until the other one hundred and fifty miles of distance is traversed which would bring us out on the inside of the earth Thus if a hole were bored down through the earth s crust at London Paris New York Chicago or Los Angeles a distance of three hundred miles it would connect the two surfaces While the inertia and momentum of a weight dropped in from the outside surface would carry it far past the magnetic center yet before reaching the inside surface of the earth it would gradually diminish in speed after passing the halfway point finally pause and immediately fall back toward the outside surface and continue thus to oscillate like the swinging of a pendulum with the power removed until it would finally rest at the magnetic center or at that particular point exactly one half the distance between the outside surface and the inside surface of the earth The gyration of the earth in its daily act of whirling around in its spiral rotation at a rate greater than one thousand miles every hour or about seventeen miles per second makes of it a vast electro generating body a huge machine a mighty prototype of the puny man made dynamo which at best is but a feeble imitation of nature s original The valleys of this inner Atlantis Continent bordering the upper waters of the farthest north are in season covered with the most magnificent and luxuriant flowers Not hundreds and thousands but millions of acres from which the pollen or blossoms are carried far away in almost every direction by the earth s spiral gyrations and the agitation of the wind resulting therefrom and it is these blossoms or pollen from the vast floral meadows within that produce the colored snows of the Arctic regions that have so mystified the northern explorers twenty five twenty five Kane vol I page forty four says We passed the crimson cliffs of Sir John Ross in the forenoon of August fifth The patches of red snow from which they derive their name could be seen clearly at the distance of ten miles from the coast La Chambre in an account of Andree s balloon expedition on page one hundred forty four says On the isle of Amsterdam the snow is tinted with red for a considerable distance and the savants are collecting it to examine it microscopically It presents in fact certain peculiarities it is thought that it contains very small plants Scoresby the famous whaler had already remarked this Beyond question this new land within is the home the cradle of the human race and viewed from the standpoint of the discoveries made by us must of necessity have a most important bearing on all physical paleontological archaeological philological and mythological theories of antiquity The same idea of going back to the land of mystery to the very beginning to the origin of man is found in Egyptian traditions of the earlier terrestrial regions of the gods heroes and men from the historical fragments of Manetho fully verified by the historical records taken from the more recent excavations of Pompeii as well as the traditions of the North American Indians It is now one hour past midnight the new year of nineteen oh eight is here and this is the third day thereof and having at last finished the record of my strange travels and adventures I wish given to the world I am ready and even longing for the peaceful rest which I am sure will follow life s trials and vicissitudes I am old in years and ripe both with adventures and sorrows yet rich with the few friends I have cemented to me in my struggles to lead a just and upright life Like a story that is well nigh told my life is ebbing away The presentiment is strong within me that I shall not live to see the rising of another sun Thus do I conclude my message OLAF JANSEN PART SEVEN AUTHOR S AFTERWORD I FOUND much difficulty in deciphering and editing the manuscripts of Olaf Jansen However I have taken the liberty of reconstructing only a very few expressions and in doing this have in no way changed the spirit or meaning Otherwise the original text has neither been added to nor taken from It is impossible for me to express my opinion as to the value or reliability of the wonderful statements made by Olaf Jansen The description here given of the strange lands and people visited by him location of cities the names and directions of rivers and other information herein combined conform in every way to the rough drawings given into my custody by this ancient Norseman which drawings together with the manuscript it is my intention at some later date to give to the Smithsonian Institution to preserve for the benefit of those interested in the mysteries of the Farthest North the frozen circle of silence It is certain there are many things in Vedic literature in Josephus the Odyssey the Iliad Terrien de Lacouperie s Early History of Chinese Civilization Flammarion s Astronomical Myths Lenormant s Beginnings of History Hesiod s Theogony Sir John de Maundeville s writings and Sayce s Records of the Past that to say the least are strangely in harmony with the seemingly incredible text found in the yellow manuscript of the old Norseman Olaf Jansen and now for the first time given to the world THE END End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Smoky God by Willis George Emerson END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE SMOKY
