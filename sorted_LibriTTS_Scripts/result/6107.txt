DRYDEN PREFACE The following work offers in book form the series of studies on the question of the historicity of Jesus presented from time to time before the Independent Religious Society in Orchestra Hall No effort has been made to change the manner of the spoken into the more regular form of the written word M M MANGASARIAN ORCHESTRA HALL CHICAGO Illustration Picture in Herculaneum of the Days of Pompeii Showing Cupid Crowned with a Cross PART I A PARABLE I am today twenty five hundred years old I have been dead for nearly as many years My place of birth was Athens my grave was not far from those of Xenophon and Plato within view of the white glory of Athens and the shimmering waters of the Aegean sea After sleeping in my grave for many centuries I awoke suddenly I cannot tell how nor why and was transported by a force beyond my control to this new day and this new city I arrived here at daybreak when the sky was still dull and drowsy As I approached the city I heard bells ringing and a little later I found the streets astir with throngs of well dressed people in family groups wending their way hither and thither Evidently they were not going to work for they were accompanied by their children in their best clothes and a pleasant expression was upon their faces This must be a day of festival and worship devoted to one of their gods I murmured to myself Looking about me I saw a gentleman in a neat black dress smiling and his hand extended to me with great cordiality He must have realized I was a stranger and wished to tender his hospitality to me I accepted it gratefully I clasped his hand He pressed mine We gazed for a moment silently into each other s eyes He understood my bewilderment amid my novel surroundings and offered to enlighten me He explained to me the ringing of the bells and the meaning of the holiday crowds moving in the streets It was Sunday Sunday before Christmas and the people were going to the House of God Of course you are going there too I said to my friendly guide Yes he answered I conduct the worship I am a priest A priest of Apollo I interrogated No no he replied raising his hand to command silence Apollo is not a god he was only an idol An idol I whispered taken by surprise I perceive you are a Greek he said to me and the Greeks he continued notwithstanding their distinguished accomplishments were an idolatrous people They worshipped gods that did not exist They built temples to divinities which were merely empty names empty names he repeated Apollo and Athene and the entire Olympian lot were no more than inventions of the fancy But the Greeks loved their gods I protested my heart clamoring in my breast They were not gods they were idols and the difference between a god and an idol is this an idol is a thing God is a living being When you cannot prove the existence of your god when you have never seen him nor heard his voice nor touched him when you have nothing provable about him he is an idol Have you seen Apollo Have you heard him Have you touched him No I said in a low voice Do you know of any one who has I had to admit that I did not He was an idol then and not a god But many of us Greeks I said have felt Apollo in our hearts and have been inspired by him You imagine you have returned my guide If he were really divine he would be living to this day Is he then dead I asked He never lived and for the last two thousand years or more his temple has been a heap of ruins I wept to hear that Apollo the god of light and music was no more that his fair temple had fallen into ruins and the fire upon his altar had been extinguished then wiping a tear from my eyes I said Oh but our gods were fair and beautiful our religion was rich and picturesque It made the Greeks a nation of poets orators artists warriors thinkers It made Athens a city of light it created the beautiful the true the good yes our religion was divine It had only one fault interrupted my guide What was that I inquired without knowing what his answer would be It was not true But I still believe in Apollo I exclaimed he is not dead I know he is alive Prove it he said to me then pausing for a moment if you produce him he said we shall all fall down and worship him Produce Apollo and he shall be our god Produce him I whispered to myself What blasphemy Then taking heart I told my guide how more than once I had felt Apollo s radiant presence in my heart and told him of the immortal lines of Homer concerning the divine Apollo Do you doubt Homer I said to him Homer the inspired bard Homer whose inkwell was as big as the sea whose imperishable page was Time Homer whose every word was a drop of light Then I proceeded to quote from Homer s Iliad the Greek Bible worshipped by all the Hellenes as the rarest Manuscript between heaven and earth I quoted his description of Apollo than whose lyre nothing is more musical than whose speech even honey is not sweeter I recited how his mother went from town to town to select a worthy place to give birth to the young god son of Zeus the Supreme Being and how he was born and cradled amid the ministrations of all the goddesses who bathed him in the running stream and fed him with nectar and ambrosia from Olympus Then I recited the lines which picture Apollo bursting his bands leaping forth from his cradle and spreading his wings like a swan soaring sunward declaring that he had come to announce to mortals the will of God Is it possible I asked that all this is pure fabrication a fantasy of the brain as unsubstantial as the air No no Apollo is not an idol He is a god and the son of a god The whole Greek world will bear me witness that I am telling the truth Then I looked at my guide to see what impression this outburst of sincere enthusiasm had produced upon him and I saw a cold smile upon his lips that cut me to the heart It seemed as if he wished to say to me You poor deluded pagan You are not intelligent enough to know that Homer was only a mortal after all and that he was writing a play in which he manufactured the gods of whom he sang that these gods existed only in his imagination and that today they are as dead as is their inventor the poet By this time we stood at the entrance of a large edifice which my guide said was the House of God As we walked in I saw innumerable little lights blinking and winking all over the spacious interior There were besides pictures altars and images all around me The air was heavy with incense a number of men in gorgeous vestments were passing to and fro bowing and kneeling before the various lights and images The audience was upon its knees enveloped in silence a silence so solemn that it awed me Observing my anxiety to understand the meaning of all this my guide took me aside and in a whisper told me that the people were celebrating the anniversary of the birthday of their beautiful Savior Jesus the Son of God So was Apollo the son of God I replied thinking perhaps that after all we might find ourselves in agreement with one another Forget Apollo he said with a suggestion of severity in his voice There is no such person He was only an idol If you were to search for Apollo in all the universe you would never find any one answering to his name or description Jesus he resumed is the Son of God He came to our earth and was born of a virgin Again I was tempted to tell my guide that that was how Apollo became incarnate but I restrained myself Then Jesus grew up to be a man continued my guide performing unheard of wonders such as treading the seas giving sight hearing and speech to the blind the deaf and the dumb converting water into wine feeding the multitudes miraculously predicting coming events and resurrecting the dead Of course of your gods too he added it is claimed that they performed miracles and of your oracles that they foretold the future but there is this difference the things related of your gods are a fiction the things told of Jesus are a fact and the difference between Paganism and Christianity is the difference between fiction and fact Just then I heard a wave of murmur like the rustling of leaves in a forest sweep over the bowed audience I turned about and unconsciously my Greek curiosity impelling me I pushed forward toward where the greater candle lights were blazing I felt that perhaps the commotion in the house was the announcement that the God Jesus was about to make his appearance and I wanted to see him I wanted to touch him or if the crowd were too large to allow me that privilege I wanted at least to hear his voice I who had never seen a god never touched one never heard one speak I who had believed in Apollo without ever having known anything provable about him I wanted to see the real God Jesus But my guide placed his hand quickly upon my shoulder and held me back I want to see Jesus I hastened turning toward him I said this reverently and in good faith Will he not be here this morning Will he not speak to his worshippers I asked again Will he not permit them to touch him to caress his hand to clasp his divine feet to inhale the ambrosial fragrance of his breath to bask in the golden light of his eyes to hear the music of his immaculate accents Let me too see Jesus I pleaded You cannot see him answered my guide with a trace of embarrassment in his voice He does not show himself any more I was too much surprised at this to make any immediate reply For the last two thousand years my guide continued it has not pleased Jesus to show himself to any one neither has he been heard from for the same number of years For two thousand years no one has either seen or heard Jesus I asked my eyes filled with wonder and my voice quivering with excitement No he answered Would not that then I ventured to ask impatiently make Jesus as much of an idol as Apollo And are not these people on their knees before a god of whose existence they are as much in the dark as were the Greeks of fair Apollo and of whose past they have only rumors such as Homer reports of our Olympian gods as idolatrous as the Athenians What would you say I asked my guide if I were to demand that you should produce Jesus and prove him to my eyes and ears as you have asked me to produce and prove Apollo What is the difference between a ceremony performed in honor of Apollo and one performed in honor of Jesus since it is as impossible to give oracular demonstration of the existence of the one as of the other If Jesus is alive and a god and Apollo is an idol and dead what is the evidence since the one is as invisible as inaccessible and as unproducible as the other And if faith that Jesus is a god proves him a god why will not faith in Apollo make him a god But if worshipping Jesus whom for the best part of the last two thousand years no man has seen heard or touched if building temples to him burning incense upon his altars bowing at his shrine and calling him God is not idolatry neither is it idolatry to kindle fire upon the luminous altars of the Greek Apollo God of the dawn master of the enchanted lyre he with the bow and arrow tipped with fire I am not denying I said that Jesus ever lived He may have been alive two thousand years ago but if he has not been heard from since if the same thing that happened to the people living at the time he lived has happened to him namely if he is dead then you are worshipping the dead which fact stamps your religion as idolatrous And then remembering what he had said to me about the Greek mythology being beautiful but not true I said to him Your temples are indeed gorgeous and costly your music is grand your altars are superb your litany is exquisite your chants are melting your incense and bells and flowers your gold and silver vessels are all in rare taste and I dare say your dogmas are subtle and your preachers eloquent but your religion has one fault it is not true Illustration Swastika Earlier Form of the Cross Illustration The Lamb in the Holy Sepulchre Mosaic of the IV Century Sarcophagus of Luc de Bearn Showing the Lamb on the Cross IN CONFIDENCE I shall speak in a straightforward way and shall say today what perhaps I should say tomorrow or ten years from now but shall say it today because I cannot keep it back because I have nothing better to say than the truth or what I hold to be the truth But why seek truths that are not pleasant We cannot help it No man can suppress the truth Truth finds a crack or crevice to crop out of it bobs up to the surface and all the volume and weight of waters can not keep it down Truth prevails Life death truth behold these three no power can keep back And since we are doomed to know the truth let us cultivate a love for it It is of no avail to cry over lost illusions to long for vanished dreams or to call to the departing gods to come back It may be pleasant to play with toys and dolls all our life but evidently we are not meant to remain children always The time comes when we must put away childish things and obey the summons of truth stern and high A people who fear the truth can never he a free people If what I will say is the truth do you know of any good reason why I should not say it And if for prudential reasons I should sometimes hold back the truth how would you know when I am telling what I believe to be the truth and when I am holding it back for reasons of policy The truth however unwelcome is not injurious it is error which raises false hopes which destroys degrades and pollutes and which sooner or later must be abandoned Was it not Spencer whom Darwin called our great philosopher who said Repulsive as is its aspect the hard fact which dissipates a cherished illusion is presently found to contain the germ of a more salutary belief Spain is decaying today because her teachers for policy s sake are withholding the disagreeable truth from the people Holy water and sainted bones can give a nation illusions and dreams but never strength A difficult subject is in the nature of a challenge to the mind One difficult task attempted is worth a thousand commonplace efforts completed The majority of people avoid the difficult and fear danger But he who would progress must even court danger Political and religious liberty were discovered through peril and struggle The world owes its emancipation to human daring Had Columbus feared danger America might have slept for another thousand years I have a difficult subject in hand It is also a delicate one But I am determined not only to know if it is possible the whole truth about Jesus but also to communicate that truth to others Some people can keep their minds shut I cannot I must share my intellectual life with the world If I lived a thousand years ago I might have collapsed at the sight of the burning stake but I feel sure I would have deserved the stake People say to me sometimes Why do you not confine yourself to moral and religious exhortation such as Be kind do good love one another et cetera But there is more of a moral tonic in the open and candid discussion of a subject like the one in hand than in a multitude of platitudes We feel our moral fiber stiffen into force and purpose under the inspiration of a peril dared for the advancement of truth Tell us what you believe is one of the requests frequently addressed to me I never deliver a lecture in which I do not either directly or indirectly give full and free expression to my faith in everything that is worthy of faith If I do not believe in dogma it is because I believe in freedom If I do not believe in one inspired book it is because I believe that all truth and only truth is inspired If I do not ask the gods to help us it is because I believe in human help so much more real than supernatural help If I do not believe in standing still it is because I believe in progress If I am not attracted by the vision of a distant heaven it is because I believe in human happiness now and here If I do not say Lord Lord to Jesus it is because I bow my head to a greater Power than Jesus to a more efficient Savior than he has ever been Science Oh he tears down but does not build up is another criticism about my work It is not true No preacher or priest is more constructive To build up their churches and maintain their creeds the priests pulled down and destroyed the magnificent civilization of Greece and Rome plunging Europe into the dark and sterile ages which lasted over a thousand years When Galileo waved his hands for joy because he believed he had enriched humanity with a new truth and extended the sphere of knowledge what did the church do to him It conspired to destroy him It shut him up in a dungeon Clapping truth into jail gagging the mouth of the student is that building up or tearing down When Bruno lighted a new torch to increase the light of the world what was his reward The stake During all the ages that the church had the power to police the world every time a thinker raised his head he was clubbed to death Do you think it is kind of us does it square with our sense of justice to call the priest constructive and the scientists and philosophers who have helped people to their feet helped them to self government in politics and to self help in life destructive Count your rights political religious social intellectual and tell me which of them was conquered for you by the priest He is irreverent is still another hasty criticism I have heard advanced against the rationalist I wish to tell you something But first let us be impersonal The epithets irreverent blasphemer atheist and infidel are flung at a man not from pity but from envy Not having the courage or the industry of our neighbor who works like a busy bee in the world of men and books searching with the sweat of his brow for the real bread of life wetting the open page before him with his tears pushing into the wee hours of the night his quest animated by the fairest of all loves the love of truth we ease our own indolent conscience by calling him names We pretend that it is not because we are too lazy or too selfish to work as hard or think as freely as he does but because we do not want to be as irreverent as he is that we keep the windows of our minds shut To excuse our own mediocrity we call the man who tries to get out of the rut a blasphemer And so we ask the world to praise our indifference as a great virtue and to denounce the conscientious toil and thought of another as blasphemy Illustration The Lamb Standing Upon the Gospels

none	none	 Century IS JESUS A MYTH What is a myth A myth is a fanciful explanation of a given phenomenon Observing the sun the moon and the stars overhead the primitive man wished to account for them This was natural The mind craves for knowledge The child asks questions because of an inborn desire to know Man feels ill at ease with a sense of a mental vacuum until his questions are answered Before the days of science a fanciful answer was all that could be given to man s questions about the physical world The primitive man guessed where knowledge failed him what else could he do A myth then is a guess a story a speculation or a fanciful explanation of a phenomenon in the absence of accurate information Many are the myths about the heavenly bodies which while we call them myths because we know better were to the ancients truths The Sun and Moon were once brother and sister thought the child man but there arose a dispute between them the woman ran away and the man ran after her until they came to the end of the earth where land and sky met The woman jumped into the sky and the man after her where they kept chasing each other forever as Sun and Moon Now and then they came close enough to snap at each other That was their explanation of an eclipse Childhood of the World Edward Clodd With this mythus the primitive man was satisfied until his developing intelligence realized its inadequacy Science was born of that realization During the middle ages it was believed by Europeans that in certain parts of the world in India for instance there were people who had only one eye in the middle of their foreheads and were more like monsters than humans This was imaginary knowledge which travel and research have corrected The myth of a one eyed people living in India has been replaced by accurate information concerning the Hindoos Likewise before the science of ancient languages was perfected before archaeology had dug up buried cities and deciphered the hieroglyphics on the monuments of antiquity most of our knowledge concerning the earlier ages was mythical that is to say it was knowledge not based on investigation but made to order Just as the theologians still speculate about the other world primitive man speculated about this world Even we moderns not very long ago believed for instance that the land of Egypt was visited by ten fantastic plagues that in one bloody night every first born in the land was slain that the angel of a tribal god dipped his hand in blood and printed a red mark upon the doors of the houses of the Jews to protect them from harm that Pharaoh and his armies were drowned in the Red Sea that the children of Israel wandered for forty years around Mount Sinai and so forth and so forth But now that we can read the inscriptions on the stone pages dug out of ancient ruins now that we can compel a buried world to reveal its secret and to tell us its story we do not have to go on making myths about the ancients Myths die when history is born It will be seen from these examples that there is no harm in myth making if the myth is called a myth It is when we use our fanciful knowledge to deny or to shut out real and scientific knowledge that the myth becomes a stumbling block And this is

none	none	the use to which myths have been put The king with his sword and the priest with his curses have supported the myth against science When a man pretends to believe that the Santa Claus of his childhood is real and tries to compel also others to play a part he becomes positively immoral There is no harm in believing in Santa Claus as a myth but there is in pretending that he is real because such an attitude of mind makes a mere trifle of truth Is Jesus a myth There is in man a faculty for fiction Before history was born there was myth before men could think they dreamed It was with the human race in its infancy as it is with the child The child s imagination is more active than its reason It is easier for it to fancy even than to see It thinks less than it guesses This wild flight of fancy is checked only by experience It is reflection which introduces a bit into the mouth of imagination curbing its pace and subduing its restless spirit It is then as we grow older and if I may use the word riper that we learn to distinguish between fact and fiction between history and myth In childhood we need playthings and the more fantastic and bizarre they are the better we are pleased with them We dream for instance of castles in the air gorgeous and clothed with the azure hue of the skies We fill the space about and over us with spirits fairies gods and other invisible and airy beings We covet the rainbow We reach out for the moon Our feet do not really begin to touch the firm ground until we have reached the years of discretion I know there are those who wish they could always remain children living in dreamland But even if this were desirable it is not possible Evolution is our destiny of what use is it then to take up arms against destiny Let it be borne in mind that all the religions of the world were born in the childhood of the race Science was not born until man had matured There is in this thought a world of meaning Children make religions Grown up people create science The cradle is the womb of all the fairies and faiths of mankind The school is the birthplace of science Religion is the science of the child Science is the religion of the matured man In the discussion of this subject I appeal to the mature not to the child mind I appeal to those who have cultivated a taste for truth who are not easily scared but who can screw their courage to the sticking point and follow to the end truth s leading The multitude is ever joined to its idols let them alone I speak to the discerning few There is an important difference between a lecturer and an ordained preacher The latter can command a hearing in the name of God or in the name of the Bible He does not have to satisfy his hearers about the reasonableness of what he preaches He is God s mouthpiece and no one may disagree with him He can also invoke the authority of the church and of the Christian world to enforce acceptance of his teaching The only way I may command your respect is to be reasonable You will not listen to me for God s sake nor for the Bible s sake nor yet for the love of heaven or the fear of hell My only protection is to be rational to be truthful In other words the preacher can afford to ignore common sense in the name of Revelation But if I depart from it in the least or am caught once playing fast and loose with the facts I will irretrievably lose my standing Illustration In Use Upon Heathen Altars Centuries Before Christianity Our answer to the question Is Jesus a Myth must depend more or less upon original research as there is very little written on the subject The majority of writers assume that a person answering to the description of Jesus lived some two thousand years ago Even the few who entertain doubts on the subject seem to hold that while there is a large mythical element in the Jesus story nevertheless there is a historical nucleus round which has clustered the elaborate legend of the Christ In all probability they argue there was a man called Jesus who said many helpful things and led an exemplary life and all the miracles and wonders represent the accretions of fond and pious ages Let us place ourselves entirely in the hands of the evidence As far as possible let us be passive showing no predisposition one way or another We can afford to be independent If the evidence proves the historicity of Jesus well and good if the evidence is not sufficient to prove it there is no reason why we should fear to say so besides it is our duty to inform ourselves on this question As intelligent beings we desire to know whether this Jesus whose worship is not only costing the world millions of the people s money but which is also drawing to his service the time the energies the affection the devotion and the labor of humanity is a myth or a reality We believe that all religious persecutions all sectarian wars hatreds and intolerance which still cramp and embitter our humanity would be replaced by love and brotherhood if the sects could be made to see that the God Jesus they are quarreling over is a myth a shadow to which credulity alone gives substance Like people who have been fighting in the dark fearing some danger the sects once relieved of the thraldom of a tradition which has been handed down to them by a childish age and country will turn around and embrace one another In every sense the subject is an all absorbing one It goes to the root of things it touches the vital parts and it means life or death to the Christian religion Illustration Ascension of Jesus Ninth Century Illustration Juno Nursing Her Divine Child Mars THE PROBLEM STATED Let me now give an idea of the method I propose to follow in the study of this subject Let us suppose that a student living in the year three thousand desired to make sure that such a man as Abraham Lincoln really lived and did the things attributed to him How would he go about it A man must have a birthplace and a birthday All the records agree as to where and when Lincoln was born This is not enough to prove his historicity but it is an important link in the chain Neither the place nor the time of Jesus birth is known There has never been any unanimity about this matter There has been considerable confusion and contradiction about it It cannot be proved that the twenty fifth of December is his birthday A number of other dates were observed by the Christian church at various times as the birthday of Jesus The Gospels give no date and appear to be quite uncertain really ignorant about it When it is remembered that the Gospels purport to have been written by Jesus intimate companions and during the lifetime of his brothers and mother their silence on this matter becomes significant The selection of the twenty fifth of December as his birthday is not only an arbitrary one but that date having been from time immemorial dedicated to the Sun the inference is that the Son of God and the Sun of heaven enjoying the same birthday were at one time identical beings The fact that Jesus death was accompanied with the darkening of the Sun and that the date of his resurrection is also associated with the position of the Sun at the time of the vernal equinox is a further intimation that we have in the story of the birth death and resurrection of Jesus an ancient and nearly universal Sun myth instead of verifiable historical events The story of Jesus for three days in the heart of the earth of Jonah three days in the belly of a fish of Hercules three days in the belly of a whale and of Little Red Riding Hood sleeping in the belly of a great black wolf represent the attempt of primitive man to explain the phenomenon of Day and Night The Sun is swallowed by a dragon a wolf or a whale which plunges the world into darkness but the dragon is killed and the Sun rises triumphant to make another Day This ancient Sun myth is the starting point of nearly all miraculous religions from the days of Egypt to the twentieth century Illustration The Persian God Mithra All the Gods Have the Solar Disc Around Their Heads Showing That Sun Worship Was One of the Earliest Forms of Religion The story which Mathew relates about a remarkable star which sailing in the air pointed out to some unnamed magicians the cradle or cave in which the wonder child was born helps further to identify Jesus with the Sun What became of this performing star or of the magicians and their costly gifts the records do not say It is more likely that it was the astrological predilections of the gospel writer which led him to assign to his God child a star in the heavens The belief that the stars determine human destinies is a very ancient one Such expressions in our language as ill starred a lucky star disaster lunacy and so on indicate the hold which astrology once enjoyed upon the human mind We still call a melancholy man Saturnine a cheerful man Jovial a quick tempered man Mercurial showing how closely our ancestors associated the movements of celestial bodies with human affairs Footnote Childhood of the World Edward Clodd The prominence therefore of the sun and stars in the Gospel story tends to show that Jesus is an astrological rather than a historical character That the time of his birth his death and supposed resurrection is not verifiable is generally admitted This uncertainty robs the story of Jesus to an extent at least of the atmosphere of reality The twenty fifth of December is celebrated as his birthday Yet there is no evidence that he was born on that day Although the Gospels are silent as to the date on which Jesus was born there is circumstantial evidence in the accounts given of the event to show that the twenty fifth of December could not have been his birthday It snows in Palestine though a warmer country and we know that in December there are no shepherds tending their flocks in the night time in that country Often at this time of the year the fields and hills are covered with snow Hence if the shepherds sleeping in the fields really saw the heavens open and heard the angel song in all probability it was in some other month of the year and not late in December We know also that early in the history of Christianity the months of May and June enjoyed the honor of containing the day of Jesus birth Illustration Isis Nursing Her Divine Child three thousand B C Of course it is immaterial on which day Jesus was born but why is it not known Yet not only is the date of his birth a matter of conjecture but also the year in which he was born Matthew one of the Evangelists suggests that Jesus was born in King Herod s time for it was this king who hearing from the Magi that a King of the Jews was born decided to destroy him but Luke another Evangelist intimates that Jesus was born when Quirinus was ruler of Judea which makes the date of Jesus birth about fourteen years later than the date given by Matthew Why this discrepancy in a historical document to say nothing about inspiration The theologian might say that this little difficulty was introduced purposely into the scriptures to establish its infallibility but it is only religious books that are pronounced infallible on the strength of the contradictions they contain Again Matthew says that to escape the evil designs of Herod Mary and Joseph with the infant Jesus fled into Egypt Luke says nothing about this hurried flight nor of Herod s intention to kill the infant Messiah On the contrary he tells us that after the forty days of purification were over Jesus was publicly presented at the temple where Herod if he really as Matthew relates wished to seize him could have done so without difficulty It is impossible to reconcile the flight to Egypt with the presentation in the temple and this inconsistency is certainly insurmountable and makes it look as if the narrative had no value whatever as history When we come to the more important chapters about Jesus we meet with greater difficulties Have you ever noticed that the day on which Jesus is supposed to have died falls invariably on a Friday What is the reason for this It is evident that nobody knows and nobody ever knew the date on which the Crucifixion took place if it ever took place It is so obscure and so mythical that an artificial day has been fixed by the Ecclesiastical councils While it is always on a Friday that the Crucifixion is commemorated the week in which the day occurs varies from year to year Good Friday falls not before the spring equinox but as soon after the spring equinox as the full moon allows thus making the calculation to depend upon the position of the sun in the Zodiac and the phases of the moon But that was precisely the way the day for the festival of the pagan goddess Oestera was determined The Pagan Oestera has become the Christian Easter Does not this fact as well as those already touched upon make the story of Jesus to read very much like the stories of the Pagan deities The early Christians Origin for instance in his reply to the rationalist Celsus who questioned the reality of Jesus instead of producing evidence of a historical nature appealed to the mythology of the pagans to prove that the story of Jesus was no more incredible than those of the Greek and Roman gods This is so important that we refer our readers to Origin s own words on the subject Before replying to Celsus it is necessary to admit that in the matter of history however true it might be writes this Christian Father it is often very difficult and sometimes quite impossible to establish its truth by evidence which shall be considered sufficient Footnote Origin Contre Celse one fifty eight et Suiv Ibid This is a plain admission that as early as the second and third centuries the claims put forth about Jesus did not admit of positive historical demonstration But in the absence of evidence Origin offers the following metaphysical arguments against the sceptical Celsus one Such stories as are told of Jesus are admitted to be true when told of pagan divinities why can they not also be true when told of the Christian Messiah two They must be true because they are the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies In other words the only proofs Origin can bring forth against the rationalistic criticism of Celsus is that to deny Jesus would be equivalent to denying both the Pagan and Jewish mythologies If Jesus is not real says Origin then Apollo was not real and the Old Testament prophecies have not been fulfilled If we are to have any mythology at all he seems to argue why object to adding to it the mythus of Jesus There could not be a more damaging admission than this from one of the most conspicuous defenders of Jesus story against early criticism Justin Martyr another early Father offers the following argument against unbelievers in the Christian legend When we say also that the Word which is the first birth of God was produced without sexual union and that he Jesus Christ our teacher was crucified died and rose again and ascended into heaven we propound nothing different from what you believe regarding those whom you esteem sons of Jupiter Footnote First Apology Chapter xxi Anti Nicene Library Which is another way of saying that the Christian mythus is very similar to the pagan and should therefore be equally true Pressing his argument further this interesting Father discovers many resemblances between what he himself is preaching and what the pagans have always believed For you know how many sons your esteemed writers ascribe to Jupiter Mercury the interpreting word he spells this word with a small w while in the above quotation he uses a capital w to denote the Christian incarnation and teacher of all Aesculapius who ascended to heaven one Hercules and Perseus and Bellerophon who though sprung from mortals rose to heaven on the horses of Pegasus Footnote Ibid If Jupiter can have Justin Martyr seems to reason half a dozen divine sons why cannot Jehovah have at least one Illustration The Unsexed Christ Naked In the Church of saint Antoine Tours France Instead of producing historical evidence or appealing to creditable documents as one would to prove the existence of a Caesar or an Alexander Justin Martyr draws upon pagan mythology in his reply to the critics of Christianity All he seems to ask for is that Jesus be given a higher place among the divinities of the ancient world To help their cause the Christian apologists not infrequently also changed the sense of certain Old Testament passages to make them support the miraculous stories in the New Testament For example having borrowed from Oriental books the story of the god in a manger surrounded by staring animals the Christian fathers introduced a prediction of this event into the following text from the book of Habakkuk in the Bible Accomplish thy work in the midst of the years in the midst of the years make known et cetera Footnote Hab iii two This Old Testament text appeared in the Greek translation as follows Thou shalt manifest thyself in the midst of two animals which was fulfilled of course when Jesus was born in a stable How weak must be one s case to resort to such tactics in order to command a following And when it is remembered that these follies were deemed necessary to prove the reality of what has been claimed as the most stupendous event in all history one can readily see upon how fragile a foundation is built the story of the Christian God man Let us continue Abraham Lincoln s associates and contemporaries are all known to history The immediate companions of Jesus appear to be on the other hand as mythical as he is himself Who was Matthew Who was Mark Who were John Peter Judas and Mary There is absolutely no evidence that they ever existed They are not mentioned except in the New Testament books which as we shall see are supposed copies of supposed originals If Peter ever went to Rome with a new doctrine how is it that no historian has taken note of him If Paul visited Athens and preached from Mars Hill how is it that there is no mention of him or of his strange Gospel in the Athenian chronicles For all we know both Peter and Paul may have really existed but it is only a guess as we have no means of ascertaining The uncertainty about the apostles of Jesus is quite in keeping with the uncertainty about Jesus himself The report that Jesus had twelve apostles seems also mythical The number twelve like the number seven or three or forty plays an important role in all Sun myths and points to the twelve signs of the Zodiac Jacob had twelve sons there were twelve tribes of Israel twelve months in the year twelve gates or pillars of heaven et cetera In many of the religions of the world the number twelve is sacred There have been few god saviors who did not have twelve apostles or messengers In one or two places in the New Testament Jesus is made to send out the seventy to evangelize the world Here again we see the presence of a myth It was believed that there were seventy different nations in the world to each nation an apostle Seventy wise men are supposed to have translated the Old Testament sitting in seventy different cells That is why their translation is called the Septuagint But it is all a legend as there is no evidence of seventy scholars working in seventy individual cells on the Hebrew Bible One of the Church Fathers declares that he saw these seventy cells with his own eyes He was the only one who saw them That the Twelve Apostles are fanciful may he inferred from the obscurity in which the greater number of them have remained Peter Paul John James Judas occupy the stage almost exclusively If Paul was an apostle we have fourteen instead of twelve Leaving out Judas and counting Matthias who was elected in his place we have thirteen apostles The number forty figures also in many primitive myths The Jews were in the wilderness for forty years Jesus fasted for forty days from the resurrection to the ascension were forty days Moses was on the mountain with God for forty days An account in which such scrupulous attention is shown to supposed sacred numbers is apt to be more artificial than real The biographers of Lincoln or of Socrates do not seem to be interested in numbers They write history not stories Again many of the contemporaries of Lincoln bear written witness to his existence The historians of the time the statesmen the publicists the chroniclers all seem to be acquainted with him or to have heard of him It is impossible to explain why the contemporaries of Jesus the authors and historians of his time do not take notice of him If Abraham Lincoln was important enough to have attracted the attention of his contemporaries how much more Jesus Is it reasonable to suppose that these Pagan and Jewish writers knew of Jesus had heard of his incomparably great works and sayings but omitted to give him a page or a line Could they have been in a conspiracy against him How else is this unanimous silence to be accounted for Is it not more likely that the wonder working Jesus was unknown to them And he was unknown to them because no such Jesus existed in their day Should the student looking into Abraham Lincoln s history discover that no one of his biographers knew positively just when he lived or where he was born he would have reason to conclude that because of this uncertainty on the part of the biographers he must be more exacting than he otherwise would have been That is precisely our position Of course there are in history great men of whose birthplaces or birthdays we are equally uncertain But we believe in their existence not because no one seems to know exactly when and where they were born but because there is overwhelming evidence corroborating the other reports about them and which is sufficient to remove the suspicion suggested by the darkness hanging over their nativity Is there any evidence strong enough to prove the historicity of Jesus in spite of the fact that not even his supposed companions writing during the lifetime of Jesus mother have any definite information to give But let us continue The reports current about a man like Lincoln are verifiable while many of those about Jesus are of a nature that no amount of evidence can confirm That Lincoln was President of these United States that he signed the Emancipation Proclamation and that he was assassinated can be readily authenticated But how can any amount of evidence satisfy one s self that Jesus was born of a virgin for instance Such a report or rumor can never even be examined it does not lend itself to evidence it is beyond the sphere of history it is not a legitimate question for investigation It belongs to mythology Indeed to put forth a report of that nature is to forbid the use of evidence and to command forcible acquiescence which to say the least is a very suspicious circumstance calculated to hurt rather than to help the Jesus story The report that Jesus was God is equally impossible of verification How are we to prove whether or not a certain person was God Jesus may have been a wonderful man but is every wonderful man a God Jesus may have claimed to have been a God but is every one who puts forth such a claim a God How then are we to decide which of the numerous candidates for divine honors should be given our votes And can we by voting for Jesus make him a God Observe to what confusion the mere attempt to follow such a report leads us A human Jesus may or may not have existed but we are as sure as we can be of anything that a virgin born God named Jesus such as we must believe in or be eternally lost is an impossibility except to credulity But credulity is no evidence at all even when it is dignified by the name of faith Let us pause for a moment to reflect The final argument for the existence of the miraculous Jesus preached in church and Sunday school these two thousand years as the sole savior of the world is an appeal to faith the same to which Mohammed resorts to establish his claims and Brigham Young to prove his revelation There is no other possible way by which the virgin birth or the godhood of a man can be established And such a faith is never free it is always maintained by the sword now and by hell fire hereafter Once more if it had been reported of Abraham Lincoln that he predicted his own assassination that he promised some of his friends they would not die until they saw him coming again upon the clouds of heaven that he would give them thrones to sit upon that they could safely drink deadly poisons in his name or that he would grant them any request which they might make provided they asked it for his sake we would be justified in concluding that such a Lincoln never existed Yet the most impossible utterances are put in Jesus mouth He is made to say Whatsoever ye shall ask in my name that will I do No man who makes such a promise can keep it It is not sayings like the above that can prove a man a God Has Jesus kept his promise Does he give his people everything or whatsoever they ask of him But it is answered Jesus only meant to say that he would give whatever he himself considered good for his friends to have Indeed Is that the way to crawl out of a contract If that is what he meant why did he say something else Could he not have said just what he meant in the first place Would it not have been fairer not to have given his friends any occasion for false expectations Better to promise a little and do more than to promise everything and do nothing But to say that Jesus really entered into any such agreement is to throw doubt upon his existence Such a character is too wild to be real Only a mythical Jesus could virtually hand over the government of the universe to courtiers who have petitions to press upon his attention Moreover if Jesus could keep his promise there would be today no misery in the world no orphans no childless mothers no shipwrecks no floods no famines no disease no crippled children no insanity no wars no crime no wrong Have not a thousand thousand prayers been offered in Jesus name against every evil which has ploughed the face of our earth Have these prayers been answered Then why is there discontent in the world Can the followers of Jesus move mountains drink deadly poisons touch serpents or work greater miracles than are ascribed to Jesus as it was promised that they would do How many self deluded prophets these extravagant claims have produced And who can number the bitter disappointments caused by such impossible promises George Jacob Holyoake of England tells how in the days of utter poverty his believing mother asked the Lord again and again on her knees with tears streaming from her eyes and with absolute faith in Jesus ability to keep His promise to give her starving children their daily bread But the more fervently she prayed the heavier grew the burden of her life A stone or wooden idol could not have been more indifferent to a mother s tears My mind aches as I think of those days writes mister Holyoake One day he went to see the reverend mister Cribbace who had invited inquirers to his house Do you really believe asked young Holyoake to the clergyman that what we ask in faith we shall receive It never struck me continues mister Holyoake that the preacher s threadbare dress his half famished look and necessity of taking up a collection the previous night to pay expenses showed that faith was not a source of income to him It never struck me that if help could be obtained by prayer no church would be needy no believer would be poor What answer did the preacher give to Holyoake s earnest question The same which the preachers of today give He parried his answer with many words and at length said that the promise was to be taken with the provision that what we asked for would be given if God thought it for our good Why then did not Jesus explain that important proviso when he made the promise Was Jesus only making a half statement the other half of which he would reveal later to protect himself against disappointed petitioners But he said If ye ask anything in my name I will do it and If it were not so I would have told you Did he not mean just what he said The truth is that no historical person in his senses ever made such extraordinary such impossible promises and the report that Jesus made them only goes to confirm that their author is only a legendary being When this truth dawned upon mister Holyoake he ceased to petition Heaven which was like dropping a bucket into an empty well and began to look elsewhere for help Footnote Bygones Worth Remembering George Jacob Holyoake The world owes its advancement to the fact that men no longer look to Heaven for help but help themselves Self effort and not prayer is the remedy against ignorance slavery poverty and moral degradation Fortunately by holding up before us an impossible Jesus with his impossible promises the churches have succeeded only in postponing but not in preventing the progress of man This is a compliment to human nature and it is well earned It is also a promise that in time humanity will be completely emancipated from every phantom which in the past has scared it into silence or submission and A loftier race than e er the world Hath known shall rise With flame of liberty in their souls And light of science in their eyes Illustration Portion of Manuscript Supposed to Be Copy of Lost Originals THE CHRISTIAN DOCUMENTS The documents containing the story of Jesus are so unlike those about Lincoln or any other historical character that we must be doubly vigilant in our investigation The Christians rely mainly on the four Gospels for the historicity of Jesus But the original documents of which the books in the New Testament are claimed to be faithful copies are not in existence There is absolutely no evidence that they ever were in existence This is a statement which can not be controverted Is it conceivable that the early believers lost through carelessness or purposely every document written by an apostle while guarding with all protecting jealousy and zeal the writings of anonymous persons Is there any valid reason why the contributions to Christian literature of an inspired apostle should perish while those of a nameless scribe are preserved why the original Gospel of Matthew should drop quietly out of sight no one knows how while a supposed copy of it in an alien language is preserved for many centuries Jesus himself it is admitted did not write a single line He had come according to popular belief to reveal the will of God a most important mission indeed and yet he not only did not put this revelation in writing during his lifetime and with his own hand which it is natural to suppose that a divine teacher expressly come from heaven would have done but he left this all important duty to anonymous chroniclers who naturally made enough mistakes to split up Christendom into innumerable factions It is worth a moment s pause to think of the persecutions the cruel wars and the centuries of hatred and bitterness which would have been spared our unfortunate humanity if Jesus himself had written down his message in the clearest and plainest manner instead of leaving it to his supposed disciples to publish it to the world when he could no longer correct their mistakes Moreover not only did Jesus not write himself but he has not even taken any pains to preserve the writings of his apostles It is well known that the original manuscripts if there were any are nowhere to be found This is a grave matter We have only supposed copies of supposed original manuscripts Who copied them When were they copied How can we be sure that these copies are reliable And why are there thousands upon thousands of various readings in these numerous supposed copies What means have we of deciding which version or reading to accept Is it possible that as the result of Jesus advent into our world we have only a basketful of nameless and dateless copies and documents Is it conceivable I ask that a God would send his Son to us and then leave us to wander through a pile of dusty manuscripts to find out why He sent His Son and what He taught when on earth The only answer the Christian church can give to this question is that the original writings were purposely allowed to perish When a precious document containing the testament of Almighty God and inscribed for an eternal purpose by the Holy Ghost disappears altogether there is absolutely no other way of accounting for its disappearance than by saying as we have suggested that its divine author must have intentionally withdrawn it from circulation God moves in a mysterious way is the last resort of the believer This is the one argument which is left to theology to fight science with Unfortunately it is an argument which would prove every cult and ism under the heavens true The Mohammedan the Mazdaian and the Pagan may also fall back upon faith There is nothing which faith can not cover up from the light But if a faith which ignores evidence be not a superstition what then is superstition I wonder if the Catholic Church which pretends to believe and which derives quite an income from the belief that God has miraculously preserved the wood of the cross the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem the coat of Jesus and quite a number of other mementos can explain why the original manuscripts were lost I have a suspicion that there were no original manuscripts I am not sure of this of course but if nails bones and holy places could be miraculously preserved why not also manuscripts It is reasonable to suppose that the Deity would not have permitted the most important documents containing His Revelation to drop into some hole and disappear or to be gnawed into dust by the insects after having had them written by special inspiration Again when these documents such as we find them are examined it will be observed that even in the most elementary intelligence which they pretend to furnish they are hopelessly at variance with one another It is for example utterly impossible to reconcile Matthew s genealogy of Jesus with the one given by Luke In copying the names of the supposed ancestors of Jesus they tamper with the list as given in the book of Chronicles in the Old Testament and thereby justly expose themselves to the charge of bad faith One evangelist says Jesus was descended from Solomon born of her that had been the wife of Urias It will be remembered that David ordered Urias killed in a cowardly manner that he may marry his widow whom he coveted According to Matthew Jesus is one of the offspring of this adulterous relation According to Luke it is not through Solomon but through Nathan that Jesus is connected with the house of David Again Luke tells us that the name of the father of Joseph was Heli Matthew says it was Jacob If the writers of the gospels were contemporaries of Joseph they could have easily learned the exact name of his father Again why do these biographers of Jesus give us the genealogy of Joseph if he was not the father of Jesus It is the genealogy of Mary which they should have given to prove the descent of Jesus from the house of David and not that of Joseph These irreconcilable differences between Luke Matthew and the other evangelists go to prove that these authors possessed no reliable information concerning the subjects they were writing about For if Jesus is a historical character and these biographers were really his immediate associates and were inspired besides how are we to explain their blunders and contradictions about his genealogy A good illustration of the mythical or unhistorical character of the New Testament is furnished by the story of John the Baptist He is first represented as confessing publicly that Jesus is the Christ that he himself is not worthy to unloose the latchet of his shoes and that Jesus is the Lamb of God who taketh away the sins of the world John was also present the gospels say when the heavens opened and a dove descended on Jesus head and he heard the voice from the skies crying He is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased Is it possible that a few chapters later this same John forgets his public confession the dove and the voice from heaven and actually sends two of his disciples to find out who this Jesus is Footnote Matthew xi The only way we can account for such strange conduct is that the compiler or editor in question had two different myths or stories before him and he wished to use them both A further proof of the loose and extravagant style of the Gospel writers is furnished by the concluding verse of the Fourth Gospel There are also many other things which Jesus did the which if they should be written every one I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that should be written This is more like the language of a myth maker than of a historian How much reliance can we put in a reporter who is given to such exaggeration To say that the world itself would be too small to contain the unreported sayings and doings of a teacher whose public life possibly did not last longer than a year and whose reported words and deeds fill only a few pages is to prove one s statements unworthy of serious consideration And it is worth our while to note also that the documents which have come down to our time and which purport to be the biographies of Jesus are not only written in an alien language that is to say in a language which was not that of Jesus and his disciples but neither are they dated or signed Jesus and his twelve apostles were Jews why are all the four Gospels written in Greek If they were originally written in Hebrew how can we tell that the Greek translation is accurate since we can not compare it with the originals And why are these Gospels anonymous Why are they not dated But as we shall say something more on this subject in the present volume we confine ourselves at this point to reproducing a fragment of the manuscript pages from which our Greek Translations have been made Footnote See page fifty seven It is admitted by scholars that owing to the difficulty of reading these ancient and imperfect and also conflicting texts an accurate translation is impossible But this is another way of saying that what the churches call the Word of God is not only the word of man but a very imperfect word at that The belief in Jesus then is founded on secondary documents altered and edited by various hands on lost originals and on anonymous manuscripts of an age considerably later than the events therein related manuscripts which contradict each other as well as themselves Such is clearly and undeniably the basis for the belief in a historical Jesus It was this sense of the insufficiency of the evidence which drove the missionaries of Christianity to commit forgeries If there was ample evidence for the historicity of Jesus why did his biographers resort to forgery The following admissions by Christian writers themselves show the helplessness of the early preachers in the presence of inquirers who asked for proofs The church historian Mosheim writes that The Christian Fathers deemed it a pious act to employ deception and fraud Footnote Ecclesiastical Hist Vol I P two hundred forty seven Again he says The greatest and most pious teachers were nearly all of them infected with this leprosy Will not some believer tell us why forgery and fraud were necessary to prove the historicity of Jesus Another historian Milman writes that Pious fraud was admitted and avowed by the early missionaries of Jesus It was an age of literary frauds writes Bishop Ellicott speaking of the times immediately following the alleged crucifixion of Jesus doctor Giles declares that There can be no doubt that great numbers of books were written with no other purpose than to deceive And it is the opinion of doctor Robertson Smith that There was an enormous floating mass of spurious literature created to suit party views Books which are now rejected as apochryphal were at one time received as inspired and books which are now believed to be infallible were at one time regarded as of no authority in the Christian world It certainly is puzzling that there should be a whole literature of fraud and forgery in the name of a historical person But if Jesus was a myth we can easily explain the legends and traditions springing up in his name The early followers of Jesus then realizing the force of this objection did actually resort to interpolation and forgery in order to prove that Jesus was a historical character One of the oldest critics of the Christian religion was a Pagan known to history under the name of Porphyry yet the early Fathers did not hesitate to tamper even with the writings of an avowed opponent of their religion After issuing an edict to destroy among others the writings of this philosopher a work called Philosophy of Oracles was produced in which the author is made to write almost as a Christian and the name of Porphyry was signed to it as its author saint Augustine was one of the first to reject it as a forgery Footnote Geo W Foote Crimes of Christianity A more astounding invention than this alleged work of a heathen bearing witness to Christ is difficult to produce Do these forgeries these apocryphal writings these interpolations freely admitted to have been the prevailing practice of the early Christians help to prove the existence of Jesus And when to this wholesale manufacture of doubtful evidence is added the terrible vandalism which nearly destroyed every great Pagan classic we can form an idea of the desperate means to which the early Christians resorted to prove that Jesus was not a myth It all goes to show how difficult it is to make a man out of a myth Illustration The Goddess Mother in the Grecian Pantheon VIRGIN BIRTHS Stories of gods born of virgins are to be found in nearly every age and country There have been many virgin mothers and Mary with her child is but a recent version of a very old and universal myth In China and India in Babylonia and Egypt in Greece and Rome divine beings selected from among the daughters of men the purest and most beautiful to serve them as a means of entrance into the world of mortals Wishing to take upon themselves the human form while retaining at the same time their divinity this compromise of an earthly mother with a divine father was effected In the form of a swan Jupiter approached Leda as in the guise of a dove or a Paracletus Jehovah overshadowed Mary A nymph bathing in a river in China is touched by a lotus plant and the divine Fohi is born In Siam a wandering sunbeam caresses a girl in her teens and the great and wonderful

we find carved on one of the walls of the great temple of Luxor a picture of the annunciation conception and birth of King Amunothph III an almost exact copy of the annunciation conception and birth of the Christian God Of course no one will think of maintaining that the Egyptians borrowed the idea from the Catholics nearly two thousand years before the Christian era The story in the Gospel of

of Luke s Gospel Massey gives a more minute description of the Luxor picture The first scene on the left hand shows the god Taht the divine Word or Loges in the act of hailing the virgin queen announcing to her that she is to give birth to a son In the second scene the god Kneph assisted by Hathor gives life to her This is the Holy Ghost or Spirit that causes conception Next the mother is seated on the midwife s stool and the child is supported in the hands of one of the nurses The fourth scene is that of the adoration Here the child is enthroned receiving homage from the gods and gifts from men Footnote Natural Genesis Massey Vol II P three hundred ninety eight The picture on the wall of the Luxor temple then is one of the sources to which the anonymous writers of the Gospels went for their miraculous story It is no wonder they suppressed their own identity as well as the source from which they borrowed their material Not only the idea of a virgin mother but all the other miraculous events such as the stable cradle the guiding star the massacre of the children the flight to Egypt and the resurrection and bodily ascension toward the clouds have not only been borrowed but are even scarcely altered in the New Testament story of Jesus Illustration The Nativity of the God Dionysius Museum of Naples That the early Christians borrowed the legend of Jesus from earthly sources is too evident to be even questioned Gerald Massey in his great work on Egyptian origins demonstrates the identity of Mary the mother of Jesus with Isis the mother of Horus He says The most ancient gold bedizened smoke stained Byzantine pictures of the virgin and child represent the mythical mother as Isis and not as a human mother of Nazareth Footnote Vol ii P four hundred eighty seven Science and research have made this fact so certain that on the one hand ignorance and on the other interest only can continue to claim inspiration for the authors of the undated and unsigned fragmentary documents which pass for the Word of God If then Jesus is stripped of all the borrowed legends and miracles of which he is the subject and if we also take away from him all the teachings which collected from Jewish and Pagan sources have been attributed to him what will be left of him That the ideas put in his mouth have been culled and compiled from other sources is as demonstrable as the Pagan origin of the legends related of him Nearly every one of the dogmas and ceremonies in the Christian cult were borrowed from other and older religions The resurrection myth the ascension the eucharisty baptism worship by kneeling or prostration the folding of the hands on the breast the ringing of bells and the burning of incense the vestments and vessels used in church the candles holy water even the word Mass were all adopted and adapted by the Christians from the religions of the ancients The Trinity is as much Pagan as much Indian or Buddhist as it is Christian The idea of a Son of God is as old as the oldest cult The sun is the son of heaven in all primitive faiths The physical sun becomes in the course of evolution the Son of Righteousness or the Son of God and heaven is personified as the Father on High The halo around the head of Jesus the horns of the older deities the rays of light radiating from the heads of Hindu and Pagan gods are incontrovertible evidence that all gods were at one time the sun in heaven Illustration Prehistoric Crosses Discovered in Pagan Sepulchres Italy THE ORIGIN OF THE CROSS Only the uninformed of whom we regret to say there are a great many and who are the main support of the old religions still believe that the cross originated with Christianity Like the dogmas of the Trinity the virgin birth and the resurrection the sign of the cross or the cross as an emblem or a symbol was borrowed from the more ancient faiths of Asia Perhaps one of the most important discoveries which primitive man felt obliged never to be ungrateful enough to forget was the production of fire by the friction of two sticks placed across each other in the form of a cross As early as the stone age we find the cross carved on monuments which have been dug out of the earth and which can be seen in the museums of Europe On the coins of later generations as well as on the altars of prehistoric times we find the sacred symbol of the cross The dead in ancient cemeteries slept under the cross as they do in our day in Catholic churchyards Illustration House of Goodness with Cross Egyptian two thousand B C In ancient Egypt as in modern China India Corea the cross is venerated by the masses as a charm of great power In the Musee Guimet in Paris we have seen specimens of pre Christian crosses In the Louvre Museum one of the heathen gods carries a cross on his head During his second journey to New Zealand Cook was surprised to find the natives marking the graves of their dead with the cross We saw in the Museum of saint Germain an ancient divinity of Gaul before the conquest of the country by Julius Caesar wearing a garment on which was woven a cross In the same museum an ancient altar of Gaul under Paganism had a cross carved upon it That the cross was not adopted by the followers of Jesus until a later date may be inferred from the silence of the earlier gospels Matthew Mark and Luke on the details of the crucifixion which is more fully developed in the later gospel of John The first three evangelists say nothing about the nails or the blood and give the impression that he was hanged Writing of the two thieves who were sentenced to receive the same punishment Luke says One of the malefactors that was hanged with him The idea of a bleeding Christ such as we see on crosses in Catholic churches is not present in these earlier descriptions of the crucifixion the Christians of the time of Origin were called the followers of the god who was hanged In the fourth gospel we see the beginnings of the legend of the cross of Jesus carrying or falling under the weight of the cross of the nail prints in his hands and feet of the spear drawing the blood from his side and smearing his body Of all this the first three evangelists are quite ignorant Illustration Pagan Priest of Herculaneum Wearing the Cross Illustration Cross of the Chinese Emperor Fou Hi twenty nine fifty three Years Before Christ Illustration Discovered in Newgrange Ireland An Ancient Pagan Cross Let it be further noted that it was not until eight hundred years after the supposed crucifixion that Jesus is seen in the form of a human being on the cross Not in any of the paintings on the ancient catacombs is found a crucified Christ The earliest cross bearing a human being is of the eighth century For a long time a lamb with a cross or on a cross was the Christian symbol and it is a lamb which we see entombed in the holy sepulchre In more than one mosaic of early Christian times it is not Jesus but a lamb which is bleeding for the salvation of the world How a lamb came to play so important a role in Christianity is variously explained The similarity between the name of the Hindu god Agni and the meaning of the same word in Latin which is a lamb is one theory Another is that a ram one of the signs of the zodiac often confounded by the ancients with a lamb is the origin of the popular reverence for the lamb as a symbol a reverence which all religions based on sun worship shared The lamb in Christianity takes away the sins of the people just as the paschal lamb did in the Old Testament and earlier still just as it did in Babylonia Illustration Used by a Priest of Bacchus Showing the Cross Illustration Engraving of the XI Century Illustration Lamb on Cross Illustration From a Picture in the Church of Genest A Lamb Carrying the Cross Illustration The Lamb and the Cross IX Century To the same effect is the following letter of the bishop of Mende in France bearing date of the year eight hundred A D Because the darkness has disappeared and because also Christ is a real man Pope Adrian commands us to paint him under the form of a man The lamb of God must not any longer be painted on a cross but after a human form has been placed on the cross there is no objection to have a lamb also represented with it either at the foot of the cross or on the opposite side Footnote Translated from the French of Didron Quoted by Malvert We leave it to our readers to draw the necessary conclusions from the above letter How did a lamb hold its place on the cross for eight hundred years If Jesus was really crucified and that fact was a matter of history why did it take eight hundred years for a Christian bishop to write now that Christ is a real man et cetera Today it would be considered a blasphemy to place a lamb on a cross On the tombstones of Christians of the fourth century are pictures representing not Jesus but a lamb working the miracles mentioned in the gospels such as multiplying the loaves and fishes and raising Lazarus from the dead Illustration Mosaic of saint Praxedes V Century Showing the Lamb Christ Illustration The Lamb Slowly Becoming Human Illustration The Lamb Multiplying the

to replace altogether Gradually the robe disappears from the crucified one until we see him crucified as in the adjoining picture with hardly any clothes on and wearing an expression of great agony Illustration Modern Christ Illustration Christ and the Twelve Apostles Carrying Swastikas and Solar Discs Instead of the Cross Sarcophagus Milan THE SILENCE OF PROFANE WRITERS In all historical matters we cannot ask for more than a reasonable assurance concerning any question In fact absolute certainty in any branch of human knowledge with the exception of mathematics perhaps is impossible We are finite beings limited in all our powers and hence our conclusions are not only relative but they should ever be held subject to correction When our law courts send a man to the gallows they can have no more than a reasonable assurance that he is guilty when they acquit him they can have no more than a reasonable assurance that he is innocent Positive assurance is unattainable The dogmatist is the only one who claims to possess absolute certainty But his claim is no more than a groundless assumption When therefore we learn that Josephus for instance who lived in the same country and about the same time as Jesus and wrote an extensive history of the men and events of his day and country does not mention Jesus except by interpolation which even a Christian clergyman Bishop Warburton calls a rank forgery and a very stupid one too we can be reasonably sure that no such Jesus as is described in the New Testament lived about the same time and in the same country with Josephus The failure of such a historian as Josephus to mention Jesus tends to make the existence of Jesus at least reasonably doubtful Few Christians now place any reliance upon the evidence from Josephus The early Fathers made this Jew admit that Jesus was the Son of God Of course the admission was a forgery De Quincey says the passage is known to be a forgery by all men not lunatics Of one other supposed reference in Josephus Canon Farrar says This passage was early tampered with by the Christians The same writer says this of a third passage Respecting the third passage in Josephus the only question is whether it be partly or entirely spurious Lardner the great English theologian was the first man to prove that Josephus was a poor witness for Christ In examining the evidence from profane writers we must remember that the silence of one contemporary author is more important than the supposed testimony of another There was living in the same time with Jesus a great Jewish scholar by the name of Philo He was an Alexandrian Jew and he visited Jerusalem while Jesus was teaching and working miracles in the holy city Yet Philo in all his works never once mentions Jesus He does not seem to have heard of him He could not have helped mentioning him if he had really seen him or heard of him In one place in his works Philo is describing the difference between two Jewish names Hosea and Jesus Jesus he says means saviour of the people What a fine opportunity for him to have added that at that very time there was living in Jerusalem a saviour by the name of Jesus or one supposed to be or claiming to be a saviour He could not have helped mentioning Jesus if he had ever seen or heard of him We have elsewhere referred to the significant silence of the Pagan historians and miscellaneous writers on the wonderful events narrated in the New Testament But a few remarks may be added here in explanation of the supposed testimony of Tacitus The quotation from Tacitus is an important one That part of the passage which concerns us is something like this They have their denomination from Chrestus put to death as a criminal by Pontius Pilate during the reign of Tiberius I wish to say in the first place that this passage is not in the History of Tacitus known to the ancients but in his Annals which is not quoted by any ancient writer The Annals of Tacitus were not known to be in existence until the year fourteen sixty eight An English writer mister Ross has undertaken in an interesting volume to show that the Annals were forged by an Italian Bracciolini I am not competent to say whether or not mister Ross proves his point But is it conceivable that the early Christians would have ignored so valuable a testimony had they known of its existence and would they not have known of it had it really existed The Christian Fathers who not only collected assiduously all that they could use to establish the reality of Jesus but who did not hesitate even to forge passages to invent documents and also to destroy the testimony of witnesses unfavorable to their cause would have certainly used the Tacitus passage had it been in existence in their day Not one of the Christian Fathers in his controversy with the unbelievers has quoted the passage from Tacitus which passage is the church s strongest proof of the historicity of Jesus outside the gospels But to begin with this passage has the appearance at least of being penned by a Christian It speaks of such persecutions of the Christians in Rome which contradict all that we know of Roman civilization The abuse of Christians in the same passage may have been introduced purposely to cover up the identity of the writer The terrible outrages against the Christians mentioned in the text from Tacitus are supposed to have taken place in the year sixty four A D According to the New Testament Paul was in Rome from the year sixty three to the year sixty five and must therefore have been an eye witness of the persecution under Nero Let me quote from the Bible to show that there could have been no such persecution as the Tacitus passage describes The last verse in the book of Acts reads And he Paul abode two whole years in his own hired dwelling and received all that went in unto him preaching the kingdom of God and teaching things concerning the Lord Jesus Christ with all boldness none forbidding him How is this picture of peace and tranquility to be reconciled with the charge that the Romans rolled up the Christians in straw mats and burned them to illuminate the streets at night and also that the lions were let loose upon the disciples of Jesus Moreover it is generally known that the Romans were indifferent to religious propaganda and never persecuted any sect or party in the name of religion In Rome the Jews were free to be Jews why should the Jewish Christians and the early Christians were Jews have been thrown to the lions In all probability the persecutions were much milder than the Tacitus passage describes and politics was the real cause Until not very long ago it was universally believed that William Tell was a historical character But it is now proven beyond any reasonable doubt that Tell and his apple are altogether mythical Notwithstanding that a great poet has made him the theme of a powerful drama and a great composer devoted one of his operas to his heroic achievements notwithstanding also that the Swiss show the crossbow with which he is supposed to have shot at the apple on his son s head he is now admitted to be only a legendary hero The principal arguments which have led the educated world to revise its views concerning William Tell are that the Swiss historians Faber and Hamurbin who lived shortly after the hero and who wrote the history of their country as Josephus did that of his do not mention Tell Had such a man existed before their time they could not have failed to refer to him Their complete silence is damaging beyond help to the historicity of Tell Neither does the historian who was an eye witness of the battle of Morgarten in thirteen fifteen mention the name of Tell The Zurich Chronicle of fourteen ninety seven also omits to refer to his story In the accounts of the struggle of the Swiss against Austria which drove the former into rebellion and ultimate independence Tell s name cannot be found Yet all these arguments are not half so damaging to the William Tell story as the silence of Josephus is to the Jesus story Jesus was supposed to have worked greater wonders and to have created a wider sensation than Tell therefore it is more difficult to explain the silence of historians like Josephus Pliny and Quintilian or of philosophers like Philo Seneca and Epictetus concerning Jesus than to explain the silence of the Swiss chroniclers concerning Tell THE JESUS STORY A RELIGIOUS DRAMA We have now progressed far enough in our investigation to pause a moment for reflection before we proceed any further I am conscious of no intentional misrepresentation or suppression of the facts relating to the question in hand If I have erred through ignorance I shall correct any mistake I may have made if some good reader will take the trouble to enlighten me I am also satisfied that I have not commanded the evidence but have allowed the evidence to command me I am not interested in either proving or disproving the existence of the New Testament Jesus I am not an advocate I am rather an umpire who hears the evidence and pronounces his decision accordingly Let the lawyers or the advocates argue pro and con I only weigh and I am sure impartially the evidence which the witnesses offer We have heard and examined quite a number of these and I at least am compelled to say that unless stronger evidence be forthcoming a historical Jesus has not been proven by the evidence thus far taken in This does not mean that there is no evidence whatever that Jesus was a real existence but that the evidence is not enough to prove it To condemn or to acquit a man in a court of law there must not only be evidence but enough of it to justify a decision There is some evidence for almost any imaginable proposition but that is not enough Not only does the evidence offered to prove Jesus historicity already examined fail to give this assurance but on the contrary it lends much support to the opposite supposition namely that in all probability Jesus was a myth even as Mithra Osiris Isis Hercules Sampson Adonis Moses Attis Hermes Heracles Apollo of Tyanna Chrishna and Indra were myths The story of Jesus we are constrained to say possesses all the characteristics of the religious drama full of startling episodes thrilling situations dramatic action and denouement It reads more like a play than plain history From such evidence as the gospels themselves furnish the conclusion that he was no more than the principal character in a religious play receives much support Mystery and morality plays are of a very ancient origin In earlier times almost all popular instruction was by means of Tableaux vivant As a great scenic or dramatic performance with Jesus as the hero Judas as the villain with conspiracy as its plot and the trial the resurrection and ascension as its finale the story is intelligent enough For instance as the curtain rises it discloses upon the stage shepherds tending their flocks in the green fields under the moonlit sky again as the scene shifts the clouds break the heavens open and voices are heard from above with a white winged chorus chanting an anthem The next scene suggests a stable with the cattle in their stalls munching hay In a corner of the stable close to a manger imagine a young woman stooping to kiss a newly born babe Anon appear three bearded and richly costumed men with presents in their hands bowing their heads in ecstatic adoration Surely enough this is not history It does not read like history The element of fiction runs through the entire Gospels and is its warp and woof A careful analysis of the various incidents in this ensemble will not fail to convince the unprejudiced reader that while they possess all the essentials for dramatic presentation they lack the requirements of real history The opened heavens angel choirs grazing flocks watchful shepherds worshiping magicians the stable crib the mother and child the wonderful star the presents the anthem all these while they fit admirably as stage setting are questionable material for history No historical person was ever born in so spectacular a manner The Gospel account of Jesus is an embellished ornamental even sensationally dramatic creation to serve as an introduction for a legendary hero Similar theatrical furniture has been used thousands of times to introduce other legendary characters All the Savior Gods were born supernaturally They were all half god half man They were all of royal descent Miracles and wonders attended their birth Jesus was not an exception We reject as mythical the birth stories about Mithra and Apollo Why accept as history those about Jesus It rests with the preachers of Christianity to show that while the god man of Persia or of Greece for example was a myth the god man of Palestine is historical The dramatic element is again plainly seen in the account of the betrayal of Jesus Jesus who preaches daily in the temples and in the public places who talks to the multitude on the mountain and at the seaside who feeds thousands by miracle the report of whose wonderful cures has reached the ends of the earth and who is often followed by such a crush that to reach him an opening has to be made in the ceiling of the house where he is stopping who goes in and out before the people and is constantly disputing with the elders and leaders of the nation is nevertheless represented as being so unknown that his enemies have to resort to the device of bribing with thirty silver coins one of his disciples to point him out to them and which is to be done by a kiss This might make a great scene upon the stage but it is not the way things happen in life Then read how Jesus is carried before Pilate the Roman governor and how while he is being tried a courier rushes in with a letter from Pilate s wife which is dramatically torn open and read aloud in the presence of the crowded court The letter it is said was about a dream of Pilate s wife in which some ghost tells her that Jesus is innocent and that her husband should not proceed against him Is this history Roman jurisprudence had not degenerated to that extent as to permit the dreams of a woman or of a man to influence the course of justice But this letter episode was invented by the playwright if I may use the phrase to prolong the dramatic suspense to complicate the situation to twist the plot and thereby render the impression produced by his piece more lasting The letter and the dream did not save Jesus Pilate was not influenced by his dreaming wife She dreamed in vain In the next place we hear Pilate pronouncing Jesus guiltless but forthwith he hands him over to the Jews to be killed Does this read like history Did ever a Roman court witness such a trial To pronounce a man innocent and then to say to his prosecutors If you wish to kill him you may do so is extraordinary conduct Then proceeding Pilate takes water and ostentatiously washes his hands a proceeding introduced by a Greek or Latin scribe who wished in all probability to throw the blame of the crucifixion entirely upon the Jews Pilate representing the Gentile world washes his hands of the responsibility for the death of Jesus while the Jews are made to say His blood be upon us and our children Imagine the clamoring howling Jews trampling on one another gesticulating furiously gnashing their teeth foaming at the mouth and spitting in one another s face as they shout Crucify him Crucify him A very powerful stage setting to be sure but it is impossible to imagine that such disorder such anarchy could be permitted in any court of justice But think once more of those terrible words placed in the mouths of the Jews His blood be upon us and our children Think of a people openly cursing themselves and asking the whole Christian world to persecute them forever His blood be upon us and our children Next the composers of the gospels conduct us to the Garden of Gethsemane that we may see there the hero of the play in his agony fighting the great battle of his life alone with neither help nor sympathy from his distracted followers He is shown to us there on his knees crying tears of blood sobbing and groaning under the shadow of an almost crushing fear Tremblingly he prays Let this cup pass from me if it be possible and then yielding to the terror crowding in upon him he sighs in the hearing of all the ages The spirit is willing but the flesh is weak precisely the excuse given by everybody for not doing what they would do if they could Now we ask in all seriousness is it likely that a God who had come down from heaven purposely to drink that cup and to be the martyr Savior of humanity would seek to be spared the fate for which he was ordained from all eternity The objection that Jesus hesitation on the eve of the crucifixion as well as his cry of despair on the cross were meant to show that he was as human as he was divine does not solve the difficulty In that event Jesus then was merely acting feigning a fear which he did not feel and pretending to dread a death which he knew could not hurt him If however Jesus really felt alarmed at the approach of death how much braver then were many of his followers who afterwards faced dangers and tortures far more cruel than his own We honestly think that to have put in Jesus mouth the words above quoted and also to have represented him as closing his public career with a shriek on the cross My God my God why hast thou forsaken me was tantamount to an admission by the writers that they were dealing with a symbolic Christ an ideal figure the hero of a play and not a historical character It is highly dramatic to be sure to see the sun darkened to feel the whole earth quaking to behold the graves ripped open and the dead reappear in their shrouds to hear the hero himself tearing his own heart with that cry of shuddering anguish My God my God but it is not history If such a man as Jesus really lived then his biographers have only given us a caricature of him However beautiful some of the sayings attributed to Jesus and whatever the source they may have been borrowed from they are not enough to prove his historicity But even as the Ten Commandments do not prove Moses to have been a historical personage or the author of the books and deeds attributed to him neither do the parables and miracles of Jesus prove him to have once visited this earth as a god or to have even existed as a man Socrates and Jesus Compare the quite natural behavior of Socrates in prison with that of Jesus in the Garden of Gethsemane The Greek sage is serene Jesus is alarmed The night agony of his soul his tears of blood his pitiful collapse when he prays if it be possible let this cup pass from me all this would be very impressive on the boards but they seem incredible of a real man engaged in saving a world Once more we say that the defense that it was the man in Jesus and not the god in him that broke down would be unjust to the memory of thousands of martyrs who died by a more terrible death than that of Jesus As elsewhere stated but which cannot be too often emphasized what man would not have embraced death with enthusiasm without a moment s misgiving did he think that by his death death and sin would be no more Who would shrink from a cross which is going to save millions to millions added from eternal burnings He must be a phantom indeed who trembles and cries like a frightened child because he cannot have the crown without the cross What a spectacle for the real heroes crowding the galleries of history It is difficult to see the shrinking and shuddering Savior of the world his face bathed in perspiration blood oozing out of his forehead his lips pale his voice breaking into a shriek My God my God why hast thou forsaken me it is difficult to witness all this and not to pity him Poor Jesus he is going to save the world but who is going to save him If we compare the trial of Jesus with that of Socrates the fictitious nature of the former cannot possibly escape detection Socrates was so well known in Athens that it was not necessary for his accusers to bribe one of his disciples to betray him Jesus should have been even better known in Jerusalem than Socrates was in Athens He was daily preaching in the synagogues and his miracles had given him an eclat which Socrates did not enjoy Socrates is not taken to court at night bound hand and feet Jesus is arrested in the glare of torchlights after he is betrayed by Judas with a kiss then he is bound and forced into the high priest s presence All this is admirable setting for a stage but they are no more than that The disciples of Socrates behave like real men those of Jesus are actors They run away they hide and follow at a distance One of them curses him The cock crows the apostate repents This reads like a play In the presence of his judges Socrates makes his own defense One by one he meets the charges Jesus refused according to two of the evangelists to open his mouth at his trial This is dramatic but it is not history It is not conceivable that a real person accused as Jesus was would have refused a great opportunity to disprove the charges against him Socrates defense of himself is one of the classics Jesus silence is a conundrum But he answered nothing But Jesus as yet answered nothing And he answered him never a word is the report of two of his biographers The other two evangelists as is usual contradict the former and produce the following dialogues between Jesus and his judges which from beginning to end possess all the marks of unreality Pilate Art thou the King of the Jews Jesus Sayest thou this thing of thyself or did others tell it thee of me Pilate Art thou a King Jesus Thou sayest that I am a King Is it possible that a real man not to say the Savior of the world would give such unmeaning and evasive replies to straightforward questions Does it not read like a page from fiction In the presence of the priests of his own race Jesus is as indefinite and sophistical as he is before the Roman Pilate The Priests Art thou the Christ tell us Jesus If I tell you ye will not believe me The Priests Art thou the Son of God Jesus Ye say that I am In the first answer he refuses to reveal himself because he does not think he can command belief in himself in his second answer he either blames them for saying he was the Son of God or quotes their own testimony to prove that he is the Son of God But if they believed he was God would they try to kill him Is it not unthinkable He intimates that the priests believe he is the Son of God Ye say that I am Surely it is more probable that these dialogues were invented by his anonymous biographers than that they really represent an actual conversation between Jesus and his judges Compare in the next place the manner in which the public trials of Socrates and Jesus are conducted There is order in the Athenian court there is anarchy in the Jerusalem court Witnesses and accusers walk up to Jesus and slap him on the face and the judge does not reprove them for it The court is in the hands of rowdies and hoodlums who shout Crucify him and again Crucify him A Roman judge while admitting that he finds no guilt in Jesus deserving of death is nevertheless represented as handing him over to the mob to be killed after he has himself scourged him No Roman judge could have behaved as this Pilate is reported to have behaved toward an accused person on trial for his life All that we know of civilized government all that we know of the jurisprudence of Rome contradicts this inspired account of a pretended historical event If Jesus was ever tried and condemned to death in a Roman court an account of it that can command belief has yet to be written Again when we come to consider the random disconnected and fragmentary form in which the teachings of Jesus are presented we cannot avoid the conclusion that he is a dramatis persona brought upon the stage to give expression not to a consistent connected and carefully worked out thought but to voice with many breaks and interruptions the ideas of his changing managers He is made to play a number of contradictory roles and appears in the same story in totally different characters One editor or compiler of the Gospel describes Jesus as an ascetic and a mendicant wandering from place to place without a roof over his head and crawling at eventide into his cave in the Mount of Olives He introduces him as the Man of Sorrows fasting in the wilderness counseling people to part with their riches and promising the Kingdom of Heaven to Lazarus the beggar Another redactor announces him as eating and drinking at the banquets of publicans and sinners a wine bibbing Son of Man John the Baptist came neither eating nor drinking but the Son of Man came both eating and drinking which if it means anything means that Jesus was the very opposite of the ascetic John A partisan of the doctrine of non resistance puts in Jesus mouth the words Resist not evil The meek shall inherit the earth et cetera and counsels that he who smites us on the one cheek should be permitted to strike us also on the other and that to him who robs us of an undergarment we should also hand over our outer garments Another draws the picture of a militant Jesus who could never endorse such precepts of indolence and resignation The kingdom of heaven is taken by violence cries this new Jesus and intimates that no such beggar like Lazarus sitting all day long with the dogs and his sores can ever earn so great a prize With a scourge in his hands this Jesus rushes upon the traders in the temple court upturns their tables and whips their owners into the streets Surely this was resistance of the most pronounced type The right to use physical force could not have been given a better endorsement than by this example of Jesus It will not help matters to say that these money changers were violating a divine law and needed chastisement with a whip Is not the man who smites us upon the cheek or robs us of our clothing equally guilty Moreover these traders in the outer courts of the synagogue were rendering the worshipers a useful service Just as candles rosaries images and literature are sold in church vestibules for the accommodation of Catholics so were doves pigeons and Hebrew coins necessary to the Jewish sacrifices sold in the temple courts for the Jewish worshiper The money changer who supplied the pious Jew with the only sacred coin which the priests would accept was not very much less important to the Jewish religion than the rabbi To have fallen upon these traders with a weapon and to have caused them the loss of their property was certainly the most inconsistent thing that a meek and lowly Jesus preaching non resistance could have done Again one writer makes Jesus the teacher par excellence of peace He counsels forgiveness of injuries not seven times but seventy times that number meaning unlimited love and charity Love your enemies Bless them that curse you is his unusual advice But another hand retouches this picture and we have a Jesus who breaks his own golden rule This other Jesus heaps abuse upon the people who displease him calls his enemies vipers serpents devils and predicts for them eternal burnings in sulphur and brimstone How could he who said Come unto me all ye that are heavy laden say also Depart from me ye cursed Who curses them How can there be an everlasting hell in a universe whose author advises us to love our enemies to bless them that curse us and to forgive seventy times seven How could the same Jesus who said Blessed are the peacemakers say also I came not to bring peace but a sword Is it possible that the same Jesus who commands us to love our enemies commands us also to hate father mother wife and child for his name s sake Yes the same Jesus who said Put up thy sword in its sheath also commands us to sell our effects and buy a sword Once more A believer in the divinity of Jesus I am going to say invents the following text The Father and I are one An opponent to this Trinitarian dogma introduces a correction which robs the above text of its authority The Father is greater than I and makes Jesus admit openly that there are some things known to the father only It is difficult not to see in these passages the beginnings of the terrible controversies which starting with Peter and Paul have come down to our day and which will not end until Jesus shall take his place among the mythical saviors of the world To harmonize these many and different Jesuses into something like unity or consistency a thousand books have been written by the clergy They have not succeeded How can a Jesus represented at one time as the image of divine perfection and at another as protesting against being called good for none is good save one God how can these two conceptions be reconciled except by a resort to artificial and arbitrary interpretations If such insurmountable contradictions in the teachings and character of another would weaken our faith in his historicity then we are justified in inferring that in all probability Jesus was only a name the name of an imaginary stage hero uttering the conflicting thoughts of his prompters Again such phrases as and he was caught up in a cloud describing the ascension and consequent disappearance of Jesus betray the anxiety of the authors of the Gospels to bring their marvelous story to a close Not knowing how to terminate the career of an imaginary Messiah his creators invented the above method of dispatching him He was caught up in a cloud but for that the narrators would have been obliged to continue their story indefinitely In tragedy the play ends with the death of the hero but if the biographers of Jesus had given a similar excuse for bringing their narrative to a finale there would have been the danger of their being asked to point out his grave He was caught up in a cloud relieved them of all responsibility to produce his remains if called upon to do so and at the same time furnished them with an excuse to bring their story to a close It would hardly be necessary were we all unbiased to look for any further proofs of the mythical and fanciful nature of the Gospel narratives than this expedient to which the writers resorted To questions Where is Jesus What became of his body et cetera they could answer He was caught up in a cloud But a career that ends in the clouds was never begun on the earth Illustration Coin of the XII Century Showing Halo Around Lamb s Head Let us imagine ourselves in Jerusalem in the year One of the Christian era when the apostles as it is claimed were proclaiming Jesus as the Messiah crucified and risen Desiring to be convinced before believing in the strange story let us suppose the following conversation between the apostles and ourselves We ask How long have you known Jesus I have known him for one year And I for two And I for three Has any of you known him for more than three years No Was he with his apostles for one year or for three For one No for three You are not certain then how long Jesus was with his apostles No How old was Jesus when crucified About thirty one No about thirty three No he was much older about fifty You cannot tell with any certainty then his age at the time of his death No You say he was tried and crucified in Jerusalem before your own eyes can you remember the date of this great event We cannot Were you present when Jesus was taken down from the cross We were not You cannot tell then whether he was dead when taken down We have no personal knowledge Were you present when he was buried We were not because we were in hiding for our lives You do not know therefore whether he was actually buried or where he was buried We do not Were any of you present when Jesus came forth from the grave Not one of us was present Then you were not with him when he was taken down from the cross you were not with him when he was interred and you were not present when he rose from the grave We were not When therefore you say he was dead buried and rose again you are relying upon the testimony of others We are Will you mention the names of some of the witnesses who saw Jesus come forth from the tomb Mary Magdalene and she is here and may be questioned Were you present Mary when the angels rolled away the stone and when Jesus came forth from the dead No when I reached the burying place early in the morning the grave had already been vacated and there was no one sleeping in it You saw him then as the apostles did after he had risen Yes But you did not see anybody rise out of the grave I did not Are there any witnesses who saw the resurrection There are many who saw him after the resurrection But if neither they nor you saw him dead and buried and did not see him rise either how can you tell that a most astounding and supposedly impossible miracle had taken place between the time you saw him last and when you saw him again two or three days after Is it not more natural to suppose that being in a hurry on account of the approaching Sabbath Jesus if ever crucified was taken down from the cross before he had really died and that he was not buried as rumor states but remained in hiding and his showing himself to you under cover of darkness and in secluded spots and in the dead of night only would seem to confirm this explanation You admit also that the risen Jesus did not present himself at the synagogues of the people in the public streets or at the palace of the High Priest to convince them of his Messiahship Do you not think that if he had done this it would then have been impossible to deny his resurrection Why then did Jesus hide himself after he came out of the grave Why did he not show himself also to his enemies Was he still afraid of them or did he not care whether they believed or not If so why are you trying to convert them The question waits for a reasonable answer Why did not Jesus challenge the whole world with the evidence of his resurrection You say you saw him occasionally a few moments at a time now here and now there and finally on the top of a mountain whence he was caught up in a cloud and disappeared altogether But that cloud has melted away the sky is clear and there is no Jesus visible there The cloud then had nothing to hide It was unnecessary to call in a cloud to close the career of your Christ The grave is empty the cloud has vanished Where is Christ In heaven Ah you have at last removed him to a world unknown to the undiscovered country Leave him there Criticism doubt investigation the light of day cannot cross its shores Leave him there Illustration saint Margaret of the Catholic Church Westminster England Illustration The Goddess Astarte Carrying a Cross British Museum THE JESUS OF PAUL The central figure of the New Testament is Jesus and the question we are trying to answer is whether we have sufficient evidence to prove to the unbiased mind that he is historical An idea of the intellectual caliber of the average churchman may be had by the nature of the evidence he offers to justify his faith in the historical Jesus The whole world celebrates annually the nativity of Jesus how could there be a Christmas celebration if there never was a Christ asks a Chicago clergyman The simplicity of this plea would be touching were it not that it calls attention to the painful inefficiency of the pulpit as an educator The church goer is trained to believe not to think The truth is withheld from him under the pious pretense that faith and not knowledge is the essential thing A habit of untruthfulness is cultivated by systematically sacrificing everything to orthodoxy This habit in the end destroys one s conscience for any truths which are prejudicial to one s interest But is it true that the Christmas celebration proves a historical Jesus We can only offer a few additional remarks to what we have already said elsewhere in these pages on the Pagan origin of Christmas It will make us grateful to remember that just as we have to go to the Pagans for the origins of our civilized institutions our courts of justice our art and literature and our political and religious liberties we must thank them also for our merry festivals such as Christmas and Easter The ignorant of course do not know anything about the value and wealth of the legacy bequeathed to us by our glorious ancestors of Greek and Roman times but the educated can have no excuse for any failure to own their everlasting indebtedness to the Pagans It will be impossible today to write the history of civilization without giving to the classical world the leading role But while accepting the gifts of the Pagan peoples we have abused the givers A beneficiary who will defame a bounteous benefactor is unworthy of his good fortune I regret to say that the Christian church notwithstanding that it owes many of its most precious privileges to the Pagans has returned for service rendered insolence and vituperation No generous or just institution would treat a rival as Christianity has treated Paganism Both Christmas and Easter are Pagan festivals We do not know no one knows when Jesus was born but we know the time of the winter solstice when the sun begins to retrace his steps turning his radiant face toward our earth once more It was this event a natural demonstrable universal event that our European ancestors celebrated with song and dance with green branches through which twinkled a thousand lighted candles and with the exchange of good wishes and gifts Has the church had the courage to tell its people that Christmas is a Pagan festival which was adopted and adapted by the Christian world reluctantly at first and in the end as a measure of compromise only The Protestants especially conveniently forget the severe Puritanic legislation against the observance of this Pagan festival both in England and America It is the return to Paganism which has given to Christmas and Easter their great popularity as it is the revival of Paganism which is everywhere replacing the Bible ideas of monarchic government with republicanism And yet repeatedly and without any scruples of conscience preacher and people claim these festivals as the gifts of their creed to humanity and quote them further to prove the historical existence of their god man Jesus It was this open and persistent perversion of history by the church the manufacture of evidence on the one hand the suppression of witnesses prejudiced to her interests on the other and the deliberate forging of documents which provoked Carlyle into referring to one of its branches as the great lying Church We have said enough to show that in all probability for let us not be dogmatic the story of Jesus his birth and betrayal by one of his own disciples his trial in a Roman court his crucifixion resurrection and ascension belongs to the order of imaginative literature Conceived at first as a religious drama it received many new accretions as it traveled from country to country and from age to age The piece shows signs of having been touched and retouched to make it acceptable to the different countries in which it was played The hand of the adapter the interpolator and the reviser is unmistakably present As an allegory or as a dramatic composition meant for the religious stage it proved one of the strongest productions of Pagan or Christian times But as real history it lacks the fundamental requisite probability As a play it is stirring and strong as history it lacks naturalness and consistency The miraculous is ever outside the province of history Jesus was a miracle and as such at least we are safe in declaring him un historical We pass on now to the presentation of evidence which we venture to think demonstrates with an almost mathematic precision that the Jesus of the four gospels is a legendary hero as unhistorical as William Tell of Switzerland This evidence is furnished by the epistles bearing the signature of Paul He has been accepted as not only the greatest apostle of Christianity but in a sense also the author of its theology It is generally admitted that the epistles bearing the name of Paul are among the oldest apostolical writings They are older than the gospels This is very important information When Paul was preaching the four gospels had not yet been written From the epistles of Paul of which there are about thirteen in the Bible making the New Testament largely the work of this one apostle we learn that there were in different parts of Asia a number of Christian churches already established Not only Paul then but also the Christian church was in existence before the gospels were composed It would be natural to infer that it was not the gospels which created the church but the church which produced the gospels Do not lose sight of the fact that when Paul was preaching to the Christians there was no written biography of Jesus in existence There was a church without a book In comparing the Jesus of Paul with the Jesus whose portrait is drawn for us in the gospels we find that they are not the same persons at all This is decisive Paul knows nothing about a miraculously born savior He does not mention a single time in all his thirteen epistles that Jesus was born of a virgin or that his birth was accompanied with heavenly signs and wonders He knew nothing of a Jesus born after the manner of the gospel writers It is not imaginable that he knew the facts but suppressed them or that he considered them unimportant or that he forgot to refer to them in any of his public utterances Today a preacher is expelled from his denomination if he suppresses or ignores the miraculous conception of the Son of God but Paul was guilty of that very heresy How explain it It is quite simple The virgin born Jesus was not yet invented when Paul was preaching Christianity Neither he nor the churches he had organized had ever heard of such a person The virgin born Jesus was of later origin than the Apostle Paul Let the meaning of this discrepancy between the Jesus of Paul that is to say the earliest portrait of Jesus and the Jesus of the four evangelists be fully grasped by the student and it should prove beyond a doubt that in Paul s time the story of Jesus birth from the virgin mother and the Holy Ghost which has since become a cardinal dogma of the Christian church was not yet in circulation Jesus had not yet been Hellenized he was still a Jewish Messiah whose coming was foretold in the Old Testament and who was to be a prophet like unto Moses without the remotest suggestion of a supernatural origin No proposition in Euclid is safer from contradiction than that if Paul knew what the gospels tell about Jesus he would have at least once or twice during his long ministry given evidence of his knowledge of it The conclusion is inevitable that the gospel Jesus is later than Paul and his churches Paul stood nearest to the time of Jesus Of those whose writings are supposed to have come down to us he is the most representative and his epistles are the first literature of the new religion And yet there is absolutely not a single hint or suggestion in them of such a Jesus as is depicted in the gospels The gospel Jesus was not yet put together or compiled when Paul was preaching Once more if we peruse carefully and critically the writings of Paul the earliest and greatest Christian apostle and missionary we find that he is not only ignorant of the gospel stories about the birth and miracles of Jesus but he is equally and just as innocently ignorant of the teachings of Jesus In the gospels Jesus is the author of the Sermon on the Mount the Lord s Prayer the Parable of the Prodigal Son the Story of Dives the Good Samaritan et cetera Is it conceivable that a preacher of Jesus could go throughout the world to convert people to the teachings of Jesus as Paul did without ever quoting a single one of his sayings Had Paul known that Jesus had preached a sermon or formulated a prayer or said many inspired things about the here and the hereafter he could not have helped quoting now and then from the words of his master If Christianity could have been established without a knowledge of the teachings of Jesus why then did Jesus come to teach and why were his teachings preserved by divine inspiration But if a knowledge of these teachings of Jesus is indispensable to making converts Paul gives not the least evidence that he possessed such knowledge But the Apostle Paul judging from his many epistles to the earliest converts to Christianity which are really his testimony supposed to have been sealed by his blood appears to be quite as ignorant of a Jesus who went about working miracles opening the eyes of the blind giving health to the sick hearing to the deaf and life to the dead as he is of a Jesus born of a virgin woman and the Holy Ghost Is not this remarkable Does it not lend strong confirmation to the idea that the miracle working Jesus of the gospels was not known in Paul s time that is to say the earliest Jesus known to the churches was a person altogether different from his namesake in the four evangelists If Paul knew of a miracle working Jesus one who could feed the multitude with a few loaves and fishes who could command the grave to open who could cast out devils and cleanse the land of the foulest disease of leprosy who could and did perform many other wonderful works to convince the unbelieving generation of his divinity is it conceivable that either intentionally or inadvertently he would have never once referred to them in all his preaching Is it not almost certain that if the earliest Christians knew of the miracles of Jesus they would have been greatly surprised at the failure of Paul to refer to them a single time And would not Paul have told them of the promise of Jesus to give them power to work even greater miracles than his own had he known of such a promise Could Paul really have left out of his ministry so essential a chapter from the life of Jesus had he been acquainted with it The miraculous fills up the greater portion of the four gospels and if these documents were dictated by the Holy Ghost it means that they were too important to be left out Why then does not Paul speak of them at all There is only one reasonable answer A miracle working Jesus was unknown to Paul What would we say of a disciple of Tolstoi for example who came to America to make converts to Count Tolstoi and never once quoted anything that Tolstoi had said Or what would we think of the Christian missionaries who go to India China Japan and Africa to preach the gospel if they never mentioned to the people of these countries the Sermon on the Mount the Parable of the Prodigal Son the Lord s Prayer nor quoted a single text from the gospels Yet Paul the first missionary did the very thing which would be inexplicable in a modern missionary There is only one rational explanation for this The Jesus of Paul was not born of a virgin he did not work miracles and he was not a teacher It was after his day that such a Jesus was I have to use again a strong word invented It has been hinted by certain professional defenders of Christianity that Paul s specific mission was to introduce Christianity among the Gentiles and not to call attention to the miraculous element in the life of his Master But this is a very lame defense What is Christianity but the life and teachings of Jesus And how can it be introduced among the Gentiles without a knowledge of the doctrines and works of its founder Paul gives no evidence of possessing any knowledge of the teachings of Jesus how could he then be a missionary of Christianity to the heathen There is no other answer which can be given than that the Christianity of Paul was something radically different from the Christianity of the later gospel writers who in all probability were Greeks and not Jews Moreover it is known that Paul was reprimanded by his fellow apostles for carrying Christianity to the Gentiles What better defense could Paul have given for his conduct than to have quoted the commandment of Jesus Go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature And he would have quoted the divine text had he been familiar with it Nay the other apostles would not have taken him to task for obeying the commandment of Jesus had they been familiar with such a commandment It all goes to support the proposition that the gospel Jesus was of a date later than the apostolic times That the authorities of the church realize how damaging to the reality of the gospel Jesus is the inexplicable silence of Paul concerning him may be seen in their vain effort to find in a passage put in Paul s mouth by the unknown author of the book of Acts evidence that Paul does quote the sayings of Jesus The passage referred to is the following It is more blessed to give than to receive Paul is made to state that this was a saying of Jesus In the first place this quotation is not in the epistles of Paul but in the Acts of which Paul was not the author in the second place there is no such quotation in the gospels The position then that there is not a single saying of Jesus in the gospels which is quoted by Paul in his many epistles is unassailable and certainly fatal to the historicity of the gospel Jesus Again from Paul himself we learn that he was a zealous Hebrew a Pharisee of Pharisees studying with Gamaliel in Jerusalem presumably to become a rabbi Is it possible that such a man could remain totally ignorant of a miracle worker and teacher like Jesus living in the same city with him If Jesus really raised Lazarus from the grave and entered Jerusalem at the head of a procession waving branches and shouting hosanna if he was really crucified in Jerusalem and ascended from one of its environs is it possible that Paul neither saw Jesus nor heard anything about these miracles But if he knew all these things about Jesus is it possible that he could go through the world preaching Christ without ever once referring to them It is more likely that when Paul was studying in Jerusalem there was no miraculous Jesus living or teaching in any part of Judea If men make their gods they also make their Christs Footnote Christianity and Mythology J M Robertson to whom the author acknowledges his indebtedness for the difference between Paul s Jesus and that of the Gospels It is frequently urged that it was impossible for a band of illiterate fishermen to have created out of their own fancy so glorious a character as that of Jesus and that it would be more miraculous to suppose that the unique sayings of Jesus and his incomparably perfect life were invented by a few plain people than to believe in his actual existence But it is not honest to throw the question into that form We do not know who were the authors of the gospels It is pure assumption that they were written by plain fishermen The authors of the gospels do not disclose their identity The words according to Matthew Mark et cetera represent only the guesses or opinions of translators and copyists Both in the gospels and in Christian history the apostles are represented as illiterate men But if they spoke Greek and could also write in Greek they could not have been just plain fishermen That they were Greeks not Jews and more or less educated may be safely inferred from the fact that they all write in Greek and one of them at least seems to be acquainted with the Alexandrian school of philosophy Jesus was supposedly a Jew his twelve apostles all Jews how is it then that the only biographies of him extant are all in Greek If his fishermen disciples were capable of composition in Greek they could not have been illiterate men if they could not have written in Greek which was a rare accomplishment for a Jew according to what Josephus says then the gospels were not written by the apostles of Jesus But the fact that though these documents are in a language alien both to Jesus and his disciples they are unsigned and undated goes to prove we think that their editors or authors wished to conceal their identity that they may be taken for the apostles themselves In the next place it is equally an assumption that the portrait of Jesus is incomparable It is now proven beyond a doubt that there is not a single saying of Jesus I say this deliberately which had not already been known both among the Jews and Pagans Footnote Sometimes it is urged by pettifogging clergymen that while it is true that Confucius gave the Golden Rule six hundred years before Jesus it was in a negative form Confucius said Do not unto another what you would not another to do unto you Jesus said Do unto others et cetera But every negative has its corresponding affirmation Moreover are not the Ten Commandments in the negative But the Greek sages gave the Golden Rule in as positive a form as we find it in the Gospels And may I do to others as I would that others should do to me said Plato Jowett Trans V four hundred eighty three P Besides if the only difference between Jesus and Confucius the one a God the other a mere man was that they both said the same thing the one in the negative the other in the positive it is not enough to prove Jesus infinitely superior to Confucius Many of Jesus own commandments are in the negative Resist not evil for instance And as to his life it is in no sense superior or even as large and as many sided as that of Socrates I know some consider it blasphemy to compare Jesus with Socrates but that must be attributed to prejudice rather than to reason And to the question that if Jesus be mythical we cannot account for the rise and progress of the Christian church we answer that the Pagan gods who occupied Mount Olympus were all mythical beings mere shadows and yet Paganism was the religion of the most advanced and cultured nations of antiquity How could an imaginary Zeus or Jupiter draw to his temple the elite of Greece and Rome And if there is nothing strange in the rise and spread of the Pagan church in the rapid progress of the worship of Osiris who never existed in the wonderful success of the religion of Mithra who is but a name if the worship of Adonis of Attis of Isis and the legends of Heracles Prometheus Hercules and the Hindoo trinity Brahma Shiva Chrishna with their rock hewn temples can be explained without believing in the actual existence of these gods why not Christianity Religions like everything else are born they grow old and die They show the handiwork of whole races and of different epochs rather than of one man or of one age Time gives them birth and changing environments determine their career Just as the portrait of Jesus we see in shops and churches is an invention so is his character The artist gave him his features the theologian his attributes What are the elements out of which the Jesus story was evolved The Jewish people were in constant expectation of a Messiah The belief prevailed that his name would be Joshua which in English is Jesus The meaning of the word is savior In ancient Syrian mythology Joshua was a Sun God The Old Testament Joshua who stopped the Sun was in all probability this same Syrian divinity According to tradition this Joshua or Jesus was the son of Mary a name which with slight variations is found in nearly all the old mythologies Greek and Hindoo divinities were mothered by either a Mary Meriam Myrrah or Merri Maria or Mares is the oldest word for sea the earliest source of life The ancients looked upon the sea water as the mother of every living thing Joshua or Jesus son of Mary was already a part of the religious outfit of the Asiatic world when Paul began his missionary tours His Jesus or anointed one crucified or slain did in no sense represent a new or original message It is no more strange that Paul s mythological savior should loom into prominence and cast a spell over all the world than that a mythical Apollo or Jupiter should rule for thousands of years over the fairest portions of the earth It is also well known that there is in the Talmud the story of a Jesus Ben or son of Pandira who lived about a hundred years before the Gospel Jesus and who was hanged from a tree I believe this Jesus is quite as legendary as the Syrian Hesous or Joshua But may it not be that such a legend accepted as true to the ancients all legends were true contributed its share toward marking the outlines of the later Jesus hanged on a cross My idea has been to show that the materials for a Jesus myth were at hand and that therefore to account for the rise and progress of the Christian cult is no more difficult than to explain the widely spread religion of the Indian Chrishna or of the Persian Mithra Footnote For a fuller discussion of the various christs in mythology read Robertson s Christianity and Mythology and his Pagan Christs Now why have I given these conclusions to the world Would I not have made more friends provoked a warmer response from the public at large had I repeated in pleasant accents the familiar phrases about the glory and beauty and sweetness of the Savior God the Virgin born Christ Instead of that I have run the risk of alienating the sympathies of my fellows by intimating that this Jesus whom Christendom worships today as a god this Jesus at whose altar the Christian world bends its knees and bows its head is as much of an idol as was Apollo of the Greeks and that we we Americans of the twentieth century are an idolatrous people inasmuch as we worship a name or at most a man of whom we know nothing provable Illustration Italian Sculpture of the X Century IS CHRISTIANITY REAL It is assumed without foundation as I hope to show that the religion of Jesus alone can save the world We are not surprised at the claim because there has never been a religion which has been too modest to make a similar claim No religion has ever been satisfied to be one of the saviors of man Each religion wants to be the only savior of man There is no monopoly like religious monopoly The industrial corporations with all their greed are less exacting than the Catholic church for instance which keeps heaven itself under lock and key But what is meant by salvation Let us consider its religious meaning first An unbiased investigation of the dogmas and their supposed historical foundations will prove that the salvation which Christianity offers and the means by which it proposes to effect the world s salvation are extremely fanciful in nature If this point could be made clear there will be less reluctance on the part of the public to listen to the evidence on the un historicity of the founder of Christianity We are told that God who is perfect created this world about half a hundred centuries ago Of course being perfect himself the world which he created was perfect too But the world did not stay perfect very long Nay from the heights it fell not slowly but suddenly into the lowest depths of degradation How a world which God had created perfect could in the twinkling of an eye become so vile as to be cursed by the same being who a moment before had pronounced it good and besides be handed over to the devil as fuel for eternal burnings only credulity can explain I am giving the story of what is called the plan of salvation in order to show its mythical nature In the preceding pages we have discussed the question Is Jesus a Myth but I believe that when we have reflected upon the story of man s fall and his supposed subsequent salvation by the blood of Jesus we shall conclude that the function or the office which Jesus is said to perform is as mythical as his person The story of Eden possesses all the marks of an allegory Adam and Eve and a perfect world suddenly plunged from a snowy whiteness into the blackness of hell are the thoughts of a child who exaggerates because of an as yet undisciplined fancy Yet if Adam and Eve are unreal theologically speaking Jesus is unreal If they are allegory and myth so is Jesus It is claimed that it was the fall of Adam which necessitated the death of Jesus but if Adam s fall be a fiction as we know it is Jesus death as an atonement must also be a fiction In the fall of Adam we are told humanity itself fell Could anything be more fanciful than that And what was Adam s sin He coveted knowledge He wished to improve his mind He experimented with forbidden things He dared to take the initiative And for that imaginary crime even the generations not yet born are to be forever blighted Even the animals the flowers and vegetables were cursed for it Can you conceive of anything more mythical than that One of the English divines of the age of Calvin declared that original sin Adam s sin imputed to us was so awful that if a man had never been born he would yet have been damned for it It is from this mythical sin that a mythical Savior saves us And how does he do it In a very mythical way as we shall see When the world fell it fell into the devil s hands To redeem a part of it at least the deity concludes to give up his only son for a ransom This is interesting God is represented as being greatly offended because the world which he had created perfect was all in a heap before him To placate himself he sacrificed his son not himself But as intimated above he does not intend to restore the whole world to its pristine purity but only a part of it This is alarming He creates the whole world perfect but now he is satisfied to have only a portion of it redeemed from the devil If he can save at all pray why not save all This is not an irrelevant question when it is remembered that the whole world was created perfect in the first place The refusal of the deity to save all of his world from the devil would lead one to believe that even when God created the world perfect he did not mean to keep all of it to himself but meant that some of it the greater part of it as some theologians contend should go to the devil Surely this is nothing but myth Let us hope for the sake of our ideals that all this is no more than the childish prattle of primitive man But let us return to the story of the fall of man God decides to save a part of his ruined perfect world by the sacrifice of his son The latter is supposed to have said to his father Punish me kill me accept my blood and let it pay for the sins of man He thus interceded for the elect and the deity was mollified As Jesus is also God it follows that one God tried to pacify another which is pure myth Some theologians have another theory there is room here for many theories According to these God gave up his son as a ransom not to himself but to the devil who now claimed the world as his own I heard a distinguished minister explain this in the following manner A poor man whose house is mortgaged hears that some philanthropist has redeemed the property by paying off the mortgage The soul of man was by the fall of Adam mortgaged to the devil God has raised the mortgage by abandoning his son to be killed to satisfy the devil who held the mortgage The debt which we owed has been paid by Jesus By this arrangement the devil loses his legal right to our souls and we are saved All we need to do is to believe in this story and we ll be sure to go to heaven And to think that intelligent Americans not only accept all this as inspired but denounce the man who ventures to intimate modestly that it might be a myth as a blasphemer O judgment cries Shakespeare thou hast fled to brutish beasts and men have lost their reason The morality which the Christian church teaches is of as mythical a nature as the story of the fall and the blood atonement It is not natural morality but something quite unintelligible and fictitious For instance we are told that we cannot of ourselves be righteous We must first have the grace of God Then we are told that we cannot have the grace of God unless he gives it to us And he will not give it to us unless we ask for it But we cannot ask for it unless he moves us to ask for it And there we are We shall be damned if we do not come to God and we cannot come to God unless he calls us Besides could anything be more mythical than a righteousness which can only be imputed to us any righteousness of our own being but filthy rags The Christian religion has the appearance of being one great myth constructed out of many minor myths It is the same with Mohammedanism or Judaism which latter is the mischievous parent of both the Mohammedan and the Christian faiths It is the same with all supernatural creeds Myth is the dominating element in them all Compared with these Asiatic religions how glorious is science How wholesome helpful and luminous are her commandments If I were to command you to believe that Mount Olympus was once tenanted by blue eyed gods and their consorts sipping nectar and ambrosia the live long day you will answer Oh that is only mythology If I were to tell you that you cannot be saved unless you believe that Minerva was born full fledged from the brain of Jupiter you will laugh at me If I were to tell you that you must punish your innocent sons for the guilt of their brothers and sisters you will answer that I insult your moral sense And yet every Sunday the preacher repeats the myth of Adam and Eve and how God killed his innocent son to please himself or to satisfy the devil and with bated breath and on your knees you whisper Amen How is it that when you read the literature of the Greeks the literature of the Persians the literature of Hindoostan or of the Mohammedan world you discriminate between fact and fiction between history and myth but when it comes to the literature of the Jews you stammer you stutter you bite your lips you turn pale and fall upon your face before it as the savage before his fetish You would consider it unreasonable to believe that everything a Greek or a Roman or an Arab ever said was inspired And yet men have been hounded to death for not believing that everything that a Jew ever said in olden times was inspired I do not have to use arguments I hope to prove to an intelligent public that an infallible book is as much a myth as the Garden of Eden or the Star of Bethlehem A mythical Savior a mythical Bible a mythical plan of salvation When we subject what are called religious truths to the same tests by which we determine scientific or historical truths we discover that they are not truths at all they are only opinions Any statement which snaps under the strain of reason is unworthy of credence But it is claimed that religious truth is discovered by intuition and not by investigation The believer it is claimed feels in his own soul he has the witness of the spirit that the Bible is infallible and that Jesus is the Savior of man The Christian does not have to look into the arguments for or against his religion it is said before he makes up his mind he knows by an inward assurance he has proved it to his own deepermost being that Jesus is real and that he is the only Savior But what is that but another kind of argument The argument is quite inadequate to inspire assurance as you will presently see but it is an argument nevertheless To say that we must believe and not reason is a kind of reasoning This device of reasoning against reasoning is resorted to by people who have been compelled by modern thought to give up one after another the strongholds of their position They run under shelter of what they call faith or the inward witness of the spirit or the intuitive argument hoping thereby to escape the enemy s fire if I may use so objectionable a phrase What is called faith then or an intuitive spiritual assurance is a species of reasoning let its worth be tested honestly In the first place faith or the intuitive argument would prove too much If Jesus is real notwithstanding that there is no reliable historical data to warrant the belief because the believer feels in his own soul that He is real and divine I answer that the same mode of reasoning and let us not forget it is a kind of reasoning would prove Mohammed a divine savior and the wooden idol of the savage a god The African Bushman trembles before an image because he feels in his own soul that the thing is real Does that make it real The Moslem cries unto Mohammed because he believes in his innermost heart that Mohammed is near and can hear him He will risk his life on that assurance To quote to him history and science to prove that Mohammed is dead and unable to save would be of no avail for he has the witness of the spirit in him an intuitive assurance that the great prophet sits on the right hand of Allah An argument which proves too much proves nothing In the second place an intuition is not communicable I may have an intuition that I see spirits all about me this morning They come they go they nod they brush my forehead with their wings But do you see them too because I see them There is the difference between a scientific demonstration and a purely metaphysical assumption I could go to the blackboard and assure you as I am myself assured that two parallel lines running in the same direction will not and cannot meet That is demonstration A fever patient when in a state of delirium and a frightened child in the dark see things We do not deny that they do but their testimony does not prove that the things they see are real What is this I see before me cries Macbeth the murderer and he shrieks and shakes from head to foot he draws his sword and rushes upon Banquo s ghost which he sees coldly staring at him But is that any proof that what he saw we could see also Yes we could if we were in the same frenzy And it is the revivalist s aim by creating a general excitement to make everybody see things Doctor Doctor help they are coming to kill me there they are the assassins one two three oh help and the patient jumps out of bed to escape the banditti crowding in upon him But is that any reason why the attending physician his pulse normal and his brow cool should believe that the room is filling up with assassins I observe people jump up and down as they do in holiness meetings I hear them say they see angels they see Jesus they feel his presence But is that any evidence for you or me An intuitive argument is not communicable and therefore it is no argument at all Our orthodox friends are finally driven by modern thought which is growing bolder every day to the only refuge left for them It is the one already mentioned Granted that Jesus was an imaginary character even then as an ideal they argue he is an inspiration and the most effective moral force the world has ever known We do not care they say whether the story of his birth trial death and resurrection is myth or actual history such a man as Jesus may never have existed the things he is reported as saying may have been put in his mouth by others but what of that is not the picture of his character perfect Are not the Beatitudes beautiful no matter who said them To strengthen this position they call our attention to Shakespeare s creations the majority of whom Hamlet Othello Lear Portia Imogen Desdemona are fictitious Yet where are there grander men or finer women These children of Shakespeare may never have lived but surely they will never die In the same sense Jesus may be just as ideal a character as those of Shakespeare they say and still be the light of the world A New York preacher is reported as saying that if Christianity is a lie it is a glorious lie My answer to the above is that such an argument evades instead of facing the question It is receding from a position under cover of a rhetorical manoeuvre It is a retreat in disguise If Christianity is a glorious lie then call it such The question under discussion is Is Jesus Historical To answer that it is immaterial whether or not he is historical is to admit that there is no evidence that he is historical To urge that unhistorical though he be he is nevertheless the only savior of the world is I regret to say not only evasive not only does it beg the question but it is also clearly dishonest How long will the tremendous ecclesiastical machinery last if it were candidly avowed that it is doubtful whether there ever was such a historical character as Jesus or that in all probability he is no more real than one of Shakespeare s creations What all these prayers these churches these denominations these sectarian wars which have shed oceans of human blood these unfortunate persecutions which have blackened the face of man the fear of hell and the devil which has blasted millions of lives all these for a Christ who may after all be only a picture Neither is it true that this pictorial Jesus saved the world He has had two thousand years to do it in but as missionaries are still being sent out it follows that the world is yet to be saved The argument presented elsewhere in these pages may here be recapitulated There was war before Christianity has Jesus abolished war There was poverty and misery in the world before Christianity has Jesus removed these evils There was ignorance in the world before Christianity has Jesus destroyed ignorance There were disease crime persecution oppression slavery massacres and bloodshed in the world before Christianity alas are they not still with us When Jesus shall succeed in pacifying his own disciples in healing the sectarian world of its endless and bitter quarrels then it will be time to ask what else Jesus has done for humanity If the world is improving at all and we believe it is the progress is due to the fact that man pays now more attention to this life than formerly He is thinking less of the other world and more of this He no longer sings with the believer The world is all a fleeting show For man s delusion given Its smiles of joy its tears of woe Deceitful shine deceitful flow There s nothing true but heaven How could people with such feelings labor to improve a world they hated How could they be in the least interested in social or political reforms when they were constantly repeating to themselves I m a pilgrim and I m a stranger I can tarry I can tarry but a night That these same people should now claim not only a part of the credit for the many improvements but all of it saying that but for their religion the world would now have been a hell Footnote reverend Frank Gunsaulus of the Central Church Chicago See A New Catechism M M Mangasarian is really a little too much for even the most serene temperament Which of the religions has persecuted as long and as relentlessly as Christianity Which of the many faiths of the world has opposed Science as stubbornly and as bitterly as Christianity In the name of what other prophets have more people been burned at the stake than in the names of Jesus and Moses What other revelation has given rise to so many sects hostile and irreconcilable as the Christian Which religion has furnished as many effective texts for political oppression polygamy slavery and the subjection of woman as the religion of Jesus and Paul Is there has there ever been another creed which makes salvation dependent on belief thereby encouraging hypocrisy and making honest inquiry a crime To send a thief to heaven from the gallows because he believes and an honest man to hell because he doubts is that the virtue which is going to save the world The claim that Jesus has saved the world is another myth A pictorial Christ then has not done anything for humanity to deserve the tremendous expenditure of time energy love and devotion which has for two thousand years taxed the resources of civilization The passing away of this imaginary savior will relieve the world of an unproductive investment We conclude Honesty like charity must begin at home Unless we can tell the truth in our churches we will never tell the truth in our shops Unless our teachers the ministers of God are honest our insurance companies and corporations will have to be watched Permit sham in your religious life and the disease will spread to every member of the social body If you may keep religion in the dark and cry hush hush when people ask that it be brought out into the light why may not politics or business cultivate a similar partiality for darkness If the king cries rebel when a citizen asks for justice it is because he has heard the priest cry infidel when a member of his church asked for evidence Religious hypocrisy is the mother of all hypocrisies Cure a man of that and the human world will recover its health Not so long ago nearly everybody believed in the existence of a personal devil People saw him heard him described him danced with him and claimed besides to have whipped him Luther hurled his inkstand at him and American women accused as witches were put to death in the name of the devil Yet all this evidence has not saved the devil from passing out of existence What has happened to the devil will happen to the gods Man is the only real savior If he is not a savior there is no other Illustration The Hindu Trinity PART II IS THE WORLD INDEBTED TO CHRISTIANITY But says the believer again as a last resort Jesus whether real or mythical has certainly saved the world and is its only hope If this assertion can be supported with facts then surely it would matter very little whether Jesus really lived and taught or whether he is a mere picture Although even then it would be more truthful to say we have no satisfactory evidence that such a teacher as Jesus ever lived than to affirm dogmatically his existence as it is now done Whatever Jesus may have done for the world he has certainly not freed us from the obligation of telling the truth I call special attention to this point Because Jesus has saved the world granting for the moment that he has is no reason why we should be indifferent to the truth Nay it would show that Jesus has not saved the world if we can go on and speak of him as an actual existence born of a virgin and risen from the dead and in his name persecute one another oppose the advance of science deny freedom of thought terrorize children and women with pictures of hell fire and seek to establish a spiritual monopoly in the world when the evidence in hand seems clearly to indicate that such a person never existed We shall quote a chapter from Christian history to give our readers an idea of how much the religion of Jesus when implicitly believed in can do for the world We have gone to the earliest centuries for our examples of the influence exerted by Christianity upon the ambitions and passions of human nature because it is generally supposed that Christianity was then at its best Let us then present a picture of the world strictly speaking of the Roman Empire during the first four or five hundred years after its conversion to Christianity We select this specific period because Christianity was at this time fifteen hundred years nearer to its source and was more virile and aggressive than it has ever been since Shakespeare speaks of the uses of adversity but the uses of prosperity are even greater The proverb says that adversity tries a man While there is considerable truth in this the fact is that prosperity is a much surer criterion of character It is impossible to tell for instance what a man will do who has neither the power nor the opportunity to do anything Opportunity says a French writer is the cleverest devil Both our good and bad qualities wait upon opportunity to show themselves It is quite easy to be virtuous when the opportunity to do evil is lacking Behind the prison bars every criminal is a penitent but the credit belongs to the iron bars and not to the criminal To be good when one cannot be bad is an indifferent virtue It is with institutions and religions as with individuals they should be judged not by what they pretend in their weakness but by what they do when they are strong Christianity Mohammedanism and Judaism the three kindred religions we call them kindred because they are related in blood and are the offspring of the same soil and climate these three kindred religions must be interpreted not by what they profess today but by what they did when they had both the power and the opportunity to do as they wished When Christianity or Mohammedanism was professed only by a small handful of men twelve fishermen or a dozen camel drivers of the desert neither party advocated persecution The worst punishment which either religion held out was a distant and a future punishment but as soon as Christianity converted an Emperor or Mohammed became the victorious warrior that is to say as soon as springing forth they picked up the sword and felt their grip sure upon its hilt this future and distant punishment materialized into a present and persistent persecution of their opponents Is not that suggestive Then again when in the course of human evolution both Christianity and Mohammedanism lost the secular support the throne the favor of the courts the imperial treasury they fell back once more upon future penalties as the sole menace against an unbelieving world As religion grows secularly speaking weaker and is more completely divorced from the temporal even the future penalties from being both literal and frightful pale into harmless figures of speech It was but a short time after the conversion of the Emperor Constantine that the following edict was published throughout the provinces of the Roman Empire O ye enemies of truth authors and counsellors of death we enact by this law that none of you dare hereafter to meet at your conventicles nor keep any meetings either in public buildings or private houses We have commanded that all your places of meeting your temples be pulled down or confiscated to the Catholic Church The man who affixed his signature to this edict was a monarch that is to say a man who had the power to do as he liked The man and monarch then who affixed his imperial signature to this first document of persecution in Europe the first because as Renan has beautifully remarked We may search in vain the whole Roman law before Constantine for a single passage against freedom of thought and the history of the imperial government furnishes no instance of a prosecution for entertaining an abstract doctrine this is glory enough for the civilization which we call Pagan and which was replaced by the Asiatic religion the man and the monarch who fathered the first instrument of persecution in our Europe who introduced into our midst the crazed hounds of religious wars unknown either in Greece or Rome Constantine has been held up by Cardinal Newman as a pattern to all succeeding monarchs Only an Englishman a European infected with the malady of the East could hold up the author of such an edict an edict which prostitutes the State to the service of a fad as a pattern If we asked for a modern illustration of what a church will do when it has the power there is the example of Russia Russia is today centuries behind the other European nations She is the most unfortunate the most ignorant the most poverty pinched country with the most orthodox type of Christianity What is the difference between Greek Christianity such as prevails in Russia and American Christianity Only this The Christian Church in Russia has both the power and the opportunity to do things while the Christian church in America or in France has not We must judge Christianity as a religion by what it does in Russia more than by what it does not do in France or America There was a time when the church did in France and in England what it is doing now in Russia which is a further confirmation of the fact that a religion must be judged not by what it pretends in its weakness but by what it does when it can In Russia the priest can tie a man s hands and feet and deliver him up to the government and it does so In Protestant countries the church being deprived of all its badges and prerogatives is more modest and humble The poet Heine gives eloquent expression to this idea when he says Religion comes begging to us when it can no longer burn us There will be no revolution in Russia nor even any radical improvement of existing conditions so long as the Greek Church has the education of the masses in charge To become politically free men must first be intellectually emancipated If a Russian is not permitted to choose his own religion will he be permitted to choose his own form of government If he will allow a priest to impose his religion upon him why may he not permit the Czar to impose despotism upon him If it is wrong for him to question the tenets of his religion is it not equally wrong for him to discuss the laws of his government If a slave of the church why may he not be also a slave of the state If there is room upon his neck for the yoke of the church there will be room also for the yoke of the autocracy If he is in the habit of bending his knees what difference does it make to how many or to whom he bends them Not until Russia has become religiously emancipated will she conquer political freedom She must first cast out of her mind the fear of the church before she can enter into the glorious fellowship of the free In Turkey all the misery of the people will not so much as cause a ripple of discontent because the Moslem has been brought up to submit to the Sultan as to the shadow on earth of Allah Both in Russia and Turkey the protestants are the heretics The orthodox Turk and the orthodox Christian permit without a murmur both the priest and the king to impose upon them at the point of a bayonet the one his religion and the other his government It is only by taking the education of the masses out of the hands of the clergy that either country can enjoy any prosperity Orthodoxy and autocracy are twins Let me now try to present to you a picture of the world under Christianity about the year four hundred of the present era Let us discuss this phase of the subject in a liberal spirit extenuating nothing nor setting down aught in malice Please interpret what I say in the next few minutes metaphorically and pardon me if my picture is a repellant one We are in the year of our Lord four hundred I rose up early this morning to go to church As I approached the building I saw there a great multitude of people unable to secure admission into the edifice The huge iron doors were closed and upon them was affixed a notice from the authorities to the effect that all who worshiped in this church would by the authority of the state be known and treated hereafter as infamous heretics and be exposed to the extreme penalty of the law if they persisted in holding services there But the party to which I belonged heeded not the prohibition but beat against the doors furiously and effected an entrance into the church The excitement ran high men and leaders shouted gesticulated and came to blows The Archbishop was urged to ascend his episcopal throne and officiate at the altar in spite of the formal interdiction against him He consented But he had not proceeded far when soldiers with a wild rush poured into the building and began to discharge arrows at the panic stricken people Instantly pandemonium was let loose The officers commanding the soldiers demanded the head of the offending Archbishop The worshipers made an attempt to resist then blood was shed the sight of which reeled people s heads and in an instant the sanctuary was turned into a house of murder Taking advantage of the uproar the Archbishop assisted by his secretaries escaped through a secret door behind the altar Illustration Engraving of XV Century Representing the Trinity On my way home from this terrible scene I fell upon a procession of monks They were carrying images and relics and a banner upon which were inscribed these words The Virgin Mary Mother of God As they marched on their number increased by new additions But suddenly they encountered another band of monks carrying a different banner bearing the same words which were on the other party s banner but instead of The Virgin Mary Mother of God their banner read The Virgin Mary Mother of Jesus Christ The two processions clashed and a bloody encounter followed in an instant images relics and banners were all in an indiscriminate heap The troops were called out again but such was the zeal of the conflicting parties that not until the majority of them were disabled and exhausted was tranquility restored Looking about me I saw the spire of a neighboring church My curiosity prompted me to wend my steps thither As soon as I entered I was recognized as belonging to the forbidden sect and in an instant a hundred fists rained down blows upon my head He has polluted the sanctuary they cried He has committed sacrilege No quarter to the enemies of the true church cried others and it was a miracle that beaten bruised my clothes torn from my back I regained the street A few seconds later looking up the streets I saw another troop of soldiers rushing down toward this church at full speed It seems that while I was being beaten in the main auditorium in the baptistry of the church they were killing in cold blood the Archbishop who was suspected of a predilection for the opposite party and who had refused to retract or resign from his office The next day I heard that one hundred and thirty seven bodies were taken out of this building Seized with terror I now began to run but alas I had worse experiences in store for me I was compelled to pass the principal square in the center of the city before I could reach a place of safety When I reached this square it had the appearance of a veritable battlefield It was Sunday morning and the partisans of rival bishops differing in their interpretation of theological doctrines were fighting each other like maddened malignant creatures One could hear over the babel of discordant yells scriptural phrases The words The Son is equal to the Father The Father is greater than the Son He is begotten of the same substance as the Father He is of like substance but not of the same substance You are a heretic You are an atheist were invariably accompanied with blows stabs and sword thrusts until as an eye witness I can take an oath that I saw the streets leading out of the square deluged with palpitating human blood Suddenly the commander of the cavalry Hermogenes rode upon the scene of feud and bloodshed He ordered the followers of the rival bishops to disperse but instead of minding his authority the zealots of both sides rushed upon his horse tore the rider from the saddle and began to beat him with clubs and stones which they picked up from the street He managed to escape into a house close by but the religious rabble surrounded the house and set fire to it Hermogenes appeared at the window begging for his life He was attacked again and killed and his mangled body dragged through the streets and rushed into a ditch The spectacle inflamed me being a sectarian myself I felt ashamed that I was not showing an equal zeal for my party I too longed to fight to kill to be killed for my religion And anon the opportunity presented itself I saw looking up the street to my right a group of my fellow believers who like myself shut out of their own church by the orthodox authorities armed with whips loaded with lead and with clubs were entering a house I followed them As we went in we commanded the head of the family and his wife to appear When they did we asked them if it was true that in their prayers to Mary they had refrained from the use of the words The mother of God They hesitated to give a direct answer whereupon we used the club and then the scourge Then they said they believed in and revered the blessed virgin but would not even if we killed them say that she was the mother of God This obstinacy exasperated us and we felt it to be our religious duty for the honor of our divine Queen to perpetrate such cruelties upon them as would shock your gentle ears to hear We held them over slowly burning fires flung lime into their eyes applied roasted eggs and hot irons to the sensitive parts of their bodies and even gagged them to force the sacrament into their mouths As we went from house to house bent upon our mission I remember an expression of one of the party who said to the poor woman who was begging for mercy What shall I be guilty of defrauding the vengeance of God of its victims A sudden chill ran down my back I felt my flesh creep Like a drop of poison the thought embodied in those words perverted whatever of pity or humanity was left in me and I felt that I was only helping to secure victims with which to feed the vengeance of God Illustration Trinity in XIII Century I was willing to be a monster for the glory of God The Christian sect to which I belonged was one of the oldest in Christendom Our ancestors were called the Puritans of the fourth and fifth centuries We believe that no one can be saved outside of our communion When a Christian of another church joins us we re baptize him for we do not believe in the validity of other baptisms We are so particular that we deny our cemeteries to any other Christians than our own members If we find that we have by mistake buried a member of another church in our cemetery we dig up his bones that he may not pollute the soil When one of the churches of another denomination falls into our hands we first fumigate the building and with a sharp knife we scrape the wood off the altars upon which other Christian priests have offered prayers We will under no consideration allow a brother Christian from another church to commune with us if by stealth anyone does we spare not his life But we are persecuted just as severely as we persecute ourselves Footnote This sect Donatist and others lasted for a long time and made Asia and Africa a hornet s nest a blood stained arena of feud and riot and massacre until Mohammedanism put an end in these parts of the world not only to these sects but to Christianity itself As the sun was setting fatigued with the holy Sabbath s religious duties I started to go home On my way back I saw even wilder bloodier scenes between rival ecclesiastical factions streets even redder with blood if possible yea certain sections of the city seemed as if a storm of hail or tongues of flame had swept over them Churches were on fire cowled monks attacking bishops residences rival prelates holding uproarious debates which almost always terminated in bloodshed and to cap the day of many vicissitudes I saw a bear on exhibition which had been given its freedom by the ruler as a reward for his faithful services in devouring heretics The Christian ruler kept two fierce bears by his own chamber to which those who did not hold the orthodox faith were thrown in his presence while he listened with delight to their groans When I reached home I was panting for breath I had lived through another Sabbath day Footnote If the reader will take the pains to read Dean Milman s History of Christianity and his History of Latin Christianity also Gibbon s Downfall of the Roman Empire and Mosheim s History of Christianity he will see that we have exaggerated nothing The Athanasian and the Arian the Donatist and Sabellian the Nestorian and Alexandrian factions converted the early centuries into a long reign of terror I feel like covering my face for telling you so grewsome a tale But if this were the fourth or the fifth century instead of the twentieth and this were Constantinople or Alexandria or Antioch instead of Chicago I would have spent just such a Sunday as I have described to you In giving you this concentrated view of human society in the great capitals of Christendom in the year four hundred I have restrained rather than spurred my imagination Remember also that I have confined my remarks to a specific and short period in history and have excluded from my generalization all reference to the centuries of religious wars which tore Europe limb from limb the wholesale exterminations the crusades which represented one of the maddest spells of misguided and costly zeal which ever struck our earth the persecution of the Huguenots the extermination of the Albigenses and of the Waldenses the massacre of saint Bartholomew the Inquisition with its red hand upon the intellect of Europe the Anabaptist outrages in Germany the Smithfield fires in England the religious outrages in Scotland the Puritan excesses in America the reign of witchcraft and superstition throughout the twenty centuries I have not touched my picture with any colors borrowed from these terrible chapters in the history of our unfortunate earth I have also left out all reference to Papal Rome with its dungeons its stakes its massacres and its burnings I have said nothing of Galileo Vanini Campanella or Bruno I have passed over all this in silence You can imagine now how much more repellant and appalling this representation of the Roman world under Christianity would have been had I stretched my canvas to include also these later centuries But I tremble to be one sided or unjust and so I hasten to say that during the twenty centuries reign of our religion the world has also seen some of the fairest flowers spring out of the soil of our earth During the past twenty centuries there have been men and women calling themselves Christians who have been as generous as heroic and as deeply consecrated to high ideals as any the world has ever produced Christianity has in many instances softened the manners of barbarians and elevated the moral tone of primitive peoples It gives us more pleasure to speak of the good which religions have accomplished than to call attention to the evil they have caused But this raises a very important question Why do you not confine yourself we are often asked to the virtues you find in Christianity or Mohammedanism instead of discussing so frequently their short comings Is it not better to praise than to blame to recommend than to find fault This is a fair question and we may just as well meet it now as at any other time Such is the economy of nature that no man or institution or religion can be altogether evil The poet spoke the truth when he said There is a soul of goodness in things evil Evil in a large sense is the raw material of the good All things contribute to the education of man The question then whether an institution is helpful or hurtful is a relative one The character of an institution as that of an individual is determined by its ruling passion Despotism for instance is generally considered to be an evil And yet a hundred good things can be said of despotism The French people over a hundred years ago overthrew the monarchy And yet the monarchy had rendered a thousand services to France It was the monarchy that created France that extended her territory developed her commerce built her great cities defended her frontiers against foreign invasion and gave her a place among the first class nations of Europe Was it just then to pull down an institution that had done so much for France Why did the Americans overthrow British rule in this country Had not England rendered innumerable services to the colony Was she not one of the most progressive most civilizing influences in the modern world Was it just then that we should have beaten out of the land a government that had performed for us so many friendly acts Referring once more to the case of Russia Why do the awakened people in that country demand the overthrow of the autocracy Is there nothing good to be said of Russian autocracy Have not the Czars loved their country and fought for her prosperity Have they not brought Russia up to her present size population and political influence in Europe Have they not beautified her cities and enacted laws for the protection of their subjects Is it right then in spite of all these things that autocracy has done for Russia to seek to overthrow it Once more Why do the missionaries go into India and China and Japan trying to replace the ancestral religion of these people with the Christian faith Why does the missionary labor to overthrow the worship of Buddha Confucius and Zoroaster Have not these great teachers helped humanity Have they not rendered any services to their countrymen Are there no truths in their teachings Are there no virtues in their lives Is it right then that the missionary should criticise these ancient faiths Illustration Conception of Trinity Ninth Century Let us take an example from nearer home We were talking some years ago with a gentleman who had just returned from Dowie s Zion He was surprised to find there a clean orderly and well behaved people apparently quite happy He said that after his experiences there he would rather do business with Dowie and his men than with the average member of other religious bodies He found the Dowieites honest reliable and peaceful Now all this may be true and I hope it is but what of it Dowieism is an evil notwithstanding this recital of its virtues It is an evil because it arrests the intellectual development of man because it makes dwarfs of the people it converts because it pinches the forehead of each convert into that of either a charlatan or an idiot We regret to have to use these harsh terms But Dowieism is denounced because it brings up human beings as if they were sheep because it robs them of the most glorious gift of life the freedom to grow Dowieism is an evil because it makes the human race mediocre by contracting its intellect down to the measure of a creed We would much rather that the Dowieites smoked and drank and swore than that they should fear to think There is hope for a bad man There is no hope for the stupid In the case of an institution or a religion then it is not by adding up the debit and credit columns and striking a balance sheet that the question whether it has helped or hurt mankind is to be determined We cannot for instance place ninety nine vices in one column and a hundred virtues in another and conclude therefrom that the institution or the religion should be preserved Nor conversely speaking can we place a hundred vices against ninety nine virtues and therefore condemn the institution Even as a man is hanged for one act in his life in spite of the thousand good acts which may be quoted against the one evil deed so an institution or a religion is honored or condemned as we said above for its ruling passion Mohammedanism Judaism and Christianity have done much good just as other religions have but they are condemned today by modern thought because they are a conspiracy against reason because they combat progress as if it were a crime Another criticism frequently advanced against us is that we fail to realize that all the evil of which Christianity is said to have been the cause is only the result of human ignorance and passion When attention is called for instance to the intolerance and stubborn opposition to science of Christianity the answer given is that this conduct is not only not inspired by the spirit of Christianity but that it is in direct contradiction to its teachings The Christians claim that all the luminous chapters in history have been inspired by their religion all its sorrowful and black pages have been written by the passions of men But this apology which we regret to say is in every preacher s mouth is not an honest one In our opinion both Mohammedanism and Christianity as also Judaism are responsible for the evil as well as the good they have accomplished in the world They are responsible for the lives they have destroyed as for the lives they have saved They are responsible for the passions they have aroused for the hatred the persecutions and the religious wars of the centuries as for the piety and charity they have encouraged The central idea in all the three religions mentioned above is that God has revealed his will to man There is we say frankly the root of all the evil which religion has inflicted upon our unfortunate earth The poison is in both the flower and the fruit which that idea brings forth If it be true that God has revealed his will that he has told us for instance to believe in the Trinity the atonement the fall of man and the dogma of eternal punishment and we refuse to do so will we not then be regarded as the most odious the most heinous the most rebellious the most sacrilegious the most stiff necked the most criminal people in the world Think of refusing to believe as God has dictated to us Think of saying no to one s Creator and Father in Heaven Think of the consequences of differing with God and tempting others to do the same Is it at all strange that during the early centuries of Christianity the people who hesitated to agree with the deity or to believe as he wanted them to were looked upon as incarnate fiends as the accomplices of the devil and the enemies of the human race and were treated accordingly The doctrine of salvation by faith makes persecution inevitable If to refuse to believe in the Trinity or in the divinity of Christ is a crime against God and will be punished by an eternity of hell in the next world and if such a man endangers the eternal salvation of his fellows is it not the duty of all religious people to endeavor to exterminate him and his race now arid here How can Christian people tolerate the rebel against their God when God himself has pronounced sentence of death against him Why not follow the example of the deity as set forth in the persecutions of the Old Testament When we have a God for a teacher the highest and surest virtue is unconditional acquiescence Judaism Mohammedanism and Christianity in giving us a God for a teacher have taken away from us the liberty to think for ourselves Each one of these three religions makes unconditional obedience the price of the salvation it offers but do you know what other word in the English language unconditional obedience is a synonym of Silence A dumb world a tongue tied humanity alone can be saved The good man is the man on his knees with his mouth in the dust But silence is sterility Silence is slavery Think then of the character of a religion which makes free speech free thought a crime which hurls hell against the Protestant There is a third question to be answered It is true they say to us that there are many things in the Koran the Old Testament and the New which are really injurious and which ought to be discarded but there are also many beautiful principles noble sentiments and high educational maxims in these scriptures Why not then dwell upon these and pass in silence over the objectionable teachings of these religions It is not necessary to repeat again that in all so called sacred scriptures there are glorious truths It could not have been otherwise All literature whether secular or religious is the voice of man and sweeps the whole compass of human love and hope We have no objection to quoting from the Veddas the Avestas the Koran or the Bible nor do we hesitate to admire and enjoy and praise generously the ravishingly beautiful utterances of the poets and prophets of all times and climes Nevertheless it remains true that the modern world finds more practical help and inspiration in secular authors in the books of science and philosophy than in these so called inspired scriptures Jesus who is popularly believed to have preached the Sermon on the Mount has said little or nothing which can help the modern world as much as the scientific revelations of a student like Darwin or of a philosopher like Herbert Spencer or of a poet like Goethe or Shakespeare We know this will sound like blasphemy to the believer but a moment s honest and fearless reflection will convince everyone of the fact that neither Mohammed nor Jesus had in view modern conditions when they delivered their sermons Jesus could have had no idea of a world outside of his little Palestine The thought of the many races of the world mingling together in one country could never have occurred to him His vision did not embrace the vista of two thousand years nor did his mind rise to the level of the problems which today tax the brain and heart of man Jesus believed implicitly that the world would speedily come to an end that the sun and the moon would soon fall from the face of the sky and that people living then in Palestine would not taste of death before they saw the Son of Man return upon the clouds Jesus had no idea of a progressive evolution of humanity It was beyond him to conceive the consolidation of the nations into one fellowship the new resources which science would tap or the new energies which human industry would challenge Jesus was in peaceful ignorance of the social and international problems which confront the world of today The Sermon on the Mount then which is said to be the best in our gospels can be of little help to us for it could not have been meant for us And it is very easy to show that the modern world ignores not out of disrespect to Jesus but by the force of circumstances and the evolution of society the principles contained in that renowned sermon I was waiting for transportation at the corner of one of the principal streets of Chicago the other day when looking about me I saw the tremendous buildings which commerce and wealth have reared in our midst On one hand was a savings bank on the other a colossal national bank and up and down the street a thousand equally solid and substantial buildings devoted to the interests of commerce and civilization To bring out and emphasize the wide breach between the man who preached the Sermon on the Mount and progressive and aggressive busy and wealthy modern Chicago I took the words of Jesus and mentally inscribed them upon the walls of these buildings Upon the savings bank and a savings bank represents economy frugality self sacrifice self restraint the desire of the people to provide for the uncertainties of the future to lay by something for the education of their children for the maintenance of their families when they themselves have ceased to live I printed upon the facade of this institution figuratively speaking these words of the Oriental Jesus Take no thought of the morrow for the morrow will take care of itself And upon the imposing front of the national bank I wrote Lay not up for yourselves treasures on earth If we followed these teachings would not our industrial and social life sink at once to the level of the stagnating Asiatics Pursuing this comparison between Jesus and modern life I inscribed upon the handsome churches whose pews bring enormous incomes and on the palatial residences of Bishops with salaries of from twenty five to a hundred thousand dollars these words How hardly shall a rich man enter into the kingdom of Heaven and It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of Heaven In plain words the gospel condemns wealth and cries Woe unto you rich and Sell all thou hast and give it to the poor which by the way would only be shifting the temptation of wealth from one class to another Buckle was nearer the truth and more modern in spirit when he ascribed the progress of man to the pursuit of truth and the acquisition of wealth But let us apply the teachings of Jesus to still other phases of modern life Some years ago our Cuban neighbors appealed to the United States for protection against the cruelty and tyranny of Spanish rule We sent soldiers over to aid the oppressed and down trodden people in the Island Now suppose instead of sending iron clads and admirals Schley Sampson and Dewey we had advised the Cubans to resist not evil and to submit to the powers that be or suppose the General of our army or the Secretary of our navy had counseled seriously our soldiers to remember the words of Jesus when fighting the Spaniards If a man smite thee on one cheek et cetera Write upon our halls of justice and courthouses and statute books and on every lawyer s desk these solemn words of Jesus He that taketh away thy coat let him have thy cloak also Introduce into our Constitution the pride and bulwark of our liberties guaranteeing religious freedom unto all these words of Paul If any man preach any other gospel than that which I have preached unto you let him be accursed Think of placing nearly fifty millions of our American population under a curse Tell this to the workers in organized charities Give to every man that asketh of thee which if followed would make a science of charity impossible To the workingmen or the oppressed seeking redress and protesting against evil tell this Blessed are they that are persecuted which is equivalent to encouraging them to submit to rather than to resist oppression Or upon our colleges and universities our libraries and laboratories consecrated to science write the words The wisdom of this world is foolishness with God and God has chosen the foolish to confound the wise Ah yes the foolish of Asia it is true succeeded in confounding the philosophers of Europe Abraham Isaac Jacob Moses Jesus did replace Socrates Plato Aristotle Seneca Cicero Caesar and the Antonines But it was a trance a spell a delirium only and it did not last it could not last The charm is at last broken Europe is forever free from the exorcism of Asia I believe the health and sanity and virtue of our Europe would increase a hundred fold if we could from this day forth cease to pretend professing by word of mouth what in our own hearts and lives we have completely outgrown If we could be sincere and brave if our leaders and teachers would only be honest with themselves and honest with the modern world there would indeed be a new earth and a new humanity But the past is past It is for us to sow the seeds which in the day of their fruition shall emancipate humanity from the pressing yoke of a stubborn Asiatic superstition and push the future even beyond the beauty and liberty of the old Pagan world Illustration Figures on a Phoenician Vase Showing the Use of the Cross Evidently in Some Ceremony of a Religious Nature CHRISTIANITY AND PAGANISM Christianity as an Asiatic cult is not suitable to European races To prove this let us make a careful comparison between Paganism and Christianity There are many foolish things and many excellent things in both the Pagan and the Christian religions We are not concerned with particular beliefs and rites it is Paganism as a philosophy of life and Christianity as a philosophy of life that we desire to investigate And at the threshold of our investigation we must bear in mind that Paganism was born and grew into maturity in Europe while Asia was the cradle of Christianity It would be superfluous to undertake to prove that in politics in government in literature in art in science in the general culture of the people Europe was always in advance of Asia Do we know of any good reason when it comes to religion why Asia should be incomparably superior to anything Europe has produced in that line Unless we believe in miracles the natural inference would be that a people who were better educated in every way than the Asiatics should have also possessed the better religion I admit that this is only inferential or a priori reasoning and that it still remains to be shown by the recital of facts that Europe not only ought to have produced a better religion than Asia but that she did In my opinion between the Pagan and Christian view of life there is the same difference that there is between a European and an Asiatic What makes a Roman a Roman a Greek a Greek and a Persian a Persian That is a very interesting but also a very difficult question Why are not all nations alike Why is the oak more robust than the spruce What are the subtle influences which operate in the womb of nature where the embryos of races are nourished into form and individuality I cannot answer that question satisfactorily and I am not going to attempt to answer it at all We know there is a radical difference between the European and the Asiatic we know that Oriental and Occidental culture are the antitheses of each other and nowhere else is this seen more clearly than in their interpretations of the universe that is to say in their religions In order to understand the Oriental races we must discover the standpoint from which they take their observations But first it is admitted of course that there are Europeans who are more Asiatic in their habits of life and thought than the Asiatics themselves and conversely there are Asiatics who in spirit energy and progressiveness are abreast of the most advanced representatives of European culture Nor has Asia been altogether barren she has blossomed in many spots and she nursed the flame of civilization at a time when Europe was not yet even cradled To show the intellectual point of view of the Asiatic let me quote a passage from the Book of Job which certainly is an Oriental composition and one of the finest How then can man be justified with God or how can he be clean that is born of a woman Man that is a worm and the son of man which is a worm This then is the standpoint of the Oriental He believes he is a poor little worm His philosophy must necessarily trail in the dust A worm cannot have the thoughts of an eagle a worm cannot have the imagination of a Titan a worm sees the world only as a worm may This is the angle of vision of the Asiatic He calls himself a worm and naturally his view of life shrinks to the limits of his standpoint To he perfectly fair however we must admit there are passages in all the bibles of the Orient which are as daring as those found in any European book but they represent only the strayings of the Oriental mind not its normal pulse The habitual accent of the Oriental is that man calling a woman his mother is a worm In the Psalms of David or whoever wrote the book we read these words I am a worm and not a man What did the Oriental see in the worm which induced him to select it out of all things as the original so to speak of man The worm crawls and creeps and writhes Nothing is so distressing as to see its helpless wiggling and its home is in the dust dirt is its daily food Moreover it is in danger of being stamped or trampled into annihilation at any instant A worm represents the minimum of worth the dregs in the cup of existence it is the scum or the froth of life which one may blow into the air It is impossible to descend lower than this in self abasement When the Oriental therefore says that man is a worm or I am a worm he is just as much obeying the cumulative pressure of his Asiatic ancestry and voicing the inherited submission of the Oriental mind as Prometheus with the vulture at his breast and shaking his hand in the face of the gods expresses the revolt of the European mind The normal state for the Asiatic is submission for the European it is independence Slavery has a fascination for the children of the east The air of independence is too sharp for them They crave a master a Sultan or a Czar who shall own them body and soul Through long practice they have acquired the art of servility and flattery of salaams and prostrations an art in which they have become so efficient that it would be to them like throwing away so much capital to abandon its practice They expect to go to Heaven on their knees This is not said to hurt the feelings of the races of the Orient We are explaining the influence of absolutism upon the products and tendencies of the human mind The religion of the Orient then notwithstanding its many beautiful features like its politics is a product of the suppressed mind which finds in the creeping worm of the dust the measure of its own worth How different is the European from the Asiatic in this respect The latter crawls upon the stage of this magnificent universe with the timidity hesitancy and tremblings of a worm True to his bringing up he falls prostrate overwhelmed by the marvelous immensities opening before him and the abysses yawning at his feet He contracts and dwindles in size imploring with outstretched hands to be spared because he is a poor worm It is a part of his religion or philosophy that if he admits he is nothing but a worm the dread powers will not consider him a rival or a rebel but will look upon him as a confirmed subject and permit him to live This is his art the strategy by which he hopes to secure his salvation There has never been a republic in Asia which is another way of saying that the Asiatic mind has never asserted its independence Hence its thought smacks of slavery In politics as in religion the Asiatic has always been passive He has never been an actor but only a spectator It is his to nod the head fold the arms and bend the knee On earth he must have a king and a pope and in heaven an Allah or a Jehovah He has not been created for himself but for the glory of his earthly and heavenly Lords This radical difference between European self appreciation and Asiatic self depreciation furnishes the key to the problem under discussion Paganism is the religion of a self governing race Buddhism Judaism Mohammedanism and Christianity are religions born on a soil where man is owned by another It will be impossible to imagine Marcus Aurelius for instance crawling upon his knees before any being or calling himself a worm One must have in his blood the taint of a thousand years of slavery before he can stoop so low Marcus Aurelius was a gentleman The European conception of a gentleman implies self respect and independence the Oriental conception of a gentleman implies self abasement and acquiescence The Oriental gentleman is a man who serves his king as though he were his slave But observe now how the Oriental proceeds to pull down his mind to the level of his body which he has likened to a worm When I was still a Presbyterian minister I was invited to address a Sunday school camp meeting at Asbury Park in New Jersey There were other speakers besides myself one of them known as a Sunday school leader had brought with him a chart of the human heart which when he arose to address the children he spread on a blackboard before them This is a picture of your heart before you have accepted Jesus What do you think of it he asked the school It is all black was the answer and it was He had drawn a totally black picture to represent the heart of the child before conversion In all the literature of Pagandom there is not the least intimation of so fearful an idea as the total depravity of human nature The Pagans never thought spoke or heard of such a thing It was inconceivable to them they would have recoiled from it as from a species of barbarism How radically different then must European culture have been from the Asiatic There is a gulf well nigh impassible between the thought of a free born citizen and that of the oppressed and enslaved Oriental But let us continue Not satisfied with thinking of himself as a worm and of his intellectual and moral nature as totally degraded the Oriental strikes with the same paralyzing stroke at the world in which he lives until it too withers and becomes an ugly and heinous thing He calls the world a vale of tears ruled by the powers of darkness and groaning under a primeval curse The world the flesh and the devil become a trio of iniquity and sin Some of you in your earlier days must have sung that Methodist hymn which represents the world as a snare and a delusion The world is a fleeting show For man s illusion given Given Think of believing that the world has been purposely given us to lead us astray The thought staggers the mind It suggests a terrible conspiracy against man For his ruin sun moon and stars company operate with the devil Help we cry as we realize our inability to cope with the tremendous powers hurling themselves against us like billows of the raging sea and taking our breath away It suggests that we are placed in a world which has been made purposely beautiful in order to tempt us into sin Think of such a belief It is that of a slave It is Asiatic it is not European Neither you nor I in all our readings have ever come across any such attitude toward nature in Pagan literature The Greeks and the Romans loved nature and made lovely gods out of every running brook caressing zephyr dancing wave glistening dew sailing cloud beaming star beautiful woman or brave man The Oriental suspects nature and regards her smiles the shining of the sun the perfume of the meadows the swell of the sea the fluttering of the branches tipped with blossoms the emerald grass the sapphire sky looks upon all these as the seductive advances of a prostitute in whose embrace lurks death But once more not satisfied with dragging the world down to the plane of his totally depraved nature and that again to the level of the worm the Asiatic projects his fatal thought into the next world and crossing the grave that silent and painless home of a tired race he crowds the beyond with a thousand thousand pains and aches and horrors and fires with sulphur and brimstone and burning hells His frightened imagination invokes dark and infernal beings without number fanning with their dark wings the very air he breathes This is too revolting to think of Poor slave Inured to suffering to the lash to oppression s crushing heel he dare not dream of a painless future of a quiet peaceful sleep at life s end nor has he the divine audacity to invent a new world wherein the misery and slavery of his present existence will be impossible where all his tyrants will be dead where he shall taste of sweet freedom and become himself a god In his timidity and shrinking submission with the spring of his heart broken his spirit crushed all independence strangled in his soul he puts in the biggest corner of his heaven even a hell Nor does he pause there but stinging his slave imagination once more he declares that this future of torture and hell fire is everlasting He cannot improve upon that Deeper in degradation he cannot descend That is the darkest thought he can have and strange to say he hugs it to his bosom as a mother would her child The doctrine of hell is the thought of a slave and of a coward No free horn man no brave soul could ever have invented so abhorrent an idea Only under a regime of absolutism only under an Oriental Sultan whose caprice is law whose vengeance is terrible whose favors are fickle whose power is crushing whose greed is insatiable whose torture instruments are without number and whose dark dungeons always resound with the rattling of chains and the groans of martyrs only under such a regime could man have invented an unending hell But we were mistaken when we said that hell was the darkest that the Asiatic was capable of He has grafted upon the European mind a belief which is darker still Is there anything more precious in human life than children The sternest heart melts the fiercest features relax at the sight of an innocent sweet laughing frolicking babe in its mother s arms Look at its glorious eyes so full of surprises so deep so appealing Look at the soft round hands the little feet the exquisite mouth opening like a bud Hear its prattle which is nothing but the mind beginning to stir Watch its gestures the first language of the child See it with its tiny arms about its mother s neck Mark its joy when it is kissed What else in our human world is more beautiful more divine And yet and yet the slave creed of Asia has drawn into its burning net of damnation even the cradle John Burroughs describes how in a Catholic cemetery near where he lives he was shown a neglected unkept corner used for the burial of unbaptized children Consecrated ground is denied to them and so their poor bodies are huddled together in this profane plot unblessed and unsaved I do not wish to live in a world where such absurdities are not only countenanced but where they are exalted even to the dignity of a religion O holy children O sweet children huddled together in unconsecrated ground and thus exposed to the cruelty of indescribable demons Can you hear me I am a man of compassion I can forgive the murderer I can pardon and pity the meanest wretch and take him into my arms but I confess that even if I had a heart as big as the ocean I could not I would not forgive the creed that can be guilty of such inhumanity against you dear innocent ones who were born to breathe but for a moment the harsh air of this world When such gloom overpowers me and wrings from my lips such hard words I find some little respite in contemplating the old Pagan world in its best days I hasten for consolation to my Pagan friends and in their sanity find healing for my bruised heart In one of his letters the Greek Plutarch says this about children which I want you to compare with what saint Augustine the representative of the Asiatic creed says on the same subject It is irreligious writes Plutarch to lament for those pure souls the children who have passed into a better life and a happier dwelling place Footnote Plutarch Ad Uxorem Comp Lecky s History of European Morals Vol I Compare this Pagan tenderness for children with the Asiatic doctrine of infant damnation but recently thrown out of the Presbyterian creed Yet if saint Augustine is to be believed it is a heresy to reject the damnation of unbaptized infants Whosoever shall tell writes this Father of the church that infants shall be quickened in Christ who died without partaking in his sacrament does both contradict the apostles teaching and condemn the whole church Footnote saint Augustine Epist one hundred sixty six It is infinitely more religious to disagree with the apostles and the church if that is their teaching The Pagan view of children is the holier view The doctrine of the damnation of children could only find lodgment in the brain of a slave or a madman It is Asiatic and altogether foreign to the culture of Europe All that we have advanced thus far may be summed up in one phrase Asia invented the idea that man is a fallen being This idea which is the dors espinal the backbone of Christianity never for once entered the mind of the European We have already quoted from Job and the Psalms the following is from the book of Jeremiah The heart is deceitful above all things and desperately wicked This is one of the texts upon which the doctrine of the fall of man is based We repeat that only under a religion of slavery where one slave vies with another to abase himself before his lords and masters could such an idea have been invented There is not a man in all our sacred scriptures who could stand before the deity erect and unabashed or who could speak in the accents of a Cicero who said We boast justly of our own virtue which we could not do if we derived it from the deity and not from ourselves or this from Epictetus It is characteristic of a wise man that he looks for all his good and evil from himself Such independence was foreign to a race that believed itself fallen In further confirmation of our position it may be said that the models which the Pagans set up for emulation were men like themselves only nobler The models which the Orientals set up for imitation on the other hand were supernatural beings or men who were supposed to possess supernatural powers The great men for the Oriental are men who can work miracles who possess magical powers who possess secrets and can know how to influence the deity Moses Joshua David Joseph Isaiah Jesus Paul all demi divinities The Pagans on the other hand selected natural men men like themselves who had earned the admiration of their fellows Let me quote to you Plutarch s eloquent sentence relative to this subject Whenever we begin an enterprise or take possession of a charge or experience a calamity we place before our eyes the examples of the greatest men of our own or of bygone ages and we ask ourselves how Plato or Epaminondas or Lycurgus or Agesilaus would have acted Looking into these personages as into a faithful mirror we can remedy our defects in word or deed The Westminster Catechism which in its essentials is a resume of our Asiatic religion emphasizes the doctrine of the fall of man of which the Pagan world knew nothing and refused to believe it until priests succeeded in dominating the mind of Europe The catechism following the Scripture teaches that we are not only a disinherited family but we are personally depraved and demoralized Footnote Westminster Catechism Comments Goodness the Oriental imagination abused by slavery cannot rid itself of the idea of being disinherited turned out into the cold orphaned and smitten with moral sores from head to foot To the Pagan such a description of man would have been the acme of absurdity Again It the fall affirms that he man is all wrong in all things and all the time Footnote Westminster Catechism Comments If this was comforting news to the Asiatic the Pagan world would have rejected the idea as unworthy of men in their senses Once more All mankind by their fall lost communion with God are under his wrath and curse and so made liable to all miseries in this life and to the pains of hell forever Footnote Westminster Catechism Comments And this is the Gospel we have imported from Asia Is it not pathetic Could slavery ever strike a deeper bottom than that Standing before his owner the Asiatic of his own choice hands himself over to be degraded to be placed in chains and delivered up to the torments of hell forever I despair of man I would cry my heart out if I permitted myself to dwell upon the folly and stupidity and slavery of which man voluntarily makes himself the victim Think of it A man and a woman nobody knows where or when are supposed to have tasted of the fruit of a tree the Oriental mind with its crouching imagination pounces upon this flimsy fanciful tale with the appetite of a carrion crow and exalts it to the dignity of an excuse for the eternal damnation of a whole world I am dazed I can say no more Let us recapitulate The Oriental distrust of the natural man born of self depreciation which is the fruit of prolonged slavery develops into a sort of mental canker spreading at a raging pace until the whole universe with its glorious sun and stars becomes an object of horror and loathing Not satisfied with thinking of himself as a worm of his intellectual and moral nature as totally depraved he communicates his disease to the world in which he lives until it too shrinks and wastes away Then the disease finding no more on this side of the grave to feed upon leaps over the grave and converts the beyond the virgin worlds into an inferno with which to satiate its fear Indeed frightful are the thoughts of a slave people Let me now in conclusion call your attention to another difference between the Occidental and the Oriental mind When the body is feeble or ill nourished it is less liable to resist disease likewise when the mind is alarmed cowed or pinched with fear it becomes more exposed to superstition Superstition is the disease of the mind It will keep away from robust minds as physical disease from a body in health Now the Asiatic mind scared into silence and subjection starved to a mere shadow of what it should be falls an easy prey to all the maladies that mind is heir to The European mind on the other hand with room and air to move and grow in develops a vitality which offers resistance to all attacks of mental disease That explains why superstition thrives with ignorance and slavery and expires when science and liberty gain the ascendency Sanitary precautions prevent physical disease knowledge and liberty constitute the therapeutics of the mind Why is the Oriental so prone or partial to miracle and mystery His mind is sick To believe is easier to him than to reason He follows the line of the least resistance he has invented faith that he may not have to think The mental cells in his brain are so starved so devitalized that they have to be whipped into movement Only the bizarre the monstrous the supernatural demons ghosts dream worlds miracles and mysteries can hold his attention Not science but metaphysics barren speculation is the product of the Oriental mind The philosopher Bacon describes the Asiatic when he speaks of men who have hitherto dwelt but little or rather only slightly touched upon experience whilst they have wasted much time on theories and fictions of the imagination Again I sometimes think that if it be true that monotheism the idea of one God was first discovered in Asia it must have been suggested to them by the regime of Absolutism under which they lived Unlike Asia democratic Europe believed in a republic of gods Polytheism is more consonant with the republican idea than monotheism If we would let the American President rule the land without the aid of the two houses of congress or his cabinet ministers his power would be infinitely more than it is now but his gain would be the people s loss His increased power would only represent so much more power taken away from the people One God means not only more slaves but more abject more helpless ones One God is a centralization which reduces man s liberty to a minimum With more gods and gods at times disagreeing among themselves and all bidding for man s support man would count for more The Greeks could not tolerate a Jehovah or an Allah before whom the Oriental rabble bent the knee Allah knows exclaims the Moslem that is why the Mohammedans continue in ignorance Allah is great cries again the Turk That is why he himself is small The more powerful the sovereign the smaller the subject Now this leads us to a final reflection upon the difference between the mind brought up under restraint in slavery and the mind of the free The Pagan to quote Lecky believed that to become acceptable to the deity one must be virtuous the Asiatic doctrine on the contrary taught that the most heroic efforts of human virtue are insufficient to avert a sentence of eternal condemnation unless united with an implicit belief in the dogmas of religion In other words the noblest of men cannot be saved by his own merits of character alone for even when we have done our best we are but unprofitable slaves quoting a Bible text Only by the merits of Christ or by the grace of God can any man be saved Have you ever paused to think of the purport of this piece of Orientalism It wipes out every imaginable claim or right of man Even when he is just and great and good he has no rights he is as vile as the vilest Only the favor of the king can save only the grace of God who can save the thief on the cross if he so pleases Is he not absolute If he extends his scepter you live if he smiles you are spared if he patronizes you you are fortunate He says live you live He says die you die This is the apotheosis of despotism exalted into a revelation What then is our creed but the thoughts of an eastern slave population cringing before the throne of a Sultan and one by one signing away their liberties The foundation of all real grandeur is a spirit of proud and lofty independence says Buckle but that is not the spirit of Asia or of its religion It is and we ought to try to keep it the spirit of the Western world I cannot imagine how we in this country born of sturdy parents born of the freedom loving Pagans of Rome and Greece born of men who shook their hands in the face of heaven and pulled the gods off their thrones when they violated the rights of man I cannot understand how we have thrown overboard the proud lofty spirit of independence of the Pagans our forefathers and taken upon our necks the strangling yoke of the slave thought of Asia Illustration Christ Half Woman at Baptism in Jordan Cathedral of Chartres France PART III SOME MODERN OPINIONS ABOUT JESUS Christianity dwells with noxious exaggeration about the person of Jesus Emerson Christmas is the season in the year when pulpit and press dwell with what Emerson calls noxious exaggeration about the work and life as well as the person of Jesus We have lying before us the Christmas sermon of so progressive a teacher as the reverend Jenkin Lloyd Jones Footnote Unitarian Independent preacher of All Souls Church Chicago Here is his text And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory glory as of the only begotten from the Father John one fourteen How our educated neighbor can find food for sober reflection in so mystical and metaphysical an effusion is more than we can tell Who is the Word that became flesh And when did the event take place What does it mean to be the only begotten from the Father We know what it means in the orthodox sense but what does it mean from the Unitarian standpoint of mister Jones But the text faithfully reflects the discourse which follows It is replete with unlimited compliments to this Word which became flesh and assumed the name of Jesus The following is a fair sample I am compelled to think of Jesus of Nazareth as an epoch making soul an era forming spirit a character in whom the light of an illustrious race and a holy ancestry was focalized a personality from which radiated that subtle creative power of the spirit which defies all analysis which baffles definition which overflows all words Goodness this is strong rhetoric and we regret that the evidence justifying so sweeping an appreciation has been withheld from us Although the doctor says that Jesus defies all analysis baffles definition and overflows all words he nevertheless proceeds to devote fifteen pages to the impossible task I am compelled to think of him as one who won the right of preeminence in the world s history continues mister Jones as if he had not said enough That is a definite claim and personally we would be glad to see it made good But truth compels us to state that the claim is unjust Without entering into the question of the authenticity of the gospels a question which we have discussed at some length in our pamphlet on the Worship of Jesus we beg to submit that there is nothing in the gospels the only records which speak of him to entitle him to the right of preeminence in the world s history No one knows better than mister Jones that the sayings attributed to Jesus the finest of them are to be found in the writings of Jewish and Pagan teachers antedating the birth of Jesus by many centuries Was it then for his works if not for his words that Jesus won the right of preeminence in the world s history What did he do that was not done by his predecessors Was he the only one who worked miracles Had the dead never been raised before Had the blind and the lame and the deaf remained altogether neglected before Jesus took compassion upon them Moreover what credit is there in opening the eyes of the blind or in raising the dead by miracle Did it cost Jesus any effort to perform miracles Did it imply a sacrifice on his part to utilize a small measure of his infinite power for the good of man Who if he could by miracle feed the hungry clothe the naked and give light and sound to the blind and deaf would be selfish enough not to do so If mister Jones does not believe in miracles then Jesus contributed even less than many a doctor contributes today to the welfare of the world More poor and diseased people are visited and medicined gratuitously by a modern physician in one month than Jesus cured miraculously in the two or three years of his career Jesus if he was the only begotten of God as mister Jones text states was not in any danger of contracting disease himself which is not the case with the doctors and nurses who extend their services to people afflicted with contagious and abhorrent diseases Moreover Jesus power must have come to him divinely while we have to study labor and conquer with the sweat of our brow any power for good that we may possess If Jesus as a God opened the eyes of the blind would it not have been kinder if he had prevented blindness altogether If Jesus can open the eyes of the blind then why is there blindness in the world How many of the world s multitude of sufferers did Jesus help Which of us if he had the divine power would not have extended it unto every suffering child of man Of what benefit is it to open the eyes of a few blind people two thousand years ago in one country when he could by his unique divinity have done so much more mister Jones falls into the orthodox habit of not applying to Jesus the same canons of criticism by which human beings are judged But perhaps the preeminence of Jesus lay in his willingness to give his life for us Noble is every soul who prefers truth and duty to life But was Jesus the only one or even the first to offer himself as a sacrifice upon the altar of humanity If Jesus died for us how many thousands have died for him and by infinitely more cruel deaths It is easier for an only begotten of God himself a God who knows death can have no power over him who sees a throne prepared for him in heaven who is sure of rising from the dead on the third day to face death than for an ordinary mortal Yet Jesus showed less courage if his reporters are reliable than almost any martyr whose name shines upon memory s golden page The European churches are full of pictures showing Jesus suffering indescribable agonies as the critical hour draws nigh We saw in Paris a painting called The Holy Face La Sainte Face which was truly too horrible to look upon big tears of blood trickling down his cheeks his head almost drooping over his chest an expression of excruciating pain upon his features his eyes fairly imploring for help he is really breaking down under the weight of his cross Compare this picture with the serenity of Socrates drinking the hemlock in prison Nor would it do to say that this is only the Catholic way of representing Jesus in his passion The picture is in the gospels it may be seen in the Garden of Gethsemane and on the cross with all its realism Far be it from us to withhold from Jesus if he really suffered as the gospels report one iota of the love and sympathy he deserves but why convert the whole world into a black canvas upon which to throw the sole figure of Jesus Which of us poor weak sinful though we are would not be glad to give his life if thereby he could save a world Do you think we would mourn and groan and weep tears of blood or collapse just when we should be the bravest if we thought that by our death we would become the divine Savior of all mankind Would we stammer Let this cup pass from me if it be possible or tear our hearts with a cry of despair My God my God why hast thou forsaken me if we knew that the eternal welfare of the human race depended upon our death If the Russian or Japanese soldier can take his home and wife and children his hopes and loves his life his all and throw them into the mouth of the cannon dying with a shout upon his lips who would hesitate to do the same when not the salvation of one country alone but of the whole world depended upon it There are examples of heroism in the annals of man which would bring the blush to the cheeks of Jesus if his biographers have not abused his memory Wherein then was the preeminence of Jesus Upon what grounds does mister Jones claim with unlimited rhetoric to use his own expression for Jesus the right of preeminence in the world s history While there is neither a commendable saying nor an act attributed to Jesus in our gospels which teachers older than himself had not already said or done there are some things in which his seniors clearly outshine him King Asoka for instance the Buddhist sovereign of India two hundred fifty years before Jesus in one of his edicts chiseled on the rocks of India declared against human slavery and offered the sweet gift of liberty to all in captivity Jesus used the word slave in one of his parables improperly translated servant without expressing himself on the subject except to intimate that when a slave does all his duty faithfully even then he is only an unprofitable slave unworthy of the thanks of his master There was slavery of the worst kind in the world of Jesus and yet he never opened his mouth to denounce the awful curse It is claimed that Jesus doctrine of love was indirectly a condemnation of slavery Even then inasmuch as other and earlier teachers did more than strike only indirectly at the ancient evil for they not only taught the brotherhood of man too but expressed themselves besides positively on the subject of slavery they have a prior claim to the right of preeminence in the world s history if they cared anything about ranks and titles The doctrine of humanity to animals our dumb neighbors is a positive tenet in Buddhism is it in Christianity Two and a half centuries before Jesus under the influence of Buddha s teaching King Asoka convened a religious Parliament offering to each and every representative of other religions absolute religious liberty Is there any trace of such tolerance in any of the sayings of Jesus On the contrary the claim of Jesus that he is the light the way the truth and that no man can come to the father except through him leaves no room for the greatest of all boons liberty without which every promise of religion is only a mockery and a cheat Not even heaven and eternal life can be accepted as a consideration for the loss of liberty The liberty of teaching is alien to a teacher who claims as Jesus did that he alone is infallible and that all who came before him were thieves and robbers Of course mister Jones will deny that Jesus ever said any of the things ascribed to him which spoil his ideal picture of him But he finds his ideal Jesus whose personality defies analysis baffles definition and overflows all words in the gospels if these are not reliable what becomes of his argument If the writers of our gospels bear false witness against Jesus when they represent him as cursing the fig tree as calling his enemies liars and devils as calling the Gentiles dogs as claiming equality with God as menacing with damnation all who disagree with him what security have we that they speak truthfully when they put the beatitudes in his mouth We have no more reliable authority for attributing to Jesus the beatitudes than we have for holding him responsible for the curses attributed to him in the gospels To return to our comparison between Jesus and his illustrious colleagues It is with cheerful praise and generous pleasure that we express our admiration for many of the sayings parables and precepts attributed to Jesus The fact that they are much older than Jesus more universal than Christianity only enhances their value and reflects glory upon the human race a glory of which Jesus too as a brother if he ever existed has his share We love and admire every teacher who has a message for humanity we feel our indebtedness to them and would deem ourselves fortunate if we could contribute to the advancement of their noble influence but we have no idols and in our pantheon truth is above all We have no hesitation to sacrifice even Jesus to the Truth If we were in India and some Hindoo preacher spoke of Buddha as mister Jones does of Jesus as a personality defying all analysis baffling definition and overflowing all words one who has won the right to preeminence in the world s history we would protest against it in the interest of Jesus and other teachers as we now protest against mister Jones Jesus in the interest of truth We have a suspicion however that if mister Jones or preachers of his style were Hindoos they would speak of Buddha as they now being Christians speak of Jesus echoing in both instances the popular opinion The best way to illustrate mister Jones style of reasoning is to quote a few examples from his sermon The story of the Good Samaritan has had a power beyond the story of the senseless blighting of the fig tree the ages have loved to think of Jesus talking with the woman at the well more than they have loved to think of him as manufacturing wine at Cana No man is so orthodox but that he reads more often the Sermon on the Mount than he does the story of the drowning of the pigs But if he did not drown the pigs the reporter who says he did might have also collected from ancient sources the texts in the Sermon on the Mount and put them in Jesus mouth Again The dauntless crusaders who now in physical armament and again in the more invulnerable armament of the spirit went forth reckless of danger regardless of cost to rescue the world from heathen hands or to gather souls into the fold of Christ We can hardly believe mister Jones speaking of rescuing the world from heathen hands et cetera Who were the heathen And think of countenancing the craze of the crusades which cost a million lives to possess the empty sepulchre of a mythical Savior Is it one of the merits of Christianity that it calls other people heathen or that it kills them and lays waste their lands for an empty grave Once more Jesus had tremendous expectations He believed mightily in the future not as some glory rimmed heaven after death but as a conquering kingdom of love and justice Jesus took large stock in tomorrow he laughed at the prudence that never dares the mock righteousness of the ledger that presumes to balance the books and pay all accounts up to date He knew that the prudence of commerce the thrift of trade the exclusive pride of the synagogue must be broken through with a larger hope and a diviner enterprise He believed there was to be a day after today and recognized his obligation to it he acknowledged the debt which can never be paid to the past and which is paid only by enlarging the resources of the future Life to Jesus was an open account he was a forward looker he was honest enough to recognize his obligations to the unborn Perhaps this adventurous spirit in the realms of morals even more than his heart of love has made him the superlative leader of men We sincerely wish all this were true and would be glad to have mister Jones furnish us with the texts or evidences which have led him to his conclusions Would not his adjectives be equally appropriate in describing any other teacher he admires Jesus had tremendous expectations Well though this is somewhat vague as a tribute to Jesus we presume the preacher means that Jesus was an optimist The reports unfortunately flatly contradict mister Jones Jesus was a man of sorrows He expressly declared that this earth belonged to the devil that the road which led to destruction was crowded while few would enter the narrow gates of life He said Many are called but few are chosen he told his disciples to confine their good work to the lost sheep of the House of Israel and intimated that it were not wise to take the bread of children his people and give it to the dogs other people The Go ye into all the world is a post resurrection interpolation and mister Jones does not believe in the miracle of the resurrection Jesus looked forward to the speedy ending and destruction of the world when the sun and moon would turn black and the stars would fall and he doubted whether he would find any faith in the world when the son of man cometh and it was Jesus who expected to say to the people on his left depart from me ye cursed into everlasting punishment This is the teacher whose pessimism is generally admitted of whom mister Jones says that he had tremendous expectations He believed there was to be a day after today and recognized his obligation to it writes mister Jones in his indiscriminate laudation of Jesus Is that why he said Take no thought of the morrow and predicted the speedy destruction of the world He acknowledged the debt which can never be paid to the past A sentence like this has all the ear marks of a glittering generality Did Jesus show gratitude to the past when he denounced all who had preceded him in the field of love and labor as thieves and robbers Equally uncertain is the following He was honest enough to recognize his obligations to the unborn How does our clerical neighbor arrive at such a conclusion From what teaching or saying of Jesus does he infer his respect for the rights of posterity Indeed how could a teacher who said He that believeth not shall be damned he described as recognizing the rights of future generations To menace with damnation the future inquirer or doubter is to seek to enslave as well as to insult the generations yet to be born instead of recognizing his obligations to them The Jesus mister Jones is writing about is not in the gospels Do you ask me if I am a Christian writes mister Jones and he answers the question thus I do not know Are you If anyone is inclined to give me that high name with the spiritual and ethical connotation in mind I am complimented and will try to merit it As our excellent neighbor is still in the dark and does not know whether or not or in what sense he is a Christian unless he is allowed to define the word himself and as he also intimates that he would like to be a Jesus Christian but not a Church Christian we humbly beg to express this opinion The American churches of today notwithstanding all their shortcomings are on every question of ethics and science of charity and the humanities far in advance of Jesus and that in these churches there are men and women who in breadth of mind and nobility of spirit are as good and even better than Jesus Does our neighbor grasp our meaning Charging all the bad in a religion to the account of man and attributing all the good to God or to a demi god is after all only a dodge Had not the disciples of Jesus been braver than their master his religion would not have come down to us And had the Christian church lived up to the letter of this Semitic teacher Europe would never have embraced Christianity By modernizing Jesus by selecting his more essential teachings and relegating his eccentricities to the background by making his name synonymous with the best aspirations of humanity by idealizing his character and enclosing it with a human halo the churches have saved Jesus from oblivion Jesus was a tribal teacher the church universalized him Jesus had no gospel for women the church has after much hesitation and wavering converted him to the European attitude toward women Jesus was silent on the question of slavery the churches have urged him with success to champion the cause of the bondsman Jesus denounced liberty of conscience when he threatened with hell fire the unbeliever but the churches have won him over to the modern secular principle of religious tolerance Jesus believed only in the salvation of the elect but the church to a certain extent has succeeded in reconciling him to the larger hope Jesus was an ascetic preferring the single life to the joys of the home and fasting and praying to the duty and privilege of labor but the church in America and Protestant Europe at least has made Jesus a lover and a seeker of wealth and knowledge the two great forces of civilization No longer does Jesus say hate your father and mother no longer does he cry in our great thoroughfares blessed are the poor no longer is his voice heard denouncing this world as belonging to the devil The modern church modernized by science has in turn modernized the gospels And yet mister Jones prefers to be a Christian such as Jesus was He is repeating one of those phrases which apologists use when they give God all the praise and man all the blame In conclusion mister Jones admits that Christianity is not unique that Buddha conquered greater tyrannies than Christ that humility and self sacrifice have world wide foundations but he draws no conclusions from these important facts but returns in a hurry to say that Jesus is the finest and dearest stream swelling the mighty tide of history The only objection we have to mister Jones Jesus is that he is not real ANOTHER RHETORICAL JESUS The reverend W H H Boyle of saint Paul improves even on mister Jones superlative tribute to Jesus He says Can you imagine such a thing as a black sun or the reversal of creation or the annihilation of primal light Then give rest to imagination and soberly think what it would mean to have the spiritual processes of two millenniums reversed to have the light of life in the unique personally of Jesus forever eclipsed Here is an idolator indeed To make an idol of his Jesus he takes a sponge and without a twinge of conscience wipes out all the beauty and grandeur of the ancient world Has this gentleman never heard of Greece During a short existence in only two centuries and a half that little land of Greece achieved triumphs in the life of the mind so unparalleled as to bring all the subsequent centuries upon their knees before it In philosophy in poetry lyrical epical dramatic in sculpture in statesmanship in ethics in literature in civilization where is there another Greece Oh land of Sophocles whose poetry is the most perfect flower the earth has ever borne of Phidias and Praxiteles whose immortal children time cannot destroy though the gods are dead whose masterpieces the earth wears as the best gem upon her brow of Aristotle the intellect of the world of Socrates the parens philosophiae and its first martyr of Aristides the Just of Phocion and Epaminondas of Chillon and Anarcharchis whose devotion to duty and beauty have perfumed the centuries O Athens the bloom of the world Hear this sectarian clergyman in his black Sunday robes closing his eyes upon all thine immortal contributions pulling down like a vandal as did the early Christians the libraries and temples the culture and civilization of the ancient world the monuments of thy unfading glory to build therewith a pedestal for his mythical Christ I can imagine the reverend advocate saying But there was slavery in Greece and immorality too of course and is the Christian world free from them Has Christ after two thousand years abolished war Indeed he came to bring as he says not peace but a sword Has Jesus healed the world of the maladies for which we blame the Pagan world Has he made humanity free Has he saved the world from the fear of hell Has he redeemed man from the blight of ignorance Has he broken the yoke of superstition and priest craft Has he even succeeded in uniting into one loving fold his own disciples How then can this clergyman with any conscience for truth compare a world deprived of the god of his sect to a tomb to a blind man groping under a blackened sun Must a man rob the long past in order to provide clothing for his idol Must he close his eyes upon all history before he can behold the beauty of his own cult But let us quote again To efface from the statute books of Christendom every law which has its basal principle in Christian ethics to abolish every institution which ministers to human need and misfortune in the name of Him whose sympathy is the heart of the divine to lower every sense of moral obligation between man and man to the old level of Paganism to silence the great oratorios which have made music the echo of the divine to take down from the galleries of the world the sacred canvases with which genius has sanctified them to obliterate from memorial symbolism the cross of sublime renunciation which has been the rebuke of human selfishness to disband every organization which makes prayer through the merit of one great name the hand of man upon the arm of God you may be able to think of an ocean without a harbor of a sky without a sun of a garden without a flower of a face without a smile of a home without a mother but can you think of a world with holiness and happiness in it and Jesus gone out of it You cannot Then come let us adore him et cetera et cetera Observe how this special pleader avoids breathing so much as a word about any of the many evils which may be laid at the door of his religion with as much show of reason as the benefits he enumerates What about the dark ages which held all Europe for the space of a thousand years in the clutches of an ignorance the like of which no other religion in the world had known What about the atrocious inquisition to which no other religion in the world had ever been able to give the swing that Christianity did What about the persecution and burning of helpless women as witches Is there anything as infamous as that in any religion outside of ours What about the wholesale massacres in the name of the true faith What about the centuries of religious wars the most imbecile as well as the most bloody from the effects of which Germany France Italy and England are still suffering today And need we also call attention to that obstinate resistance to science and progress which rewarded every discoverer of a new power for man with the halter or the stake which filled the dungeons with the elite of Europe which even dug open graves to punish the bones of the dead savants and illuminators of man The Pagans in their gladitorial games sacrificed the lives of slaves Christianity made a holocaust of the noblest intellects of Europe And shall we speak of the bigotry the fanaticism the bitter sectarian prejudices which to this day embitter the life of the world Are not these too the fruits of Christianity We know the answer which the reverend gentleman would make to this All the evils you speak of are chargeable not to Christianity but to its abuse But we have already shown that that argument won t do We might as well say that all the evil of Paganism was due to its abuse The mere fact that Christianity lent itself to such fearful distortions and was capable of arousing the worst passions in man on such a fearful scale is condemnation enough It shows that there was in it a potentiality for evil beyond compare Moreover wherein does a divine religion differ from a man made cult if it is equally powerless to protect itself against perversion In what sense is Jesus a god while all his rivals were mere men if he is as helpless to prevent the abuse of his teachings as they were But it would not be difficult to show that the characteristic crimes we have scheduled are the direct inspiration of a religion claiming exclusiveness and infallibility Such texts as there is no other named given under heaven by which men can be saved Let such an one the man who will not be converted be like a heathen and a publican to you John s advice to refrain from saying God speed to the alien in faith the bible command not to suffer a witch to live and many of the dogmas which might be cited corrupted the sympathies perverted the judgment of the noblest while at the same time they stung the evil minded into something like madness The world knew nothing of the tyranny of dogma or religious oppression and persecution comparatively speaking until the advent of the Jewish Christian Church Verily I say unto you it shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and of Gomorrah in the day of judgment than for that city said Jesus speaking of the people who might not accept his teachings How can Christianity be a religion of love and how can it believe in tolerance when it threatens the unbeliever with a fate worse than that of Sodom and Gomorrah The benefits which the reverend Boyle parades as the direct fruit of his cult did not appear until after the Renaissance that is to say the return to Pagan culture and ideals The art and science and the humanities which he praises followed upon the gradual decline of the Jewish Christian religion which had already destroyed two civilizations But Greece and Rome triumphed To this day if we need models in poetry in art in philosophy in literature in politics in patriotism in service to the public in heroism and devotion to ideals we must go to the Greeks and the Romans Not that these nations were by any means perfect but because they have not been surpassed In our colleges and schools when we wish to bring up our children in the ways of wisdom and beauty we do not give them the Christian fathers to read we give them the Pagan classics We ask this saint Paul clergyman to read Gibbons tribute to Pagan Rome If a man was called upon to fix a period in the history of the world during which the condition of the human race was most happy and prosperous he would without hesitation name that which elapsed from the death of Domitian to the accession of Commodus This period included such men and rulers as Nerva Trajan Adrian Antoninus Pius and above all the greatest of them all the greatest ruler our earth has ever owned Marcus Aurelius Antoninus Let the reverend W H H Boyle look over the names of the kings of Israel and of Christian France Spain Italy and England and find among them any one that can come up to the stature of these Pagan monarchs WE OWE EVERYTHING TO JESUS But behold another clergyman with the claim that the modern world owes all its joy and cheer during the Christmas season to the babe in Bethlehem What was it that brought about such a condition that crowds the stores that overflows the mails and loads the express with packages of every description The little babe in Bethlehem set all this in motion the wreath the holly are all from him When we read the above and more to the same effect we wrote to the reverend W A Bartlett Footnote Pastor First Congregational Church Chicago the author of the words quoted asking him if he was correctly reported We reproduce herewith a copy of our letter DEC twenty nineteen oh four Rev W A Bartlett Washington Boul and Ann saint Chicago DEAR mister BARTLETT In the report of your sermon of last Sunday you are represented as claiming that it is to the babe in Bethlehem we owe the Christmas festival the giving of presents et cetera et cetera I write to ascertain whether this report has stated your position correctly I am sure you know that Christmas is only a recomposition of an old Pagan festival and that giving presents at this season is a much older practice than Christianity Of course you do not believe that Christmas is celebrated in December and on the twenty fifth of the month because Jesus was born on that day You know as well as I do of the Pagan festivals celebrated in the month of December throughout the Roman Empire celebrations which were accompanied with the giving and receiving of presents Moreover you know also as every student does that in the Latin countries of Europe it is not on Christmas day but on New Year s day that presents are exchanged Surely you would not claim that for New Year s day too the world is indebted to the Bethlehem babe You must also have known that the use of the evergreen and the holy was in vogue among the Druids of Pagan times Be kind enough therefore to give me if I am not asking too much the facts which led you to make the statement to which I have called your attention and believe me with great respect et cetera To this neighborly letter the reverend gentleman did not condescend to send an acknowledgment We knocked at his door as it were and he a minister of the Gospel declined to open it unto us Clergymen as a rule say that they are happy when people will let them preach the gospel to them In our case we saved the clergyman from calling upon us we called upon him that is to say we wrote and gave him an opportunity to enlighten us to bring his influence to bear upon us to open our eyes to the error of our ways and he would have nothing to do with us Was not our soul worth saving Did the reverend W A Bartlett consider us beyond hope We ask this clergyman to place his hand upon his conscience and ask himself whether he did the brotherly thing in not returning a friendly and kindly answer to our honest inquiry for truth But he did not answer us because he had no real faith in his gospel It was not good enough for an inquirer But the clergyman according to reports made an attempt on the Sunday following the receipt of our letter before his congregation to answer indirectly our question He denied that Christmas was a recomposition of an old Pagan festival and said that the early Christians fasted and wept because of these Pagan festivals and that as early as the second century the birth of Jesus was commemorated In short he pronounced it a distortion of history to assign to the Christmas festival a Pagan origin In his great work on the History of Civilization Buckle says this to which we call doctor Bartlett s attention As soon as eminent men grown unwilling to enter any profession the luster of that profession will be tarnished first its reputation will be lessened then its power abridged We fear this is true of mister Bartlett s profession How can Christian ministers hope to engage the interest of the reading public if they themselves abstain from reading Ask a secular newspaper about the origin of the Christmas celebration and it will tell you the truth On the very Sunday that doctor Bartlett was denouncing in his church our claim that the Pagans gave us the December season of joy and merry making as a distortion of history and editorial in the Chicago Tribune said this But the festive character of the celebration the giving of presents the feasting and merriment the use of evergreen and holly and mistletoe are all remnants of Pagan rites Continuing the same editorial called attention to the antiquity of the institution Long before the shepherds on the Judean plains saw the star rise in the east and heard the tidings of Peace on earth good will to man the Roman populace surged through the streets at the feast of Saturn giving themselves up to wild license and boisterous merry making They exchanged presents they decorated their dwellings and temples with green boughs slaves were given special privileges and the spirit of good will was abroad among men This Roman Saturnalia came at the winter solstice the same as does our Christmas day while the birth of Christ is widely believed to have taken place at some other season of the year But doctor Bartlett may have had in mind the quotation from Anastasius Our Lord Jesus Christ was born of the Holy Virgin Mary in Bethlehem at one o clock in the afternoon of December twenty fifth appearing to quote from some old manuscript which unfortunately is not to be found anywhere But Clement of Alexandria in the year two hundred ten A D dismisses all guesses as to when Jesus was born the eighteenth of April nineteenth of May et cetera as products of reckless speculation March twenty eighth is given as Jesus birthday in De Pascha Computius in the year two hundred forty three Jan fifth is the date defended by Epiphanius Baradaens Bishop of Odessa says No one knows exactly the day of the nativity of our Lord this only is certain from what Luke writes that he was born in the night Poor doctor Bartlett his December twenty fifth does not receive support from the Fathers For our clerical brother s sake we quote some more from the Tribune editorial Primeval man looked upon the sun as the revelation of divinity When the shortest day of the year was passed when the sun began his march northward the primitive man rejoiced in the thought of the coming seedtime and summer and he made feasts and revelry the mode of expressing the gladness of his heart Among the sun worshipers of Persia among the Druids of the far north among the Phoenicians among the Romans and among the ancient Goths and Saxons the winter solstice was the occasion of festivities Many of them were rude and barbarous but they were all distinguished by hearty and profuse hospitality And yet our neighbor calls it distortion of history to connect Christmas with the Pagan festival celebrated about this time We quote once more from the Secular press The Christian church did not abolish these heathen ceremonies but grafted upon them a deeper spiritual meaning For this reason Christmas is an institution which memorializes the best there was in Pagan man Its good cheer its charity its sports its feasting and the features which most endear it to children are all the heritage of our Pagan ancestors How refreshing this compared with the clergyman s silence or cry of distortion But in one thing the doctor is correct The early Christians did bewail the Pagan festivals as they did everything else that was Pagan But it did not help them at all they were compelled to acquiesce The Christians have fasted and prayed also against science progress and modern thought but what good has it done They asked God to hook Theodore Parker s tongue to overthrow Darwin and to confound the wisdom of this world but the prayer remains unanswered Yes the doctor is right the church has fasted and prayed against religious tolerance against the use of Sunday as a day of recreation the opening of galleries and libraries on that day the advancement of women the emancipation of the negro the secularization of education the revision of old creeds and a thousand other things But their opposition has only damaged their own cause They did try to suppress the Pagan festival which we call Christmas and the Puritans in this country until recently abstained from all recognition of the day and called it Popery and Paganism but their efforts bore no fruit doctor Bartlett if he will read will learn that for many years in England and in this country the observance of Christmas was forbidden by law under severe penalties As to our being indebted for the cheer and merriment of the December festival to the Bethlehem babe the doctor must inform himself of those acts of Parliament which under the Puritan regime compelled people to mourn on Christmas day and to abstain from merrymaking In Christian Connecticut for a man to have a sprig of holly in his house on Christmas day was a finable crime In Massachusetts any Christian detected celebrating Christmas was fined five shillings and costs But see having failed to suppress these good institutions they now turn about and claim that they have always believed in them and that in fact we would not now be enjoying any one of these benefits but for the Christian Church In conclusion we have one other word to say to the three clerical teachers from whose writings we have quoted Against them we are constrained to bring the charge of looseness in thought They seem to have little conscience for evidence mister Jones says for instance In short I am compelled to think that this Light of Souls this saving and redeeming spirit was the loved and loving child of Joseph the carpenter and the loyal wife Mary I believe this notwithstanding the stories of immaculate conceptions star guided magi choiring angels and adoring shepards that gathered around the birth night Which is another way of saying that he is compelled to believe against the evidence merely because it is his pleasure or interest to do so This is not very edifying to be sure mister Jones takes all his information about Joseph and Mary and Jesus from the gospels and yet the gospels clearly contradict his conclusions Mary the mother of Jesus gives her word of honor that Joseph was not the father of her child and Joseph himself testifies that he is not Jesus father but mister Jones pays no attention to their testimony he wishes Joseph to be the father of Jesus and that ought to be sufficient evidence he thinks We quote from the gospel Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise When his mother Mary had been betrothed to Joseph before they came together she was found with child of the Holy Ghost And Joseph her husband being a righteous man and not willing to make her a public example was minded to put her away privily But when he thought on these things behold an angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream saying Joseph thou son of David fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost Now if Joseph admits he was not Jesus father and Mary corroborates his testimony See Luke first chapter Jesus was if he ever lived and the records which give mister Jones his ideal Jesus are reliable the son of a man who has succeeded in concealing his identity unless of course we believe in the virgin birth If the real father of Jesus had come forth and owned his son and Mary had acknowledged that he was the father of her child what would have become of Christianity We hope these clergymen who have dwelt as Emerson says with noxious exaggeration about the person of Jesus will reflect upon this and while doing so will they not also remember this other saying of the Concord philosopher The vice of our theology is seen in the claim that Jesus was something different from a man We take our leave of the three clergymen assuring them that in what we have said we have not been actuated in the least by any personal motive whatever and that we have only done to them what we would have them do to us Illustration Head of a God with Horns Museum of saint Germain A LIBERAL JEW ON JESUS FELIX ADLER PRAISES JESUS That it is very easy for scholars to follow the people instead of leading them and to side with the view that commands the majority receives fresh confirmation from the recent utterances of the founder of the Ethical Culture Society in New York Professor Adler the son of a rabbi and at one time a freethinker has slowly drifted into orthodox waters after having tried for a period of years the open seas and has become a more enthusiastic champion of the god of the Christians than many a Christian scholar whom we could name The pendulum in the Adler case has swung clear to the opposite side We do not find fault with a man because he changes his views we only ask for reasons for the change It will be seen by the following extracts from Adler s printed lectures that he has made absolutely no critical study of the sources of the Jesus story but has merely and hurriedly at that accepted the conventional estimate of Jesus and enlarged upon it Jesus is entitled to all the praise which is due him but it must first be shown that in praising him we are not sacrificing the truth Praising any man at such a cost is merely flattering the masses and bowing to the fashion of the day Let us hear what Professor Adler has to say about Jesus He writes It has been said that if Christ came to New York or Chicago they would stone him in the very churches It is not so If Christ came to New York or Chicago the publicans and sinners would sit at his feet For they would know that he cared for them better than they in their darkness knew how to care for themselves and they would love him as they loved him in the days of yore This would sound pious in the mouth of a Moody or a Torrey but we confess it sounds like affectation in the mouth of the free thinking son of a rabbi That Prof Adler enters here into a field for which his early Jewish training has not fitted him is apparent from the hasty way in which he has put his sentences together It has been said he writes that if Christ came to New York or Chicago they would stone him in the very churches It is not so Why is it not so And he answers If Christ came to New York or Chicago the publicans and sinners would sit at his feet But what has the reception which publicans and sinners might give Jesus to do with how the churches would receive him He proves that Jesus would not be stoned in the churches of New York and Chicago by saying that the publicans and sinners would sit at his feet Does he mean that New York and Chicago churches and publicans and sinners are the same thing Publicans and sinners might welcome him and still the churches might stone him which in fact according to Adler s own admission was the case in Jerusalem where the synagogues conspired against Jesus while Mary Magdalene sat at his feet Nor are his words about the publicans and sinners loving Jesus as they loved him in the days of yore edifying Who does he mean by the publicans and sinners and how many of them loved Jesus in the days of yore and why should this class of people have felt a special love for him On the question of the resurrection of Jesus Prof Adler says this It is sometimes insinuated that the entire Christian doctrine depends on the accounts contained in the New Testament purporting that Jesus actually rose on the third day and was seen by his followers and that if these reports are found to be contradictory unsupported by sufficient evidence and in themselves incredible then the bottom falls out of the belief in immortality as represented by Christianity It was the Apostle Paul himself who said that if Jesus has not risen from the dead then is our faith in vain and we are of all men most miserable So you see friend Adler it is not sometimes insinuated as you say but it is openly and to our thinking logically asserted that if Jesus did not rise from the dead the whole fabric of Christian eschatology falls to the ground But we must remember that Prof Adler has not been brought up a Christian He has acquired his Christian predilections only recently so to speak hence his unfamiliarity with its Scriptures Continuing the Professor says But similar reports have arisen in the world time and again apparitions of the dead have been seen and have been taken for real and yet such stories after being current for a time invariably have passed into oblivion Why did this particular story persist despite the paucity and the insufficiency of the evidence Why did it get itself believed and take root What shall we think of such reasoning from the platform of a presumable rationalist movement Does not the Professor know that the story of the resurrection of Jesus is not original but a repetition of older stories of the kind Had the world never heard of such after death apparitions before Jesus day it would never have invented the story of his resurrection And how does the Professor know that the story of Jesus resurrection is not going to meet the same fate which has overtaken all other similar stories Is it not already passing into the shade of neglect Are not the intelligent among the Christians themselves beginning to explain the resurrection of Jesus allegorically denying altogether that he rose from the dead in a literal sense Moreover the pre Christian stories of similar resurrections lived to an old age two or three thousand years before they died and the story of Jesus resurrection has yet to prove its ability to live longer All miraculous beliefs are disappearing and the story of the Christian resurrection will not be an exception But Prof Adler s motive in believing that the story of the resurrection of Jesus shall live is to offer it as an argument for immortality and in so doing he strains the English language in lauding Jesus He says In my opinion people believed in the resurrection of Jesus because of the precedent conviction in the minds of the disciples that such a man as Jesus could not die because of the conviction that a personality of such superlative excellence so radiant so incomparably lofty in mien and port and speech and intercourse with others could not pass away like a forgotten wind that such a star could not be quenched We regret to say that there are as many assumptions in the above sentence as there are lines in it Of course if we are for emotionalism and not for exact and accurate conclusions Adler s estimate of Jesus is as rhetorical as that of Jones or Boyle but if we have any love for historical truth there is not even the shadow of evidence for instance that the disciples could not believe that such a man as Jesus could die On the contrary the disciples left him at the cross and fled and believed him dead until it was reported to them that he had been seen alive and even then some doubted and one wished to feel the flesh with his fingers before he would credit his eyes Jesus had to eat and drink with them he had to open their eyes and perform various miracles before they would believe that he was not dead The text which says that the apostles hesitated to believe in the resurrection because as yet they knew not the scripture that he would rise from the dead shows conclusively how imaginary is the idea that there was a precedent conviction in the minds of the disciples that such a man as Jesus could not die Apparently it was all a matter of prophecy not of moral character at all Yet in the face of all the evidence to the contrary Prof Adler tells his Carnegie Hall audience who unfortunately are even less informed in Christian doctrine than their leader that there was a precedent conviction in the minds of the disciples that such a man as Jesus could not die And what gave the disciples this supposed precedent conviction That a personality of such superlative excellence so radiant so incomparably lofty in mien and port and speech and intercourse with others could not pass away like a forgotten wind that such a star could not be quenched We are simply astonished and grieved as well to see the use which so enlightened a man as Prof Adler makes of his gifts Will this Jewish admirer of the god of Christendom kindly tell us wherein Jesus was superlatively excellent or incomparably lofty in mien and port and speech and intercourse with others Was there a weakness found in men like Buddha Confucius Socrates et cetera from which Jesus was free That Jesus created no such ideal impression upon his disciples is shown by the fact that they represented him as a sectarian and an egotist who denounced all who had preceded him as unworthy of respect and to be despised And how could a man whose public life did not cover more than two or three years of time and who lived as a celibate and a monk returning every night to his cave in the Mount of Olives taking no active part in the business life supporting no family or parents assuming no civil or social duties how can such a man we ask be held up as a model for the men and women of today Jesus according to his biographers believed he could raise the dead and announced himself the equal of God I and my father are one he is reported to have said and one of his apostles writes He Jesus thought it no robbery to be equal to God Either this report is true or it is not If it is what shall we think of a man who thought he was a god and could raise the dead If the report is not true what reliance can we place in his biographers when the things which they affirm with the greatest confidence are to be rejected Yet Prof Adler swept off his feet by the popular and conventional enthusiasm about Jesus describes him as a personality of such superlative excellence so radiant so incomparably lofty in mien and port and speech and intercourse with others that his followers could not believe he was a mere mortal But where is the Jesus to correspond to this rhetorical language He is not in the anonymous gospels There we find only a fragmentary character patched or pieced together as it were by various contributors a character made up of the most contradictory elements as we have tried to show in the preceding pages The Jesus of Adler is not in history he is not even in mythology There is no one of that name and answering that description in the four gospels That a loose way of speaking grows upon one if one is not careful and that sounding phrases and honest historical criticism are not the same thing will be seen by Prof Adler s lavish praise of John Calvin He speaks of him in terms almost as glowing as he does of Jesus He calls Calvin that mighty and noble man That Calvin ruled Geneva like a Russian autocrat that he was mighty in a community in which Jacques Gruet was beheaded because he had danced and also because he had committed the grave offense of saying that Moses was only a man and no one knows what God said to him and in which Michael Servetus was burned alive for holding opinions contrary to those which the Genevan pope was interested in is readily conceded But was Calvin mighty in a beneficent sense Did his power save people from the Protestant inquisition Was not the Geneva of his day called the Protestant Rome And if he did not use his powerful influence to further religious tolerance and intellectual honesty if he did not use his position to save men from the grip of superstition and the fear of hell how can Prof Adler refer to him as that mighty and noble man John Calvin It is not our purpose to grudge Calvin any compliments which Felix Adler wishes to pay him What we grieve to see is that he should indirectly at least recommend to the admiration of his readers a man who if he existed today and acted as he did in the Geneva of the sixteenth century would be regarded by every morally and intellectually awakened man as a criminal Has not Felix Adler examined the evidence which incriminates Calvin and proves him beyond doubt as the murderer of Servetus If he Servetus comes to Geneva I shall see that he does not escape alive wrote John Calvin to Theodore Beza And he carried out his fearful menace Servetus was put to death by the most horrible punishment ever invented he was burned alive in a smoking fire What did this mighty and noble man do to save a stranger and a scholar from so atrocious a fate Let his eulogist Prof Adler answer It will not do to say that those were different times A thousand voices were raised against the wanton and cruel murder of Servetus but Calvin s was not among them In fact when Calvin himself was a fugitive and a wanderer he had written in favor of religious tolerance but no sooner did he become the Protestant pope of Geneva than he developed into an exterminator of heresy by fire Such is the mighty and noble man held up for our admiration Mighty he was but we ask again was he mighty in a noble sense Had Calvin been considered a mighty and noble man by the reformers who preceded Prof Adler there would have been no Ethical Culture societies in America today Prof Adler is indebted for the liberties which he enjoys in New York to the Voltaires and the Condorcets who regarded Calvin and his isms as pernicious to the intellectual life of Europe and did all they could to lead the people away from them Think of the leader of the Ethical Societies exalting a persecutor to say nothing of his abominable theology or of his five aliases as that mighty and noble man John Calvin We feel grateful to Prof Adler for organizing the Ethical Societies in American but we would be pleased to have him explain in what sense a man of Calvin s small sympathies and terrible deeds could be called both noble and mighty Footnote See The Kingdom of God in Geneva Under Calvin M M Mangasarian It was predicted some years ago that the founder of the Ethical Societies will before long return to the Jewish faith of his fathers However this may be we have seen in his estimate of Jesus and John Calvin evidences of his estrangement from rationalism of which in his younger days he was so able a champion In his criticism of the Russian scientist Metchnikoff of the Pasteur Institute in Paris Prof Adler endorsing the popular estimate of Jesus accepts also the popular attitude toward science He appears to prefer the doctrine of special creation to the theory of evolution We would not have believed this of Felix Adler if we did not have the evidence before us We speak of this to show the relation between an exaggerated praise of a popular idol and a denial of the conclusions of modern science It is the popular view which Prof Adler champions in both instances In his criticism of Metchnikoff s able book The Nature of Man Prof Adler writes And to account for the reason in man this divine spark that has been set ablaze in him it is not sufficient to point to an ape as our ancestor If we are descended from an anthropoid ape on the physical side we are not descended from him in any strict sense of the word on our rational side for as life is born of life so reason is born of reason and if the anthropoid ape does not possess reason as we possess it it cannot be said that on our rational side we are his progeny If the above had been written fifty years ago when the doctrine of evolution was a heresy or by an orthodox clergyman of today we would have taken no note of it But coming as it does from the worthy founder of the Ethical Movement in America it deserves attention If says doctor Adler we are descended from an anthropoid ape on the physical side we are not descended from him in any strict sense of the word on our rational side He is not sure evidently that even physically man is the successor of the anthropoid ape but he is sure that we are not descended from him on our rational side Is doctor Adler then a dualist Does he believe that there are two eternal sources from one of which we get our bodies and from the other our rational side And why cannot doctor Adler be a monist He answers for as life is born of life so reason is born of reason and if the anthropoid ape does not possess reason as we possess it it cannot be said that on our rational side we are his progeny Not so good doctor There is no life without reason Do we mean to say that the jelly fish the creeping worm or the bud on the tree has reason Yes not as much reason as a horse or a dog and certainly not as much as a Metchnikoff or an Adler but these lower forms of life could not have survived but for the element of rationality in them We may call this instinct sensation promptings of nature but what s in a name The difference between a pump and a watch is only a difference of mechanism The stone and the soul represent different stages of progression not different substances If a charcoal can be transformed into a diamond why may not nature with the resources of infinity at her command refine a stone into a soul Let us not marvel at this it is not less thinkable than the proposition of two independent sources of life the one physical the other rational If life is born of life where did the first life come from Let us have an answer to that question And if as the professor says reason is born of reason how did the first reason come Is it not very much simpler to think in monistic terms than to separate life from reason and mind from matter as Prof Adler does in the words quoted above Why cannot mind be a state of matter What objection is there to thinking that matter refined elevated ripened cultured becomes both sentient and rational If matter can feel can see can hear can it not also think Does not the horse see hear and think There is no lowering of the dignity of man to say that he tastes with his palate sees with his eyes hears with his ears and thinks with the gray matter in his brain Remove his optic nerve and he becomes blind destroy the ganglia in his brain and he becomes mindless Gold is as much matter as the dust but it is very much more precious so is mind infinitely more precious than the matter which can only feel see taste or hear If the anthropoid ape does not possess reason as we possess it it cannot be said that on our rational side we are his progeny says doctor Adler But suppose we were to say that if our remote African or Australian savage ancestors did not possess reason as we possess it it cannot be said that on our rational side we are their progeny The child in the cradle does not possess reason as we do any more than does the anthropoid ape but the beginnings of reason are in both Let the worm climb and he will overtake man This is a most hopeful a most beautiful gospel Its spirit is not one of isolation and exclusiveness from the rest of nature but one of fellowship and sympathy We are all plants trees birds bugs animals all members of one family children at various ages and stages of growth of the same great mother Nature We quote again When I ask him Metchnikoff whence do I come he points to the simian stage which we have left behind but I would look beyond that stage to some ultimate fount of being to which all that is highest in me and in the world around me can be traced a source of things equal to the best that I can conceive But if there is some ultimate fount of being to which our highest nature can be traced whence did our lower nature come Is Prof Adler trying to say God We do not object to the word we only ask that he give the word a more intelligible meaning than has yet been given If God is the ultimate fount of being to which all that is highest in us can be traced who or what is the ultimate fount to which all that is lowest in us can be traced Let us have the names of the two ultimate founts of being and also to what still more ultimate founts these founts may be traced In our opinion doctor Adler has failed to do justice to Prof Metchnikoff It is no answer to the Darwinian Theory which the Russian scientist accepts in earnest and in all its fullness not fractionally as Adler seems to do to say that it does not explain everything No one claims that it does Not all the mystery of life has been cleared Evolution has offered us only a new key so to speak with which to attempt the doors which have not yielded to metaphysics And if the key has not opened all the doors it has opened many Prof Adler seems to think that the doctrine of evolution explains only the physical descent of man for the genesis of the spiritual man he looks for some supernatural fount in the skies Well that is not science that is theology and Adler s estimate of Jesus is just as theological as his criticism of evolution APPENDIX The argument in this volume will be better understood if we give to our readers the comments and criticisms which our little pamphlet Jesus a Myth

1289_288043_000008_000000	train-clean-360	Religions as well as their variations appear as new branches do upon an old tree 
none	none	The new branch is quite as much the product of the soil and climate as the parent tree Like Brahmanism Judaism Shinto and the Babylonian and Egyptian Cults which had no single founders Christianity is a deposit to which Hellenic Judaic and Latin tendencies have each contributed its quota 
1289_288043_000009_000000	train-clean-360	But the popular imagination craves a Maker for the Universe a founder for Rome a first man for the human race and a great chief as the starter of the tribe 
none	none	In the same way it fancies a divine or semi divine being as the author of its credo 
1289_288043_000010_000000	train-clean-360	Because Mohammed is historical it does not follow that Moses is also historical 
none	none	That argument would prove too much reverend doctor CRAPSEY We would be in the same position that the astronomers were when they discovered the great planet Uranus from their knowledge of the movements of these bodies they were convinced that these perturbations could be occasioned by nothing less than a great planet lying outside of the then view of mankind P six Ibid ANSWER But the astronomers did not rest until they converted the probability of a near by planet into demonstration Jesus is still a probability reverend doctor CRAPSEY We have of Jesus a very distinctly outlined history There is nothing vague about him P twelve Ibid 
1289_288043_000014_000000	train-clean-360	ANSWER But in the same sentence the doctor takes all this back by adding There are a great many things in his history that are not historical If so then we do not possess a very distinctly outlined history but at best a mixture of fact and fiction 
none	none	reverend doctor CRAPSEY We can follow Jesus history from the time that he entered upon his public career until the time that career closed just as easily as we can follow Caesar et cetera P twelve Ibid 
1289_288043_000016_000000	train-clean-360	ANSWER How long was the time from the opening of Jesus public career until the time that it closed One year according to the three gospels 
1289_288043_000016_000001	train-clean-360	It sounds quite a period to speak of following his public career from beginning to end especially when compared with Caesar s until it is remembered that the entire public career of Jesus covers the space of only one year 
none	none	This is a most decisive argument against the historicity of Jesus 
1289_288043_000016_000003	train-clean-360	With the exception of one year his whole life is hid in impenetrable darkness 
1289_288043_000016_000004	train-clean-360	We know nothing of his childhood nothing of his old age if he lived to be old and of his youth we know just enough to fill up a year 
1289_288043_000016_000005	train-clean-360	Under the circumstances there is no comparison between the public career of a Caesar or a Socrates covering from fifty to seventy years of time and that of a Jesus of whose life only one brief year is thrown upon the canvas 
none	none	An historical Jesus who lived only a year reverend doctor CRAPSEY The Christ I admit to be purely mythological the word Christ you know means the anointed one they the Hebrews expected the coming of that Christ But that is purely a mythical title The Debate P thirty five ANSWER Did the Hebrews then expect the coming of a title Were they looking forward to seeing the ancient throne of David restored by a title By Messiah or Christ the Jews did not mean a name but a man a real flesh and bone savior anointed or appointed by heaven 
1289_288043_000020_000000	train-clean-360	But if the Christ which the Hebrews expected was purely mythical what makes the same Christ in the supposed Tacitus passage historical 
none	none	The New Testament Jesus is Jesus Christ and the apostle John speaks of those who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh mark his words not Christ but Jesus Christ The apostle does not separate the two names There were those then in the early church who denied the historicity not of a title for what meaning would there be in denying that a title is come in the flesh but of a person known as Jesus Christ And what could the doctor mean when he speaks of a title being mythological There are no mythological titles Titles are words and we do not speak of the historicity or the non historicity of words We cannot say of words as we do of men that some are historical and others are mythical 
1289_288043_000021_000003	train-clean-360	William Tell is a myth not the name but the man the name stands for 
none	none	William is the name of many real people and so is Tell There were many anointed kings who are historical and the question is Is Jesus Christ or Jesus the Anointed also historical 
1289_288043_000021_000005	train-clean-360	To answer that Jesus is historical but The Anointed is not is to evade the question 
1289_288043_000022_000000	train-clean-360	When Mosheim declares that The prevalent opinion among early Christians was that Christ existed in appearance only he could not have meant by Christ only a title 
none	none	There is no meaning in saying that a man s title existed in appearance only We do not speak of a title being born or crucified and when some early Christians denied that Jesus Christ was ever born or ever crucified they had in mind not a title but a person In conclusion If the Christ by whom the Hebrews meant not a mere name but a man was purely mythological as the reverend debater plainly admits see pages thirty five thirty six of The Debate that is if when the Hebrews said Christ is coming they were under the influence of an illusion why may not the Christians when they say that Christ has come be also under the influence of an illusion 
1289_288043_000024_000001	train-clean-360	The Hebrew illusion said Christ was coming the Christian illusion says Christ has come 
none	none	The Hebrews had no evidence that Christ was coming although that expectation was a great factor in their religion and the Christians have no more evidence for saying Christ has come although that belief is a great factor in their religion II 
1289_288043_000026_000000	train-clean-360	The minister of the South Congregational Church who heard the debate has publicly called your lecturer an unscrupulous sophist who practices imposition upon a popular audience and who put forth sentence after sentence which every scholar present knew to be a perversion of the facts so outrageous as to be laughable 
none	none	As one of the leading morning papers said the above is not a reply to arguments made by mister Mangasarian 
1289_288043_000028_000000	train-clean-360	Invited by several people to prove these charges the Reverend replies In the absence of any full report of what he M 
none	none	M Mangasarian said or of any notes taken at the time I am unable to furnish you with quotations When the Reverend gentleman was addressing the public his memory was strong enough to enable him to say sentence after sentence was put forth by mister Mangasarian which every scholar present knew to be a perversion of the facts But when called upon to mention a few of them his memory forsakes him Our critic is not careful to make his statements agree with the fact 
1289_288043_000029_000000	train-clean-360	One instance however he is able to remember which when it fell upon my ears he writes it struck me with such amazement that it completely drove from my mind a series of most astonishing statements of various sorts which had just preceded it 
1289_288043_000030_000000	train-clean-360	We refrain from commenting on the excuse given to explain so significant a failure of memory 
none	none	The instance referred to was about the denial of some in apostolic times that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh But as mister Mangasarian had hardly spoken more than twenty minutes when he touched upon this point it is not likely that it could have been preceded by a series of most astonishing statements of various sorts 
1289_288043_000031_000000	train-clean-360	And what was the statement which while it crippled his memory it did not moderate his zeal 
none	none	We will let him present it himself I refer to the use he made of one or two passages in the New Testament mentioning some who deny that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh So that he went on to say there were those even among the early Christians themselves who denied that Jesus had come in the flesh Of course they were cast out as heretics Here came an impressive pause and then without further explanation or qualification he proceeded to something else 
1289_288043_000032_000000	train-clean-360	This is his most serious complaint 
1289_288043_000032_000001	train-clean-360	Does it justify hasty language 
none	none	saint John writes of those who confessed not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh The natural meaning of the words is that even in apostolic times some denied the flesh and bone Jesus and regarded him as an idea or an apparition something like the Holy Ghost 
1289_288043_000033_000001	train-clean-360	All church historians admit the existence of sects that denied the New Testament Jesus the Gnostics the Essenes the Ebionites the Marcionites the Cerinthians et cetera 
1289_288043_000034_000000	train-clean-360	As the debate is now in print further comment on this would not be necessary 
1289_288043_000035_000000	train-clean-360	Incidents like the above however should change every lukewarm rationalist into a devoted soldier of truth and honor 
1289_288043_000036_000000	train-clean-360	To us more important than anything presented on this subject is this evidence of the existence of a very early dispute among the first disciples of Jesus on the question of whether he was real or merely an apparition 
none	none	The Apostle John in his epistle clearly states that even among the faithful there were those who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh This is very important 
1289_288043_000036_000002	train-clean-360	As early as John s time if he is the writer of the epistle Jesus historicity was questioned 
1289_288043_000037_000000	train-clean-360	The gospel of John also hints at the existence in the primitive church of Christians who did not accept the reality of Jesus 
none	none	When doubting Thomas is told of the resurrection he answers that he must feel the prints of the nails with his fingers before he will believe and Jesus not only grants the wishes of this skeptical apostle but he also eats in the presence of them all which story is told evidently to silence the critics who maintained that Jesus was only a spirit the Wisdom of God an emanation a light and not real flesh and bones III The same clergyman to whom a copy of the Mangasarian Crapsey Debate was sent has written a five page criticism of it 
1289_288043_000040_000000	train-clean-360	The strength of a given criticism is determined by asking Does it in any way impair the soundness of the argument against which it is directed 
1289_288043_000040_000001	train-clean-360	Critics have discovered mistakes in Darwin and Haeckel but are these mistakes of such a nature as to prove fatal to the theory of evolution 
none	none	To be effective criticism must be aimed at the heart of an argument A man s life is not in his hat which could be knocked off or in his clothes which could be torn in places by his assailant without in the least weakening his opponent s position 
1289_288043_000041_000002	train-clean-360	It is the blow that disables which counts 
1289_288043_000042_000000	train-clean-360	To charge that we have said Gospel where we should have said Epistle or Trullum instead of Trullo that it was not Barnabas but Nicholas who denied the Gospel Jesus and that there were variations of this denial does not at all disprove the fact that according to the Christian scriptures themselves among the apostolic followers there were those to whom Jesus Christ was only a phantom 
none	none	Milman the Christian historian states that the belief about Jesus Christ adopted by almost all the Gnostic sects was that Jesus Christ was but an apparent human being an impassive phantom History of Christianity Vol two P sixty one 
1289_288043_000043_000001	train-clean-360	Was ever such a view entertained of Caesar Socrates or of any other historical character 
none	none	On page twenty eight of The Debate we say The Apostle John complains of those who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh To this the clergyman replies
1289_288043_000045_000000	train-clean-360	 The Apostle John never made any such complaint 
1289_288043_000045_000001	train-clean-360	Critical scholarship is pretty well agreed that he did not write the epistles ascribed to him 
none	none	We have a lecture on How the Bible was Invented and this clergyman s admission that at least parts of the bible are invented is very gratifying In a former communication this same clergyman tried to prove that the Apostle John s complaint does not at all imply a denial of the historical Jesus 
1289_288043_000047_000001	train-clean-360	In his recent letter he denies that the apostle ever made such a complaint 
1289_288043_000048_000000	train-clean-360	John did not write the epistles then which the Christian church for two thousand years and at a cost of millions of dollars and at the greater sacrifice of truth and progress has been proclaiming to the world as the work of the inspired John 
none	none	The strenuous efforts to get around this terrible text in the Holy Bible show what a decisive argument it is Every exertion to meet it only tightens the text like a rope around the neck of the belief in the historical Jesus 
1289_288043_000049_000002	train-clean-360	Our desire in engaging in this argument is to turn the thought and love of the world from a mythical being to humanity which is both real and present 
none	none	On page twenty two of The Debate we say saint 
1289_288043_000050_000001	train-clean-360	Paul tells us that he lived in Jerusalem at a time when Jesus must have been holding the attention of the city yet he never met him To this the clergyman replies 
1289_288043_000051_000000	train-clean-360	 Paul tells us nothing of the kind 
none	none	In a speech which is put into the mouth of Paul put into the mouth of Paul Is this another instance of forgery 
1289_288043_000051_000002	train-clean-360	John did not write the epistles and Paul s speech in the Book of Acts was put into his mouth 
none	none	Will the clergyman tell us which parts of the bible are not invented Let us make a remark The church people blame us for not believing in the trustworthiness of the bible but when we reply that if the bible is trustworthy then Paul must have been in Jerusalem with Jesus and John admits that some denied the historical Jesus we are blamed for not knowing better than to prove anything by quoting Paul and John as if everything they said was trustworthy 
1289_288043_000053_000000	train-clean-360	In other words only those passages in the bible are authentic which the clergy quote those which the rationalists quote are spurious 
none	none	In the meantime the authentic as well as the spurious passages together compose the churches Word of God IV In a letter of protest to mister Mangasarian Rabbi Hirsch of this city asks Was it right for you to assume that I was correctly reported by the News After stating what he had said in his interview with the reporter the Rabbi continues But said I to the reporter all these possible allusions do not prove that Jesus existed You see in reality I agreed with you 
1289_288043_000055_000001	train-clean-360	I personally believe Jesus lived 
1289_288043_000055_000002	train-clean-360	But I have no proof for this beyond my feeling that the movement with which the name is associated could even for Paul not have taken its nomenclature without a personal substratum 
none	none	But and this I told the reporter also this does not prove that the Jesus of the Gospels is historical Rabbi Hirsch writes in this same letter that he did not say Jesus was mentioned in the Rabbinical Books 
1289_288043_000055_000004	train-clean-360	The News reports the Rabbi as saying But we know through the Rabbinical Books that Jesus lived 
none	none	A committee from our Society waited on the editor of the Daily News for an explanation 
1289_288043_000056_000001	train-clean-360	The editor promised to locate the responsibility for the contradiction 
none	none	As the report in the News was allowed to stand for four days without correction and as Rabbi Hirsch did not even privately by letter or by phone disclaim responsibility for the article to mister Mangasarian the latter claims he was justified in assuming that the published report was reliable 
1289_288043_000057_000001	train-clean-360	But it is with pleasure that the Independent Religious Society gives Rabbi Hirsch this opportunity to explain his position 
none	none	We hope he will also let us know whether he said to the reporter I do not believe in mister Mangasarian s argument that Christianity has inspired massacres wars and inquisitions 
1289_288043_000057_000003	train-clean-360	It is a stock argument and not to the point 
1289_288043_000057_000004	train-clean-360	This is extraordinary and as the Rabbi does not question the statement we infer that it is a correct report of what he said 
none	none	Though we have room for only one quotation from the Jewish Christian Scriptures it will be enough to show the relation of religion to persecution And thou shalt consume all the people which the Lord thy God shall deliver thee thine eye shall have no pity upon them Why were women put to death as witches Why were Quakers hanged For what economic and political reasons which the Rabbi thinks are responsible for persecution was the blind Derby girl who doubted the Real Presence burned alive at the age of twenty two V The reverend 
1289_288044_000002_000001	train-clean-360	W E Barton of Oak Park is one of the ablest Congregational ministers in the West 
1289_288044_000002_000002	train-clean-360	He has recently expressed himself on the Mangasarian Crapsey Debate 
none	none	Let us hear what he has to say on the historicity of Jesus 
1289_288044_000003_000000	train-clean-360	The Reverend gentleman begins by an uncompromising denial of our statements and ends by virtually admitting all that we contend for This morning we will write of his denials next Sunday of his admissions 
1289_288044_000004_000000	train-clean-360	 mister Mangasarian says doctor Barton has not given evidence of his skill as a logician or of his accuracy in the use of history Then he proceeds to apologize in a way for the character of his reply to our argument by saying that mister 
1289_288044_000004_000001	train-clean-360	Mangasarian s arguments fortunately do not require to be taken very seriously for they are not in themselves serious 
1289_288044_000005_000000	train-clean-360	Notwithstanding this protest doctor Barton proceeds to do his best to reply to our position 
none	none	In The Debate we call attention to the fact that according to the New Testament Paul was in Jerusalem when Jesus was teaching and performing his miracles there 
1289_288044_000006_000001	train-clean-360	Yet Paul never seems to have met Jesus or to have heard of his teachings or miracles 
none	none	To this doctor Barton replies We cannot know and are not bound to explain where Paul was on the few occasions when Jesus publicly visited Jerusalem 
1289_288044_000007_000000	train-clean-360	The above reply we are compelled to say much to our regret is not even honest 
1289_288044_000007_000001	train-clean-360	Without actually telling any untruths it suggests indirectly two falsehoods First that Jesus was not much in Jerusalem that he was there only on a few occasions and that therefore it is not strange that Paul did not see him or hear of his preaching or miracles and second that Paul was absent from the city when Jesus was there 
1289_288044_000007_000002	train-clean-360	The question is not how often Jesus visited Jerusalem but how conspicuous was the part he played there 
none	none	He may have visited Jerusalem only once in all his life yet if he preached there daily in the synagogues if he performed great miracles there if he marched through the streets followed by the palm waving multitude shouting Hosanna et cetera if he attacked the high priest and the pharisees there to which latter class Paul belonged and if he was arrested tried and publicly executed there and if his teaching stirred the city from center to circumference it would not be honest to intimate that the few times Jesus visited Jerusalem Paul was engaged elsewhere 
1289_288044_000008_000000	train-clean-360	The Reverend debater attempts to belittle the Jerusalem career of Jesus by suggesting that he was not there much when according to the Gospels it was in that city that his ministry began and culminated 
none	none	Again to our argument that Paul never refers to any of the teachings of Jesus the Reverend replies Nor is it of consequence that Paul seldom quotes the words of Jesus Seldom would imply that Paul quotes Jesus sometimes 
1289_288044_000009_000001	train-clean-360	We say Paul gives not a single quotation to prove that he knew of a teaching Jesus 
none	none	He had heard of a crucified risen Christ one who had also instituted a bread and wine supper but of Jesus as a teacher and of his teaching Paul is absolutely ignorant But by saying Paul seldom quotes Jesus doctor Barton tries to produce the impression that Paul quotes Jesus though not very often which is not true 
1289_288044_000010_000001	train-clean-360	There is not a single miracle parable or moral teaching attributed to Jesus in the Gospels of which Paul seems to possess any knowledge whatever 
1289_288044_000011_000000	train-clean-360	Nor is it true that it is of no consequence that Paul seldom quotes the words of Jesus For it proves that the Gospel Jesus was unknown to Paul and that he was created at a later date 
1289_288044_000012_000000	train-clean-360	Once more we say that the only Jesus Paul knew was the one he met in a trance on his way to Damascus 
1289_288044_000012_000001	train-clean-360	To this the pastor of the First Congregational Church of Oak Park replies in the same we do not care to explain style 
1289_288044_000012_000002	train-clean-360	He says Nor is it of consequence that Paul values comparatively lightly having known him in the flesh 
none	none	The words Paul valued comparatively lightly are as misleading as the words Paul seldom quotes Jesus Paul never quotes Jesus teachings and he never met Jesus in the flesh 
1289_288044_000013_000001	train-clean-360	The clergyman s words however convey the impression that Paul knew Jesus in the flesh but he valued that knowledge comparatively lightly that is to say he did not think much of it 
1289_288044_000013_000002	train-clean-360	And doctor Barton is one of the foremost divines of the country 
none	none	And now about his admissions VI I The Gospels by whomever written says the clergyman are reliable By whomever written 
1289_288044_000016_000001	train-clean-360	After two thousand years it is still uncertain to whom we are indebted for the story of Jesus 
1289_288044_000016_000002	train-clean-360	What in doctor Barton s opinion could have influenced the framers of the life of Jesus to suppress their identity 
none	none	And why does not the church instead of printing the words The Gospel according to Matthew or John which is not true print The Gospel by whomever written II
1289_288044_000017_000001	train-clean-360	 At the very least four of Paul s epistles are genuine says the same clergyman 
1289_288044_000017_000002	train-clean-360	Only four 
1289_288044_000017_000003	train-clean-360	Paul has thirteen epistles in the bible and of only four of them is doctor Barton certain 
1289_288044_000017_000004	train-clean-360	What are the remaining nine doing in the Holy Bible 
1289_288044_000017_000005	train-clean-360	And which four does the clergyman accept as doubtlessly genuine Only yesterday all thirteen of Paul s letters were infallible and they are so still wherever no questions are asked about them 
1289_288044_000017_000006	train-clean-360	It is only where there is intelligence and inquiry that four of them at least are reliable 
1289_288044_000017_000007	train-clean-360	As honesty and culture increase the number of inspired epistles decreases 
none	none	What the Americans are too enlightened to accept the church sends to the heathen III It is true that early a sect grew up which held that Jesus could not have had a body of carnal flesh but they did not question that he had really lived According to doctor Barton these early Christians did not deny that Jesus had really lived they only denied that Jesus could have had a body of carnal flesh 
1289_288044_000018_000002	train-clean-360	We wonder how many kinds of flesh there are according to doctor Barton 
none	none	Moreover does not the bible teach that Jesus was tempted in all things and was a man of like passions as ourselves 
1289_288044_000018_000004	train-clean-360	The good man controls his appetites and passions but his flesh is not any different from anybody else s 
none	none	If Jesus did not have a body like ours then he did not exist as a human being 
1289_288044_000018_000006	train-clean-360	Our point is that if the New Testament is reliable in the time of the apostles themselves the Gnostics an influential body of Christians denied that Jesus was any more than an imaginary existence 
none	none	But pleads the clergyman these sects believed that Jesus was real though not carnal flesh What kind of flesh was he then If by carnal the Gnostics meant sensual then the apostles in denouncing them for rejecting a carnal Jesus must have held that Jesus was carnal or sensual 
1289_288044_000018_000009	train-clean-360	How does the Reverend Barton like the conclusion to which his own reasoning leads him 
none	none	IV It is true that there were literary fictions in the age following the apostles This admission is in answer to the charge that even in the first centuries the Christians were compelled to resort to forgery to prove the historicity of Jesus 
1289_288044_000019_000003	train-clean-360	The doctor admits the charge except that he calls it by another name 
1289_288044_000019_000004	train-clean-360	The difference between fiction and forgery is this the former is what it claims to be the latter is a lie parading as a truth 
1289_288044_000019_000005	train-clean-360	Fiction is honest because it does not try to deceive 
1289_288044_000019_000006	train-clean-360	Forgery is dishonest because its object is to deceive 
1289_288044_000019_000007	train-clean-360	If the Gospel was a novel no one would object to its mythology but pretending to be historical it must square its claims with the facts or be branded as a forgery 
none	none	V We may not have the precise words Jesus uttered the portrait may be colored tradition may have had its influence but Jesus was real A most remarkable admission from a clerical 
1289_288044_000020_000002	train-clean-360	It concedes all that higher criticism contends for 
1289_288044_000020_000003	train-clean-360	We are not sure either of Jesus words or of his character intimates the Reverend preacher 
none	none	Precisely 
1289_288044_000021_000000	train-clean-360	In commenting on our remark that in the eighth century Pope Hadrian called upon the Christian world to think of Jesus as a man doctor Barton replies with considerable temper To date people s right to think of Jesus as a man from that decree is not to be characterized by any polite term Our neighbor in the first place misquotes us in his haste 
none	none	We never presumed to deny anyone the right to think of Jesus what he pleased before or after the eighth century The Debate p twenty eight We were calling attention to Pope Hadrian s order to replace the lamb on the cross by the figure of a man But by what polite language is the conduct of the Christian church which to this day prints in its bibles Translated from the Original Greek when no original manuscripts are in existence to be characterized doctor Barton s efforts to save his creed remind us of the Japanese proverb It is no use mending the lid if the pot be broken VII The most remarkable clerical effort thus far which The Mangasarian Crapsey Debate has called forth is that of the reverend E V Shayler rector of Grace Episcopal Church of Oak Park
1289_288044_000025_000000	train-clean-360	 In answer to your query which I received I beg to give the following statement 
1289_288044_000025_000001	train-clean-360	Facts not theories 
1289_288044_000025_000002	train-clean-360	The date of your own letter nineteen oh eight tells what 
1289_288044_000025_000003	train-clean-360	nineteen oh eight years after what 
1289_288044_000025_000004	train-clean-360	The looking forward of the world to Him 
1289_288044_000026_000000	train-clean-360	reverend Shayler has an original way of proving the historicity of Jesus Every time we date our letters suggests the clergyman we prove that Jesus lived 
1289_288044_000026_000001	train-clean-360	The ancient Greeks reckoned time by the Olympiads which fact according to this interesting clergyman ought to prove that the Olympic games were instituted by the God Heracles or Hercules son of Zeus the Roman Chronology began with the building of Rome by Romulus which by the same reasoning would prove that Romulus and Remus born of Mars and nursed by a she wolf are historical 
none	none	reverend Shayler has forgotten that the Christian era was not introduced into Europe until the sixth century and Dionysius the monkish author of the era did not compute time from the birth of Jesus but from the day on which the Virgin Mary met an angel from heaven 
1289_288044_000027_000001	train-clean-360	This date prevailed in many countries until seventeen forty five 
none	none	Would the date on a letter prove that an angel appeared to Mary and hailed her as the future Mother of God 
1289_288044_000027_000003	train-clean-360	According to this clergyman scientists instead of studying the crust of the earth and making geological investigations to ascertain the probable age of the earth ought to look at the date in the margin of the bible which tells exactly the world s age 
1289_288044_000028_000000	train-clean-360	reverend Shayler continues The places where he was born labored and died are still extant and have no value apart from such testimony 
1289_288044_000029_000000	train-clean-360	While this is amusing we are going to deny ourselves the pleasure of laughing at it we will do our best to give it a serious answer 
1289_288044_000029_000001	train-clean-360	If the existence of such a country as Palestine proves that Jesus is real the existence of Switzerland must prove that William Tell is historical and the existence of an Athens must prove that Athene and Apollo really lived and from the fact that there is an England reverend Shayler would prove that Robin Hood and his band really lived in eleven sixty 
none	none	The Reverend knows of another fact which he thinks proves Jesus without a doubt
1289_288044_000031_000000	train-clean-360	 A line of apostles and bishops coming right down from him by his appointment to Anderson of Chicago shows that Jesus is historical It does but only to Episcopalians 
1289_288044_000031_000001	train-clean-360	The Catholics and the other sects do not believe that Anderson is a descendant of Jesus 
1289_288044_000031_000002	train-clean-360	Did the priests of Baal or Moloch prove that these beings existed 
none	none	The Reverend has another argument The Christian Church when why and how did it begin Which Christian church brother 
1289_288044_000033_000001	train-clean-360	Your own church began with Henry the Eighth in fifteen thirty four with persecution and murder when the king his hands wet with the blood of his own wives and ministers made himself the supreme head of the church in England 
none	none	The Methodist church began with John Wesley not much over a hundred years ago the Presbyterian church began with John Calvin who burned his guest on a slow fire in Geneva about three hundred years ago and the Lutheran church began with Martin Luther in the sixteenth century the man who said over his own signature It was I Martin Luther who slew all the peasants in the Peasants War for I commanded them to be slaughtered But I throw the responsibility on our Lord God who instructed me to give this order and the Roman Catholic church the parent of the smaller churches all chips from the same block began its real career with the first Christian Emperor Constantine who hanged his father in law strangled his brother in law murdered his nephew beheaded his eldest son and killed his wife 
1289_288044_000033_000003	train-clean-360	Gibbon writes of Constantine that the same year of his reign in which he convened the council of Nice was polluted by the execution or rather murder of his eldest son 
1289_288044_000034_000000	train-clean-360	But our clerical neighbor from Oak Park has one more argument Why is Sunday observed instead of Saturday Well why 
none	none	Sun day is the day of the Sun whose glorious existence in the lovely heavens over our heads has never been doubted it was the day which the Pagans dedicated to the Sun Sunday existed before the Jesus story was known the anniversary of whose supposed resurrection falls in March one year and in April another 
1289_288044_000034_000003	train-clean-360	If Jesus rose at all he rose on a certain day and the apostles must have known the date 
1289_288044_000034_000004	train-clean-360	Why then is there a different date every year 
1289_288044_000035_000000	train-clean-360	reverend Shayler concludes Haven t time to go deeper now and he intimates that to deny his facts is either to be a fool or a liar We will not comment on this 
none	none	We are interested in arguments not in epithets VIII 
1289_288044_000037_000000	train-clean-360	One of our Sunday programs the other day found its way into a church 
1289_288044_000037_000001	train-clean-360	It went farther it made its appearance in the pulpit 
none	none	In my hand I hold the notice of a publication bearing the title Is Jesus a Myth said doctor Boyle
1289_288044_000038_000001	train-clean-360	 This too just as though Paul never bore testimony 
1289_288044_000039_000000	train-clean-360	This gave the clergyman a splendid opportunity to present in clear and convincing form the evidence for the reality of Jesus 
1289_288044_000039_000001	train-clean-360	But one thing prevented him the lack of evidence 
1289_288044_000040_000000	train-clean-360	Therefore after announcing the subject he dismissed it by remarking that Paul s testimony was enough 
none	none	The reverend 
1289_288044_000041_000001	train-clean-360	Morton Culver Hartzell in a letter offers the same argument 
1289_288044_000041_000002	train-clean-360	 Let mister Mangasarian first disprove Paul he writes 
1289_288044_000041_000003	train-clean-360	The argument in a nutshell is this Jesus is historical because he is guaranteed by Paul 
none	none	But who guarantees Paul Aside from the fact that the Jesus of Paul is essentially a different Jesus from the gospel Jesus there still remains the question Who is Paul 
1289_288044_000043_000001	train-clean-360	Let us see how much the church scholars themselves know about Paul 
none	none	The place and manner and occasion of his death are not less uncertain than the facts of his later life The chronology of the rest of his life is as uncertain We have no means of knowing when he was born or how long he lived or at what dates the several events of his life took place Referring to the epistles of Paul the same authority says The chief of these preliminary questions is the genuineness of the epistles bearing Paul s name which if they be his yes IF The Christian scholar whose article on Paul is printed in the Britannica and from which we are now quoting gives further expression to this uncertainty by adding that certain of Paul s epistles have given rise to disputes which cannot easily be settled in the absence of collateral evidence The pastoral epistles have given rise to still graver questions and are probably even less defensible Let the reader remember that the above is not from a rationalist but from the reverend 
1289_288044_000047_000001	train-clean-360	Edwin Hatch D D Vice Principal saint Mary Hall Oxford England 
none	none	Were we disposed to quote rationalist authorities the argument against Paul would be far more decisive 
1289_288044_000048_000001	train-clean-360	But we are satisfied to rest the case on orthodox admissions alone 
none	none	The strongest argument then of clergymen who have attempted an answer to our position is something like this 
1289_288044_000050_000000	train-clean-360	Jesus is historical because a man by the name of Paul says so though we do not know much about Paul 
none	none	It is just such evidence as the above that led Prof 
1289_288044_000051_000001	train-clean-360	Goldwin Smith to exclaim Jesus has flown 
1289_288044_000051_000002	train-clean-360	I believe the legend of Jesus was made by many minds working under a great religious impulse one man adding a parable another an exhortation another a miracle story and George Eliot to write The materials for a real life of Christ do not exist 
1289_288044_000052_000000	train-clean-360	In the effort to untie the Jesus knot by Paul the church has increased the number of knots to two 
1289_288044_000052_000001	train-clean-360	In other words the church has proceeded on the theory that two uncertainties make a certainty 
none	none	We promised to square also with the facts of history our statement that the chief concern of the church Jewish Christian or Mohammedan is not righteousness but orthodoxy IX 
1289_288044_000055_000000	train-clean-360	Speaking in this city reverend 
1289_288044_000055_000001	train-clean-360	W H Wray Boyle of Lake Forest declared that unbelief was responsible for the worst crimes in history 
1289_288044_000055_000002	train-clean-360	He mentioned the placing 
none	none	of a nude woman on a pedestal in the city of Paris the assassination of William McKinley The same unbelief sent a murderer down the isle of a church in Denver to pluck the symbol of the sacrament from the hands of a priest and slay him at the altar 
1289_288044_000059_000000	train-clean-360	The story of a nude woman et cetera is pure fiction and that the two murders were caused by unbelief is mere assumption 
1289_288044_000059_000001	train-clean-360	To help his creed the preacher resorts to fable 
none	none	We shall prove our position by quoting facts I HYPATIA Footnote See Author s The Martyrdom of Hypatia was dragged into a Christian church by monks in Alexandria and before the altar she was stripped of her clothing and cut in pieces with oyster shells and murdered 
1289_288044_000060_000001	train-clean-360	Her innocent blood stained the hands of the clergy who also handle the Holy Sacraments 
1289_288044_000060_000002	train-clean-360	She was murdered not by a crazed individual but by the orders of the bishop of Alexandria 
1289_288044_000060_000003	train-clean-360	How does the true story of Hypatia compare with the fable of a nude woman placed on a pedestal in the city of Paris The Reverend must answer or never tell an untruth again 
1289_288044_000061_000000	train-clean-360	Hypatia was murdered in church and by the clergy because she was not orthodox 
none	none	II POLTROT the Protestant in the sixteenth century assassinated Francois the Catholic duke of Guise in France and the leaders of the church instead of disclaiming responsibility for the act publicly praised the assassin and Theodore Beza the colleague of Calvin promised him a crown in heaven De l etat et cetera P eighty two Quoted by Jules Simon 
1289_288044_000063_000000	train-clean-360	III JAMES CLEMENT a Catholic assassinated Henry III 
1289_288044_000063_000001	train-clean-360	For this act the clergy placed his portrait on the altar in the churches between two great lighted candle sticks 
none	none	Because he had killed a heretic prince the Catholics presented the assassin s mother with a purse Esprit de la Ligue I III P fourteen If it was unbelief that inspired the murder of McKinley what inspired the assassins of Hypatia and Henry III We read in the Bible that general 
1289_288044_000065_000001	train-clean-360	Sisera a heathen having lost a battle begged for shelter at the tent of Jael a friendly woman but of the Bible faith 
none	none	Jael assured the unfortunate stranger that he was safe in her tent 
1289_288044_000065_000003	train-clean-360	The tired warrior fell asleep from great weariness Then Jael picked a tent peg and with a hammer in her hand walked softly unto him and smote the nail into his temples and fastened it into the ground So he died 
none	none	The BIBLE calls this assassin blessed above women Judge IV eighteen et cetera She had killed a heretic In each of the instances given above the assassin is honored because he committed murder in the interest of the faith We ask this clergyman and his colleagues who are only too anxious to charge every act of violence to unbelief in their creeds What about the crimes of believers END
