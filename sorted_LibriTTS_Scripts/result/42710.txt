this book I became appreciably indebted to doctor Warren S Holder my dentist mister William Vroom my tailor mister M Tesshow my stationer and tobacconist and Messrs Acker Merrall Condit my grocers Although these gentlemen neither corrected the proofs of my book nor saw it through the press nor allowed me access to rare documents and family letters nor treated me to intimate accounts of their fathers and great uncles as they knew them though they did none of these customary things nevertheless I became decidedly their debtor and still am Indeed without their stimulus this book might never

The Survival of the Fattest WHAT NOTS UNSOLICITED PERSONAL ADORNMENTS Illustration Decorative letter H Have you ever on returning home from a round of calls discovered upon your coat a large obtrusive spot Stricken with horror you wonder how long it has been there Did you have this adjunct when you appeared before your wealthy aunt That severe female has never quite approved of you and now this will finish you as far as she is concerned Did you exhibit yourself thus disgraced at the Brumleighs You recollect that the maid eyed you queerly when she opened the door and that missus B had frequent recourse to her lorgnettes Then too both the Greens and the Worthingtons seemed a little stiffer than usual How did you acquire it anyhow It looks and feels like ice cream of a very rich quality ice cream that has drippled merrily in leaps and bounds But you had no ice cream today Neither did you talk to anyone who was having ice cream Perhaps you have been struck by ice cream just as people are struck by lightning The weather does such peculiar things nowadays I have a gray suit that is a constant prey to spots Its frail color a sickly betwixt and between shade chosen in haste and repented of at leisure puts it utterly at their mercy And they flock to it Things sticky and glutinous pounce avidly upon it nor is its seat reserved from paints and varnishes Sauces afflict it Oils take advantage of its helplessness Grass bedizens it with garish green I try my best to protect it but what can I do What am I against so many While I am rescuing my left elbow from the machinations of a passing dish I unwittingly suffer my right cuff to be enticed by the gravy in my plate As I walk discreetly in the middle of the sidewalk an automobile out in the street salutes me with a volley of mud And the most notable spots happen mysteriously They appear out of the air as it were like the pictures that frost makes on window panes I submit the phenomenon of their strange origin to the scientific world as an instance of spontaneous generation This spotability of my gray suit is surpassed only by the achievements of my blue serge I shall not here discuss my English tweeds nor my Scotch cheviots nor the braided cutaway and the lounge suit that I had made for me in Bond Street for fear the reader might divine that I never possessed those garments This suit is not a victim to spots it deliberately invites them It is a connoisseur a discriminating collector Scorning such vulgarities as paint and pitch it seeks the exotic the outre amazing stickinesses bewildering viscosities undreamed of goos Although delighting in intricacy of design and delicate nuances of shading it prefers durability to all other qualities Some of its antiques particularly a brownish white one resembling an octopus over the front pocket have stood the test of time and clothes brushes On three occasions this remarkable collection has been almost entirely destroyed by benzine but each time the principal specimens have survived intact These cleanings divide the history of the suit into four epochs Spots of the fourth or present epoch are of small consequence spots of the third and second epochs are more interesting while spots which antedate the first great deluge are quite rare Among these last are the octopus and other gems of the collection Once when I had become exceedingly irked at having to go about clad in pseudo tapestry I handed the suit over to a desperado of a ladies and gents tailor a man who had the reputation of being capable of getting anything out of anything or anybody and besought him to raze the frescoes He attacked them after the manner customary to cleaners that is to say he drove out the spots with smells Only he used smells that were nothing short of brutal The rout was complete When he brought the suit to my room on Saturday night I could hardly believe my eyes Being forced however to believe my nose I hastily opened the window I could understand why the spots had departed I even felt sorry for them Not daring to put the suit away for fear of contaminating the rest of my apparel I hung it over the back of a chair by the window But the incoming breeze instead of carrying the aroma away wafted it directly toward me It was certainly strong It fairly assaulted the nostrils One good whiff of that vicious chemical was almost enough to make you dizzy It treated me as if I were a spot I picked up a book and tried to read but could not concentrate my attention The spot destroyer was continually interrupting My head was spinning so that I could hardly see I realized that the life of a spot was not a happy one Thinking that smoking might help I was about to light a cigarette when I remembered reading in the papers of people who struck matches in fume filled rooms and then were blown blocks and blocks without knowing what hit them So I gave that up and sat a while dejected Then another scary thought came into my mind What if I should be asphyxiated I pictured myself being found dead in bed having been extinct for hours and hours and the mournfulness of it broke me all up Overcome with emotion and spot destroyer I gathered a few things into a suitcase and went out to spend the night at a hotel When I returned to my room on the following evening the aroma had gone and the rays of the setting sun illuminating the old blue suit as it hung there on the back of the chair showed me a host of familiar faces particularly that of an especially offensive brownish white octopus over the pocket They had come back every one not a design was missing SHELF CULTURE Illustration Decorative letter A A man of education and refinement like you needs books befitting your culture your place in the world said my visitor He spoke as though he were a revered friend of the family But actually he was not just that I had never seen him before He was honoring me with a call at my room on Freshman Row I had come to college to get in touch with Belles Lettres and lo Belles Lettres were seeking me out Recognition had come far sooner than I had hoped To appreciate what I felt you must know that Belles Lettres ambassador was no ordinary person He had the clothes of a clubman the benignity of a clergyman and the dignity of an undertaker There was scholarliness in the droop of the pinch glasses on his aquiline nose and as he talked he kept lifting his curiously arched eyebrows in a manner that fascinated the beholder From the subject of my culture in its broader aspects he progressed by easy gradations to my culture in its relation to the works of Hawthorne and Irving the two authors indispensable to a man of discerning taste the authors whose writings constituted the logical nucleus of the well bred student s library He was happy to be able to tell me of the rare opportunity that now lay in my grasp of acquiring the immortal and exhilarating works of both these masters at one and the same time in one and the same set The urgency of my need for Hawthorne and Irving being thus established beyond the shadow of a hesitance the only thing for me to decide fairly and squarely was whether they should come to me in blue half morocco or in red buckram The splendid showing that either set would make in my bookcase was attested by the accordion plaited binding sample which at the proper moment he produced and unfolded Nearly a yard of titled book backs I signed on the dotted line and accepted his congratulations while he accepted my two dollar deposit About a week later the box arrived Eagerly I lifted forth the magic volumes which were to put me on a new intellectual plane Somehow the bindings seemed to need breaking in They creaked and cracked at the hinges and the pages clung together in little groups clannishly The gluing of the backs was queer yet casual The hand that had tinted the elegant colored frontispieces was evidently a heavy one No matter Hawthorne and Irving were mine I had been taken into the higher circles of culture That very evening I plunged into Mosses from an Old Manse I stuck at it Each day I balanced my morning s Shredded Wheat with Hawthorne Mosses at night till the entire volume had been systematically consumed Then having created my new literary universe I rested Today no one can stump me on Mosses Mention the Old Manse to me and my whole manner changes My face lights up with intelligence My eyes sparkle My nostrils dilate like those of an old fire engine horse at the clang of an alarm gong Yes right this minute I can give you moss for moss If only I had gone on and read all the other volumes of the set Who knows I might now be dean of a college or a second doctor Frank Crane Alas I continued to rest on my Mosses arguing sophistically with my conscience that these books the nucleus of my ultimate library were precious possessions not necessarily for immediate perusal Time defying classics like Hawthorne and Irving would keep and be equally enjoyable years hence if not more so in fact it would be almost extravagant to use them all up in the beginning So it was tacitly decided that we three Nathaniel Washington and I the first two in red buckram the latter in invisible yet palpable Freshman green should grow old together The fourth member of our little group he who had introduced us had dropped out I neither saw nor heard from him again It would seem that he worked like lightning striking in the same place only once Not so his firm however They struck me by mail each month with awful iteration But before a year had passed there descended upon me another emissary of intellectualism This personage expounded to me the doctrine of the De Luxe I learned that an edition of any author no matter how reputable that author may be was mere dross if published for the public at large Only as a subscriber possessing a numbered set of a limited edition could one obtain the quintessence of literature Fiat de lux Let there be e lite The fact that this prophet of almost vellum exclusiveness was physically a fat and florid Irishman whom a wiser man than I might have mistaken for a saloon keeper in his Sunday clothes did not hamper his spirit Enthrallingly yet confidentially he discoursed on Selected Literature for the Serene Few I could be one of those Serene Few I could I did I signed In his display room to which this rotund spider lured me I examined enraptured sets of all the leading de luxe writers There was Pepys with pasted labels Smollett and Fielding with special illustrations twelve volumes of the World s Best Oratory a bobtailed set of Stevenson the inevitable Plutarch in fool morocco that was very like shellacked paper and many more But the magnum opus of them all was a green buckram affair in thirty tall tomes calling itself The Bibliophile Library of Literature Art and Rare Manuscripts To emphasize the word Art in the title there was as an adjunct a three foot portfolio of reproductions from paintings Here was something that cast Hawthorne and Irving into the shade It was world wide wonderful Later I came to know it as the Hash As in a trance I said yes to the Bibliophile Library to the Great Orations to the much shorter R L S Later I took on a few more My finances grew groggy Indeed Europe s difficulties over paying her war indebtedness are as naught in comparison Then at last the miracle happened the book concern mislaid their record of my indiscretions and all scowls ceased For three years Then rediscovery Collectors collectors collectors not the sort that A Edward Newton writes about They came faster than I could insult them Litigation Cash compromise Formal return of books Such is the story of My Life With Great Authors or The Horrors of Dunning Street But I shall not allow it to take its place among the successful biographies and intimate journals of the season Distinctly not It is for the elite alone It is to be published on sugar cured oilskin the edition to be limited to two numbered copies one for me and one for the ashcan Illustration PORTABLE PIGEONHOLES Aside from a few unimportant physical distinctions the chief difference between man and woman is that his pockets are in his clothes whereas her solitary one dangles fitfully from her hand Man is girded about with these little repositories for the safekeeping of his belongings while woman less interested in conservation than in cosmetics holds her booty ever accessible so as to be able at any moment to dispose of three dollars ninety eight cents or powder her nose The ding of her husband s cash register and the click of her dangle bag mark the systole and diastole of married life Man delights in multiplicity of pockets He must have clusters of them layers of them pockets within pockets Otherwise his search for anything he has hidden on his person would be uninterestingly simple Fancy for example the monotony of traveling if at the call All tickets please there were but a single pocket to excavate And how difficult it would be when riding on a street car for one to put up an appearance of searching madly for his purse while he allowed his companion to pay the fare The instinct for stowing away things in pockets manifested in childhood by a proneness for smuggling home from parties such contraband as strawberry tarts and layer cake with soft icing continues throughout life But as one grows older the reason for these caches is less and less obvious The delectable but adhesive loot in the boy s pocket is soon separated as much as possible from the lining and devoured in rapture but the dry accumulations of the middle aged man such as useless ticket stubs old newspaper clippings business cards thrust upon him by salesmen or accepted absentmindedly when handed to him on the street unposted letters which he promised three days ago to drop into the first mail box all these lie buried and forgotten until resurrected on suit pressing day He secretes them with the infatuation of a dog interring bones Only unlike the sagacious hound instead of getting rid of them by this process he merely turns them into encumbrances A pocket that has long suffered from congestion will sometimes take matters into its own hands and empty itself Without bothering to give any warning of its intention it acquires a hole in one corner and then quietly disposes of its contents In this way small but useful change departs in company with your latch key via your trouser leg And your unfortunate fountain pen let down suddenly as though by the springing of a trapdoor falls clear to the bottom of the inside of your waist coat where it lies prostrate gasping out its last spurt of ink There is a treacherous kind of pocket inhabiting a vertical slit in the side of an overcoat that simulates openness when it is actually closed so that the unwary owner imagining himself to be putting a thing into a safe nook is really poking it through a hole and dropping it upon the ground The average tailor has an unpleasant sense of humor He allows you fifteen pockets and then proceeds to fit your suit so closely that not a single one of them can be used Unless you take the precaution of stuffing each pocket with cotton batting when he tries the suit on you he will systematically take in all seams and buttons in such a way that a post card inserted in the breast pocket would be sufficient wadding to throw the entire coat out of shape Perhaps he goes on the assumption that when you have paid his bill you won t have anything left to put there Every pocket is a latent distortion put something into it and you have a swelling a tumor Utilize your hip pocket as an oasis and you have a bustle These cares and tribulations are as we stated at the beginning of this treatise the lot of man alone For woman while accepting the responsibility of the vote has thus far avoided the responsibility of the pocket preferring to let her husband be a walking warehouse for two It is her method of maintaining him in subjection If she too were bepocketed she could not keep him on the jump picking up things she has dropped and trotting back for things she has left behind Nor if she were not in the habit of making him dutifully store her gloves fan handkerchief et cetera on his person could she put him in the wrong by taking him to task for forgetting to return them No woman is too wise She talks very blandly about equality but so far the only representative of her sex to wear a real pocket is the female kangaroo SIMILE Mortimer was as bold as orange and pink hosiery and Simile was as elusive as a cake of castile soap When at the appointed hour he repaired to her house as punctual as a bill collector she tried like a street car conductor to put him off But his mind like the face of a cutie was made up Becoming as eloquent as a man in a telephone booth which you are waiting to use he said Simile I love you Her lips quivered like a ford but the look in her eyes was as far away as Brooklyn Ah marry me he pleaded his voice sounding as hollow as a campaign pledge or I shall be as wretched as porous custard He edged nearer to her till he was almost as close as the air in the subway He gazed anxiously at her face the way a person in a taxicab gazes at the face of the meter Her skin was smooth as a confidence man and clear as boarding house soup He put his arm about her slender waist which was slim as a librarian s salary Yielding suddenly like a treacherous garter she murmured in a voice as soft as stale crackers while tears rushed to her eyes like shoppers to a bargain counter I am yours And she clung to him like barbed wire A thrill of joy went through Mortimer like a highwayman Ah he cried Then I am as happy as a coincidence THE BEATIFIED RACE It is wrong to assert that our fiction magazines have lost their power to inspire to uplift High romance and whole hearted cheerfulness have not deserted them These qualities have merely migrated to the advertising pages The morbid unpleasant fiction is only a short interlude between the innocent joys of Nabiscos and fireless cookers and the wholesomeness of Mellin s Food After sin and adulteration comes ninety nine forty four one hundred per cent pure The people in the advertisements help us to forget those in the stories These pictured endorsers display a generosity that I have not met with elsewhere They offer me a total stranger to them the most delicious refreshments costly gifts in silverware whole suites of furniture they make me aware of long felt wants they volunteer to teach me Spanish or osteopathy or plumbing in ten lessons they propose to send me immediately a portable house in many pieces or a new lease of life in many doses They take a most personal interest in me enquiring sympathetically Are you bilious Here I confess I sometimes feel embarrassed When my old family doctor asks me in the privacy of his office questions of this sort I am prepared to answer them but when as I am turning over the pages of a magazine at a public news stand someone bobs out from behind a respectful soap advertisement and accosts me brusquely with How is your liver or Are you bowlegged I feel positively uncomfortable This forwardness due to the bad influence of the fiction characters is I regret to say a trait of some of the women How sad it is that editors should wilfully allow them to be contaminated I have seen a little Campbell Soup girl of quite a tender age placed on the same page with a heroine whose only topic of conversation was unmoral love Luxuriant creatures as unabashed as they are beautiful invite my approval of their stays and make disclosures of the most sensational kind All of this may be in accordance with the modern ideas of frankness may be part of the sex education campaign but somehow I can t get used to it I am still old fashioned enough to believe that woman s place is in the home especially when she is undressing However while the behavior of these people toward me is occasionally a bit disconcerting their deportment toward each other is uniformly admirable In their own sphere they lead model lives Their family devotion for example is a treat to behold Just see Mama and Papa and Susie and Marian and little Jack all seated around the dining table From their happy smiles it is easy to tell that they love each other and Jell O After dinner dear kind Papa will not bury himself in the evening paper as selfish inconsiderate papas do he will give Mama and the good rosy cheeked children each a stick of Spearmint Then all the family will gather round the fire in peaceful attitudes and listen to the phonograph which protects the atmosphere of their home and Susie will sit on the arm of Papa s chair and fondly compare their Holeproofs Later when Susie s bright young man dressed in a nobby Kuppenheimer suit comes to win her heart with a box of Huyler s Mama whom Papa still adores because her complexion is youthified with Pompeiian will take Marian and little Jack upstairs and show her maternal tenderness by teaching them how to make Colgate s Dental Cream lie flat on a Pro phy lac tic They learn gladly for they love Mama and wear garters and union suits just like hers Even more remarkable than the family devotion of these people is their supreme capability They never do anything without brilliant success Papa can whenever he feels the inclination build a launch or become a magnetic speaker or earn eighty dollars a week in his spare time or evolve a thriving chicken farm from two eggs When he goes fishing you see him in the act of reeling in a six pound trout when he goes duck hunting you see him casually bringing down a bird with each barrel and when he plays billiards you see him in a backhand position and a Donchester shirt executing a shot that would make the reputation of even a professional Look at him now seated at his desk in his office directing a great business without the least worry or effort See the respect on his employes faces At this very moment he is concluding a deal that involves millions And yet how calm he is All because he wears B V D s In short the race of endorsers produced by the eugenics of advertising is not subject to the ills that ordinary flesh is heir to They are the heroes of the present age deified like Greek Orion in the realms of space long legged serene divinely handsome We poor mortals humbly try to imitate them and lay our wealth at their shrines as did the Ancients at the altars of their gods Our Ceres is Aunt Jemima our Mercury is Phoebe Snow our Adonis is the Arrow Collar youth our Venus is the Physical Culture lady and our Romulus and Remus are the Gold Dust Twins JOUEZ BALLE Illustration Le plus grand tournoyeur sud patte New and better ideas of child education are steadily making their way Nearly every one now acknowledges that the school room should be primarily a place of entertainment that the true vocation of the teacher is to amuse in an instructive manner and that study is really a scientific form of play Also it is quite generally admitted that methods which involve mental effort on the part of the child are not to be tolerated So much progress has already been made But now there has just appeared a book which bids fair to carry the educational advance as far ahead again This book entitled A Baseball Primer of French substitutes for the conventional pedantry of conjugations syntax et cetera a vivid account in French of an imaginary world s series Any boy who studies it will understand it instinctively for if the foreign text prove obscure he has only to read the English translation underneath The author Speed Stevens who it may be remembered was captain of his college nine shows a profound knowledge of baseball Indeed it is on account of his ability as athletic coach that he holds his position of instructor in French at Croton The following extract gives an inkling of the rare pedagogical value of the book Dans le dixieme point avec deux hommes In the tenth period with two men sur bases et un sorti Harburg eventa Alors on bases and one out Harburg fanned Then

blanchisseurs allaient sauvages bleachers went wild THE ART OF PACKING With a Disquisition on the Science of Rooting for What You Have Packed Illustration Decorative letter A A traveler is a person who escorts baggage He may think he is taking a trip for business or pleasure but whether he be journeying from Brooklyn to Hoboken with one trunk or touring Europe with a bevy of handbags his real occupation consists in chaperoning impedimenta There is something almost touching about the way in which he looks after his little flock seeing that they are properly tagged counting them anxiously to be sure that none are missing defending them from the cruelty of expressmen pleading for them at the feet of customs inspectors He has care for the humblest satchel If it be lost he will set down three full suitcases and seek after it until he finds it Not that he is actually fond of his luggage But he has packed it and brought it with him and therefore he is under obligation to it is responsible for its well being He knows in his heart that many of the clothes he has brought will never be worn and that most of the books he has stowed away dry looking volumes which he long ago decided he ought to read but which somehow he has never got round to will not be opened Nevertheless he has these things with him and it is his duty to cherish them and see them safely back home again As he unpacks his belongings at the first stop he wonders what his state of mind could have been when he packed them Why had he deemed his shaving brush de trop And why oh why had he abandoned his faithful slippers Had he imagined that two left hand rubbers constituted a pair Five hats and caps are all very nice but why did he put in only four handkerchiefs And even an array of fifty seven neckties affords poor consolation for the total absence of socks As for the bathing suit the morning tub would be the only place where he could use that and even there it would hardly seem appropriate Anybody with the price of a ticket can travel from one city to another but it takes a real genius to pack a trunk The art must be practiced in its purity there must be no mixing of the pancake or roll em up style with the flapjack or spread em out flat style Such eclecticism is pernicious Considered from another point of view packing is a fascinating game You put all sorts of objects in a trunk the baggage man churns them thoroughly and then you take them out again and try to guess what they are You meet with a hundred different surprises For instance you never would have dreamed that a derby hat could turn inside out or that a single suit could acquire ninety three separate and distinct creases or that a book could swallow a mirror and have indigestion from it or that a bottle of ink inside seven wrappings could break and assert itself over a pile of shirts and a month s supply of collars But the great paradox of packing is that a trunk is always full when you close it and always three quarters empty when you open it The trunk that nothing but violent stamping will shut is the very trunk that a few hours later bounces your possessions about like beans in a rattle so that when you lift the lid again you find them huddled forlornly in a corner exhausted and battered from their shuttle istics Another peculiarity is that nothing that you want is where you think it is The garment that you clearly remember putting in the right hand front corner of the top tray is sure to turn up at last in the opposite part of the bottom Indeed sooner will the Sphinx give up her secret than the trunk give up the thing you are looking for To dig up de profundis a shoehorn that you need is a more remarkable achievement than to unearth a new Pompeii Rooting is a science Suppose for instance you wish to locate a pair of scissors without disturbing the general order You begin by classifying the scissors in your mind in order that you may calculate their position in the trunk You consider them with reference to the following scheme of arrangement which you recite as if you were an elevator boy in a department store one Main Tray Shirts collars hats handkerchiefs and toilet articles two Mezzanine Tray Dress clothes neckwear art goods and bric a brac three Basement Shoes hardware suits underwear books medicines and sporting goods Concluding after due deliberation that the scissors are equally appropriate to all of these you start in on the main tray sliding your palms around the edge as though you were easing ice cream out of a mold No scissors You delve deeper using the back of your hand as a plow share No scissors Refusing to be baffled you leave no garment unturned No scissors Growing a trifle impatient you take out the main tray and tackle the mezzanine This will be a simple matter because it is so shallow that you have only to feel around the edges No scissors Perhaps they got shaken into the middle You burrow there making considerable work for the clothes presser No scissors Now you are genuinely angry You toss the mezzanine upon the arms of a chair It is a rocking chair and it slides the tray gently forward and deposits it face downward on the floor Pretending to ignore this you plunge both arms into the basement so violently that the lid unclicks and gives you a cowardly blow on the back of the head You rise up and vow that this your chattel shall flout you no longer Seizing it fiercely you turn it upside down you dump its contents about the room No scissors Then there steals into your mind a vision of the above mentioned cutlery lying on a chiffonier in a room hundreds of miles away and the realization that they are probably lying there still AGRICULTURE INDOORS Illustration The usual package of seeds has not arrived Is the honorable my Representative in Congress neglecting me The uncertainty appals Year after year this eminent legislator has favored me with floral tributes in kernel form so that I have come to think of them as my inalienable rights as a constituent True as is the case with the thousands of other voters in this urban district which he represents I have no facilities for horticulture Living in a New York apartment seven stories up and unequipped with arable soil the nondescript substance which deposits on my window sills from outshaken mops above would scarcely qualify as loam I have been at a

intelligent voter And my M C allows me but six My allotment being limited he explains But why should his allotment be thus limited Since he grants that the bulletins are indispensable to my enlightenment it is not for him to apologize but to see that I am fully supplied with them To protest that the Department of Agriculture cramps his largess is no excuse for does not almighty Congress rule the Department of Agriculture and run it in the interests of the People and not for the sake of a lot of rubes No let him spur the department to greater efforts press the presses to greater output When my little son looks up into my eyes and asks Daddy tell me about the flat headed apple tree borer am I to answer him Sorry my boy but Bulletin No ten sixty five was denied me by a niggardly government My M C will not have done his complete duty till every home in this city boasts a five foot shelf of bulletins and the head of every family can gather his dear ones about the radiator in the evening with a cheery Ah now we take up No nine hundred fifty six The Spotted Garden Slug Every one who pays strict attention gets a hollyhock seed Only then will the true function of government be realized Meanwhile The seeds have come SNOWY BOSOMS At the risk of seeming churlish a veritable outcast from society I confess that I have no great fondness for snowy bosoms I realize that they are generally considered beautiful and that their virgin whiteness is the embodiment of unyielding purity and yet I cannot but prefer the more comfortable negligee shirt If only they could be soft boiled I would so appreciate a three minute one I know it would sit better on the stomach The white could be firm enough to hold together and yet not so much so as to require a knife to break into it Gala chemises that approached this ideal did appear several seasons ago Their frontispieces were encrusted with a swarm of very young tucks which rendered them quite docile But these gentle easy going garments with their pliant pleats and amenable button holes could not survive They were alas too soft They lacked the stoicism of starch They could not hold their own against the sterner fibred armored breastworks And so we men of today when we go to perform our evening devotions to the ladies have upon us the same old white plague I might find some consolation in the fact that my aversion to it is shared by all laundries Yes the laundry is my avenger With Machiavellian guile it invites shirts seeks them welcomes them professes a yearning passion for them and then subtly destroys them in secret Commit an insufferable new stud smasher to a laundry and note the fate that overtakes it See what happens to its bold front A week later it will be brought back to you with its spirit quite broken and its tail between its sleeves and held in subjection by a squad of menacing pins The moment you rend the veil of wax paper with which they have discreetly concealed its destitution you are amazed to find how it has aged in one short week It has become like the sear and yellow leaf There are crow s feet at the corners of its buttonholes It is so weak that they have had to send it on a paste board stretcher to keep it from going all to pieces Your erstwhile festive buckler now looks more like the bosom of Abraham INTERIOR DESPERATION It is easy nowadays to get advice on how to arrange your home The Woman s Page in any newspaper will tell you just how your living room ought to look just how your hallway may be beautified and just how your kitchen may be transformed into a scientific laboratory Scores of books by experts on the subject undertake to instruct you how to change your home from a place to live in to a work of art Realizing that my abode needed a little toning up along modern aesthetic lines I consulted a book called The Dwelling Beautiful which I had been informed would give me just the help I needed It is not necessary that your furniture rugs hangings and pictures be expensive says the author reassuringly The only essential is that they be beautiful in themselves and in restful accord with each other Pray gentle writer did you ever see my belongings Did you ever see the marble and walnut parlor table that Aunt Jessamine gave me or the streakily stained Mission piano with mottled glass panels and gew gawy candle brackets that my wife won in the guessing contest and is therefore inordinately proud of or the case of stuffed birds which Uncle Lemuel left me in his will How am I to make these things beautiful in themselves and in restful accord with each other The truth is none of our furnishings are gregarious From the green rug whose acrid hue assaults every other color in the room to the wonderfully and fearfully made ornamental lamp each thing is what the advertisement writers would call different Rabid in their nonconformity how am I to make a happy family of them The main feud is between our heirlooms and our wedding presents the former being atrocities in oak walnut and plush of the Victorian era and the latter present day garishnesses so that the general effect might be likened to a colon one period on top of another The author of The Dwelling Beautiful would probably suggest that I get rid of some of these incumbrances The lamentable fact is that I can t My relatives would disown me For my whole family connection not to mention my wife s about which much might be said takes upon itself to police my belongings Every visit of a relative even the casual call of my most distant cousin means a critical inspection a careful stock taking of heirlooms and wedding presents A person who gives you anything as a wedding present never forgets it His taste may be erratic but his memory is inexorable Because a thing happened to catch his fancy in an off moment it is anchored in your home forever And the feeling of self appreciation for his generosity which he experiences whenever he beholds his gift in after years prevents him from admitting even to himself that he was out of his mind when he bought it Hence you are doomed to be its perpetual curator with the obligation to display it prominently so that whenever he chooses to enter your house he may see it and claim it with his eye An heirloom is still worse Each one that you have in your possession might have gone to somebody else and that somebody else feels that he or she would have appreciated it more than you do Nevertheless for you to disburden yourself of a single heirloom by presenting it to the person who coveted it most would be to precipitate a family crisis Take for instance that case of stuffed birds Every time Uncle Lemuel s daughter sees it she tells me how much it always meant to her and how the old house seems empty without it Yet whenever I offer to make her a present of it she bursts into tears and sobs that her dear father wanted me to have it because I had once told him I liked birds and that therefore she would be the last person in the world to deprive me of it So along with all the rest of the harmony killers I am saddled for life with this ornithological incubus It is true as Cousin Ophelia says that I like birds but my fondness for them does not continue after they are defunct and stuffed neither does it include owls whether alive or dead and there are no less than three owls in that cabinet gloomy dusty evil looking fowls their big yellow glass eyes wide open and staring I ll wager they had their eyes closed when Uncle Lemuel shot them He never was much of a sport Be that as it may these lugubrious specimens are on my hands I kept them in the living room till I couldn t stand them there any longer Strangers would ask me how I happened to take up taxidermy Then I removed them to the dining room where they promptly took away my appetite Transferred subsequently to the nursery they caused Mamma s Pet to go into convulsions of terror I offered the cook an increase in wages if she would take the cursed things into her room she threatened to leave I made a pathetic appeal to my wife to take them into hers she reminded me coolly that Uncle Lemuel was my uncle Now they are in my room in the corner where I used to keep my favorite chair But something tells me that they may not endure there forever I am a mild dispositioned man long suffering and tractable but that cabinet of birds is too much Some day you may see clouds of smoke pouring out of my windows and fire engines pulling up at my door If you do don t feel sorry for me or censure me A burning need will be satisfied It will be a case of sponsored combustion THE WRITING ON THE SCREEN Being interested in human nature in all its manifestations I have lately made a study of handwriting as it is shown in the moving pictures I undertook this research because I had been given to understand that chirography when scientifically analyzed revealed every nuance of human character and because the personages in moving pictures being intensely dramatic could not fail to have striking individualities as penmen Let me give some of the interesting examples which I found Here for instance is a confidential communication from a great financier to one of his associates Dear Buggenheim Buy thirty thousand shares of B V D immediately We must foil Stockfeller if it takes our last million J P Mormon Observe in what a firm steady hand this is written It shows that the great financier can be cool even in a crisis No wonder he is successful He always looks ahead he never crosses a T until he comes to it Clear visioned he is his I s have their specks on straight Such a man will go far without being missed The next specimen is a letter written by the dashing young hero to the heroine It reads Dear Bosnia I love you madly Your father despises me because I am poor but honest Elope with me at midnight in my racing machine Beverly Stanch and dependable His passion is intense yet he is too loyal to betray it Note the uncompromising uprightness of his L s You just can t help trusting him because as he says he hasn t any money Here is a letter penned by a wayward wife Fraught with tense emotion it is indeed a moving human document She writes Dear Bertram I am leaving you tonight for ever Try to understand and forgive me My hand trembles so that I can scarcely write I hope you will be happy Goodbye Arnica What a wealth of sorrow this handwriting displays Poor unfortunate woman tearful and yet volatile Her M s are bowed with grief and yet they have an arch look Out of touching deference to her first love she makes a desperate effort to be neat she is not willing that her husband s last memento of her should be a sloppy one Even when about to commit a sin she still retains that refinement of nature which he has always reverenced that indescribable feminine delicacy which was wont to reveal itself in such little acts as shrinking visibly at the touch of unclean overshoes There are innumerable other examples which might be cited handwritings of every conceivable kind but the endless variety of them would merely tend to bewilder Therefore I shall give only two more and without extended comment for indeed their characteristics jut out quite protuberantly The little six year old child raises her face wistfully from her piece of angel food and scrawls Dear Daddy Mama and me wish you would come home Melba Truly a revelation of the artistic nature In contrast to this let us examine what Jimmie the Dope escaped convict scribbles to his confederate Steve Be there wit yer tools at one o clock tonight ready to do the job But look out fer that Italian named Isaac McTavish he s a stool pigeon Jimmie This particular specimen has a tragic interest for us It demonstrates the failure of our modern institutions Here is a man forced by society into a felon s trade who was capable of earning an honest living as an instructor in penmanship MUSIQUE GLACEE Illustration Of all strivers after the Ideal none have so kindly a method as the architects responsible for those pleasing structures termed French pastry Whatever they create is delicate delectable imbued with sweetness Putting aside the thought of future fame these gentle artificers devote their labor to works as perishable as they are exquisite meringues sculptured in ambrosial stucco that melt to nothing roseate cakelets of which the crimson splendor endures no longer than a sunset kisses that are all too brief tarts which frail as flowers succumb quickly to hunger in the dessert These crust craftsmen pour forth richness as song birds do creating rapture for but a precious moment If ordinary architecture is frozen music then surely this Gallic refinement of it is musique glacee There are many styles ranging from Perpendicular Gothic to Powdered Rococo so many in fact that one could scarcely hope to masticate them all at a single sitting Two or three is the most I have ever been able to account for Yet each style if found in its purity merits attention as an embodiment of good taste For even the humblest cream puff despite the looseness of its design and the unpretentiousness of its exterior has an interior well worth investigating Perhaps the most important landmark in all the realm of pastry is the tradition hallowed and chocolate roofed eclair whose long nave affords sanctuary for whipped cream or custard Not necessarily chocolate roofed however the eaves may be tinged instead with a soft patina of cafe au lait This mellow hued pile eminently edible is cherished by multitudes of devotees Another structure beautiful in ruin is the massive patty that serves as donjon keep for oysters Upon its crumbling ramparts parsley has found root and encircling its fissured base is a broad moat of gravy Gaunt sugarless no oyster can hope to escape An equally notable tower is the stately white charlotte russe Its impenetrable wall of cardboard re enforced inside with a doughty thickness of cake rises sheer from the glacis of the plate and terminates in crenelated battlements over the edge of which hang masses of cream ready for the invader Upon the topmost pinnacle is posted a sentinel cherry Of contrastingly mild aspect are the various crisp terraces those luxuriant Hanging Gardens where fruits of every sort are spread out in gorgeous profusion rows of gold gleaming apricots neat hedges of orange plugs happy pears and orderly better halves of peaches a bed of sugar fed strawberries each tucked in snugly grapes chaliced in fluted pie crust jocund apple chips and banana checkers cuddled cosily slice against slice Truly a paradise in pastry And there are a host of other fair shapes the pantheon like Kossuth cake beneath the low dome of which is a votive offering of cream the amazing custard skyscraper with its innumerable floors no walls and gaily iced roof the Byzantine baba au rhum inlaid with tutti frutti mosaics and steeped in subtle enchantment and countless others fanes kiosks minarets pavilions reliquaries of jam baffling description or digestion Frail ephemeral created with no thought of permanence and yet we should hardly enjoy them more if they were built of everlasting marble The craftsmen who design them scorning personal glory do not sign their works For theirs is the true aesthetic spirit so rare in this commercial age Their handiwork faithfully bears out the precept Tart for Tart s Sake THE CARE OF THE HUSBAND The average young wife is regrettably inexperienced in the matter of husbands Unless it has been her fortune to have a wise mother or a divorce she is likely to be quite ignorant of how to care for and train the big stranger who comes into her life Therefore these precepts of friendly counsel may not seem to the matrimonial novice altogether amiss The advice I would give is simple in the fullest sense of the word so that after the young wife has had a few husbands she can dispense with it if not sooner Feeding This is the most important problem a wife has to face The husband must be made to feel that he is well fed Otherwise he will not be contented and docile During the first week after marriage when he is still quite infantile and tender to the point of mushiness he may be fed from the hand or spoon This method will be found especially satisfactory in cases where the husband shows symptoms of sickly sentimentality Throughout the entire first month he will be so demanding of care so bewildered by the strange new world in which he finds himself as to be barely able to maintain sanity in short he will be so soso that she will have to prepare all the food herself or at least make him think she does But later a change of diet will be found necessary He will demand scientifically prepared foods If the change is managed in the right way it can be accomplished with only slight upset to his disposition Simply alter the feeding formula so that the total quantity is lessened and the proportion of sugar and burnt materials is increased It will soon take effect In a day or two he will say with a worried look Darling I m afraid the cooking is too much for you And you know what he really means After that the transition to avowedly professional cooking will be quite painless Outings and Play During the first few months the husband will not need many outings He will be happy and contented if allowed to romp about the house Such toys as hammers picture wire curtain rods et cetera will keep him occupied Later however there will come a period of restlessness Then you must take him out more and more and let him run and play with other husbands after you have made sure of course that they are good well behaved husbands The companionship of these innocent sports will tend to make him one himself When as time goes by he reaches the stage where he begins to take notice the wife must be very careful for he is highly impressionable At this time a wife will do well to look out for her husband herself instead of entrusting him to some empty headed girl whom she may not really know at all If he needs amusement let her divert him with brightly colored silks and baubles which she wears and he pays for Let her take him to see the pretty theater and show him the beautiful mountains and the big blue ocean and tell him fairy stories about economy and teach him to draw nice big cheques in his little cheque book Discipline cannot begin too early The husband must be taught that he can only have the things that his wife decides are best for him and that no protesting on his part will do any good If he proves fretful chide him by threatening to go live with your mother If after that he is still unruly threaten to have your mother come live with you In this way he will soon learn to mind Indeed before long you will be able to show him off before company with the assurance that he will behave just as you have trained him to and you will have the satisfaction of hearing your friends declare he does you credit Awakening his mind This is one of the chief duties and responsibilities of wifehood It cannot be shirked For while no husband is expected to know anything at marriage the fact that he got married attests that he is expected a year or so later to look intelligent when the lady next to him at dinner discusses Coue and Scriabine and to know that Gauguin is not something to be got from a bootlegger For him not to know these things would be a reflection on his home training or in other words his wife She will be considered negligent unless she has instilled into his rudimentary mind a smattering of whatever is accounted smart For every wife is judged by the way she brings up her husband

their servants They are not human No one ever saw them eat or sleep or smile My millionaire host may overlook the fact that I am using the salad fork for the fish not so his English butler This austere personage takes note of my error in silence and when the salad course arrives steals up behind me like Nemesis and lays by my plate the fork that correct form demands I feel chastened Illustration My host may overlook the fact that I am using the salad fork for fish not so his English butler His eye is always upon me I can t even take a sip of water without his calling attention to it by stealthily refilling my glass If he didn t watch me so closely when I am helping myself I wouldn t be so nervous As it is my hand trembles under his grueling stare Just at the critical moment when my tongful of asparagus conveyed like a hot coal is poised in mid air between the serving dish and my plate I flinch and there is a green and white avalanche I make a frantic slap at it as it falls and by good luck it lands on the plate To be sure some of the stalks are craning their necks perilously over the edge but that is a small matter compared with what might have happened I rake them into the middle of the plate sit gasping at the thought of my narrow escape There is an awkward pause The bon mot I was about to utter apropos of an opera I had never heard has left my mind entirely I can t think of anything to say Finally in desperation I remark idiotically to the dowager at my left I love asparagus don t you The next time he passes a dish I lose my nerve I lift my hand to help myself and then as I catch his eye draw back shaking my head No I won t take any chances After that I keep to a strict diet eating only the things that appear on my plate when it is put down in front of me If the plate arrives naked and empty naked and empty it remains even though the course consist of my favorite delicacy I suffer the pangs of Tantalus Alligator pear salad more to be desired than gold yea than much fine gold is offered to me I covet it Everything gastronomic in my nature craves it but cowardly fear restrains me it looks slippery and I refuse it I could almost weep As the dinner proceeds and my modified hunger strike continues I begin to regain confidence I feel that my abstemiousness implying as it does a jaded palate and an aristocratic indigestion is highly fashionable I fancy that in refusing ambrosia I am showing a godlike superiority I expand with self assurance Just watch me startle these plutocrats with my scorn of their costly food I ll make myself the lion of the evening May I help you to shortcake sir asks a low ironically respectful voice My pride collapses The butler has seen through me to the cowardice in my heart From his lofty pinnacle he stoops to succor me But I rebel I ll help myself thank you I retort for I am on my mettle now and boldly prize off a towering segment of the dessert Would I let a menial reveal to the whole table that I was afraid to help myself Never Why I d sooner Dizzily the creamy thing totters keels over and falls with a sickening flop a mushy sound as of the impact of a wet sponge Juicy red berries gambol hither and thither For a moment the shortcake lies helplessly on its side like a jellyfish that the tide has left But only for a moment for a wrecking crew made up of the butler and his assistant comes hurrying on the scene With emergency plate and scraper they remove the debris while I turn purple and clutch at my collar for air Then after a mortifying amount of crumb gleaning and cream mopping they spread a napkin before me in the presence of my swell friends as if to shield the cloth from further depredations I draw back to allow them to put it there and in so doing squash a hidden strawberry against my waistcoat As a final humiliation a fresh piece of shortcake is brought to me already on a plate If there is anything more formidable than an English butler it is an English valet Somebody else s valet I mean for I suppose that if a person had one long enough he could get so that he wouldn t be afraid of him But as for a perfectly strange English valet Your key please sir demands Hawkins upon my arrival at my friend s summer palace He bows slightly What key I ask uneasily The key to your traveling bag sir I am just stopping overnight on my way home from a house party in the woods and all my spare raiment is soiled and bedraggled So I can unpack your things sir threatens the Great Mogul Never mind thank you I stammer I ve lost the key Very good sir he replies and goes But not permanently When I return to my room at midnight elated over having trounced my host in countless games of billiards I am met at the door by my oppressor In his hand is a small object I fetched a locksmith out from the city sir and ad im make this for you sir It fits quite correctly sir And one glance about the room from the snaggle tooth comb on the dresser to the frayed pajamas the mussiness of which no festive laying out can hide makes me aware of my utter ignominy Since when I have confined my week end visiting exclusively to lumber camps PUTTING PEDAGOGY ACROSS There is much well meaning propaganda in progress for the preservation of professors Alumni are appealed to bankers are buttonholed and in every college club the diagram showing the Big Game play by play has been replaced by a dial showing how many millions have been garnered to date for the fund all this in order that the saying Live and learn may be reversible as Be learned and yet live Wouldn t it be more humane instead of giving the professors money to which they are not accustomed to teach them how to sell themselves Today every one is paid according to how completely the public or the plutocrats are sold on him Only salesmanship can save the scholars The time is ripe for some gilt edged grad such as Morton K Mung President of the Newark Noodle Corporation to announce when stalked by the subscription squad No gentlemen of the Adopt a Professor Committee your suggestion that by donating seven cents a day I keep an instructor in paleontology from starvation or be godfather to an authority on Sanscrit at eight cents strikes me as impractical With the cost of living rising again next year they will want nine and ten cents and you see the position that would put us in No gentlemen I ll do better I ll solve this situation once for all by loaning my general sales manager mister Blat to dear old Weehawken for two months and he will give the members of the Faculty the same tutoring course he gives the men we send out on the road Within a year after they leave his hands these same profs you ve mentioned will be writing Success Through Sanscrit and How I made My Pile with Paleontology for the American Magazine At the conclusion of this loyal speech the committee would give a long cheer and depart checkless but with a new vision And sure enough the pale pedagogues would emerge from mister Blat s snappy seminar simply exuding system They would possess the Power to Meet Men the Personality that Wins Laboratory recluses would burst forth primed to impress with

would want to know Cigar Well Vedas are the wisdom songs of India Mellowed by forty centuries in the parchment One hundred per cent Hindu Classy yet conservative noble yet nobby You know what caste is among the Brahmins well that s how exclusive these are Indeed Yes and I m offering them for immediate delivery to students But how does this concern me I was just getting to that This is a proposition which requires considerable capital for its development At the present time only seven students have asked for Vedas yet I have estimated that the supply of Vedas now mellowing out in India is enough for at least one hundred eighty thousand students Which means that if we created the demand why think of the business we could do When you come right down to it a Veda when presented in the right way can be as catchy as a Kewpie Hm How much money would you need to start with Fifty thousand dollars Besides my salary which would be fifteen thousand dollars outright plus a bonus of one and one half cents per Veda per student there would be the cost of advertising in the college catalogue the conducting of a circularizing campaign to a selected list of student prospects and the publication of a promotion organ to be entitled India Ink Then too of course I would have to have a commission on gross tuition receipts and text book sales and an ample expense account for entertaining in the class room and in my home Now will you kindly put your name here on the dotted line Before I guarantee you all this money tell me one thing What is the real value of these Vedas They are the quaint quintessence of conservatism and will occupy youthful minds menaced by modernism I ll sign Succored by the science of salesmanship any professor would be able to achieve affluence Fortunes would rise

LOOSE Illustration Decorative letter T There is no constancy so affecting as that of a faithful button Friends may be devoted yet they seek your company partly for the pleasure of it Dogs may show the uttermost fidelity but you feed them But the attachment of buttons is without taint of self it is pure spontaneous This loyalty is the more remarkable when you consider how empty their lives are The outlook through their buttonholes is but a narrow one Their daily labor a mere mechanical buttoning into and out of an uncongenial flap is deadeningly monotonous I have seldom known a button whose heart was really in its work In surroundings so little adapted to the building up of character they display a stanchness that is akin to stoicism Indeed many a button will stick doggedly to an old weatherbeaten garment long after the perfidious nap has fled There are unfortunately buttons wanting in probity deceitful buttons that pretend to be strongly attached to you when detained by but a single thread irresponsible buttons that fly off at a tangent immodest buttons of the cloth covered variety that disrobe in public But deliberately vicious buttons are rare The fact is few buttons would go to the bad were it not for the heartless indifference of their owners Too often a headstrong young button that might easily have been saved had it been brought up short the moment it showed signs of looseness is allowed to reach the end of its rope fall and be utterly lost And the dereliction of one may mean the ruin of its family I was told of a sad case once where an entire clan of brown buttons dwelling happily together on the front of a coat and waistcoat polished distinctive buttons they were not be matched anywhere were cruelly banished because of a single erring member While to neglect buttons is most reprehensible there is such a thing as showing them too much indulgence For buttons must not be coddled when toyed with they droop Tender hearted women actuated by sympathy and not realizing the consequences of what they were doing have been known to pamper buttons Because a button has a pleasant open countenance one of these misguided persons will support it on her costume in idleness She may even surround herself with a retinue of glittering sycophants that never knew a buttonhole great saucerlike hangers on lolling on their stems brazen braggadocios flashing with insolent militarism and puny silken pettinesses mere pills of buttons Often I have been shocked to see a swarm of these drones perched indolently on the show part of a garment while underneath a squadron of industrious hooks and eyes grappled with the work to be done Such sights are to thoughtful people almost as depressing as the massacre of helpless shirt buttons by a baleful flatiron Are buttons to become effete Will they in the course of generations of dolce far niente lose their stamina The signs are ominous THE PRIMROSE PATHOLOGY Illustration I am laying an ego With

peace among pens As it is however every pen wears a drop of ink on its shoulder Not even the tender ministrations of chamois cloth will soothe its savage heart It is deaf to sweet reasonableness Returning drunk from the inkwell it will smutch the hand that fed it cast blots upon the fairest names and ravish virgin sheets of paper And when you try to force it to a more civilized way of behaving you discover it has its points crossed A pen thus divided against itself will not write There must be freedom for the black fluid There must be perfect harmony two prongs with but a single point two parts that meet as one Disunion is a sign of weakness I had a pen once whose prongs became estranged They were egoists each followed his individual bent and was determined to make his own mark in his own field For the sake of appearances they took their meals of ink together but immediately afterward when pressure was brought to bear upon them they separated Yet when one of them striving too hard after originality broke under the strain his widow was left desolate More domestic in an old fashioned way is that staunch blunt family the Stubbs They are firm and substantial sort of pens By people who dislike them they are called phlegmatic stodgy close stiffnibbed and it must be admitted they do lack the sprightliness of the Sharps but after all these unyielding puritans with

meet obstacles The Stubbs plodding along doggedly overcome all hazards in the paper whereas the Sharps tripping nonchalantly come to grief at the first bunker and before they get started again waste several strokes and gouge the course And when the Sharps attempt to run the gauntlet of expensive linen stationery the higher the price the higher the ridges they get held up at every cable crossing But there is a kind of paper smooth slippery insidious that prompts both the Sharps and the Stubbs to evil ways They know they are doing wrong however for they are ashamed and conceal their tracks rendering all tracing impossible It is a great pity that pens are not more consistent about their ink giving One moment they are stingy and the next lavish Perhaps this may be due to absent mindedness Beginning a letter to a crabbed old relative you say to your pen Give me a little ink for Dear Uncle Jonathan It ignores the request You urge again Still it is thinking of something else Here wake up now You shake it violently Give me some ink Why certainly it replies effusively Take a blot And Dear Uncle Jonathan is buried with deep mourning Haphazard as their outgivings appear to be I have a theory that they are in reality quite logical for I have noticed that pens spend most ink on things that are worth most Thus a pen that would grudge to disburse a single minim on a cheap sheet of a pad will gladly expend all it has upon a costly embroidered tablecloth And it finds the flyleaf of a handsome book which if separate from the volume it would regard as a mere scrap of paper amazingly absorbing If it take a fancy to something large and sumptuous such as an oriental rug and yet not have on hand sufficient ink for such an outlay it will appropriate it with a deposit of spot splash However little aptitude a pen may have for writing it is sure to display rare skill as a fisherman In the most unpromising inkwell it will catch deep sea monsters that astound you It will spear great flounders of blotting paper and wriggly eels of string It will drag up from the bottom wreckage of forgotten times prehistoric flora and fauna an antique rubber band a female tress perhaps of some ink nymph long dead or discharged a tack bent with age a perfectly preserved shoe button a less perfectly preserved mummy of a fly The perseverance of this follower of Izaak Walton is admirable It will cast patiently again and again without a single dribble and then all at once it will come struggling triumphantly to the surface with a whale of a June bug it has harpooned Whereupon as is the custom with fishermen who write it will make a grand splurge of its catch on paper In order to prevent such piscatorial dippiness pen fanciers have bred the fountain species the latest variety of which is self spilling Pens of this artificially produced species are very nervous They have to be handled with extreme care For example if one of them is held upside down all the ink runs to its head and there is danger of a hemorrhage Its digestive system is poor it regurgitates and bubbles at the mouth The least thing upsets its stomach If you forget to put its cap on even in mild weather it contracts a serious congestion of the throat with the result that the next letter you write proves dry point etching Taken all in all pens have a great deal to answer for The record they have left on the pages of history is a black one Many a person who has sat down to write something bright and optimistic has been so disillusioned and embittered by his pen that he has ended by hacking a hymn of hate or drooling a dirge of despair Which accounts for most of the world s harsh diplomacy and morbid literature Even this essay was originally intended to be cheerful ENLIGHTENMENT At last I have found out the awful truth about humanity I never even suspected it Till last evening I went along my way cheerfully blindly never guessing that my fellow men were steeped in evil But now I know My eyes have been opened For last night I went to one of those enlightening film dramas that reveal life as it is It was called Her Blackest Sin and it comprised nine reels of terrible truth It was one of those fine moral sermons to which every mother ought to take her son and every niece ought to take her uncle and every stepaunt ought to take her Pekingese I only wish my daughter could have seen it but as I haven t any daughter she couldn t have Illustration She never really intended to become steeped in sin she was scenarioed into it This drama shows how a handsome but thoughtless woman may sink in sin without ever meaning to Yes the strange and pitiful part about it is that she really never intended to be a fallen crime seared creature She sins witlessly she is scenarioed into it Perhaps she is too anxious to please She appears at wild cabarets and wears gowns that are cut to the quick not because she desires to of her own accord but because it is expected of her by the audience Lack of firmness leads to her undoing she is first pliant then supple then sinuous She displays too little backbone and too much Poor woman what chance has she amid so many dress suits Only too late does she learn that stiff bosoms cover none but hard hearts and that there is no gleam so sinister as that of a silk hat covering as it does baldness of the baldest sort Innocent at first hardly a reel passes before she begins to stop and work her face just the way the villains stop and work their faces Of course being still a modest woman she does this only in the privacy of a close up By the seventh reel even her high minded husband has become afflicted with the taint and is stopping and working his face And so the drama progresses growing blacker and more enlightening every minute I can t be too grateful to the producers of this film for the unflinching way in which they accepted the responsibility of my innocence and warned me If they had not I should probably have gone to the end of my days without ever knowing that people were at bottom only smiling criminals But now thank goodness I m warned and on my guard I m posted on sin When a man comes up to me and shakes my hand I ll know he s a hawk looking for a home to break up and when a woman smiles at me I ll know she s a vampire They won t catch me I ll just watch them surreptitiously when they are off their guard until I see them working their faces and then I ll have them For now I am an expert on evil That film showed me the thrilling seductions of a life of vice so that if I am ever confronted by them I shall be able to recognize them at once and say how do you do And at the end there was one of those solemn moral warnings such as everybody thinks everybody else is supposed to need so in future I shall know what to avoid in that line And this entire transformation of my life cost me only thirty three cents HOLIDAY MISGIVINGS Illustration When on Christmas night I take a private view of the collection of presents I have received I realize that I am a much misunderstood person I sit down sadly and wonder what I could have done to create such an impression Is there something queer about me If so then wouldn t it have been more tactful more kind to have come to me and told me of it instead of thus brutally proclaiming it to the world But that is the way people are they will serenely assume things they wouldn t have the face to mention Those morbid socks half hose and half a disease The loom that made them must have been degenerate It is plain that they were never intended to be put on because the paste board document that lurks in the bottom of the box declares they are guaranteed against any sort of wear And these were esteemed suitable associates for my feet I have no recollection of sniffling in public yet here are nine dozen handkerchiefs an outfit for someone with chronic coryza As for the assemblage of pocketbooks purses wallets coin holders et cetera I only hope that after I have paid my holiday bills there will be enough money left to half way fill the pocketbook I have already But the crowd that seems most oppressive is that of the calendars Am I really so absent minded as to require seven engagement pads Am I so lax about settling my accounts that my butcher and grocer and milkman feel called upon to supply me the means of knowing what day of the month it is Anything may pass for a calendar so long as it complies with the law by having a little batch of months attached to the bottom like an appendix a snapshot of Cousin Gertrude s baby oh the deuce I suppose I was expected to give that kid something for Christmas a pastoral chromo entitled Shearing the Lambs sent me by a firm of brokers a picture of a child in a nightie saying its prayers with the compliments of the Schweinler Beef Packing company a hand tinted but feebly glued print of Paul and Virginia inscribed Jones and Bergfeldt Plumbers One calendar consisting of a sheaf of large placards each purporting to exhibit a specimen of female beauty is so throttled by its silken cord that when February first arrives and I attempt to give one of the beauties the flop over in order that I may gaze on the next for a while the situation proves too tense The eyelet suddenly splits into an outlet and the jilted maiden cast off by her sisters collapses upon the floor All of which is most distressing but no more so than the notion that women seem to have of what a man likes I shall never forget the pair of slippers that Aunt Josephine bestowed upon me last year They were what are technically known as mules but in reality they were a couple of long rafts each with an arching toe cabin that would have accommodated both feet The low racing sterns extended so far aft of my heels that the latter stood almost amidships Navigation was difficult They kept running afoul of each other so that I would suddenly find my starboard foot partly on the port slipper and mostly on the floor Sometimes one of them would dart ahead several lengths and capsize obliging me to turn skipper No matter how earnestly I lifted their bows their sterns always dragged A landsman would have said that my progress resembled pumping a rhapsody on a pianola or skiing in the Alps The unreasonableness of these mules reached a climax one morning while I was visiting the Cholmondeley Browdens I encountered my hostess unexpectedly as I was returning from my bath In the excitement of the moment both slippers bolted one of them performing a spectacular flip flap and the other skidding through the balustrade of the stairway and landing below in a globe of goldfish while I made my escape in a state of pedal nudity As for the neckties I have received truly Love is blind ALL ALL ARE GONE THE OLD FAMILIAR FACADES Nowadays when it is hard for the casual observer to distinguish Somebody s Mother from Somebody s Jazz Baby it is not to be wondered at that houses as well as humans are disguising their age Victorian brownstone mansions that later sank to boarding house seediness now renew their youth as the Rubens Studios or Haddon Chambers drab office buildings yielding to a sudden access of sand take on new complexions as talcumy white as those of the flappers passing by He would be a tactless and cruel man who would say I know when that one s corner stone was laid Or My great uncle knew that one when it was only three stories high Or It didn t have that cornice until its gables began to fall off Or You ought to have seen the stoop it had before they put in the steel braces Beauty doctoring to buildings must have become quite an art It takes skill to know how to eliminate the dark lines under tired window sills lift the sagging balconies reduce protuberant bay windows Only a trained chisel can remove a superfluous ornament in a way that will guarantee against its reappearance We are shocked though at the brazenly commercial character that certain sedate houses have taken on in the giddier part of town Buildings that were formerly quiet residences keeping themselves retiringly back from the bustle and modestly shielding themselves with brown balustrades now shamelessly come forward as close to the line as they dare meeting the idle stroller half way not with lowered shades but with broad plate glass assurance and even displaying scandalous lingerie We cannot but feel that buildings thus bedizened in the effort to keep from being neglected will not command the same reverence that used to be inspired by the mossy old manse or the messy old mill Theirs is hardly the Age of Innocence Would the old home seem as homely to you after it had been exterior decorated Would it be as dear Oh much dearer as the real estate agent will tell you or your own broker MY MUSEUM Illustration I called her Plury That is to say I would speak of her by that endearing appellation when she was running along smoothly and seldom missing in either cylinder Her real name however was E Pluribus Unum You see I had wanted an automobile but found that no single make was within my means So I bought Plury just as a person who cannot afford beef veal chicken turkey lamb or pork orders hash Individually Fords Buicks Overlands Peerlesses Simplexes Pierce Arrows et cetera were too expensive for me but collectively combined in the form of second hand Plury I could afford them all at one hundred thirty two dollars fifty cents Plury was a cosmopolitan Her rear axle was Italian her steering wheel was French her magneto was Austrian and her mudguards were Belgian It was hard to maintain her neutrality For example a German cogwheel that clutched with an English one scarred veterans both of them kept the gear box in a constant state of friction When such international clashes occurred it was always difficult to find out which one had started the trouble Then too among the American made parts there was much jealousy between those that had come from rival factories The tires were of four different makes each boasting a surface specially patented against skidding but each strove so hard to shove the other three into the gutter that all four cavorted about the road in a most unseemly fashion Many were the heartburnings the incompatibilities of temperament of the parts thus yoked together Whenever these dissentions brought matters to a standstill I would have to get out and apply the monkey wrench of peace Plury was hardly a noble car in either appearance or speed yet I was genuinely fond of her Her lamps had a wistful look a look as innocent and helpless as that with which poached eggs gaze up at you before they die As for her slowness that made little difference because her speedometer geared presumably for a racing car exaggerated And after all what is speed but a number on a dial While I saw seventy one registered there I was not disturbed by the fact that bicyclists were passing me I admired her pluck She would chunk along stoically accepting other people s dust without complaint when in a condition of health that would have prostrated any other machine Thoroughbreds do not show the greatest endurance Bravely she would drag herself home after a hard afternoon s work with a leak in her radiator and congestion in all her bearings I used to practice vivisection on her taking her apart and putting her together in new ways It was a fascinating kind of solitaire solving the problem of what to do on rainy Sundays In a few hours time I could shuffle the parts and deal out an entirely new model Under my care Plury changed her shape with ultrafashionable frequency A model that I was particularly interested in trying out was number nine i e the eighth transformation This was such a daring rearrangement that it seemed too wonderful to be true But it worked and thrillingly In this form Plury exceeded all her previous speed records The speedometer dial registered eighty seven and a swarm of gnats had hard work keeping up with us Proceeding at this reckless pace we approached a hilly curve marked DANGER DRIVE SLOWLY I changed gear The cogs emitted a grating crunching sound as of quartz in a stone crusher and then subsided I got out to view their death grapple But I had no sooner set foot upon the ground than the roar of an infuriated claxon startled me so that I leaped clear aside into the ditch In that instant a huge Fiat armed with a brazen fender swung around the curve and rammed Plury in the radiator Plury splattered like a charlotte russe hit by a sledgehammer The road and neighboring fields were full of her The liveried chauffeur of the Fiat got out and began to brush the dust from the front of his car A frightened fat man picked himself up from the floor of the tonneau and called to me Are you badly hurt No I replied I m all right I think Good he said in a tone of great relief Then let s settle the damages at once for I don t want this thing to get into the papers With a shaky hand he drew out a checkbook What was the value of your car I hesitated Would you consider five thousand sufficient indemnity to close the whole matter personal injuries property damages and everything I considered it And after he had gone I fondly stooped and kissed Plury s tin remains ON CHAIRS AND OFF Illustration AS a person who frequently sits I should like to know why there are so many uncomfortable chairs Why is it that people who are apparently mild and kind hearted will foster in their homes at their very firesides chairs of the most insidious cruelty Why will dear old ladies cherish these household monsters festooning them with ribbons and fancywork Of course I realize that every chair represents some furniture maker s theory of beauty and comfort that every lump ridge and crook is supposed to have its aesthetic or anatomic reason what I object to is being tortured for heresy just because I am physically unable to agree with these theories An innocent looking willow rocker that stands invitingly on my aunt s veranda is built on the assumption that the human back is in the shape of an S Perhaps the Apollo Belvedere may have a back like that but not I Mine sitting in that rocker feels more like the Dying Gladiator s I am fond of Nature and I have the greatest respect for her but my joy in things sylvan does not extend to rustic chairs As parlor editions of the woodpile they are certainly ingenious but their surface which resembles that of a corduroy road is hardly adapted to sitting purposes Then too there are always a few nails in evidence And I can never resist picking at the loose shreds of bark on the arms with the result that before I know it I am sure to skin quite a large place and then feel mortified The city cousin of the rustic chair is the high backed carved seat This has a lion s head that catches you at the nape of the neck and a couple of scrolls for your shoulder blades The seat itself is a huge slab of wood that feels like adamant This chair looks best against the wall and the fact that it weighs about fifty pounds is one reason why it generally stays there Another massive chair is the Morris It indeed took the imagination of a poet to conceive of sitting on a folding bed that was only half folded When I get into one of these contrivances its bedlike quality makes me so drowsy that I almost fall asleep yet its chair like quality keeps me awake with the result that I remain in a semi comatose condition from which I rouse myself occasionally to climb out and shift the rod to another notch A variety that is not to be relied on much less sat on is the loop the loop species which is found in cheap restaurants and at amateur theatricals This consists of a four legged tambourine backed by two loops of wood the outer one in the shape of a Moorish arch and the inner one in the shape of a tennis racket Exactly half of these chairs in existence have racks under them to hold your hat and gloves whereas the other half have no such racks so that exactly half the times I sit on one of these chairs and put my hat and gloves under the seat those articles fall disconcertingly to the floor A kind of rocker much in vogue is a medley of young banisters a sort of improvisation on a turning lathe When new this chair emits a peculiar creaking sound In the course of a few weeks it loosens up till quite supple so that in rocking the various rods perform a complicated piston motion This process continues till gradually the chair reaches the stage where at every rock it comes apart and puts itself together again or almost together Best parlor chairs run to extremes of fatness and leanness They are either pampered slender gilded things mere wisps of chairs that offer a most precarious support or fat puffy tufted affairs satin feather beds on sticks no not feather beds either for they have twanging springs that tune up every time you sit on them The colors of this latter variety may be endured in winter but when summer comes it is necessary to suppress them with linen slips One interesting species the elevated rocker is nearly extinct This curious chair able to skid on rollers like any other has a little rocking department upstairs so that it can wobble to and fro on its track without doing the least harm in the world I could speak of the personal idiosyncrasies of chairs such as the trick some of them have of shedding their castors at the slightest provocation I could tell of the rocker that insisted on sidling away from a reading lamp or the chair that while not supposed to be a rocker at all teetered diagonally on its northeast and southwest legs but the chair I am now sitting on has given me such a cramp that I shall have to get up and take a walk MINIMS THE NIGHT OF THE FLEECE Wimley was the mildest man living 
8307-120456-0000	train-other-500	Consequently when Molly said in her most decisive tone Nonsense I won t hear of your going back tonight before you ve even seen our new tennis court he realized that he would have to stay over the week end
8307-120456-0001	train-other-500	Not that he didn t want to in one way for he liked Molly and admired the way she bossed the servants and ran the house for her mother Then too the weather which seemed to be growing hotter every minute
8307-120456-0002	train-other-500	would be far more endurable out here in Avondale Manor than in the city What troubled him was the fact that he had not brought a handbag I ll lend you some of Father s things she went on It will be no bother at all
8307-120456-0003	train-other-500	When the evening drew to a close and bed ward migration began he was shown to the guest room I hope you will find everything all right said his hostess as she bid him good night He replied
8307-120456-0004	train-other-500	that he was sure he would Then he opened the door The heat met him like a solid wall Throwing off his coat he went to the two windows to see if they could really be open
none	none	 Yes they were 
8307-120456-0005	train-other-500	but the thick fly screening kept out any air that might have desired to enter He glanced at the bed There was something blue and white lying folded on it As he drew nearer
8307-120456-0006	train-other-500	he could see that this something was fuzzy Picking it up he discovered it to be a pair of woolen pajamas Horrors Not even in the bitterest winter could his skin endure the feel of wool
8307-120456-0007	train-other-500	He wondered if Molly s father ever really wore such things Perhaps his wife had given them to him and perhaps that was why the old gentleman was staying so long in South America
none	none	 Midnight found Wimley still looking the pajamas squarely in the fuzz 
8307-120456-0008	train-other-500	An awful thought was in his mind What would Molly and her mother think of him if they found them unrumpled and therefore unused He slid one leg into the proper section
8307-120456-0009	train-other-500	the flannel drew like a mild mustard plaster Then he pulled on the other he was engulfed A hippopotamus would have felt comfortable in them at the north pole
8307-120456-0010	train-other-500	He drew the fuzzy cord several feet before he tied it then put on the ulster It had a huge pocket capable of containing a tablecloth that hung over the spot where his appendix would have been
8307-120456-0011	train-other-500	if he had been internally left handed Noting that his feet had disappeared he turned up the bottoms of the trousers four times so that each ankle was neatly encircled with a doughnut shaped buffer Then
8307-120456-0012	train-other-500	after throwing back all the covers he snapped out the light and got into bed It had one of those patent soft mattresses that sinking in hold the body in bas relief He rolled and floundered on the thing
8307-120456-0013	train-other-500	but at every flounder he sank deeper It was a quicksand of a bed He recalled Victor Hugo s account of the unfortunate traveler who perished in just such a way
8307-120456-0014	train-other-500	how first his feet disappeared then his knees then his waist till at last there was nothing but a waving hand and then that went He was just preparing to wave
8307-120456-0015	train-other-500	when his attention was distracted by the realization that his whole body was tingling with the heat He seized the jacket by the middle button and pumped it in and out trying to pump in some cool air There was none to pump
8307-120456-0016	train-other-500	Gasping for breath he crawled to a window Still no air He decided to remove the fly screening There was a little groove in the side of the frame where you were supposed to put in your fingers and pull
8307-120456-0017	train-other-500	He put in his fingers and pulled Nothing happened Then he did so again considerably harder and the screen went sailing out of the window
8307-120456-0018	train-other-500	He leaned out just in time to see it crash upon a row of potted plants His heart stood still Had any one heard the noise He listened for several minutes in agonizing suspense
8307-120456-0019	train-other-500	Here at the window it was a little cooler than in the bed Why not emulate the Japanese and sleep on the floor Splendid No more squashy clinging mattress for him
8307-120456-0020	train-other-500	Fetching a pillow he stretched out in true oriental style Quite right the floor did not sink or yield in any manner It even gave prominence to certain bony places which the bed had kindly overlooked
8307-120456-0021	train-other-500	Resisting the thick woolen anklets it complicated the disposal of his lower limbs Finally however a gentle sleep slid into his soul
8307-120456-0022	train-other-500	But about an hour later the slippery thing slid out again at the mere announcement by a rooster that dawn had arrived Other roosters wishing to remove all doubts on the subject
8307-120456-0023	train-other-500	repeated with emphasis that joyous day was at hand Then a large fly buzzed in through the window to say good morning It perched sociably on his left temple
none	none	 and began rubbing its two front legs together in a jovial manner 
8307-120456-0024	train-other-500	But Wimley was in no mood for holding a levee He brushed the fly away It executed a boomerang trajectory lit again on the same spot and began rubbing its legs as before He brushed it away again
8307-120456-0025	train-other-500	It perched again in exactly the same spot He was indignant was he to be at the mercy of a miserable little fly It seemed he was He got up and paced the floor
8307-120456-0026	train-other-500	Happening to catch a glimpse of his face in the mirror he beheld a flourishing crop of black bristles His whiskers stood ready to be harvested and his faithful razor was fifty miles away Panic seized him
8307-120456-0027	train-other-500	He thought of the window screen catastrophe of the quicksand bed of the hard floor his heart sank But when he thought of a day in those whiskers another night in those pajamas
8307-120456-0028	train-other-500	and then tomorrow s whiskers he felt that instant flight was the only thing possible Hastily he pulled on his clothes which felt sticky and moldy and spoke eloquently of yesterday s dust and heat
8307-120456-0029	train-other-500	Then he opened the door and peered out into the hall No one was in sight but other doors were open and out of one of these came a rumbling snore Could it be Molly s
8307-120456-0030	train-other-500	This ominous sound was more than he could bear he retreated Back in the room once more he tiptoed over to the screenless window to see what his chances would be in that quarter Ah
8307-120456-0031	train-other-500	there close by was a vine covered trellis that reached down to the ground With palpitating heart he swung himself over to it It oscillated slightly as it received his weight
8307-120456-0032	train-other-500	The thorny crimson rambler was decidedly cloying He no sooner succeeded in detaching himself from one twig than two more just like it whipped out and hooked him He reached down with his right foot
8307-120456-0033	train-other-500	down down where the devil was that next cross piece At last he found it together with about a dozen new thorns But when he started to bring down his left foot
none	none	 the twigs from above insisted on escorting him to the lower perch so that he was now in the clutches of the thorns of both levels His coat tails had soared to the middle of his back and his side pockets were nestling under his armpits The air was full of perfume and profanity Illustration The air was full of perfume and profanity All at once there was a crack 
8307-120456-0034	train-other-500	and a tear and something gave way The next instant he and the vine were descending rapidly in each other s embrace A clump of lofty hollyhocks suffered martyrdom in breaking his fall
8307-120456-0035	train-other-500	They gave their sap to save him and complete the ruin of his clothes Disentangling himself from the wreckage he dashed off down the nearest path
8307-120456-0036	train-other-500	under arbors and pergolas around sun dials and summer houses past marble seats with mottos that spoke of rest till
none	none	 just as he thought he had reached the edge of the labyrinth 
8307-120456-0037	train-other-500	he found himself at the end of a blind alley In front of him was a dribbling fountain a vapid faced female clad in dew and idiotically pouring water out of a parlor ornament
8307-120456-0038	train-other-500	On the pedestal was carved A garden is a lovesome spot God wot A brown measuring worm was measuring the lady for garments she needed but would never wear
8307-120456-0039	train-other-500	And the water dribbled and dribbled But Wimley wasn t thirsty Striding over a row of conch shells and broad jumping a plot of geraniums
8307-120456-0040	train-other-500	he made for a six foot hedge that appeared to be the boundary of the garden A desperate spring followed by a frantic scramble brought him to the top of it He wriggled there like a bareback rider on a bucking porcupine
none	none	 Ping 
8307-120456-0041	train-other-500	sounded a tennis racket close beside him Lifting his face from the foliage he beheld Molly enjoying an early morning game with her thirteen year old brother My advantage

8307-120457-0009	train-other-500	Be kind to Black Jitney Never scratch him or bend him The chubby little fellows grew so fond of me
none	none	 that before long they would trot sturdily beside me Their mother however 
8307-120457-0010	train-other-500	was a cold imperious woman She cared nothing for the feelings of a ford She would drive me at a heartless pace till my radiator was parched with thirst and my gears fairly cried out for oil Speed was her one desire
8307-120457-0011	train-other-500	and naturally I could not satisfy her Even when I ran so fast that the effort made me shake from top to tires and I was in danger of losing my lamps she would call me ice wagon and rattle trap
8307-120457-0012	train-other-500	and other cruel names and refer unkindly to the fact that she could count the palings of the fences that we passed Finally this hard hearted woman prevailed upon her husband to sell me
8307-120457-0013	train-other-500	and buy a big sixteen cylinder Pope Gregory This car as I afterward learned was so vicious that the very first time she took it out for an airing it assaulted three helpless chickens and a pig
8307-120457-0014	train-other-500	My next master was a young man whose private life was such as no well brought up automobile could have approved of Every evening after he had kept me in the garage all day long fuming with impatience and spilled gasolene
8307-120457-0015	train-other-500	he would make me carry him for hours and hours with some young woman who ought to have known better What sights and sounds I had to endure I who had always kept the strictest decorum Worst of all
8307-120457-0016	train-other-500	his deplorable conduct began to affect me I found myself thinking thoughts which I had never permitted to enter my mind before and looking with more interest than I should at seductive satin trimmed limousines
8307-120457-0017	train-other-500	My morality was in danger of skidding One evening while my master was dining with a young woman at a roadside inn I was left to wait in the adjoining garage But I was not alone
none	none	 for close beside me stood a little French landaulet 
8307-120457-0018	train-other-500	the most immorally alluring car I had ever seen Her lines were exquisitely shapely she was a goddess on wheels Good evening she sparked enticingly
8307-120457-0019	train-other-500	Aren t you the car that stood next to me at the country club last Thursday night There was a daredevil gleam in her lamps which set my carbureter a splutter
none	none	 Yes I answered 
8307-120457-0020	train-other-500	infatuated I knew you even though you tried to hide your name Wasn t it lovely just us two in the moonlight touching tires A quiver ran through me
8307-120457-0021	train-other-500	I knew that unless I could back out in a hurry I was lost I tried hastily to reverse she had me completely short circuited Heaven knows what might have happened had not my master entered at that moment and saved me
8307-120457-0022	train-other-500	The instant he laid hold of my crank I gave vent to my pent up emotions in a way that nearly burst my muffler and when he pressed down the pedal I fairly leaped through the door in flight As it was
8307-120457-0023	train-other-500	I was seething with nervousness My motor throbbed so violently that I could hardly hold still while the young woman climbed into her seat Off we sped down a dark and narrow road
none	none	 I had no control over myself and neither did the people I was carrying seem to have control over me 
8307-120457-0024	train-other-500	or over themselves All at once my left fore tire exploded violently veering me aside into a mile post My master and the young woman landed in a clump of bushes but I was maimed for life
8307-120457-0025	train-other-500	Bad example and bad association had ruined me Many an innocent unsophisticated car is thus driven to destruction all because its owner fails to live up to his moral responsibility
8307-120457-0026	train-other-500	I lay there all the rest of the night while my gasolene ebbed away drop by drop In the morning
none	none	 some men came out from the city and dragged me in They performed a most painful operation on me amputating various shattered members 
8307-120457-0027	train-other-500	and grafting on several feet of tin Then before I was really convalescent I was sold to a new master This person was a harsh speaking unfeeling man who cared for nothing but money
8307-120457-0028	train-other-500	He drove up and down the streets all day inviting people to get in and ride and when they did get in he forced each one of them to surrender a nickel He was very cruel to me
8307-120457-0029	train-other-500	Instead of showing any consideration for my broken health he would say openly Well I ll get what use I can out of this one and then buy another Not once did he ever throw a blanket over my hood in cold weather
8307-120457-0030	train-other-500	or steady my slipping wheels with chains
none	none	 He was so penurious that whenever he drove me through a crowded street 
8307-120457-0031	train-other-500	he would shut off my gasolene
none	none	 and make me run on what I could breathe in from the exhausts of other cars Wretched indeed is the old age of an automobile Bereft of the beauty it had when it was a new model 
8307-120457-0032	train-other-500	it declines into squalid neglect No amount of painting and enameling can restore its youthful bloom One day this master was driving me through an amusement park when I broke down completely He got out
8307-120457-0033	train-other-500	and prodded me brutally in the magneto
none	none	 I had not the strength 
8307-120457-0034	train-other-500	to budge He grew very angry and the people in the tonneau demanded their money back A crowd of idlers gathered to witness my humiliation Becoming purple in the face my master nearly
none	none	 twisted my crank off He heaped upon me the most insulting and 
8307-120457-0035	train-other-500	unjust imprecations as though it were my fault that my health was gone even making distressing insinuations as to my ancestry Words failing him
none	none	 he fell to belaboring me with a hammer and monkey wrench The spectators looked on with indifference Some of them even urged him maliciously to the attack 
8307-120457-0036	train-other-500	I d sell the thing for fifty cents he exclaimed with a shocking oath Suddenly an elderly kindly faced man pushed his way forward through the crowd I ll give you that for it he said Only stop battering it
none	none	 My master left off hitting me He looked surlily at the speaker and then at the crowd You can have it he said between his teeth Hot tears of gratitude dropped from my cylinders as my deliverer pushed me to his nearby home 
8307-120457-0037	train-other-500	From that moment to this I have never known anything but happiness For my dear old master is a retired gas fitter whose hobby is landscape gardening Relieving me of my tired wheels
8307-120457-0038	train-other-500	he has pastured me in the center of his front yard and planted me full of geraniums I am lovingly taken care of
none	none	 My kind master waters me regularly and curries me with a trowel My working days are over But what makes me happiest is the knowledge that I can never be sold LIGHT BREAKFAST Illustration Henry dear said missus Brush gently without raising her pretty head from the pillow 
8307-120458-0000	train-other-500	it s nearly half past eight What exclaimed her husband sitting up vehemently and staring at the clock Where is Maria She s supposed to be here by seven isn t she Perhaps she didn t come today
8307-120458-0001	train-other-500	That good for nothing darky
none	none	 I ll go and investigate 
8307-120458-0002	train-other-500	Plunging energetically into his bath robe and slippers he sallied forth on a tour of the apartment
none	none	 No Maria sweeping in the hall 
8307-120458-0003	train-other-500	no Maria straightening up the living room or library no Maria dusting in the dining room no Maria preparing breakfast in the kitchen How provoking sighed missus Brush
8307-120458-0004	train-other-500	Provoking I call it outrageous Yes I m sorry dear that this will make you late to your office Oh I m not bothered about that for I ve just put through some new efficiency systems
none	none	 which enable me to accomplish a tremendous amount of work in a very short time 
8307-120458-0005	train-other-500	What I can t stand is having that darky impose on us But dearest maybe she s sick Then she could have sent us word by telephone No
8307-120458-0006	train-other-500	she s taking advantage of the fact that you are young and inexperienced But she ll be sorry for it I ll discharge her myself Now please don t get excited dear If you discharged her
8307-120458-0007	train-other-500	it might be days and days before we could get another That wouldn t make any difference We d simply take our meals out Except breakfast of course I d get that You
none	none	 Yes We ll start this morning 
8307-120458-0008	train-other-500	If you ll attend to the dusting later in the day I mean I ll bring you your coffee before you get up just as you re used to having it But Henry It won t be any trouble at all Nothing is
8307-120458-0009	train-other-500	no matter how unfamiliar it may be to you if you go at it intelligently scientifically
none	none	 When mister Brush was obsessed with an idea 
8307-120458-0010	train-other-500	it was useless to oppose him The best policy was to let it take its course
none	none	 As I have often told you he continued housekeeping could be greatly simplified if you women would only Seeing that he was about to launch into a homily on efficiency such as she had heard him deliver at least twenty times in the three months she had been married to him she said If you re going to get breakfast hadn t you better hurry and take your bath That s so he admitted Shuffling briskly to the bathroom he was soon foaming at the mouth with tooth paste There was a loud buzzing sound from the direction of the kitchen Henry called missus Brush there goes the dumb waiter Shall I answer it No I ll ho he replied pastily out of the corner of his mouth Still busily agitating his tooth brush so as not to waste any time he paddled to the dumb waiter and called He o Whash you wa Garbage replied a gruff voice A rattling of ropes announced that the car was on its way 
8307-120458-0011	train-other-500	mister Brush opened the sanitary garbage closet and screwing up his face and tooth brush seized something that was mighty unlike a rose
8307-120458-0012	train-other-500	He held the pail out at arm s length as he carried it to the dumb waiter
none	none	 Buzz buzz buzz went the buzzer Huh 
8307-120458-0013	train-other-500	gurgled mister Brush nervously swallowing a generous amount of tooth paste
none	none	 Garbage 
8307-120458-0014	train-other-500	repeated the voice mister Brush looked helplessly at the can on the dumb waiter and then at his incapacitated hands Put your garbage on roared the voice mister Brush sputtered
8307-120458-0015	train-other-500	then extracting the tooth brush with the fourth and fifth knuckles of his left hand he shouted back indignantly I id Then why didn t you say so And down went the dumb waiter with a jerk
8307-120458-0016	train-other-500	mister Brush returned to the bathroom As he was in the midst of shaving the buzzer sounded again This time he was on the alert and ready for any argument Leaving his razor but not his lather
8307-120458-0017	train-other-500	he hurried back to the kitchen in a combative mood
none	none	 What do you want he yelled defiantly as he opened the door of the dumb waiter 
8307-120458-0018	train-other-500	There was no answer but facing him on the shelf of the car stood his empty pail silent stolid indifferent to his bravado He snatched it off
8307-120458-0019	train-other-500	and returned to his ablutions On account of the extreme lateness of the hour he decided to finish off with a quick shower bath first hot and then cold Just as he removed his last garment
8307-120458-0020	train-other-500	the buzzer sounded again Aw go ahead and buzz he said between his teeth As he stepped into the hot downpour the door bell rang Whoever that is can wait
8307-120458-0021	train-other-500	But apparently the person in question had no desire to do so for the bell sounded again and again To complete the symphony the telephone chimed in with its merry tune Gwendolyn
8307-120458-0022	train-other-500	called mister Brush distractedly amid the roar of waters But she having fallen into a pleasant doze while waiting for her breakfast did not hear him The bells and buzzer had by this time settled into a sustained chord
8307-120458-0023	train-other-500	like that of the whistles at New year s Bounding out of the tub to the mat mister Brush wrapped his form which still glistened with pearly drops in his bath robe and slip slopped frigidly down the hall
8307-120458-0024	train-other-500	Hello he cried snatching off the telephone receiver No this is not Schmittberger the butcher Then he darted to the front door Opening it he found the postman waiting with a letter
8307-120458-0025	train-other-500	Two cents due please The buzzer continued its heavy droning and the telephone started up again Two cents two cents repeated mister Brush in befuddlement The postman stared
8307-120458-0026	train-other-500	Two cents yes two cents reiterated mister Brush groping immodestly for pockets where there were none You said that before Oh excuse me I ll get it right off Now
none	none	 where did I put that purse 
8307-120458-0027	train-other-500	Let me think But thinking in the neighborhood of that telephone was an impossibility He would have to quiet the thing So clapping the receiver to his ear he protested Hello hello
8307-120458-0028	train-other-500	Will you kindly give me Schmittberger s butcher shop Good grief he exclaimed letting the receiver fall It swung by its tail pendulum wise barking infuriated clicks
8307-120458-0029	train-other-500	mister Brush staggered to the bedroom With reeling brain he ransacked all his chiffonier drawers for the purse which was lying in plain view on top By the time he had discovered it and started back to the door
8307-120458-0030	train-other-500	the buzzer in the kitchen was having delirium tremens Floundering to the spot he gasped What do you want Ice was the husky reply All right I ll send it down No
8307-120458-0031	train-other-500	I mean you send it up As the dumb waiter rose the temperature fell and mister Brush soon found himself in the presence of a beautiful blue berg With chattering teeth he reached forward and drew it to him
8307-120458-0032	train-other-500	The door of the dumb waiter closed automatically and he was left alone in the kitchen with the iceberg in his arms How to open the ice box was a problem After attempting unsuccessfully to cajole the catch
8307-120458-0033	train-other-500	by fondling it with the corner of the berg he tried nudging it with his elbow It would not take the hint Indeed it refused utterly to move until he got down on his knees before it and rubbed it with his shoulder Finally however
8307-120458-0034	train-other-500	the door opened disclosing a rival berg attended by a throng of bottles siphons and butter crocks A cold inhospitable crowd they were resenting any intrusion
8307-120458-0035	train-other-500	Thus rebuffed mister Brush who felt as though he were being frozen and cauterized at the same time deposited the berg upon the cover of the wash tubs It coasted forward threatening an avalanche
8307-120458-0036	train-other-500	Clutching it at the brink he paused and wondered what he would do next The door bell saved him the trouble of deciding He had entirely forgotten the postman Setting the berg upon a chair
8307-120458-0037	train-other-500	he scurried out and offered him a dollar bill chattering apologies for the delay Haven t you anything smaller
none	none	 asked the postman impatiently N no I d don t think so 
8307-120458-0038	train-other-500	Then why did you keep me here all this time I ll have to come back later He started off Stop
none	none	 Wait a moment I d 
8307-120458-0039	train-other-500	rather make you a present of the ninety eight cents Oh glory that ll have to be gone through with all over again Discouraged and shivering he leaned against the side of the doorway In so doing
8307-120458-0040	train-other-500	his eye fell upon a collection of objects that had been deposited in front of the sill the morning newspaper a bottle of milk one of cream and a bag containing a long loaf of bread He stooped over and gathered them up carefully one by one
none	none	 Just as he had stowed away the newspaper under one arm 
8307-120458-0041	train-other-500	and gripped the bag with his left hand and the two bottles with his right the chilliness in him culminated in a sneeze and everything fell Both bottles smashed Landing just on the sill
8307-120458-0042	train-other-500	they distributed their contents impartially outside and inside
none	none	 Finding that the proportion of the flood that the bread and the newspaper were able to sop up was small 
8307-120458-0043	train-other-500	though they did what they could mister Brush hastily procured a bucket and rag from the kitchen where the ice was indulging in a flood of its own and set to work mopping As he sprawled out into the hallway
8307-120458-0044	train-other-500	gingerly squeezing out ragfuls of cream and broken glass the door opposite was opened and a handsome woman appeared attired in fashionable street dress She looked him straight in the eye mister Brush clasped his bath robe to him
8307-120458-0045	train-other-500	made a frenzied recoil slammed the door and collapsed into the pool of milk Henry dear is breakfast nearly ready called his loving wife Enraged and dripping
8307-120458-0046	train-other-500	he leaped up with sudden strength and started for the bedroom spluttering incoherent expostulations as he went At that moment there was heard the sound of a latch key and a grinning black face appeared
8307-120458-0047	train-other-500	Good mawnin sah Somefin seems to be spilt heah Fetching a large cloth she set to work with easy dexterity mister Brush fascinated watched the lake disappear
none	none	 You bes get dress sah 
8307-120458-0048	train-other-500	Ah ll have yo breakfas ready in a couple o minutes Thank Heaven you re here Maria he said fervently
none	none	 I was almost afraid you weren t coming THE MAN OPPOSITE Mildred congratulated herself on having conquered her timidity She had come all the way down town by herself had looked through several stores until she found just the curtains she wanted and now ready to return home she got on the bus as calmly as though she had been a New Yorker and a married woman all her life It being the rush hour of the afternoon the conveyance was quite crowded Mildred thought at first that she would have to sit on the backward facing bench up front which she disliked but luckily she found a place on one of the seats opposite it A moment later even the less desirable bench was occupied The person who took the place on it directly facing her was a tall dark man of about forty with piercing black eyes and an aquiline nose Mildred kept encountering his glance There was something about it that disturbed her She flushed a little His face seemed vaguely uncomfortably familiar Where had she seen him before She was sure he wasn t anyone who had waited on her in a shop nor any of the tradesmen who came to the door of her apartment he looked too much the man of the world for that Neither was he one of the few friends of her husband whom she had had a chance to meet She could not place him Happiness and the absorption that goes with it had made her oblivious of outside things Whoever he was his glances rendered her more and more ill at ease She looked out of the window she looked up at the advertisements she looked down at her lap No use she could feel his gaze In vain did she reason with herself that he was not staring at her intentionally but was merely directing his eyes straight ahead of him as anyone might do No not even the protecting presence of the other passengers could reassure her She felt almost as though she and the hawk like stranger were alone in the conveyance Several times she thought of getting out and taking another bus But the evening was growing dark and she might have to wait a long while in a part of town she knew nothing about And suppose he should get off after her The blocks seemed hours apart the halts at corners interminable Passengers got out in twos and threes He stayed Looking down at her hands which nervously fingered the chain of her reticule Mildred hoped and prayed he would go But he did not The people who had shared the bench with him had moved to forward facing seats as soon as any were vacant He remained where he was It seemed she had seen that face somewhere behind her following her This recollection threw her into such a fit of trembling that she let fall her handkerchief Before she could recover it he bent forward with a quick swooping motion seized it in his long fingers and held it out to her She took it trembling hardly able to murmur Thank you He appeared about to speak Mildred rose in terror and retreated hastily to a place several seats back across the aisle What would he do Would he follow her Were his eyes still fixed upon her She dared not look but a reflection in the window pane increased her fears Street after street went by The last other passenger got off Still he stayed Mildred s furtive observations via the reflecting window pane never found him looking out to ascertain what part of town it was Gradually she was forced to the sickening conviction that he was watching not for any particular street but to see where she would get off As her corner approached she rang the bell He rose She moved quickly to the door He followed her smiling presumingly As she stepped down from the platform her knees were so weak that she almost fell Her heart pounded Instead of running as her terror prompted her to she could with difficulty maintain a panting walk The man followed not hurrying but relentlessly like an animal that is sure of its prey When she entered the doorway of the apartment house he was barely ten yards behind her She knew he would turn in also He did If only she could get into the elevator and escape before he arrived The car was at one of the upper floors She rang desperately until it appeared The instant the iron door slid back she flung herself in gasping Quick Take me up quickly Yes miss replied the startled but drowsy elevator boy as a tall form passed in after her Mildred shrank into a corner quivering Fou th flo announced the boy She sprang out As she staggered totteringly down the dim corridor she heard the man step out of the car Her latch key Her latch key She fumbled frantically in her handbag then groped for the lock The man drew nearer She was helpless cornered at the end of a dark hallway Almost hysterical she let the key fall and closed her eyes At that moment the door opposite was unlocked briskly and a lusty young voice inside yelled Hello Pappa LUCY THE LITERARY AGENT Illustration I know you will agree with me said Lucy that these stories by Perth Dewar are quite remarkable quite the most distinctive things of the kind that have been done in years and that your readers will like them immensely Ethridge the Editor said nothing It was unwise to contradict her for of all the personal touch literary agents Lucy was the personal touchiest So he let her run on and on trusting that eventually she would run down Also she wasn t bad looking in her aggressive way You ve read them she queried suddenly Why certainly he lied glancing with studied casualness at the Reader s Report slip attached to the blue manuscript cover Ethridge never read anything he could possibly avoid reading He was one of those successful editors who edit by belonging to the best clubs and attending the right teas Mere perusal of manuscripts was not particularly in his line The Report slip said Costume stories of Holland in the seventeenth Century Only moderately well done Not suitable for this magazine Who is this Dewar person anyhow asked Ethridge defensively You mean to say you haven t heard of him Why my dear mister Ethridge Dewar is a man of independent means lives on his estate down in Maryland and writes stories between fox hunts Enormously gifted She failed to add however that Dewar had offered to let her keep any money she received for the stories provided she could get them printed Resting her white elbows on Ethridge s desk and eyeing him with calculating coyness Lucy knew that he had not read the stories She would make him wonder if she knew he hadn t What do you yourself honestly think of them mister Ethridge Candidly now You re always so delightfully frank with me mister Ethridge That s why it s such a pleasure to deal with you How did they strike you Really Miss Leech I don t see how in our magazine we could possibly Now mister Ethridge She held up a reproving finger laughing roguishly But what s the use of our trying to discuss imaginative literature here in your busy office with the telephone ringing every moment or threatening to ring and your discouragingly pretty blonde secretary the minx popping in continually to see if we re behaving Ethridge smiled complacently Why be an ogre I tell you what Let s have supper at my studio this evening continued Lucy It ll be so much more satisfactory to discuss things sensibly without interruption So he did and they did At breakfast it was finally decided that the series by Perth Dewar should consist of ten stories including four still to be written Ethridge salved his conscience by resolving secretly that they should all be published in the back of the book In due course of time the first story appeared It contained a mean reference to the Knights of Pythias or Mormonism or a former Vice President of the United States or something for which reason the issue containing it was suppressed Whereupon the buried issue became a Living Issue The intelligentsia rushed to the rescue with highbrow hue and cry Round robins were circulated Newspaper columnists got sarcastic Liberal cliques chittered Perth Dewar became suddenly significant The issue containing the second story was sold out the day it appeared By the time the third one was out Professor Lion Whelps of Yale proved in an article in the Sunday Times that Dewar s attitude toward women was like Turgeniev s and Professor Brando Methuseleh of Columbia discovered he had cadences Sinclair Lewis inserted a mention of him in the forty ninth edition of Babbitt Nine British novelists hurried over to lecture on him And Ethridge He was made In acknowledgement of his peerless editorial acumen that could discern true genius at a glance the directors of the magazine doubled his salary and gave him a bonus to keep him from being coaxed away by the Saturday Evening Pictorial And Lucy Ethridge married her to keep her quiet THE CREEPING FINGERS Illustration Decorative letter M missus Whoffin s figure resembled that of the punch bowl behind which she was standing it was broad and squat with a slight tapering at the base And her mind was like the punch sweetish and characterless with scrappy rinds of things floating about in it Each guest who presented a cup received the same dipperful and the same set of remarks Good evening I m so glad you could come I just love hearing ghost stories don t you See that log over there She pointed to a huge gray hulk that lay at the side of the open fireplace That s real driftwood and it ought to give just the right kind of light I found it myself on the beach and had the gardener bring it home in a wheelbarrow Look it s all honeycombed with age A tall serious looking young man stepped forward and extended his glass He knew that that was the way to please her and she was the woman who he hoped and feared would be his mother in law She beamed Do have another mister Carson He did for he was in a desperate mood He was to leave for the city on the early morning train and this evening would be his last chance to propose to Polly for several months Somehow despite his best efforts the psychological moment had never arrived Just then Polly sailed into the room fresh and rosy in a flutter of white muslin He put down the glass and hurried over to her Good evening Polly he said in an ardent undertone Couldn t you slip away from this crowd and take a stroll on the beach No George I m hostess tonight She shook her head including some airy little curls which seemed to make light of her refusal We are all to gather around the hearth and listen to the stories Then she added teasingly Besides it is in your honor that mother is giving this party Yes she s very kind I m sure he said awkwardly Think of all the trouble she has taken over that log Carson faced her with squared jaw Listen to me Polly There is something serious I want to talk to you about Before I leave you I Polly called missus Whoffin isn t it time to begin Perhaps it is she answered innocently What do you think George I think the story telling might as well begin at once he said stiffly A few minutes later all lights were turned out The score of young people had settled themselves about the room in comfortable attitudes some on chairs and sofas some on cushions on the floor while in the midst of them sat the narrator a girl of eighteen who affected a deep morbidity Gazing into the fire she began her tale as though she were in a trance Carson sulkily picked his way after Polly toward a seat beside the hearth Just as he was reaching it he tripped over something bulky Why that s my log exclaimed missus Whoffin from the back of the room Dear dear Why hasn t anyone put it on the fire The story waited while missus Whoffin scurried forward and personally supervised the placing of the log upon the andirons and then sat down beside the hearth opposite Polly Do go on cried several voices You stopped in the most exciting part The narrator looking daggers at missus Whoffin paused long enough to show that she didn t have to go on unless she wanted to and then resumed her tale Suddenly as he lay there in the haunted room on the very bed where the old man had been murdered he felt an invisible hand on the bedclothes missus Whoffin shuddered and a large black ant peered out of a hole in the log to see what was going on Then he felt a second hand more terrifying than the first Beholding his home in flames the ant rushed back indoors to spread the alarm Along the highways of the interior he sped a second Paul Revere rousing the sleeping insects of which there were many Oh groaned missus Whoffin The exodus of Paul s friends proceeded in orderly fashion Larvae and eggs first was their order Carrying their infants upon their backs they filed out of the subway openings in steady processions The hands clutched the covers just above his feet Fear paralyzed him so that he could neither move nor cry out A party of refugees applied to missus Whoffin for shelter She was so absorbed in the story that she did not see them Then the fingers began to creep up and up up and up His flesh tingled with horror missus Whoffin quivered like an aspen leaf She breathed hard her eyes nearly popping Other people began to feel creepy They clutched his knee and missus Whoffin uttered a piercing shriek and clasped her knee with both hands She was invaded Then Polly screamed and Carson began to slap himself on various parts of the anatomy There was a general panic Girls squealed and clambering frantically upon chairs shook out their lifted skirts young men stamped about wildly mashing ants and people s toes in equal numbers missus Whoffin tormented from head to foot galloped in circles moaning Oh mercy Oh mercy Save me George cried Polly clinging to his arm Yes darling he answered fervently If the ants had been raging bulls he would have saved her from them but they were ants and their ways were devious He hesitated slapping himself thoughtfully Turn on the lights yelled some one No Don t screamed half a dozen shrill voices Save me repeated Polly distractedly I can t stand this any longer I ll perish Struck with a swift inspiration he caught her up in his arms and started for the door She made no resistance Out of the room he carried her then through the front hall and down the front steps Half way down the walk she asked Where are you taking me To the ocean Why you clever boy People sitting on the verandas of neighboring cottages saw in he moonlight a sight that electrified them with horror A powerful looking maniac with a helpless woman in his arms strode across the beach and began to wade out into the water Hoping to save her they ran to the shore and put out in boats and canoes Oh sighed the victim blissfully as Carson let her down into the water it feels so cool and quiet Polly George Row harder Doctor cried the steersman of the nearest boat He s trying to strangle her THE MAN WITH THE HOSE A feeling of elation is like a feeling of alcohol Under its stimulus a person may do the most brilliant things and also the most grotesque It was just this feeling that took hold of Jack Carrington when the senior member of the firm invited him to dine at his apartment on the following evening and meet missus Stockbridge and my daughter During all the rest of the day the young college man learning how to work in an office fairly walked on air and that night in his hall bedroom he went through a sort of dress rehearsal of the role he hoped to play on the great occasion resuscitating and donning his evening clothes to make sure that they looked as well as they did when he led the commencement prom six months before and marshaling all the bons mots he could recollect in order that his supply of extempore witticisms might be adequate Still buoyed up by this feeling of elation Carrington presented himself next evening at the door of the sumptuous apartment house where the boss lived gave his name to one of the liveried grandees in attendance and was shown up to E four a gorgeous duplex suite half as large as a house and renting for twice as much Everything went off splendidly The boss unbent to a surprising degree missus Stockbridge was most cordial and the daughter proved to be a fascinator What was more Carrington surpassed himself as a social light He told several funny stories with considerable eclat and inspired by the thrill of the occasion even thought up one or two original ones that surprised him as much as they impressed his hosts When later in the evening he played bridge as the daughter s partner he had a rush of hearts and aces to the hand He made slams big and little at such a rate that Miss Stockbridge complimented him upon his skill Consequently when after two victorious rubbers he bid his hosts good night and noted from their effusiveness that he had made a very favorable impression it was no wonder that he already pictured himself a member of the firm and the boss s son in law As the door of the apartment closed behind him he heaved a sigh of triumph He felt like shouting or doing something violent Tingling with pride he strutted down the hallway toward the elevator A shining brass fire nozzle jutting out provokingly from a coil of hose attracted his attention It looked so like the head of some absurd animal that he couldn t help poking his finger into its mouth as he went by His finger stuck Facing the nozzle squarely and taking hold of it with his free left hand he pulled more carefully Still it stuck The finger was beginning to swell and turn red He tugged it harder with no result Concluding that lubrication was necessary he leaned over and licked it acquiring a strong brass taste upon his tongue Then he pulled hard More swelling By this time he was in a perspiration of misery He paused and tried to think clearly but his mind which had scintillated all evening was now a blur His first lucid thought was that he must unscrew the nozzle from the hose Why of course How simple But when he tried turning the coupling of the hose the nozzle insisted on turning with it and his imprisoned finger was averse to revolving Lapsing again into rueful speculation he tried desperately to devise some means of regaining his liberty Why not go ring the elevator bell No that was around the bend of the corridor and his tether probably would not reach that far and besides it would be awful to have to explain his plight to a liveried dignitary like the one who had convoyed him up And suppose the elevator should arrive full of plutocrats coming home from the opera or high strung women who would shriek when they saw him with the fire hose No that could never be risked He must think of something else A little olive oil would probably do the trick but how could he get it If he had thought of that at first and gone right back and asked for it it wouldn t have been so bad but now after nearly half an hour his hosts were probably in bed No it was too late to ring their door bell now Suddenly an ingenious idea occurred to him he would turn on the water and squirt his finger out Splendid He reached up and turned the wheel It made a mournful creaking sound but no water came through the coil of hose It must be shut off downstairs he thought Thanks to the incessant sting of his finger and the maddening exasperation of the predicament he was in Carrington was nearly frantic Oh he exclaimed I ll have to disturb them for that oil sooner or later so I d better do it right off With that he started for the boss s door trailing the hose after him His heart thumped as he rang the bell Standing in close to the wall he kept the nozzle behind his back thinking it better to explain before displaying his appendage There was a sound of slippered feet and from the opposite direction a sound of slipping hose The door was unlocked and the remainder of the canvas and rubber coil that had kept back the water unrolled down upon the floor Who s there growled mister Stockbridge arrayed in a bath robe and squinting out into the dimly lighted corridor without his glasses Mortification seemed to paralyze Carrington s speech Bringing the nozzle forward abjectly so that mister Stockbridge could see his plight he faltered I At that moment his finger was shot like a bullet from a gun and the ensuing stream of water caught mister Stockbridge squarely in the throat Simultaneously a supreme inspiration came to Carrington I m a fireman he cried in a disguised voice Wake your family at once Whereupon as mister Stockbridge rushed back into the apartment Carrington dropping the hose made a thrilling rescue of himself down the stairway and darted into the street before the drowsy dignitary in the vestibule could raise his head JANGLES THOSE SYMPHONY CONCERT PROGRAMS METROPOLITAN SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA OTTO CULMBACHER Conductor FELICE ELEFANTINE Soloiste of the evening I GASTRONOMIC SYMPHONY Kovik Bordunov a Allegretti b Pistachio c Chianti d Risotto con aglio II LARGHETTO Culmbacher III ARIA FROM IL CAMPANILE Gondola SIGNORINA ELEFANTINE The Hardwood Piano is used CRITICAL COMMENTS ON THE NUMBERS I Gastronomic Symphony It is not certain when Ptior Kovik Bordunov was born His parents being thrifty peasants put him in a basket and left him on the steppes of Russia Adopted by a Russian Princess named Caviar Vodka he was raised as if he had been her own dog His early musical inclination was so pronounced that he was sent to the Warsaw Conservatory where he served three terms Soon after being released from this institution he wrote Samovar the opera that made him famous Samovar so pleased the Czar that young Bordunov was given a pension and a bath But alas either his sudden success or the bath so affected his mind that from that time on the authorities were obliged to keep him in confinement The above symphony was written on the walls of his cell from which it was transcribed after his suicide It depicts the blight of all his hopes the sorrows of Russia the drowning of his fiancee the height of the steppes and the agonies of indigestion The Allegretti opens with an arabesque tone poem of somber sweetness under which strange and varied delights are hidden Then comes the minor Pistachio weirdly oriental in color This is followed by the tempestuous and maddening Chianti Last of all comes the terrible Risotto con aglio Here we have an example of the insight of genius By itself the Risotto con aglio would be almost mild but coming as it does on top of the Allegretti the Pistachio and the Chianti it is bound to produce a truly tragic finale II Larghetto This etude is by the conductor He thought this would be a good place to work it in the orchestra and audience being powerless to restrain him Herr Otto Fedor Ivan Culmbacher was born of noble parents in Hofbraeu Silesia He was discovered and imported to America by the brilliant patronesses of the Metropolitan Symphony Society A larghetto is a little largo one without a handel A composer writes a larghetto when he feels something like writing a largo but isn t on the whole quite up to it III Aria from Il Campanile This opera though well known in Budapest and South America is practically unknown in the United States The aria O belli spaghetti is so vocally exacting that to sing its bird like notes a prima donna should diet for weeks on bird seed Here are the words which are repeated fourteen times in the course of the aria THE ITALIAN THE TRANSLATION O belli spaghetti Had I the wings of a dove O bianchi confetti I would fly I would fly to my love Bananni bananni I would fly I would fly E tutti frutti Through the sky through the sky O bianchi confetti I would fly I would fly to my love She waddles off HOW TO KNOW THE INSTRUMENTS Editor s Note The following observations if carefully studied will enable the intelligent concertgoer to tell the difference between an orchestra and a dress circle The principal instrument in music is the violin This instrument is held fast under the performer s double chin and then tickled in the gut with a strand of horse hair until it cries out Which cruel treatment reacts on its disposition so that as the little violin grows up into a cello it becomes gloomy and morose and when after a life of nagging it reaches old age as a crabbed double bass and is relegated to the back of the orchestra it spends its resentment in querulous grumbling Further from the conductor than the violins and consequently more intermittent in their playing are the Tootle family Grandfather Tootle the bassoon spends his time in dozing all you can hear from him is an occasional snore missus Tootle the flute is of a romantic turn of mind doting on moonlight and warbling birds and babbling brooks She prides herself on her limpid utterance and admonishes her little son Piccolo not to talk through his nose like Cousin Oboe Tootle Her husband the bass clarinet takes himself very seriously and no wonder for to him falls the unpleasant duty of announcing bad news such as that the hero has just died or that the act is only half over Quite remote from the conductor are the mysterious somethings that live in kettle drums What they are no one knows but a watchful keeper bends over and listens to them and whenever despite his constant cork screwing they show signs of aggressiveness he beats them into submission with a brace of bottle mops If this is not sufficient he calls in an assistant who cows them with the roar of a whanging Chinese stewpan Somewhat nearer the conductor but yet far enough away to be able to resist his authority until threatened with his stick are the horns the most vehement members of the orchestra A blast from them besides waking up the audience always means something For example the martial sound of a trumpet heralds the approach of a conqueror or a scissors grinder The old fashioned hunting horn from which the modern orchestral horn is descended was very simple indeed In those days every one was supposed to wind his horn instead of buying it already wound as we do now Yet the modern pretzelized horn is still adapted for hunting purposes Take as large a horn as you can conveniently carry a forty two centimetre tuba is preferable and stand under a tree with the muzzle pointing up at the bird you desire to hunt Then play Silver Threads Among the Gold for two hours and ten minutes and the bird will fall lifeless into the horn NOTES ON PIANOS Illustration A piano is an instrument with eighty eight keys and twenty installments You play on the keys and pay on the installments the latter being by far the more difficult performance If you do not play in time you are called down by your critics if you do not pay on time you are called on by your collectors The keys are arranged in two rows short fat blondes in front and tall skinny brunettes behind There are three pedals one for each foot and one for good measure the damper pedal or muffler cut out which puts an end to conversation the sostenuto pedal which helps the piano sustain what it has to sustain and the soft pedal which is seldom used and then only by request There are two kinds of pianos uprights and prostrates Uprights are used in homes where there is standing room only Prostrates are used in concert halls virtuosi prefer them because they can hit a piano much harder when it is down The upright piano is frequently pitched in A flat It remains there till pitched out by the neighbors An advantage that this piano possesses is that it keeps the player s back turned to his hearers which is a great saving to his feelings Another advantage is that the top serves as a mantelpiece annex bric a brac that won t stand heat but will stand noise is put there Anything is appropriate cupids shepherdesses brass bowls painted vases The only requirement for a place on this repository is that the object be able to make some buzzing twanging wheezing or humming sound when the strings are struck Prostrates are built for endurance Their black finish bespeaks the hard life they lead A conflict between one of these indestructible pianos and an irresistible pianist is called a recital A non combatant lifts the lid and the fight begins FIRST ROUND Nocturne Merely warming up SECOND ROUND Etude Livelier but not much heavy hitting THIRD ROUND Scherzo Considerably hotter fighting in close FOURTH ROUND Appassionato Real slugging FIFTH ROUND Rhapsodie Piano receives fearful punishment Knocked out in final cadenza but pianist sprains wrist In learning to play the piano the first thing to acquire is a good touch or tread as it is properly called Unfortunately there is a divergence of opinion among authorities as to what a good tread consists in the famous dictum of Prof Biffski of Moscow Conservatory that you should hammer the hammers being offset by the equally famous assertion of Hieronimus Dudelsack the noted Viennese pedagogue that you should not strike the ivories at all but massage or knead them Herr Dudelsack and his eminent pupils maintain that his tread is the only normal one that it has the naturalness of a cat s walking on the keyboard But the astute Russian insinuates that it produces tangled chords and scales that are short weight But these methods have been rendered obsolete by the heel and toe technique of the playerpiano This wonderful instrument impregnating the feet with melody and rhythm has given rise to the modern dances For a person who makes a habit of playing the pianola simply has to toddle the music out of his ankles Even more remarkable is the way in which the piano footy has simplified musical composition The masters of the past had to toil away painfully with pen and ink whereas the composer of today can attain the same results with a roll of paper and a ticket punch Judging from the progress we have made and are still making it is safe to predict that the composer of the future will use a shotgun THE LIFE DRAMA OF A MUSICAL CRITIC IN FOUR CLIPPINGS I ADOLESCENCE From the Centerville Clarion LOCAL TALENT MAKES SPLENDID SHOWING The concert held last evening in Masonic Hall was a great success It certainly showed what Centerville could do in a musical line From the opening duet played by Miss Violet and Miss Nancy Stubbs to the very end of the program the audience seemed to thoroughly enjoy every number But the feature of the evening was the singing by mister Harry Bowers of Rocked in the Cradle of the Deep This noble song gave the popular young druggist an opportunity to display his remarkable low notes Another person deserving of special mention was Miss Helen Smith who attractively dressed in pink and carrying a bouquet of fresh flowers rendered The Rosary with great effect All in all the concert was a great event and a considerable amount of money was raised toward the new fire engine ABRAHAM LINCOLN SIMPSON Music and Art Critic Illustration II EFFERVESCENCE From the New York Chronicle GOTHAM ORCHESTRA PLAYS SCHNITZEL Warmth of Oriental Color Adolf Schnitzel s symphonic poem Aus Bengalien which was admirably performed last evening by the Gotham Symphony Orchestra shows a masterly understanding of the folk music of India The Bengalese have from the earliest times been noted for their proficience in the arts Their principal instrument is the bimbam an elongated drum played upon with any convenient article such as an elephant s tusk or the bone of an ancestor When struck at one end it emits the sound bim when struck at the other a clear toned bam is produced hence its curious name The following melody known as the War Song of Prince Brahmadan gives one an idea of the capacity of this instrument Bim bim bam bim bam bim The chorus is also characteristic Bim bim At the religious ceremonies of the Bengalese the Futrib or high priest plays upon a peculiar one toned flute producing an effect of awe and mystery as this hymn to the sun god aptly illustrates Too oo t Toot toot a toot toot a toot toot Too oo t With this wealth of material to draw from Schnitzel has constructed a work that is nearly perfect in form Beginning with a soft bim bam bim which is followed by a sinister toot toot he works up to a climax of marvelous contrapuntal ingenuity in which the two themes are combined thus Bim toot bam toot a toot Truly the apotheosis of Bengal A L S III ACQUIESCENCE From the New York Chronicle WASHINGTON REPEATED Last night was a brilliant one at the opera Washington the new American music drama was given for the second time with the same cast as before Among those who attended the performance were missus Pierpont Astorbilt who wore pale nesserole garnished with soufflee mister and missus Plantagenet Carter the latter in an exquisite creation of blanc mange and missus Sibley Harwood Stevens in gray limousine air cooled with insertion missus Reginald Carrington s guests were Lord and Lady Shrewby and the Duc de Vaurien The latter wore a black dress suit and a white shirt missus Gaybird was present for the first time since the death of her husband She wore her skirt at half mast Unsigned IV SENESCENCE Illustration From the New York Evening Spot BASSOON CONCERT A RELIEF FROM MODERNISM BY A LINCOLN SIMPSON New York is suffering from a plethora of concerts The fact that the halls are generally crowded is no excuse for giving so many performances It is unfair to the critics Yesterday afternoon at the concert of the Gotham Symphony Society Ludwig Kaese played that great German master work the Leberwurst bassoon concerto in F flat major opus posthumous Posthumous does not in this case have its usual meaning of written after the defunction of the composer s brain it refers to the fact that Leberwurst did not live to publish the work as his audience lynched him when he played it from manuscript This concerto dedicated to the composer s patron the deaf old Duke of Pretzelheim bears the title of Spring and this vernal quality was admirably brought out by Herr Kaese particularly in the movement representing influenza Indeed it was impossible to hear his sublime sniffulations without being moved to profound coughing Francois Grise s Gingerbread Suite scored for viola piccolo trombone and celesta might have been interesting had it been more of a novelty but since it had been heard in New York five times within four years its performance on this occasion was a mistake The program included also a symphonic rhapsody on cow boy melodies As this is by an obscure native composer and has never been heard before there is nothing to say about it Illustration Even people sitting behind pillars can enjoy her THE SURVIVAL OF THE FATTEST There is no lightweight championship in opera Stars of the first magnitude are of very considerable magnitude three hundred pounds and up In this class are the expensive prima donnas and heroic tenors the term heroic referring to their efforts to move about the stage The second magnitude two hundred fifty to two hundred ninety nine pounds includes jilted beauty mezzo sopranos and hated rival baritones The third magnitude of which no one takes any notice under two hundred fifty pounds is made up of confidante contraltos and noble father bassos Thus it will readily be seen that fat and fame are synonymous For in navigating the high C s latitude is far more important than longitude Italian opera was made possible by the discovery of spaghetti the serpentine food that produces coloratura tissue A few miles of this swallowed daily will keep the palate leggiero and the figure larghissimo In like manner beer is responsible for the national opera of Germany Who would have heard of Wagner if Pilsener had never been invented Where could Wagner have found his massive Brunhildes his slow dying Tristans Here lies the secret of the failure of our national music drama we have spaghetti opera and beer opera but no opera built on an American food Emaciated from a diet of pebbly cereals and grape juice our art still awaits the invention of the great American fattener For fat constitutes the wonder of opera When a diva who looks like a hippo surprises us by singing like a canary that is something remarkable When a languid mass of blubber for whom the very act of standing would seem a supreme accomplishment displays the lung energy of a steam calliope and the vocal endurance of a peanut stand whistle we are astonished overcome And fat robs the tragic ending of its depression The sight of a normally built woman expiring of heartbreak or any other favorite operatic death would be most distressing but the spectacle of a four hundred pound consumptive on a thickly padded canvas and steel rock breathing forth her everlasting last like a moping walrus on a cake of ice such a spectacle does not disturb us in the least for we realize that all she needs is a fan Indeed the fattest never die After a prima donna is no longer able to manoeuver over the operatic stage she toddles along the carpet of the concert platform tugging her train like a double expansion freight engine while the audience applauds from sheer amazement She is an immense success even people sitting behind posts can see her Thin singers perish and are forgotten there never were any anyhow but the gloriously fat ones sing on forever When Judgment Day comes and the angel blows his trumpet he will have to toot it with Wagnerian fury plus Straussian blatancy if he hopes to be heard above the aigretted and tiaraed dodos who are still on the yell End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Bizarre by Lawton Mackall END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK BIZARRE This file should be
