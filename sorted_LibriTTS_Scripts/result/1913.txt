touch in Hong Kong but the fool had slipped away But there in the next room assured that he had escaped it would be easy The squat man tiptoed to the window Luck of luck there was a fire escape platform He would let half an hour pass then he would act The ape with his British mannerisms Death to the breed root and branch He sat down to wait On the other side of the wall the bather finished his ablutions His body was graceful vigorous and youthful tinted a golden bronze His nose was hawky his eyes a Latin brown alert and roving though there was a hint of weariness in them the pressure of long racking hours of ceaseless vigilance His top hair was a glossy black inclined to curl but the four days growth of beard was as blond as a ripe chestnut burr In spite of this mark of vagabondage there were elements of beauty in the face The expanse of the brow and the shape of the head were intellectual The mouth was pleasure loving but the nose and the jaw neutralized this After he had towelled himself he reached down for a brown leather pouch which lay on the three legged bathroom stool It was patently a tobacco pouch but there was evidently something inside more precious than Saloniki He held the pouch on his palm and stared at it as if it contained some jinn clamouring to be let out Presently he broke away from this fascination and rocked his body eyes closed like a man suffering unremitting pain God s curse on them he whispered opening his eyes He raised the pouch swiftly as though he intended dashing it to the tiled floor but his arm sank gently After all he would be a fool to destroy them They were future bread and butter He would soon have their equivalent in money money that would bring back no terrible recollections Strange that every so often despite the horror he had to take them out and gaze at them He sat down upon the stool spread a towel across his knees and opened the pouch He drew out a roll of cotton wool which he unrolled across the towel Flames Blue flames red yellow violet and green precious stones many of them with histories that reached back into the dim centuries histories of murder and loot and envy The young man had imagination perhaps too much of it He saw the stones palpitating upon lovely white and brown bosoms he saw bloody and greedy hands the red sack of towns he heard the screams of women and the raucous laughter of drunken men Murder and loot At the end of the cotton wool lay two emeralds about the size of half dollars and half an inch in thickness polished and as vividly green as a dragonfly in the sun fit for the turban of Schariar spouse of Scheherazade Rodin would have seized upon the young man s attitude the limp body the haggard face hewn it out of marble and called it Conscience The possessor of the stones held this attitude for three or four minutes Then he rolled up the cotton wool jammed it into the pouch which he hung to his neck by a thong and sprang to his feet No more of this brooding it was sapping his vitality and he was not yet at his journey s end He proceeded to the bedroom emptied the battered kitbag and began to dress He put on heavy tan walking shoes gray woollen stockings gray knickerbockers gray flannel shirt and a Norfolk jacket minus the third button Ah that button He fingered the loose threads which had aforetime snugged the button to the wool The carelessness of a tailor had saved his life Had that button held his bones at this moment would be reposing on the hillside in far away Hong Kong Evidently Fate had some definite plans regarding his future else he would not be in this room alive But what plans Why should Fate bother about him further She had strained the orange to the last drop Why protect the pulp Perhaps she was only making sport of him lulling him into the belief that eventually he might win through One thing she would never be able to twist his heart again You cannot fill a cup with water beyond the brim And God knew that his cup had been full and bitter and red His hand swept across his eyes as if to brush away the pictures suddenly conjured up He must keep his thoughts off those things There was a taint of madness in his blood and several times he had sensed the brink at his feet But God had been kind to him in one respect The blood of his glorious mother predominated How many were after him and who He had not been able to recognize the man that night in Hong Kong That was the fate of the pursued one never dared pause to look back while the pursuers had their man before them always If only he could have broken through into Greece England would have been easy The only door open had been in the East It seemed incredible that he should be standing in this room but three hours from his goal America The land of the free and the brave And the irony of it was that he must seek in America the only friends he had in the world All the Englishmen he had known and loved were dead He had never made friends with the French though he loved France In this country alone he might successfully lose himself and begin life anew The British were British and the French were French but in this magnificent America they possessed the tenacity of the one and the gayety of the other these joyous unconquered speed loving Americans He took up the overcoat Under the light it was no longer black but a very deep green On both sleeves there were narrow bands of a still deeper green indicating that gold or silver braid had once befrogged the cuffs Inside soft silky Persian lamb and he ran his fingers over the fur thoughtfully The coat was still impregnated with the strong odour of horse He cast it aside never to touch it again From the discarded small coat he extracted a black wallet and opened it That passport He wondered if there existed another more cleverly forged It would not have served an hour west of the Hindenburg Line but in the East and here in America no one had questioned it In San Francisco they had scarcely glanced at it peace having come Besides this passport the wallet contained a will ten bonds a custom appraiser s receipt and a sheaf of gold bills The will however was perhaps one of the most astonishing documents conceivable It left unreservedly to captain John Hawksley the contents of the wallet Within three hours of his ultimate destination He knew all about great cities An hour after he left the train if he so willed he could lose himself for all time From the bottom of the kitbag he dug up a blue velours case which after a moment s hesitation he opened Medals incrusted with precious stones but on the top was the photograph of a charming girl blonde as ripe wheat and arrayed for the tennis court It was this photograph he wanted Indifferently he tossed the case upon the centre table and it upset sending the medals about with a ring and a tinkle The man in the next room heard this sound and his eye roved desperately Some way to peer into yonder room But there was no transom and he would not yet dare risk the fire escape The young man raised the photograph to his lips and kissed it passionately Then he hid it in the lining of his coat there being a convenient rent in the inside pocket I must not think he murmured I must not He became the hunted man again He turned a chair upend and placed it under the window He tipped another in front of the door On the threshold of the bathroom door he deposited the water carafe and the glasses His

none	none	was against the connecting door No man would be able to enter unannounced He had no intention of letting himself fall asleep He would stretch out and rest So he lit his pipe banked the two pillows switched out the light and lay down Only the intermittent glow of his pipe coal could be seen Near the journey s end and no more tight rope walking with death at both ends and death staring up from below Queer how the human being clung to life What had he to live for Nothing So far as he was concerned the world had come to an end Sporting instinct probably that was it couldn t make up his mind to shuffle off this mortal coil until he had beaten his enemies English university education had dulled the bite of his natural fatalism To carry on for the sport of it not to accept fate but to fight it By chance his hand touched his spiky chin Nevertheless he would have to enter New York just as he was He had left his razor in a Pullman washroom hurriedly one morning He dared not risk a barber s chair especially these American chairs that stretched one out in a most helpless manner Slowly his pipe sank toward his breast The weary body was overcoming the will A sound broke the pleasant spell He sat up tense Someone had entered through the window and stumbled over the chair Hawksley threw on the light CHAPTER II When the day clerk arrived the night clerk sleepily informed him that the guest in Room two hundred fourteen was without baggage and had not paid in advance Lave a call No I thought I d put you wise I didn t notice that the man had no grip until he was in the elevator All right I ll send the bell hop captain up with a fake call to see if the man s still there When the captain late of the A E F in France returned to the office he was mildly excited Gee there s been a whale of a scrap in Room two hundred twelve The chambermaid let me in Murder whispered the clerks in unison Murder your granny Naw Just a fight between two hundred twelve and two hundred fourteen because both of em have flown the roost But take a peek at what I found on the table It was a case of blue velours The boy threw back the lid dramatically War medals If they are I never piped em before They ain t French or British The captain of the bell boys scratched his head ruminatively Gee I got it Orders that s what they all em Kings pay em out Saturdays when the pay roll is nix Will you pipe the diamonds and rubies There s your room rents monseer The day clerk who considered himself a judge was of the opinion that there were two or three thousand dollars tied up in the stones It was a police affair Some ambassador had been robbed and the Britisher and the Greek or Bulgarian were mixed up in it Loot I thought the war was over said the night clerk The shootin is over that s all said the captain of the bellboys sagely What had happened in Room two hundred twelve A duel of wits rather than of physical contact Hawksley realized instantly that here was the crucial moment Caught and overpowered he was lost If he shouted for help and it came he was lost Once the police took a hand in the affair the newspaper publicity that would follow would result in the total ruin of all his hopes There was only one chance to finish this affair outside the hotel in some fog dimmed street There leaped into his mind obliquely and queerly a picture in one of Victor Hugo s tales Quasimodo And there he stood in every particular save the crooked back And on the top of this came the recollection that he had seen the man before The torches The red torches and the hobnailed boots There began an odd game a dancing match which the young man led adroitly always with his thought upon the open window There would be no shooting Quasimodo would not want the police either Half a dozen times his fingers touched futilely the dancing master s coat Back and forth across the room over the bed round the stand and chairs Persistently as if he understood the young man s manoeuvres the squat individual kept to the window side of the room An inspiration brought the affair to an end Hawksley snatched up the bedclothes and threw them as the ancient retiarius threw his net He managed to win to the lower platform of the fire escape before Quasimodo emerged There was a fourteen foot drop to the street and the man with the golden stubble on his chin and cheeks swung for a moment to gauge his landing Quasimodo came after with the agility of an ape The race down the street began with about a hundred yards in between Down the hill they went like phantoms The distance did not widen Bears will run amazingly fast and for a long while The quarry cut into Pearl Street for a block turned a corner and soon vaguely espied the Hudson River He made for this To the mind of Quasimodo this flight had but one significance he was dealing with an arrant coward and he based his subsequent acts upon this premise forgetting that brave men run when need says must It would have surprised him exceedingly to learn that he was not driving that he was being led Hawksley wanted his enemy alone where no one would see to interfere Red torches and hobnailed boots For once the two bloods always more or less at war merged in a common purpose to kill this beast to grind the face of him into pulp Red torches and hobnailed boots Presently one of the huge passenger boats moored for the winter loomed up through the fog and toward this Hawksley directed his steps He made a flying leap aboard and vanished round the deckhouse to the river side Quasimodo laughed as he followed It was as if the tobacco pouch and the appraiser s receipt were in his own pocket and broad rivers made capital graveyards They two alone in the fog He whirled round the deckhouse and backed on his heels to get his balance Directly in front in a very understandable pose was the intended victim his jaw jutting his eyelids narrowed Quasimodo tried desperately to reach for his pistol but a bolt of lightning stopped the action There is something peculiar about a blow on the nose a good blow The Anglo Saxon peoples alone possess the counterattack a rush To other peoples concentration of thought is impossible after the impact Instinctively Quasimodo s hands flew to his face He heard a laugh mirthless and terrible Before he could drop his hands from his face blows short and boring from this side and from that over and under The squat man was brave enough simply he did not know how to fight in this manner He was accustomed to the use of steel and the hobnails on his boots He struck wildly swinging his arms like a Flemish mill in a brisk wind Some of his blows got home but these provoked only sardonic laughter Wild with rage and pain he bored in He had but one chance to get this shadow in his gorilla like arms He lacked mental flexibility An idea getting into his head stuck it was not adjustable Like an arrow sped from the bowstring it had to fulfill its destiny It never occurred to him to take to his heels to get space between himself and this enemy he had so woefully underestimated Ten feet and he might have been able to whirl draw his pistol and end the affair The coup de grace came suddenly a blow that caught Quasimodo full on the point of the jaw He sagged and went sprawling upon his face The victor turned him over and raised a heel No He was neither Prussian nor Sudanese black He was white and white men did not stamp in the faces of fallen enemies But there was one thing a white man might do in such a case without disturbing the ethical and he proceeded about it forthwith Draw the devil s fangs render him impotent for a few hours He deliberately knelt on one of the outspread arms and calmly emptied the insensible man s pockets He took everything watch money passport letters pistol keys rose and dropped them into the river He overlooked Quasimodo s belt however The Anglo Saxon idea was top hole His fists had saved his life CHAPTER III Hawksley heard the panting of an engine and turned his head Dimly he saw a giant bridge and a long drab train moving across it He picked up the fallen man s cap and tried it on Not a particularly good fit but it would serve He then trotted round the deckhouse to the street side jumped to the wharf and sucking the cracked knuckles of his right hand fell into a steady dogtrot which carried him to the station he had left so hopefully an hour and a half gone An accommodation train eventually deposited him in Poughkeepsie where he purchased a cap and a sturdy walking stick The stubble on his chin and cheeks began to irritate him intensely but he could not rid himself of the idea that a barber s chair would be inviting danger He was now tolerably certain that from one end of the continent to the other his presence was known His life and his property they would be after both Even now there might be men in this strange town seeking him The closer he got to New York the more active and wide awake they would become He walked the streets his glance constantly roving But apparently no one paid the least attention to him Finally he returned to the railway station and at six o clock that evening he left the platform of the one hundred and twenty fifth Street Station and appraised covertly the men who accompanied him to the street He felt assured that they were all Americans Probably they were but there are still some stray fools of American birth who cannot accept the great American doctrine as the only Ararat visible in this present flood Perhaps one of these accompanied Hawksley to the street Whatever he was one had upon order met every south going train since seven o clock that morning when Quasimodo paying from the gold hidden in his belt had sent forth the telegraphic alarm The man hurried across the street and followed Hawksley by matching his steps His business was merely to learn the other s destination and then to report Across the earth a tempest had been loosed but Ariel did not ride it Caliban did The scythe of terror was harvesting a type and the innocent were bending with the guilty Suddenly Hawksley felt young revivified free He had arrived Surmounting indescribable hazards and hardships he walked the pavement of New York In an hour the mutable quicksands of a great city would swallow him forever Free He wanted to stroll about peer into shop

none	none	watch the amazing electric signs dally but he still had much to accomplish He searched for a telephone sign It was necessary that he find one immediately He had once spent six weeks in and about this marvellous city and he had a vague recollection of the blue and white enamel signs Shortly he found one It was a pay station in the rear of a news and tobacco shop He entered a booth but discovered that he had no five cent pieces in his purse He hurried out to the girl behind the cigar stand She was exhibiting a box of cigars to a customer who selected three paid for them and walked away Hawksley boiling with haste to have his affair done flung a silver coin toward the girl Five cent pieces Will you take them with you or shall I send them asked the girl earnestly I beg pardon Any particular kind of ribbon you want the box tied with I beg your pardon repeated Hawksley harried and bewildered But I m in a hurry Too much of a hurry to leave out the bark when you ask a favour I make change out of courtesy And you all bark at me Nickel Nickel as if that was my job A thousand apologies contritely And don t make it any worse by suggesting a movie after supper My mother never lets me go out after dark I rather fancy she s quite sensible Still you seem able to take care of yourself I might suggest With that black eye Nay nay I ll bet somebody s brother gave it to you Venus was not on that occasion in ascendancy Thank you for the change Hawksley swung on his heel and reentered the booth A great weariness oppressed him A longing almost irresistible came to him to go out and cry aloud Here I am Kill me I am tired and done For he had recognized the purchaser of the cigars as one of the men who had left the one hundred and twenty fifth Street Station at the same time as he He remembered distinctly that this man had been in a hurry Perhaps the whole dizzy affair was reacting upon his imagination psychologically and turning harmless individuals into enemies Hello said a man s voice over the wire Is mister Rathbone there Captain Rathbone is with his regiment at Coblenz sir Coblenz Yes sir I do not expect his return until near midsummer sir Who is this talking Have you opened a cable from Yokohama This is mister Hawksley The voice became excited Oh sir You will come right away I alone understand sir You will remember me when you see me I m the captain s butler sir Jenkins He cabled back to give you the entire run of the house as long as you desired it He advised me to notify you that he had also prepared his banker against your arrival Have your luggage sent here at once sir Dinner will be at your convenience Hawksley s body relaxed A lump came into his throat Here was a friend anyhow ready to serve him though he was thousands of miles away When he could trust himself to speak he said Sorry It will be impossible to accept the hospitality at present I shall call in a few days however to establish my identity Thank you Good evening Just a moment sir I may have an important cable to transmit to you It would be wise to leave me your address sir Hawksley hesitated a moment After all he could trust this perfect old servant whom he remembered He gave the address As he came out of the booth the girl stretched forth an arm to detain him He stopped I m sorry I spoke like that she said But I m so tired I ve been on my feet all day and everybody s been barking and growling and if I d taken in as many nickels as I ve passed out in change the boss would be rich Give me a dozen of those roses there She sold flowers also The pink ones How much he asked Two fifty He laid down the money Never mind the box They are for you Good evening The girl stared at the flowers as Ali Baba must have stared at the cask with rubies For me she whispered For nothing Her eyes blurred She never saw Hawksley again but that was of no importance She had a gentle deed to put away in the lavender of recollection Outside Hawksley could see nothing of the man who had bought the cigars At any rate further dodging would be useless He would go directly to his destination Old Gregor had sent him a duplicate key to the apartment He could hide there for a day or two then visit Rathbone s banker at his residence in the night to establish his identity Gregor could be trusted to carry the wallet and the pouch to the bank Once these were walled in steel half the battle would be over He would have nothing to guard thereafter but his life He laughed brokenly Nothing but the clothes he stood in He never could claim the belongings he had been forced to leave in that hotel back yonder But there was loyal old Gregor Somebody would be honestly glad to see him The poor old chap Astonishing but of late he was always thinking in English He hailed the first free taxicab he saw climbed in and was driven downtown He looked back constantly Was he followed There was no way of telling The street was alive with vehicles tearing north and south with frequent stoppage for the passage of those racing east and west The destination of Hawksley s cab was an old fashioned apartment house in Eightieth Street Gregor would have a meal ready and it struck Hawksley forcibly that he was hungry that he had not touched food since the night before Gregor valeting in a hotel pressing coats and trousers and sewing on buttons Groggy old world wasn t it Gregor pressing the trousers of the hoi polloi Gregor who could have sent New York mad with that old Stradivarius of his But Gregor was wise Safety for him lay in obscurity and what was more obscure than a hotel valet He did not seek the elevator but mounted the first flight of stairs He saw two doors one on each side of the landing He sought one stooped and peered at the card over the bell Conover Gregor s was opposite Having a key he did not knock but unlocked the door and stepped into the dark hall Stefani Gregor he called joyously Stefani my old friend it is I Silence But that was understandable Either Gregor had not returned from his labours or he was out gathering the essentials for the evening meal Judging from the variety of odours that swam the halls of this human warren many suppers were in the process of making and the top flavour was garlic He sniffed pleasurably Not that the smell of garlic quickened his hunger It merely sent his thought galloping backward a score of years He saw Stefani Gregor and a small boy in mountain costume footing it sturdily along the dizzy goat paths of the rugged hills saw the two sitting on some ruddy promontory and munching black bread rubbed with garlic Ambrosia His mother s horror when she smelt his breath as if garlic had not been one of her birthrights His uncle roaring out in his bull s voice that black bread and garlic were good for little boys stomachs and made the stuff of soldiers Black bread and garlic and the Golden Age After he had flooded the hall with light he began a tour of inspection The rooms were rather bare but clean and orderly Here and there were items that kept the homeland green in the recollection He came to the bedroom last He hesitated for a moment before opening the door The lights told him why Gregor had not greeted his entering hail The overturned reading lamp the broken chair the letters and papers strewn about the floor the rifled bureau drawers these things spoke plainly enough Gregor was a prisoner somewhere in this vast city or he was dead Hawksley stood motionless for a space And he must remain here at least for a night and a day He would not dare risk another hotel He could of course go to the splendid Rathbone place but it would not be fair to invite tragedy across that threshold A ball of crushed paper at his feet attracted his attention He kicked it absently followed and picked it up his thought on other things He was aimlessly smoothing it out when an English word caught his eye English He smoothed the crumpled sheet and read If you find this it is the will of God I have been watched for several days and am now convinced that they have always known I was here but were leaving me alone for some unknown purpose I roll this ball because anything folded and left in a conspicuous place would be useless should they come for me I understand It is you poor boy They are watching me in hopes of catching you and I ve no way to warn you not to come here It was after I sent you the key that I learned the truth God bless you and guard you STEFANI Hawksley tore the note into scraps Food and sleep He walked toward the kitchen musing What an odd mixture he was Superficially British with the British outlook and yet filled with the dancing blood of the Latin and the cold phlegmatic blood of the Slav He was like a schoolmaster with two students too big for him to handle Always the Latin was dispossessing the Slav or the Slav was ousting the Latin With fatalistic confidence that nevermore would he look upon the kindly face of Stefani Gregor alive he went in search of food Not a crust did he find In the ice chest there was a bottle of milk soured Hungry and not a crumb And he dared not go out in search of food No one had observed his entrance to the apartment but it was improbable that such luck would attend him a second time He returned to the bedroom He did not turn on the light because a novel idea had blossomed unexpectedly a Latin idea There might be food on some window ledge He would leave payment He proceeded to the window throwing up both it and the curtain and looked out Ripping There was a fire escape As he slipped a leg over the sill a golden square sprang into existence across the way Immediately he forgot his foraging instincts In a moment he was all Latin always susceptible to the enchantment of beauty The distance across the court was less than forty feet He could see the girl quite plainly as she set about the preparation of her evening meal He forgot his danger his hunger his code of ethics which did not permit him to gaze at a young woman through a window Alone He was alone and she was alone A novel idea popped into his head He chuckled and the sound of that chuckle in his ears somehow brought back his resolve to carry on to pass out if so he must fighting He would knock on yonder window and ask the beautiful lady slavey for a bit of her supper CHAPTER IV Kitty Conover had inherited brains and beauty and nothing else but the furniture Her father had been a famous reporter the admiration of cubs from New York to San Francisco handsome happy go lucky generous rather improvident and wholly lovable Her mother had been a comedy actress noted for her beauty and wit and extravagance Thus it will be seen that Kitty was in luck to inherit any furniture at all Kitty was twenty four A body is as old as it is but a brain is as old as the facts it absorbs and Kitty had absorbed enough facts to carry her brain well into the thirties Conover had been dead twenty years and Kitty had scarcely any recollections of him Improvident as the run of newspaper writers are Conover had fulfilled one obligation to his family he had kept up his endowment policies and for eighteen years the insurance had taken care of Kitty and her mother who because of a weak ankle had not been able to return to the scenes of her former triumphs In nineteen fifteen this darling mother whom Kitty loved to idolatry had passed on There was enough for the funeral and the cleaning up of the bills but that was all The income ceased with missus Conover s demise Kitty saw that she must give up writing short stories which nobody wanted and go to
1789_142896_000012_000000	train-clean-360	 work 
none	none	So she proceeded at once to the newspaper office where her father s name was still a tradition and applied for a job It was frankly a charity job but Kitty was never to know that because she fell into the newspaper game naturally and when they discovered her wide acquaintance among theatrical celebrities they switched her into the dramatic department where she had astonishing success as a raconteur She was now assistant dramatic editor of the Sunday issue and her pay envelope had four crisp ten dollar notes in it each Monday She still remained in the old apartment sentiment as much as anything She had been born in it and her happiest days had been spent there She lived alone without help being one of that singular type of womanhood that is impervious to the rust of loneliness Her daily activities sufficed the gregarious instincts and it was often a relief to move about in silence Among other things Kitty had foresight She had learned that a little money in the background was the most satisfying thing in existence So many times she and her mother had just reached the insurance check with grumbling bill collectors in the hall that she was determined never to be poor She had to fight constantly her love of finery inherited from her mother and her love of good times inherited from her father So she established a bank account and to date had not drawn a check against it which speaks well for her will power an attribute cultivated not inherited Kitty was as pleasing to the eye as a basket of fruit Her beauty was animated There was an expression in her eyes and on her lips that spoke of laughter always on tiptoe An enviable inheritance this the desire to laugh to be searching always for a vent to laughter it is something money cannot buy something not to be cultivated a true gift of the gods This desire to laugh is found invariably in the tender and valorous and Kitty was both Brown hair with running threads of gold that was always catching light slate blue eyes with heavy black fringe Irish colour that waxed and waned and a healthy shapely body Topped by a sparkling intellect these gifts made Kitty desirable of men Kitty had no beau After the adolescent days beaux ceased to interest her This would indicate that she was inclined toward suffrage Nothing of the kind Intensely romantic she determined to await the grand passion or go it alone No experimental adventures for her Be assured that she weighed every new man she met and finding some flaw discarded him as a matrimonial possibility Besides her unusual facilities to view and judge men had shown her masculine phases the average woman would have discovered only after the fatal knot was tied She did not suspect that she was romantical She attributed her wariness to common sense If there is one place where a pretty young woman may labour without having to build a wall of liquid air about her to fend off amatory advances that place is the editorial room of a great metropolitan daily One must have leisure to fall in love and only the office boys could assemble enough idle time to call it leisure Her desk faced Burlingame s and Burlingame was the dramatic editor a scholar and a gentleman He liked to hear Kitty talk and often he lured her into the open and he gathered information about theatrical folks that was outside even his wide range of knowledge A drizzly fog had hung over New York since morning Kitty was finishing up some Sunday special Burlingame was reading proofs All day theatrical folks had been in and out of this little ten by twelve cubby hole and now there would be quiet But no The door opened and an iron gray head intruded Will I be in the way Lord no cried Burlingame throwing down his proofs Come along in Cutty The great war correspondent came in and sat down sighing gratefully Cutty was a nickname he carried and smoked everywhere they would permit him the worst looking and the worst smelling pipe in Christendom You may not realize it but a nickname is a round about Anglo Saxon way of telling a fellow you love him He was Cutty but only among his dear intimates mind you to the world at large to presidents kings ambassadors generals and capitalists he is known by another name You will find it on the roster of the Royal Geographical on the title page of several unique books on travel jewels and drums in magazines and newspapers on the membership roll of the Savage in London and the Lambs in New York But you will not find it in this story because it would not be fair to set his name against the unusual adventures that crossed his line of life with that of the young man who wore the tobacco pouch suspended from his neck Tall bony graceful enough except in a chair where his angles became conspicuous the ruddy weather bitten complexion of a deep sea sailor and a sailor man s blue eye the brow of a thinker and the mouth of a humourist Men often call another man handsome when a woman knows they mean manly Among men Cutty was handsome Kitty considerately rose and gathered up her manuscript No no Kitty I d rather talk to you than Burly here You re always reminding me of that father of yours Best comrade I ever had You laugh just like him Did your mother ever tell you that old Cutty is your godfather Good gracious Fact I told your dad I d watch over you And a fat lot of watching you ve done to date jeered Burlingame Couldn t help that But I can be on the job until I return to the Balkans Kitty laughed joyously and sat down perhaps a little thrilled She had always admired Cutty from afar shyly Once in a blue moon he had in the old days appeared for tea and he and missus Conover would spend the balance of the afternoon discussing the lovable qualities of Tommy Conover Kitty had seen him but twice during the war Every so often began Cutty I have to find listeners Fact I used to hate crowds listeners but those ten days in an open boat a thousand miles from anywhere made me gregarious I m always wanting company and hating to go to bed which is bad business for a man of

none	none	Cutty s ship had been torpedoed To Kitty with his tired eyes and weather bitten face his bony gangling body he had the appearance of a lazy man Actually she knew him to be a man of tremendous vitality and endurance Eagles when they roost are heavy lidded and clumsy She wondered if there was a corner on the globe he had not peered into For thirty years he had been following two gods Rumour and War For thirty years he had been the slave of cables and telegrams Even now he was preparing to return to the Balkans where the great fire had started and where there were still some threatening embers to watch Cutty was not well known in America his reputation was European He played the game because he loved it being comfortably fortified with worldly goods He was a linguist of rare attainments specializing in the polyglot of southeastern Europe He came and went like cloud shadow His foresight was so keen he was seldom ordered to go here or there he was generally on the spot when the orders arrived He was interested in socialism and its bewildering ramifications but only as an analytical student He could fit himself into any environment interview a prime minister in the afternoon and take potluck that night with the anarchist who was planning to blow up the prime minister Burlingame an intimate often exposed for Kitty s delectation the amazing and colourful facets of Cutty s diamond brilliant mind Cutty wrote authoritatively on famous gems and collected drums He had one of the finest collections of chrysoprase in the world He loved these semi precious stones because of their unmatchable translucent green like the pulp of a grape From Burlingame Kitty had learned that Cutty rather indifferent to women carried about with him the photographs large size of famous professional beauties and a case filled with polished chrysoprase He would lay a photograph on a table and adorn the lovely throat with astonishing necklaces and the head with wonderful tiaras all the while his brain at work with some intricate political puzzle And he collected drums The walls of his apartment part of the loft of a midtown office building were covered with a most startling assortment of drums drums of war of the dance of the temples of the feast ancient and modern some of them dreadful looking objects as Kitty had cause to remember Though Cutty had known her father and mother intimately Kitty was a comparative stranger He recollected seeing her perhaps a dozen times She had been a shy child not given to climbing over visitors knees not the precocious offspring of the average theatrical mother So in the past he had somewhat overlooked her Then one day recently he had dropped in to see Burlingame and had seen Kitty instead which accounts for his presence here this day Neither Kitty nor Burlingame suspected the true attraction The dramatic editor accepted the advent as a peculiar compliment to himself And it is to be doubted if Cutty himself realized that there was a true magnetic pole in this cubbyhole of a room Kitty however had vivid recollections Actually the first strange man she had ever met But not having been visible on her horizon except in flashes she knew of the man only what she had read and what Burlingame had casually offered during discussions Well anyhow said Burlingame complacently the war is over Cutty smiled indulgently That s the trouble with us chaps who tramp round the world for news We can t bamboozle ourselves like you folks who stay at home The war was only the first phase There s a mess over there wanting something and not knowing exactly what those millions milling cattle with neither shed nor pasture The Lord only knows how long it will take to clarify Would you mind if I smoked Wow cried Burlingame Not at all answered Kitty I don t see how any pipe could be worse than mister Burlingame s I apologize said the dramatic editor humbly You needn t replied the girl She turned to the war correspondent Any new drums I remember that day You were scared half to death at my walls Small wonder I was only twelve and I dreamed of cannibals for weeks Drums I wonder if any living man has heard a greater variety than I What a lot of them I have heard them calling a jehad in the Sudan Tumpi tum tump tumpitum tump Makes a white man s hair stand up when he hears it in the night I don t know what it is but the sound drives the Oriental mad And that reminds me I ve had them in mind all day the drums of jeopardy What an odd phrase And what are the drums of jeopardy asked Kitty leaning on her arms Odd but suddenly she felt a longing to go somewhere thousands and thousands of miles away She had never been west of Chicago or east of Boston Until this moment she had never felt the call of the blood her father s Cocoanut palms and birds of paradise And drums in the night going tumpi tum tump tumpi tum tump I ve always been mad over green things began Cutty A wheat field in the spring leafing maples It s Nature s choice and mine My passion is emeralds and I haven t any because those I want are beyond reach They are owned by the great houses of Europe and Asia and lie in royal caskets or did If I could go into a mine and find an emerald as big as my fist I should be only partly happy if it chanced to be of fine colour In a little while I should lose interest in it It wouldn t be alive if you can get what I mean Just as a man would rather have a homely woman to talk to than a beautiful window dummy to admire A stone to interest me must have a story a story of murder and loot of beautiful women palaces Br r r cried Burlingame Why I ve seen emeralds I would steal with half a chance I couldn t help it Fact declared Cutty earnestly Think of the loot in the Romanoff palaces What s become of all those magnificent stones In a little while they ll be turning up in Amsterdam to be cut some of them Or maybe Mister Bolsheviki s inamorata will be stringing them round her neck Loot But the drums of jeopardy said Kitty Emeralds green as an English lawn in May after a shower Kitty By the way do you mind if I call you Kitty I used to And I ve always thought of you as Cutty Fifty fifty It s a bargain Well the drums to my thinking are the finest two examples of the green beryl in the world Polished of course as emeralds always should be I should say that they were about the size of those peppermint chocolate drops there Have one said Kitty No Spoil the taste of the pipe You ought to spoil that taste once in a while was Burlingame s observation But go on I suppose originally there was a single stone later cut into halves because they are perfect matches The drums proper are exquisitely carved ivory statuettes of Hindu or Mohammedan drummers squatting the golden base of the drums between the knees and the drumheads the emeralds Lord how they got to me I wanted to run off with them The history of murder and loot they could tell Some Delhi mogul owned them first Then Nadir Shah carried them off to Persia along with the famous peacock throne I saw them in a palace on the Caspian in nineteen twelve Russia was very strong in Persia at one time Perhaps they were gifts perhaps they were stolen these emeralds Anyhow I d never heard of them until that year And I travelled all the way up from Constantinople to get a glimpse of them if it were possible I had to do some mighty fine wire pulling For one of those stones I would give half of all I own To see them in the possession of another man would be a supreme test to my honesty You old pirate said Burlingame But why the word jeopardy persisted Kitty who was intrigued by the phrase Probably some Hindu trick It is a language of flowery metaphors It means I suppose that when you touch the drums they bite In journeying from one spot to another they always leave misfortune behind as I understand it Just coincidence but you couldn t drive that into an Oriental skull This is what makes the study of precious stones so interesting There is always some enchantment some evil spell To handle the drums is to invite a minor accident Call it twaddle probably is and yet I have reason to believe that there s something to the superstition Burlingame sniffed I can prove it Cutty declared I held those drums in my hands one day I carried them to a window the better to observe them On my return to the hotel I was knocked down by a horse and laid up in bed for a week That same night someone tried to kill the man who showed me the emeralds Coincidence Perhaps But these days I m shying at thirteen the wrong side of the street ladders and religious curses An old hard boiled egg like you Burlingame threw up his hands in mock despair I laugh too but I duck nevertheless The chap who showed me the stones was what you d call the honorary custodian a privileged character because of his genius Before approaching him I sent him a copy of my monograph on green stones I found that he was quite as crazy over green as I That brought us together and while I drew him out I kept wondering where I had seen him before Both his name and his face were vaguely familiar It seems a superstition had come along with the stones from India to Persia from there to Russia A maid fortunate enough to see the drums would marry and be happy The old fellow confessed that occasionally he secretly admitted a peasant maid to gaze upon the stones But he never let the male inmates of the palace find this out He knew them a little too intimately A bad lot And this palace asked Kitty Not one stone on another The proletariat rose up and destroyed it To mobs anything beautiful is offensive Palaces looted banks museums houses The ignorant toying with hand grenades thinking them sceptres All the scum in the world boiling to the top After the Red Day comes the Red Night Whatever will become of them the little kings and princes and dukes After all thought Kitty they were human beings they would not suffer any the less because they had been born to the purple Maybe they ll go to work said Cutty dryly Sooner or later all parasites will have to work if they want bread And yet I ve met some men among them big in the heart and the mind who would have made bully farmers and professors The beautiful thing about the Anglo Saxon education is that the whole structure is based upon fair play In eastern and southeastern Europe few of them can play solitaire without cheating But I would give a good deal to know what has happened to those emeralds the drums of jeopardy They ll probably be broken up and sold in carat weights The whole family was wiped out in a night I say will you take lunch with me to morrow Gladly All right I ll drop in here at half after twelve Here s my telephone number should anything alter your plans If I m going to be godfather I might as well start right in The drums of jeopardy what a haunting phrase Haunting stones too Kitty For picking them up in my hands I went to bed with a banged up leg I can t forget that We Occidentals laugh at Orientals and their superstitions We don t believe in the curse And yet by George those emeralds were accursed Piffle snorted Burlingame Mush It s greed pure and simple that gives precious stones their sinister histories You d have been hit by that horse if you had picked up nothing more valuable than a rhinestone buckle Take away the gold lure and precious stones wouldn t sell at the price of window glass Is that so How about me It isn t because a stone is worth so much that makes me want it I want it for the sheer beauty I want it for the tremendous panorama the sight of it unfolds in my mind I imagine what happened from the hour the stone was mined to the hour it came into my possession To me to all genuine collectors the intrinsic value is nil Can t you see It is for me what Balzac s La Peau de Chagrin would be to you if you had fallen on it for the first time money love tragedy death An interruption came in the form of one of the office boys The chief was on the wire and wanted Cutty at once At half after twelve Kitty And by the way added Cutty as he rose they say about the drums that a beautiful woman is immune to their danger There s your chance Kitty said Burlingame Am I beautiful asked Kitty demurely Lord love the minx shouted Cutty A corner in Mouquin s Rain or shine After Cutty had departed Kitty said He s the most fascinating man I know What fun it would be to jog round the world with a man like that who knew everybody and everything As a little girl I was violently in love with him but don t you ever dare give me away You ll probably have nightmare to night And honestly you ought not to live in that den alone But Cutty has seen things Burlingame admitted things no white man ought to see He s been shot up mauled by animals marooned torpedoed at sea made prisoner by old Fuzzy Wuzzy An ordinary man would have died of fatigue Cutty is as tough and strong as a gorilla and as active as a cat But this jewel superstition is all rot Odd though he ll travel halfway round the world to see a ruby or an emerald He says no true collector cares a cent for a diamond Says they are vulgar Except on the third finger of a lady s left hand and then they are just perfectly splendid Oho Well when you get yours I hope it s as big as the Koh i noor Thank you You might just as well wish a brick on me Kitty left the office at a quarter of six The phrase kept running through her head the drums of jeopardy A little shiver ran up her spine Money love tragedy death This terrible and wonderful old world of which she had seen little else than city streets suddenly exhibited wide vistas She knew now why she had begun to save travel Just as soon as she had a thousand she would go somewhere A great longing to hear native drums in the night Even as the wish entered her mind a new sound entered her ears The Subway car wheels began to beat tumpitum tump tumpitum tump Fudge She opened her evening paper and scanned the fashions the dramatic news and the comics Being a woman she read the world news last On the front page she saw a queer story dated at Albany Mysterious guests at a hotel how they had fought and fled in the early morning There had been left behind a case with foreign orders incrusted with several thousand dollars worth of gems Bolsheviki said the police just as they said auto bandits a few years ago when confronted with something they could not understand The orders had been turned over to the Federal authorities from whom it was learned that they were all royal and demi royal Neither of the two guests had returned up to noon and one had fled leaving even his hat and coat But there was nothing to indicate his identity Loot murmured Kitty All the scum in the world rising to the top quoting Cutty Poor things as she thought of the gentle ladies who had died horribly in bedrooms and cellars Kitty was beginning to cast about for more congenial quarters There were too many foreigners in the apartments and none of them especially good housekeepers Always nowadays somebody had a washing out on the line the odour of garlic was continuously in the air and there were noisy children under foot in the halls The families she and her mother had known were all gone and Kitty was perhaps the oldest inhabitant in the block The living room windows faced Eightieth Street bedrooms dining room and kitchen looked out upon the court From the latter windows one could step out upon the fire escape platform which ran round the three sides of the court Among the present tenants she knew but one an old man by the name of Gregory who lived opposite The acquaintance had never ripened into friendship but sometimes Kitty would borrow an egg and he would borrow some sugar In the summertime when the windows were open at night she had frequently heard the music of a violin swimming across the court Polish Russian and Hungarian music always speaking with a tragic note nothing she had ever heard in concerts Once however she had heard him begin something from Thais and stop in the middle of it and that convinced her that he was a master She was fond of good music One day she asked Gregory why he did not teach music instead of valeting at a hotel His answer had been illuminative It was only his body that pressed clothes but it would have torn his soul to listen daily to the agonized bow of the novice Kitty was lonely through pride as much as anything As for friends she had a regiment of them But she rarely accepted their hospitality realizing that she could not return it No young men called because she never invited them All this however was going to change when she moved As she turned on the hail light she saw an envelope on the floor Evidently it had been shoved under the door It was unstamped She opened it and stepped out of the humdrum into the whirligig DEAR MISS CONOVER If anything should happen to me all the things in my apartment I give to you without reservation STEPHEN GREGORY She read the letter a dozen times to make sure that it meant exactly what it said He might be ill After she had cooked her supper she would run round and inquire The poor lonely old man She went into the kitchen and took inventory There was nothing but bacon and eggs and coffee She had forgotten to order that morning She lit the gas range and began to prepare the meal As she broke an egg against the rim of the pan the nearby Elevated train rushed by drumming tumpitum tump tumpitum tump She laughed but it wasn t honest laughter She laughed because she was conscious that she was afraid of something Impulse drove her to the window Contact with men her unusual experiences as a reporter had developed her natural fearlessness to a point where it was aggressive As she pressed the tip of her nose against the pane however she found herself gazing squarely into a pair of exceedingly brilliant dark eyes and all the blood in her body seemed to rush violently into her throat Tableau CHAPTER V Kitty gasped but she did not cry out The five days growth of blondish stubble the discoloured eye for all the orb itself was brilliant and the hawky nose combined to send through her the first great thrill of danger she had ever known Slowly she backed away from the window The man outside immediately extended his hands with a gesture that a child would have understood Supplication Kitty paused naturally But did the man mean it Might it not be some trick to lure her into opening the window And what was he doing outside there anyhow Her mind freed from the initial hypnosis of the encounter began to work quickly If she ran from the kitchen to call for help he might be gone when she returned only to come back when she was again alone Once more the man executed that gesture his palms upward It was Latin she was aware of that for she was always encountering it in the halls Another gesture She understood this also The tips of the fingers bunched and dabbed at the lips She had seen Italian children make the gesture and cry Ho fame Hungry But she could not let him into the kitchen Still if he were honestly hungry She had it In the kitchen table drawer was an imitation revolver press the trigger and a fluted fan was revealed a dance favour she had received during the winter She plucked it out of the drawer and walked bravely to the window which she threw up What do you want What are you doing out there on the fire escape she instantly demanded to know My word I am hungry I was looking out of the window across the way and saw you preparing your dinner A bit of bread and a glass of milk Would you mind I wonder Why didn t you come to the door then What window Kitty was resolute once she embarked upon an enterprise That one Where is mister Gregory Kitty recalled that odd letter Gregory I should very much like to know I have come many miles to see him He sent me a duplicate key There was not even a crust in the cupboard Gregory away That letter Something had happened to that poor kindly old man Why did you not seek some restaurant Or have you no money I have plenty I was afraid that I might not be able conveniently to return I am a stranger My actions might be viewed with suspicion Indeed Describe mister Gregory Not of the clinging kind evidently he thought A raving beauty Diana domesticated It is four years since I saw him He was then gray dapper and erect A mole on his chin which he rubs when he talks He is a valet in one of the fashionable hotels He is or was the only true friend I have in New York Was What do you mean I m afraid something has happened to him I found his bedroom things tossed about What could possibly happen to a harmless old man like mister Gregory Pardon me but your egg is burning Kitty wheeled and lifted off the pan choking in the smother of smoke She came right about face swiftly enough The man had not moved and that decided her Come in I will give you something to eat Sit in that chair by the window and be careful not to stir from it I m a good shot lied Kitty truculently Frankly I do not like the looks of this I do look like a burglar what He sat down in the chair meekly Food and a human being to talk to A lovely self reliant American girl able to take care of herself Magnificent eyes slate blue with thick velvety black lashes Irish In a moment Kitty had three eggs and half a dozen strips of bacon frying in a fresh pan She kept one eye upon the pan and the other upon the intruder risking strabismus At length she transferred the contents of the pan to a plate backed to the ice chest and reached for a bottle of milk She placed the food at the far end of the table and retreated a few steps her arms crossed in such a way as to keep the revolver in view Please do not be afraid of me What makes you think I am Any woman would be Kitty saw that he was actually hungry and her suspicions began to ebb He hadn t lied about that And he ate like a gentleman Young not more than thirty possibly less But that dreadful stubble and that black eye The clothes would have passed muster on any fashionable golf links A fugitive From what Thank you he said setting down the empty milk bottle Your accent is English Which is to say That your gestures are Italian My mother was Italian But what makes you believe I am not English An Englishman or an American for that matter with money in his pocket would have gone into the street in search of a restaurant You are right The fundamentals of the blood will always crop out You can educate the brain but not the blood I am not an Englishman I merely received my education at Oxford A fugitive however of any blood might have come to my window Yes I am a fugitive pursued by the god of Irony And Irony is never particular the chase is the thing What matters it whether the quarry be wolf or sheep Kitty was impressed by the bitterness of the tone What is your name John Hawksley But that is English I should not care to call myself Two Hawks literally It would be embarrassing So I call myself Hawksley A pause Kitty wondered what new impetus she might give to the conversation which was interesting her despite her distrust How did you come by that black eye she asked with embarrassing directness Hawksley smiled revealing beautifully white teeth I say it is a bit off isn t it I received it a twinkle coming into his eyes in a situation that had moribund perspectives Moribund perspectives repeated Kitty casting the phrase about in her mind in search of an equivalent less academic I am young and healthy and I wanted to live he said gravely I am curious to know what is going to happen to morrow and other to morrows Somewhere near by a door was slammed violently Kitty every muscle in her body tense jumped convulsively with the result that her finger pressed automatically the trigger of her pistol The fan popped out gayly Hawksley stared at the fan quite as astonished as Kitty Then he broke into low rollicking laughter which Kitty because her basic corpuscle was Irish perforce had to join For all her laughter she retreated furious and alarmed Fancy I say now you re jolly plucky to face a scoundrel like me with that I don t just know what to make of you said Kitty irresolutely flinging the fan into a corner You have revivified a celestial spark my faith in human beings I beg of you not to be afraid of me I am quite harmless I am very grateful for the meal Yours is the one act of kindness I have known in weeks I will return to Gregor s apartment at once But before I go please accept this I rather suspect you know that you live alone and that fan is amusing and not particularly suitable He rose and unsmilingly laid upon the table one of those heavy blue black bull dogs of war a regulation revolver Kitty understood what this courteous act signified he was disarming himself to reassure her Sit down she ordered Either he was harmless or he wasn t If he wasn t she was utterly at his mercy She might be able to lift that terrible looking engine of murder battle and sudden death with the aid of both hands but to aim and fire it never in this world As I came in to night I found a note in the hall from mister Gregory I will fetch it But you call him Gregor His name is Stefani Gregor and years and years ago he dandled me on his knees I promise not to move until you return Subdued by she knew not what no longer afraid Kitty moved out of the kitchen She had offered Gregory s letter as an excuse to reach the telephone Once there however she did not take the receiver off the hook Instead she whistled down the tube for the janitor This is Miss Conover Come up to my apartment in ten minutes No it s not the water pipes In ten minutes Nothing very serious could happen inside of ten minutes and the janitor was reliable and not the sort one reads about in the comic weeklies Her confidence reenforced by the knowledge that a friend was near she took the letter into the kitchen Apparently her unwelcome guest had not stirred The revolver was where he had laid it Read this she said The visitor glanced through it It is Gregor s hand Poor old chap I shall never forgive my self For what For dragging him into this They must have intercepted one of my telegrams He stared dejectedly at the strip of oilcloth in front of the range You are an American Yes God has been exceedingly kind to your country I doubt if you will ever know how kind I ll take myself off No sense in compromising you He laid a folded handkerchief inside his cap which he put on Know anything about this indicating the revolver Nothing whatever Permit me to show you It is loaded there are five bullets in the clip See this little latch So it is harmless So and you kill with it It is horrible cried Kitty Take it with you please I could not keep my eyes open to shoot it These are troublous times All women should know something about small arms Again I thank you For your own sake I trust that we may never meet again Good bye He stepped out of the window and vanished Kitty at a mental impasse could only stare into the night beyond the window This mesmeric state endured for a minute then a gentle and continuous sound dissipated the spell It was raining Obliquely she saw the burnt egg in the pan The thing had happened she had not been dreaming Her brain awoke Thought crowded thought before one matured another displaced it and all as futile as the sparks from the anvil An avalanche of conjecture and out of it all eventually emerged one concrete fact The man Was honest His hunger had been honest his laughter Who was he what was he For all his speech not English for all his gestures not Italian Moribund perspectives Somewhere that day he had fought for his life John Two Hawks And there was the mysterious evanishment of old Gregory whose name was Stefani Gregor In a humdrum prosaic old apartment like this Kitty had ideas about adventure an inheritance though she was not aware of that There had to be certain ingredients principally mystery Anything sordid must not be permitted to edge in She had often gone forth upon semi perilous enterprises as a reporter entered sinister houses where crimes had been committed but always calculating how much copy at eight dollars a column could be squeezed out of the affair But this promised to be something like those tales which were always clear and wonderful in her head but more or less opaque when she attempted to transfer them to paper A secret society Vengeance An echo of the war Johnny Two Hawks she murmured aloud And he hopes we ll never meet again There was a mirror over the sink and she threw a glance into it Very well if he thought like that about it Here the doorbell tinkled That would be the faithful janitor She ran to the door Whadjuh wanta see me about Miz Conover What has happened to old mister Gregory Him Why some amb lance fellers carted him off this afternoon Didn t know nawthin was the matter with im until I runs into them in the hall He d been hurt Couldn t say miz He was on a stretcher when I seen im Under a sheet But he might have been dead

none	none	I ast em an they said a shock of some sort What hospital Gee I forgot t ast that I ll find out Good night But Kitty did not find out She called up all the known private and public hospitals but no Gregor or Gregory had been received that afternoon nor anybody answering his description The fog had swallowed up Stefani Gregor CHAPTER VI The reportorial instinct in Kitty Conover combined with her natural feminine curiosity impelled her to seek to the bottom of affair Her newspaper was as far from her as the poles simply a paramount desire to translate the incomprehensible into sequence and consequence Harmless old Gregor s disappearance and the advent of John Two Hawks the absurdity of that name with his impeccable English accent his Latin gestures and his black eye convinced her that it was political an electrical cross current out of that broken world over there Moribund perspectives What did that signify save that Johnny Two Hawks had fought somewhere that day for his life Had Gregor been spirited away so as to leave Two Hawks without support to confuse and discourage him and break down his powers of resistance Or had there been something of great value in the Gregor apartment and Johnny Two Hawks had come too late to save his friend A word slipped into her mind like a whiff of miasma off an evil swamp As she recognized the word she felt the same horror and repugnance one senses upon being unexpectedly confronted by a cobra Internationalism The scum of the world boiling to the top A half blind viper striking venomously at everything even itself A destroyer who tore down

none	none	knew not how or what to build Kitty knew that lower New York was seething with this species of terrorism thousands of noisome European rats trying to burrow into the granary of democracy But she had no particular fear of the result The reacting chemicals of American humour and common sense would neutralize that virus Supposing a ripple from this indecent eddy had touched her feet The torch of liberty in the hands of Anarch Johnny Two Hawks Somehow even if she never saw him again she knew she would always remember him by that name Phases of the encounter began to return Fine hands perhaps he painted or played The oblong head of well balanced mentality A pleasant voice Breeding To be sure he had laughed at that fan popping out Anybody would have laughed Never had she felt so idiotic He had gravely expressed the hope that they might never meet again because his life was in danger What danger Conceivably the enmity of a society internationalism The word having found lodgment in her thoughts took root Internationalism Utopia while you wait Anarchism and Bolshevism offering nostrums for humanity s ills And there were sane men who defended the cult on the basis that the intention was honest Who can say that the rattlesnake does not consider his intentions honourable The attribute lacking in the ape to make him human is continuity of thought and action in all things save one He often starts out well but he never arrives His interest is never sustained He drops one thing and turns to another The exception is his enmity savage and cunning relentless and enduring Kitty was awake to one fact She could not venture to dig into this affair alone On the other hand she did not want one of the men from the city room a reporter who would see nothing but news If Gregor was only a prisoner publicity might be the cause of his death and publicity would certainly react hardily against Johnny Two Hawks To whom might she turn Cutty with his great physical strength his shrewd and alert mentality and his wide knowledge of peoples and tongues There was the man for her Kitty Conover s godfather She dumped the contents of her handbag upon the stand in the hallway in her impatience to find Cutty s card with his telephone number It was not in the directory She might catch him before he went out for the evening A Japanese voice answered her call Souse but he iss out Where No tell me How long has he been gone Scuse Kitty heard the click of the receiver as it went down upon the hook But she wasn t the daughter of Conover for nothing She called up the University Club No The Harvard Club No The Players the Lambs and in the latter club she found him Who is it Cutty spoke impatiently Kitty Conover Oh

none	none	Can t you have lunch with me Something very strange is happening in this old apartment house Cutty I m afraid it is a matter of life and death Otherwise I shouldn t have bothered you Can you come up right away As soon as a taxi can take me Thanks Kitty then went through the apartment and turned out all the lights Next she drew up a chair to the kitchen window and sat down to watch All was dark across the way But there was nothing singular in this fact Johnny Two Hawks would have sense enough to realize that it would be safer to move about in the dark It was even probable that he was lying down Tumpitum tump Tumpitum tump went the racing Elevated and Kitty s heart raced along with it Queer how the echo of Cutty s description of the drums calling a jehad a holy war should adapt itself to that Elevated Drums Perhaps the echo clung because she had been interested beyond measure in his tale of those two emeralds the drums of jeopardy Mobs sacking palaces and museums and banks and homes all the scum of the world boiling to the top the Red Night that wasn t over She uttered a shaky little laugh She would tell Cutty The real drums of jeopardy weren t emeralds but the roll of warning that prescience taps upon the spine the occult sense of impending danger That was why the Elevated went tumpitum tump tumpitum tump She would tell Cutty The drums of fear He over there and she here in darkness both of them waiting for something to happen and the invisible drumsticks beating the tattoo of fear If he were in her thoughts might not she be a little in his She stood up She would do it Convention in a moment like this was nonsense Hadn t he kept his side of the line scrupulously Nonchalance It occurred to her for the first time that there must be good material in a man who could come through in a contest with death nonchalant She would fetch him and have him here to meet Cutty this rather forlorn Johnny Two Hawks with his unshaven face his black eye and his nonchalance She would fetch him at once It would save a good deal of time There were but ten apartments in the building two on a floor The living room formed an L Kitty s buttressed Gregor s The elevator shaft was inside facing the court and the stair head was on the Gregor side of the elevator The two entrances faced each other across the landing As Kitty opened her door to step outside she was nonplussed to see two men issue cautiously from the Gregor door The moment they espied her however there was a mad rush for the stair head She could hear the thud of their feet all the way down to the ground floor and every footfall seemed to touch her heart One of them carried a bundle She breathed quickly and she knew that she was afraid Neither man was Johnny Two Hawks Something dreadful had happened she was sure of it Reenforcing her sinking courage with nerve energy she ran across to the Gregor door and knocked No answer She knocked again then she tried the door Locked The flutter in her breast died away she became quite calm She was going to enter this apartment by the way of the fire escape The window he had come out of was still up She had made note of this from the kitchen In returning he had stepped on to the springe of a snare She hurried back to her kitchen for the automatic She hadn t the least idea how to manipulate it but she was no longer afraid of it Bravely she stepped out on to the fire escape To reach her objective she had to walk under the ladder Danger often puts odd irrelevancies into the human brain As she moved forward she wondered if there was anything in the superstition regarding ladders When she reached the window she leaned against the brick wall and listened Silence an ominous silence The window was open the curtain up Within what For as long as five minutes she waited then she climbed in Now as this bedroom was a counterpart of her own she knew where the light button would be She might stumble over a chair or two but in the end she would find the light The fingers of one hand spread out before her and the other clutching the impossible automatic she succeeded in navigating the uncharted reefs of an unfamiliar room She blinked for a moment after throwing on the light and stood with her back to the wall the automatic wabbling at nothing in particular The room was empty so far as she could see There was evidence of a physical encounter but she could not tell whether it was due to the former or to the latter invasion Where was he From where she stood she could not see the floor on the far side of the bed Timidly she walked past the foot of the bed and the transient paralysis of horror laid hold of her She became bereft of the power to grasp and hold and the automatic slipped from her fingers and thudded on the carpet On the floor lay poor Johnny Two Hawks crumpled grotesquely a streak of blood zigzagging across his forehead to all appearances dead CHAPTER VII Twice before in her life Kitty had looked upon death by violence and it required only this present picture to convince her that she would never be able to gaze upon it callously without pity and terror Newspaper life at least the reportorial side of it has an odd effect upon men and women it sharpens their tragical instincts and perceptions and dulls eternally the edge of tenderness and sentimentality It was natural for Kitty to possess the keenest perceptions of tragedy but she had been taken out of the reportorial field in time to preserve all her tenderness and romanticism Otherwise she would have seen in that crumpled object with the sinister daub of blood on the forehead merely a story and would have approached it from that angle But was he dead She literally forced her steps toward the body and stared She dropped to her knees because they were threatening to buckle in one of those flashes of physical incoordination to which the strongest will must bow occasionally She was no longer afraid of the tragedy but she feared the great surging pity that was striving to express itself in sobs and she knew that if she surrendered she would forthwith become hysterical for the rest of the evening and incompetent to carry out the plan in her head A strong healthy young man done to death in this fashion only a few minutes after he had left her kitchen Somehow she could not look upon him as a stranger She had given him food she had talked to him she had even laughed with him He was not like those dead she had seen in her reportorial days Her orbit and Johnny Two Hawks had indeterminately touched she had known old Gregory or Gregor who had been this unfortunate young man s friend And he had hoped they might never meet again The murderous scoundrels had been watching They must have entered the apartment shortly after he had entered hers Conceivably they would have Gregor s key And they had watched and waited striking him down it may have been at the very moment he had crossed the sill of the window Her hand shook so idiotically that it was impossible for a time to tell if the man s heart was beating All at once a wave of hot fury rushed over her fury at the cowardliness of the assault and the vertigo passed She laid her palm firmly over Johnny Two Hawks heart Alive He was alive She straightened his body and put a pillow under his head Then she sought water and towels There was no cut on his forehead only blood but the top of his head had been cruelly beaten He was alive but without immediate aid he might die The poor young man There were two physicians in the block one or the other would be in She ran to the door to find it locked She had forgotten Next she found the telephone wire cut and the speaking tube battered and inutile She would have to return to her own apartment to summon help She dared not leave the light on The scoundrels might possibly return and the light would warn them that their victim had been discovered and naturally they would wish to ascertain whether or not they had succeeded in their murderous assault As she was passing the first landing windows she saw Cutty emerging from the elevator She flew across the fire escape platform with the resilient step of one crossing thin ice Probably the most astonished man in New York was the war correspondent when the door opened and a pair of arms were flung about him and a voice smothered in the lapel of his coat cried Oh Cutty I never was so glad to see any one What in the name of Come We ll handle this ourselves Hurry She dragged him along by the sleeve But It is life and death No talk now Cutty immaculate in his evening clothes very much perturbed went along after her As she passed through the kitchen window and beckoned him to follow he demurred Kitty what the deuce is going on here I ll answer your questions when we get him into my apartment They tried to murder him left him there to die Cutty possessed a great art an art highly developed only in explorers and newspaper reporters of the first order adaptability of being able to cast aside instantly the conventions of civilization and let down the bars to the primordial the instinctive and the natural Thus the Cutty who stepped out beside Kitty into the drizzle was not the Cutty she had admitted into the apartment She did not recognize this remarkable transition until later and then she discovered that Cutty the suave and lackadaisical in idleness was a tremendous animal hibernating behind a crackle shell Ordinarily Cutty would have declined to come through this shell thin as it was he liked these catnaps between great activities But this lovely creature was Conover s daughter and she would have the seventh sense divination of the born reporter Something big was in the air Go on he said briskly I m at your heels And stoop as you pass those hall windows No use throwing a silhouette for somebody in those rear houses to see Old Tommy Conover s daughter sure pop There you go under the ladder You ve dished the whole affair whatever it is No no Just spoofing Kitty A long face is no good anywhere even at a funeral This window All right Know where the lights are Very good When Cutty saw the man on the floor he knelt quickly Nasty bang on the head but he s alive What s this His cap Poughkeepsie By George padded with his handkerchief Must have known something was going to fall on him Now what s it all about When we get him to my apartment Yours Good Lord what s the matter with this They tried to kill him here They might return to see if they had succeeded They mustn t find where he has gone I m strong I can take hold of his knees Tut Neither of us could walk backward over that fire escape He looks husky but I ll try it Now obey me without question or comment You ll have to help me get him outside the window and in through yours Between the two windows I can handle him alone I only hope we shan t be noticed for that might prove awkward Now take hold

none	none	When I m through the window just push his legs outside Panting Kitty obeyed All right said Cutty I like your pluck You run along ahead and be ready to help me in with him A healthy beggar Here goes With a heave and a hunch and another heave Cutty stood up the limp body disposed scientifically across his shoulders Kitty was quite impressed by this exhibition of strength in a man whom she considered as elderly old There was an underthought that such feats of bodily prowess were reserved for young men With the naive conceit of twenty four she ignored the actual mathematics of fifty years of clean living and thinking missed the physiological fact that often men at fifty are stronger and tougher than men in the twenties They never waste energy their precision of movement and deliberation of thought conserve the residue against the supreme moment As a parenthesis To a young woman what is a hero Generally something conjured out of a book she has read the unknown handsome young man across the street the leading actor in a society drama the idol of the movie A hero must of necessity be handsome that is the first essential If he happens to be brave and debonair rich and aristocratic so much the better Somehow to be brave and to be heroic are not actually accepted synonyms in certain youthful feminine minds For instance every maid will agree that her father is brave but tell her he is a hero because he pays his bills regularly and she will accept the statement with a smile of tolerant indulgence Thus Kitty viewed Cutty s activities with a thrill of amazed wonder Had the young man hoisted Cutty to his shoulders her feeling would have been one of exultant admiration Let age crown its garnered wisdom youth has no objections to that but feats of physical strength that is poaching upon youth s preserves Kitty was not conscious of the instinctive resentment At that moment Cutty was to her the most extraordinary old man in the world Forward he whispered I want to know why I am doing this movie stunt The journey began with Kitty in the lead She prayed that no one would see them as they passed the two landing windows Below and above were vivid squares of golden light She regretted the drizzle no clothes laden lines intervened to obscure their progress Someone in the rear of the houses in Seventy ninth Street might observe the silhouettes The whole affair must be carried off secretly or their efforts would come to nothing Once inside the kitchen Cutty shifted his burden into his arms the way one carries a child and followed Kitty into the unused bedroom He did not wait for the story but asked for the telephone I m going to call for a surgeon at the Lambs He s just back from France and knows a lot about broken heads And we can trust him absolutely
1789_142896_000048_000001	train-clean-360	 I told him to 
none	none	wait there until I called Cutty you re a dear I don t wonder father loved you Presently he turned away from the telephone He ll be here in a jiffy Now then what the deuce is all this about Briefly Kitty narrated the episodes Samaritan stuff I see Any absorbent cotton I can wash the wound after a fashion Warm water and Castile soap We can have him in shape for Harrison Alone Cutty took note of several apparent facts The victim s flannel shirt was torn at the collar and there were marks of finger nails on the throat and chest Upon close inspection he observed a thin red line round the neck the mark of a thong Had they tried to strangle him or had he carried something of value Silk underwear and a clean body well born foreign After a conscientious hesitance Cutty went through the pockets All he found were some crumbs of tobacco and a soggy match box They had cleaned him out evidently There were no tailors labels in any of the pockets but there were signs that these had once existed The man on the bed had probably ripped them out himself did not care to be identified A criminal in flight Cutty studied the face on the pillow Shorn of that beard it would be handsome not the type criminal certainly A bit of natural cynicism edged into his thoughts Kitty had seen through the beard otherwise she would have turned the affair over to the police Not at all like her mother yet equally her mother s match in beauty and intelligence Conover s girl whose eyes had nearly popped out of her head at the first sight of those drum lined walls of his Two Hawks What was it that was trying to stir in his recollection Two Hawks He was sure he had heard that name before Hawksley meant nothing at all but Two Hawks possessed a strange attraction He stared off into space He might have heard the name in a tongue other than English A sound It came from the lips of the young man Cutty frowned The poor chap wasn t breathing in a promising way he groaned after each inhalation And what had become of the old fellow Kitty called Gregory A queer business Kitty came in with a basin and a roll of absorbent cotton He is groaning she whispered Pretty rocky condition I should say That handkerchief in his cap doubtless saved him Now little lady I frankly don t like the idea of his being here Suppose he dies In that event there ll be the very devil to pay You re all alone here without even a maid Am I all alone softly Well no come to think of it I m no longer your godfather in theory Give me the cotton and hold the basin He was very tender The wound bled a little but it was not the kind that bled profusely It was less a cut than a smashing bruise Well that s all I can do Who was this tenant Gregory A dear old man A valet at a Broadway hotel Oh I forgot Johnny Two Hawks called him Stefani Gregor Stefani Gregor Yes 
1789_142896_000012_000001	train-clean-360	What is it 
none	none	Why do you say it like that Say it like what sparring for time As if you had heard the name before Just as I thought cried Cutty his nimble mind pouncing upon a happy invention You re romantic Kitty You re imagining all sorts of nonsense about this chap and you must not let the situation intrigue you If I spoke the name oddly this Stefani Gregor it was because I sensed in a moment that this was a bit of the overflow Southeastern Europe where the good Samaritan gets kicked instead of thanked Now here s a good idea Of course we can t turn this poor chap loose upon the public now that we know his life is in danger That s always the trouble with this Samaritan business When you commit a fine action you assume an obligation You hoist the Old Man of the Sea on your shoulders as it were The chap cannot be allowed to remain here So if Harrison agrees we ll take him up to my diggings where no Bolshevik will ever lay eyes upon him Bolshevik For the sake of a handle They might be Chinamen for all I know I can take care of him until he is on his feet And you will be saved all this annoyance But I don t believe it s going to be an annoyance I m terribly interested and want to see it through If he can be moved out he goes No arguments He can t stay in this apartment That s final Exactly why not Kitty demanded rebelliously Because I say so Kitty Is Stefani Gregor an undesirable You knew him What do you say countered her godfather evading the trap The innocent child He smiled inwardly Kitty was keen She sensed an undercurrent and her first attempt to touch it had failed The mere name of Stefani Gregor had not roused Cutty s astonishment She was quite positive that the name was not wholly unfamiliar to her father s friend Still something warned her not to press in this direction He would be on the alert She must wait until he had forgotten the incident So she drew up a chair beside the bed and sat down Cutty leaned against the footrail his expression neutral He sighed inaudibly His delightful catnap was over Stefani Gregor Kitty s neighbour a valet in a fashionable hotel Stefani Gregor who upon a certain day had placed the drums of jeopardy in the palms of a war correspondent known to his familiars as Cutty And who was this young man on the bed There goes the bell cried Kitty jumping up Wait The ring was repeated vigorously and impatiently Kitty I don t quite like the sound of that bell Harrison would have no occasion to be impatient Somebody in a hurry Now attend to me I m going to steal out to the kitchen Don t be afraid Call if I m needed Open the door just a crack with your foot against it If it s Harrison he ll be in uniform Call out his name Slam the door if it is someone you don t know Kitty opened the door as instructed but she swung it wide because one of the men outside was a policeman The man behind him was a thickset squat individual with puffed discoloured eyes and a nose that reminded Kitty of an alligator pear What s going on here the policeman demanded to know CHAPTER VIII A phrase apparently quite irrelevant to the situation shot into Kitty s head Moribund perspectives Instantly she knew with that foretasting mind of hers that the man peering over the policeman s shoulder and Johnny Two Hawks had met somewhere that day She was now able to compare the results and she placed the victory on Two Hawks brow Yonder individual somehow justified the instinct that had prompted her to play the good Samaritan Whence had this gorilla come He was not one of the men who had issued in such dramatic haste from the Gregor apartment This man here saw you and another carrying someone across the fire escape What s the rumpus The policeman was not exactly belligerent but he was dutifully determined And though he was ready to grant that this girl with the Irish eyes was beautiful a man never could tell There s been a tragedy of some kind began Kitty This man certainly did see us carrying a man across the fire escape He had been set upon and robbed in the apartment across the way Why didn t you call in the police Because he might have died before you got here Where s the man who helped you Gone He was an outsider He was afraid of getting mixed up in a police affair and ran away Behind the kitchen door Cutty smiled She would do this girl Sounds all right said the policeman I ll take a look at the man This way if you please said Kitty readily You come too sir she added as the squat man hesitated Kitty wanted to watch his expression when he saw Johnny Two Hawks Seed on rocky soil nothing came of the little artifice No Buddha s graven face was less indicative than the squat man s Perhaps his face was too sore to permit mobility of expression The drollery of this thought caused a quirk in one corner of Kitty s mouth The squat man stopped at the foot of the bed with the air of a mere passer by and seemed more interested in the investigations of the policeman than in the man on the bed But Kitty knew A fine bang on the coco was the policeman s observation Take anything out of his pockets They were quite empty I ve sent for a military surgeon He may arrive at any moment This fellow live across the way That s the odd part of it No he doesn t Then what was he doing there Probably awaiting the return of the real tenant who hasn t returned up to this hour with an oblique glance at the squat man Kind o queer Say you stay here and watch the lady while I scout round The squat man nodded and leaned over the foot of the bed The policeman stalked out I was in the kitchen said Kitty confidingly I saw shadows on the window curtain It did not look right So I started to inquire and almost bumped into two men leaving the apartment They took to their heels when they saw me Again the squat man nodded He appeared to be a good listener Where were you when we crossed the fire escape In the yard on the other side of the fence There was reluctance in the guttural voice Oh I see You live there As this was a supposition and not a direct query the squat man wagged his head affirmatively Kitty her ears strained for disquieting sounds in the kitchen laid her palm on the patient s cheek It was very hot She dipped a bit of cotton into the water which had grown cold and dampened the wounded man s cheeks and throat Not that she expected to accomplish anything by this act it relieved the nerve tension This man was no fool If her surmises were correct he was a strong man both in body and in mind In a rage he would be terrible However had Johnny Two Hawks done it beaten the man and escaped No doubt he had been watching all the time and had at length stepped in to learn if his subordinates had followed his instructions and to what extent they had succeeded If he dies it will be murder It is a big city And so many terrible things happen like this every day But sooner or later those who commit them are found out Nemesis always follows on the heels of vengeance For the first time there was a flash of interest in the battered eyes of the intruder Perhaps he saw that this was not only a pretty woman but a keen one and sensed the veiled threat Moreover he knew that she had lied at one point There had been no light in the room across the court But what in the world was happening out there in the kitchen Kitty wondered So far not a sound Had Cutty really taken flight And why shouldn t he have faced it out at her side Very odd on Cutty s part Shortly she heard the heavy shoes of the policeman returning Guess it s all right miss I ll report the affair at the precinct and have an ambulance sent over You ll have to come along with me sir Is that legally necessary asked the squat man rather perturbed Sure You saw the thing and I verified it declared the policeman It won t take ten minutes Your name and address in case this man dies I see Very well Kitty wasn t sure but the policeman seemed embarrassed about something The directness was gone from his eyes and his speech was no longer brisk My name is Conover said Kitty I got that coming in replied the policeman We ll be on our way Not once again did the squat man glance at the man on the bed He followed the policeman into the hall his air that of one who had accepted a certain obligation to community welfare and cancelled it Kitty shut the door and leaned against it weakly Where had Cutty gone Even as she expressed the query she smelt burning tobacco She ran out into the kitchen to behold Cutty seated in a chair calmly smoking his infamous pipe And I thought you were gone What did you say to that policeman I hypnotized him Kitty The newspaper No Just looked into his eye and made a few passes with my hands Of course if you believe you ought not to tell me said Kitty which is the way all women start their wheedling Cutty looked into the bowl of his pipe Kitty when you throw a cobble into a pond what happens A splash But did you ever notice the way the ripples have of running on and on until they touch the farthest shore Yes And this is a ripple from some big stone cast into the pond of southeastern Europe I understand That s just the difficulty If you understood nothing it would be much easier for me But you know just enough to want to follow up on your own hook I know nothing definitely I have only suspicions I calmed that policeman by showing him a blanket police power issued by the commissioner I want you to pack up and move out of this neighbourhood It s not congenial to you I m afraid I can t afford to move until May I ll take care of that gladly to get you out of this garlicky ruin No Cutty I m going to stay here until the lease is up Gee whiz The Irish are all alike cried the war correspondent hopelessly Petticoat or pantaloon always looking for trouble No Cutty simply we don t run away from it And there s just as much Irish in you as there is in me Sure And for thirty years I ve gone hunting for trouble and never failed to find it I don t like this affair Kitty and because I don t I m going to risk my Samson locks in your lily white hands I am going to tell you two things I am a secret foreign agent of the United States Government Now don t light up that way Dark alleys and secret papers and beautiful adventuresses and bang bang have nothing at all to do with my job There isn t a grain of 
1789_142896_000060_000000	train-clean-360	romance 
none	none	in it Ostensibly I am a war correspondent I have handled all the big events in Serbia and Bulgaria and Greece and southwestern Russia Boiled down I am a census taker of undesirables Socialist anarchist and Bolshevik I photograph them in my mental fillums and transmit to Washington Thus when Feodor Slopeski lands at Ellis Island with the idea of blowing up New York he is returned with thanks I didn t ask for the job it was thrust upon me because of my knowledge of the foreign tongues I accepted it because I am a loyal American citizen And you left me because you didn t know who might be at the door Precisely I am known in lower New York under another name I m a rabid internationalist Down with everything I don t go out much these days keep under cover as much as I can Once recognized my value would be nil In a flannel shirt I m a dangerous codger And Gregor and this poor young man are in some way mixed up with internationalism Victims probably What is the other thing you wish to tell me Because your eyes are slate blue like your mother s I loved your mother Kitty said Cutty blinking into his pipe And the singular fact is your father knew but your mother never did I was never able to tell your mother after your father died Their bodies were separated but not their spirits Kitty nodded So that was it Poor Cutty I make this confession because I want you to understand my attitude toward you I am going to elect myself as your special guardian so long as I m in New York From now on when I ask you to do something understand that I believe it best for you If my suspicions are correct we are not dealing with fools but with madmen The most dangerous human being Kitty is an honest man with a half baked or crooked idea and that s what this world pother Bolshevism is honest men with crooked ideas carrying the torch of anarchism and believing it enlightenment What makes them tear down things Every beautiful building is only a monument to their former wretchedness and so they annihilate None of them actually knows what he wants A thousand will o the wisps in front of them and all alike A thousand years to throw off the shackles and they expect Utopia in ten minutes It makes you want to weep Socialism the brotherhood of man is a beautiful thing theoretically but it is like some plays they read well but do not act Lopping off heads believing them to be ideas The poor things That s it Though I betray them I pity them Democracy slowly and surely As prickly with faults as a cactus pear but every year there are less prickles We don t stand still or retrogress we keep going on and up Take this town Think of It to day and compare it with the town your father knew There s the bell I imagine that will be Harrison If we can move this chap will you go to a hotel for the night I m going to stay here Cutty That s final Cutty sighed CHAPTER IX At the precinct station the squat man gave a name and an address to the bored sergeant at the desk passed out a cigar lit one himself expressed some innocuous opinions upon one or two topics of the day and walked leisurely out of the precinct He wanted to laugh These pigheads had never thought to question his presence in the backyard of the house in Seventy ninth Street It was the way he had carried himself Those years in New York prior to the war had not been wasted The brass buttoned fools Serenely unconscious that he was at liberty by explicit orders because the Department of Justice did not care to trap a werewolf before ascertaining where the pack was and what the kill he proceeded leisurely to the corner turned and broke into a run which carried him to a drug store in Eightieth Street Here he was joined by two men apparently coal heavers by the look of their hands and faces They will take him to a hospital Find where then notify me Remember this is your business and woe to you if you fail Where is it One of the men extended an object wrapped in ordinary grocer s paper Ha That s good I shall enjoy myself presently Remember telephone me the moment you learn where they take him He is still alive bunglers And you came away empty handed There was nothing on him We searched He has hidden them in one of those rooms I ll attend to that later Watch the hospital for an hour or so then telephone for information regarding his condition Is that motor for me Very good Remember Inside the taxicab the squat man patted the object on his knees and chuckled from time to time audibly It would be worth all that journey all he had gone through since dawn that morning Stefani Gregor After these seven long years the man who had betrayed him To reach into his breast and squeeze his heart as one might squeeze a bit of cheese Many things to tell many pictures to paint He rode far downtown wound in and out of the warehouse district for a while then dismissed the taxi and proceeded on foot to his destination a decayed brick mansion of the forty s sandwiched in between two deserted warehouses In the hall of the first landing a man sat in a chair under the gas reading a newspaper At the approach of the squat man he sprang to his feet but a phrase dissipated his apprehension and he nodded toward a door Unlock it for me and see that I am not disturbed Presently the squat man stood inside the room which was dark He struck a match and peered about for the candle The light discovered a room barren of all furniture excepting the table upon which stood the candle and a single chair In this chair was a man bound He was small and dapper his gray hair swept back a la Liszt His chin was on his breast his body limp Apparently the bonds alone held him in the chair The squat man laid his bundle on the table and approached the prisoner Stefani Gregor look up it is I He drummed on his chest like a challenging gorilla I Boris Karlov Slowly the eyelids of the prisoner went up revealing mild blue eyes But almost instantly the mildness was replaced by an agate hardness and the body became upright Yes it is Boris whom you betrayed But I escaped by a hair Stefani and we meet again What good to tell this poor madman that Stefani Gregor had not betrayed him that he had only warned those marked for death There was no longer reason inside that skull To die probably in a few moments So be it Had he not been ready for seven years But that poor boy to have come all these thousands of miles only to walk into a trap Had he found that note Had they killed him Doubtless they had or Boris Karlov would not be in this room We killed him to night Stefani in your rooms We threw out the food so he would have to seek something to eat The last of that breed stem and branch We are no longer the mud we ourselves are the heels We are conquering the world Today Europe is ours to morrow America A wintry little smile stirred the lips of the man in the chair America with its keen perceptions of the ridiculous its withering humour No more the dissolute opera dancers will dance to your fiddling Stefani while we starve in the town Fiddler valet tutor the rivers and seas of Russia are red We roll east and west and our emblem is red Stem and branch We ground our heels in their faces as for centuries they ground theirs in ours He escaped us there but I was Nemesis He died to night The body in the chair relaxed a little He was clean and honest Boris I made him so He would have done fine things if you had let him live That breed Why you yourself loved him when he was a boy Stem and branch I loved my little sister Anna too But what did they do to her behind those marble walls Did you fiddle for her What was she when they let her go My pretty little Anna The fires of hell for those damned green stones of yours Stefani She heard of them and wanted to see them and you promised I I never promised Anna So that was it Boris I only saw her there I never knew what brought her But the boy was in England then The breed the breed roared the squat man Ha but you should have seen Those gay officers and their damned master we left them with their faces in the mud Stefani in the mud And the women begged Fine music Those proud hearts begging Boris Karlov for their lives their faces in the mud You born of us in those Astrakhan Hills you denied us because you liked your fiddle and a full belly and to play keeper of those emeralds The winding paths of torture and misery and death by which they came into the possession of that house And always the proletariat has had to pay in blood and daughters You of the people to betray us I did not betray you I only tried to save those who had been kind to me A cunning light shot into Karlov s eyes The emeralds He struck his pocket Here Stefani and they shall be broken up to buy bread for our people That poor boy So he brought them What are you going to do with me Watch you grow thin Stefani You want death you shall want food instead Oh a little enough to keep you alive You must learn what it is to be hungry The squat man picked up the bundle from the table and tore off the wrapping paper A violin the colour of old Burgundy lay revealed Boris The man in the chair writhed Have I waked you Stefani tenderly The Stradivarius the very grand duke of fiddles And he and his damned officers how they used to call out Get Stefani to fiddle for us And you fiddled dragged your genius though the mud to keep your belly warm To save a soul Boris the boy s When I fiddled his uncle forgot to drag him into an orgy Ah yes I fiddled fiddled because I had promised his mother The Italian singer She was lucky to die when she did She did not see the torch the bayonet and the mud But the boy did with his English accent How he escaped I don t know but he died to night and the emeralds are in my pocket See Karlov held the instrument close to the other s face Look at it well this grand duke of fiddles Look fiddler look The huge hands pressed suddenly There was brittle crackling and a rare violin became kindling A sob broke from the prisoner s lips What to Karlov was a fiddle to him was a soul He saw the madman fling the wreckage to the floor and grind his heels into the fragments Gregor shut his eyes but he could not shut his ears and he sensed in that cold demoniacal fury of the crunching heel the rising of maddened peoples CHAPTER X Meanwhile Captain Harrison of the Medical Corps entered the Conover apartment briskly You old vagabond what have you been up to I beg pardon as he saw Kitty emerge from behind Cutty s bulk This is Miss Conover Harrison Very pleased I m sure Luckily my case was in the coat room at the club I took the liberty of telephoning for Miss Frances who returned on the same ship with me I concluded that your friend would need a nurse Let me have a look at him Callously but lightly and skillfully the surgeon examined the battered head Escaped concussion by a hair you might say Probably had his cap on That black eye though is an older affair Who is he I suspect he s some political refugee We don t know a thing about him otherwise How soon can he be moved He ought to be moved at once and given the best of care I can give him that in my eagle s nest Harrison this chap s life is in danger and if we get him into my lofty diggings they won t be able to trace him Not far from here there s a private hospital I know It goes through from one street to the next I know the doctor We ll have the ambulance carry the patient there but at the rear I ll have one of the office newspaper trucks And after a little wait we ll shoot the stretcher into the truck The police will not bother us I ve seen to that I rather believe it falls in with some of my work The main idea of course is to rid Miss Conover of any trouble Just as you say agreed the surgeon That s all I can do for the present I ll run down to the entrance and wait for The nurse Will he live asked Kitty Of course he will He is in good physical condition Imagine he has simply been knocked out Serious only if unattended Your finding him probably saved him Twelve hours will tell the story May be on his feet inside a week Still it would be advisable to keep him in bed as long as possible Fagged out I should say from that beard I ll go down and wait for Miss Frances And ring three times when you return advised Cutty All right Did they try to strangle him or did he have something round his neck Hanged if I know All out of the room now I want it dark Just as soon as the nurse arrives I ll return Three rings Harrison left the apartment Cutty spent a few minutes at the telephone then he joined Kitty in the living room Kitty what was the stranger like Like a gorilla He spoke English as if he had a cold Cutty scowled into space Have a scar over an eyebrow Good gracious I couldn t tell Both his eyes were black and his nose banged dreadfully Johnny Two Hawks probably did it Bully for Two Hawks Kitty you re a marvel Not a flivver from the start And those slate blue eyes of yours don t miss many things Listen she interrupted taking hold of his sleeve Hear it Only the Elevated Tumpitum tump Tumpitum tump Cutty you hypnotized me this afternoon with your horrid drums The emeralds He managed to repress the start I don t know what it is drums anyhow Maybe it is the emeralds Something has been happening ever since you told me about them the misery and evil that follow their wake But the story goes that women are immune Kitty Nonsense No woman is immune where a wonderful gem is concerned And yet I ve common sense and humour And a lot more besides Kitty You re a raving howling little beauty and how you ve remained out of captivity this long is a puzzler to me Haven t you got a beau somewhere No Cutty Perhaps I m one of those who are quite willing to wait patiently If the one I want doesn t come why I ll be a jolly philosophical old maid No seconds or culls for me as the magazine editor says Exactly what do you want Cutty was keenly curious for some reason he could not define He did not care for diamonds as stones but he admired any personality that flashed differently from each new angle exposed Oh a man among other things I don t mean one of those godlike chromos in the frontispiece of popular novels He hasn t got to be handsome But he must be able to laugh when he s happy when he s hurt I must be his business in life He must know a lot about things I know I want a comrade who will come to me when he has a joke or an ache A gay man and whimsical The law can make any man a husband but only God can make a good comrade Kitty said Cutty his fine eyes sparkling I shan t have to watch over you so much as I thought On the other hand you have described me to a dot Quite possibly Vanity has its uses It keeps us in contact with bathtubs and nice clothes I imagine that you would make both husband and comrade or you would have twenty years ago without intentional cruelty Wasn t Cutty fifty two Kitty you ve touched a vital point It took those twenty years to make me companionable Experience is something we must buy it isn t left in somebody s will Let us say that I possess all the necessary attributes save one And what is that Youth Kitty And take the word of a senile old dotard your young man when you find him will lack many of the attributes you require On the other hand there is always the possibility that these will develop as you jog along The terrible pity of youth is that it has the habit of conferring these attributes rather than finding them You put garlands on the heads of snow images and the first glare of sunshine pouf Cutty I m beginning to like you immensely smiling Perhaps women ought to have two husbands one young and handsome and the other old and wise like yourself Cutty wished he were alone in order to analyze the stab Old When he knew that mentally and physically he could take and break a dozen Two Hawks Old He had never thought himself that Fifty two years they had piled up on him without his appreciation of the fullness of the score And yet he was more than a match for any ordinary man of thirty in sinew and brain and no man met the new morning with more zest than he himself met it But to Kitty he was old Lavender and oak leaves were being draped on his door knob He laughed Why do you laugh Oh because Hark The two of them ran to the bedroom door Olga Olga And then a guttural level jumble of sounds Kitty s quick brain reached out for a similitude water rushing over ragged boulders Olga she whispered He is a Russian There are Serbian Olgas and Bulgarian Olgas and Rumanian Olgas Probably his sweetheart The poor thing Sounds like Russian added Cutty his conscience pricking him But he welcomed that Olga It would naturally put a damper on Kitty s interest There s Harrison with the nurse Quarter of an hour later the patient was taken down to the ambulance and conveyed to the private hospital Cutty had no way of ascertaining whether they were followed but he hoped they would be The knowledge that their victim was in a near by hospital would naturally serve to relax the enemy vigilance temporarily and this would permit safely and secretly the second leg of the journey that to his own apartment He decided to let an hour go past then Two Hawks was taken through the building to the rear and transferred to the truck Cutty sat with the driver while Captain Harrison and the nurse rode inside with the patient On the way Cutty was rather disturbed by the deep impression Kitty Conover had made upon his heart and mind That afternoon he had looked upon her with fatherly condescension as the pretty daughter of the two he had loved most From the altitude of his fifty two he had gazed down upon her twenty four weighing her as like all young women of twenty four pleasure loving and beau hunting and fashion scorched and in a flash she had revealed the formed mind of a woman of thirty Altitude He had forgotten that relative to altitudes there are always two angles of vision that from the summit and that from the green valley below Kitty saw him beyond the tree line but just this side of the snows and matched his condescension with pity He chuckled Doddering old ass what did it matter how she looked at him Beautiful and young and full of common sense yet dangerously romantical To wait for the man she wanted what did that signify but romance And there was her Irish blood to consider The association of pretty nurse and interesting patient always afforded excellent background for sentimental nonsense the obligations of the one and the gratitude of the other Well he had nipped that in the bud And why hadn t he taken this Two Hawks person how easy it was to fall into Kitty s way of naming the chap why hadn t he taken him directly to the Roosevelt Why all this pother and secrecy over a total stranger Stefani Gregor who lived opposite Kitty and who hadn t prospered particularly since the day he had exhibited the drums of jeopardy he was the reason These were volcanic days and a friend of Stefani Gregor who played the violin like Paganini might well be worth the trouble of a little courtesy Then too there was that mark of the thong a charm a military identification disk or something of value Whatever it was the rogues had got it Murder and loot And as soon as he returned to consciousness the young fellow would be making inquiries Perhaps Kitty s point of view regarding a certain duffer aged fifty two was nearer the truth than the duffer himself realized Second childhood As if the drums of jeopardy would ever again see light after that tempest of fire and death that mud volcano One thing was certain there would be no more cat napping The game was on again He was assured of that side of it Green stones the sunlight breaking against the flaws in a shower of golden sparks green as the pulp of a Champagne grape the drums of jeopardy Murder and loot he could understand Immediately after the patient was put to bed Cutty changed A nondescript suit of the day labourer type and a few deft touches of coal dust completed his make up I shan t be back until morning he announced Work to do Kuroki will be at your service through the night Miss Frances Strike that Burmese gong once at any hour Come along Harrison Want any company asked Harrison with a belligerent twist to his moustache Cutty laughed No You run along to your lambs I m running with the wolves to night old scout and you might get that spick and span uniform considerably mussed up Besides it s raining But what s to become of Miss Conover She ought not to remain alone in that apartment Well well I thought of that too But she can take care of herself Those ruffians may call up the hospital and learn that we tricked them And then Try to force the truth from Miss Conover That s precisely the wherefore of this coal dust On your way Eleven o clock Kitty was in the kitchen without light her chair by the window which she had thrown up She had gone to bed but sleep was impossible So she decided to watch the Gregor windows Sometimes the mind is like a movie camera set for a double exposure The whole scene is visible but the camera sees only half of it Thus while she saw the windows across the court there entered the other side of her mind a picture of the immaculate Cutty crossing the platform with Johnny Two Hawks thrown over his shoulder The mental picture obscured the actual She had called him old Well he was old And no doubt he looked upon her as a child wanting her to spend the night at a hotel The affair was over No one would bother Kitty Conover Why should they But it took strength to shoulder a man like that What fun he and her father must have had together And Cutty had loved her mother That made Kitty exquisitely tender for a moment All alone at the age when new friendships were impossible A lovable man like that going down through life alone Census taker of alien undesirables a queer occupation for a man so famous as Cutty Patriotism to plunge into that seething revolutionary scum to sort the dangerous madmen from the harmless mad men Courage and strength and mental resource yes Cutty possessed these and he would be the kind to laugh at a joke or a hurt One thing however was indelibly printed on her mind Stefani Gregor either Cutty had met and known the man or he had heard of him Suddenly she became conscious that she was blinking as one blinks from mirror reflected sunlight She cast about for the source of this phenomenon Obliquely from between the interstices of the fire escape platform came a point of moving white light She craned her neck A battery lamp The round spot of light worked along the cement floor vanished occasionally reappeared and then vanished altogether Somebody was down there hunting for something What Kitty remained with her head out of the window for some time unmindful of the spatter of rain But nothing happened The man was gone Of course the incident might not have the slightest bearing upon the previous adventures of this amazing night still it was suggestive The young man had worn something round his neck But if his enemies had it why should this man comb the court unless he was a tenant and had knocked something off a window ledge She began to appreciate that she was very tired and decided to go back to bed This time she fell asleep Her disordered thoughts rearranged themselves in a dazzling dream She found herself wandering through a glorious translucent green cavern a huge emerald And in the distance she heard that unmistakable tumpitum tump tumpitum tump It drew her irresistibly She fought and struggled against the fascinating sound but it continued to draw her on Suddenly from round a corner came the squat man his hair a la Fuzzy Wuzzy He caught her savagely by the shoulder and dragged her toward a fire of blazing diamonds On the other side of that fire was a blonde young woman with a tiara of rubies on her head Save me I am Olga Olga Kitty struggled fiercely and awoke The light was on At the side of her bed were two men One of them was holding her bare shoulder and digging his fingers into it cruelly They looked like coal heavers We do not wish to harm you and won t if you re sensible Where did they take the man you brought CHAPTER XI Kitty did not wrench herself loose at once She wasn t quite sure that this was not a continuance of her nightmare She knew that nightmares had a way of breaking off in the middle of things of never arriving anywhere The room looked natural enough and the pain in her shoulder seemed real enough but one never could tell She decided to wait for the next episode Answer cried the spokesman of the two twisting Kitty s shoulder Where did they take him Awake Kitty wrenched her shoulder away and swept the bedclothes up to her chin She was thoroughly frightened but her brain was clear The spark of self preservation flew hither and about in search of expediencies temporizations She must come through this somehow with the vantage on her side She could not possibly betray that poor young man for that would entail the betrayal of Cutty also She saw but one avenue the telephone and these two men were on the wrong side of the bed between her and the door What do you want Her throat was so dry she wondered whether the words were projected far enough for them to hear We want the address of the wounded man you brought into this apartment They took him to a hospital He was taken away from there He was Yes he was You may not know where but you will know the address of the man who tricked us and that will be sufficient The army surgeon He was called in by chance I don t know where he lives The man in the dress suit He was with the surgeon He came first Come we have no time to waste We don t want to hurt you and we hope you will not force us Will you step out of the room while I dress No Tell us where the man lives and you can have the whole apartment to yourself You speak English very well Enough Do you want us to bundle you up in the bedclothes and carry you off It will not be a pleasant experience for a pretty young woman like yourself Something happened to the man you knew as Gregory Will that make you understand You know what abduction means Your police will not catch us But I might give you the wrong address Try it and see what happens Young lady this is a bad affair for a woman to be mixed up in Be sensible We are in a hurry Well you seem to have acquired at least one American habit said a gruff voice from the bedroom doorway Raise your hands quickly and don t turn went on the gruff voice If I shoot it will be to kill It is a rough game as you say That s it and keep them up Now then young lady slip on your kimono Get up and search these men I m in a hurry too Kitty obeyed very lovely in her dishevelment Repugnant as the task was she disarmed the two men and flung their weapons on the bed Now something to tie their hands anything that will hold Kitty could see the speaker now Another coal heaver but evidently on her side Tie their hands behind them I warn you not to move men When I say I ll shoot I mean it Don t be afraid of hurting them miss Very good Now bandage their eyes Handkerchiefs But Kitty s handkerchiefs did not run to the dimensions required so she ripped up a petticoat Torn between her eagerness to complete a disagreeable task and her offended modesty Kitty went through the performance with creditable alacrity Then she jumped back into bed doubled her knees and once more drew up the bedclothes to her chin content to be a spectator her eyes as wide as ever they possibly could be Some secret service man Cutty had sent to protect her Dear old Cutty Small wonder he had urged her to spend the night at a hotel The admiration of her childhood returned but without the shackles of shyness She had always trusted him absolutely and to this trust was now added understanding To have him pop into her life again in this fashion all the ordinary approaches to intimacy wiped out by these amazing episodes the years bridged in an hour If only he were younger Watch them miss Don t be afraid to shoot I ll return in a moment still gruffly The secret service man pushed his prisoners into chairs and left the bedroom Kitty did not care how gruff the voice was it was decidedly pleasant in her ears Gingerly she picked up one of the revolvers Kitty Conover with shooting irons in her hands like a movie actress She heard a whistle After this an interval of silence save for the ticking of the alarm clock on the stand She eyed the blindfolded men speculatively swung out of bed and put on her stockings and sandals then she sat on the edge of the bed and waited for the sequence Kitty Conover was going to have some queer recollections to tell her grandchildren providing she had any That morning she had risen to face a humdrum normal day And here she was at midnight hobnobbing with quiescent murder and sudden death To morrow Burlingame would ask her to hustle up the Sunday stuff and she would hustle She wanted to laugh but was a little afraid that this laughter might degenerate into incipient hysteria There was still in her mind a vivid recollection of her dream the fire of diamonds and the blonde girl with the tiara of rubies Olga Olga Russian the whole affair was Russian She shivered Always that land and people had appeared to her in sinister aspect no doubt an impression acquired from reading melodramas written by Englishmen who once upon a time had given Russia preeminence as a political menace Russia in all things music art literature the tragic note Stefani Gregor and Johnny Two Hawks had roused the enmity of some political society with this result Nihilist or Bolshevist or socialist there was little choice and Cutty sensibly did not want her drawn into the whirlpool What a pleasant intimacy hers and Cutty s promised to be And if he hadn t casually dropped into the office that afternoon she would have surrendered the affair to the police and that would have been the end of it Amazing thought you might jog along all your life at the side of a person and never know him half so well as someone you met m a tense episode like that of the immaculate Cutty crossing the fire escape with Two Hawks on his shoulders She heard the friendly coal heaver going down the corridor to the door When he returned to the bedroom two men accompanied him Not a word was said The two men marched off with the prisoners and left Kitty alone with her saviour Thank you she said simply You poor little chicken did you believe I had deserted you The voice wasn t gruff now Cutty Kitty ran to him flinging her arms round his neck Oh Cutty Cutty s heart which had bumped along an astonishing number of million times in fifty two years registered a memorable bump against his ribs The touch of her soft arms and the faint indescribable perfume which emanates from a dainty woman s hair thrilled him beyond any thrill he had ever known For Kitty s mother had never put her arms round old Cutty s neck Of course he understood readily enough Molly s girl flesh of her flesh And she had rushed to him as she would have rushed to her father He patted her shoulder clumsily still a little dazzled for all the revelation in the analysis The sweet intimacy of it The door of Paradise opened for a moment and then shut in his face I did not recognize you at all she cried standing off I shouldn t have known you on the street And it is so simple What a wonderful man you are For an old codger Cutty s heart registered another sizable bump Kitty laughed Never call yourself old to me again Are you always doing these things Well I keep moving I suspected something like this might happen Those two will go to the Tombs to await deportation if they are aliens Perhaps we can dig something out of them relative to this man Gregor Anyhow we ll try Cutty I saw a man in the court with a pocket lamp before I went to bed He was hunting for something I didn t find anything but a lot of fresh food someone had thrown out It was you then Yes There was a vague possibility that your protege might have thrown out something valuable during the struggle What Lord knows A queer business Kitty you ve lugged me into my own And there is one thing I want you to remember particularly Life means nothing to the men opposed neither chivalry nor ethics Annihilation is their business They don t want civilization they want chaos They have lost the sense of comparisons or they would not seek to thrust Bolshevism down the throats of the rest of the world They say democracy has failed and their substitute is murder and loot Kitty I want you to leave this roost I shall stay until my lease expires Why In the face of real danger Because I intend to Cutty unless you kidnap me Have you any good reason You ll laugh but something tells me to stay here But Cutty did not laugh Very well Tomorrow an assistant janitor will be installed His name is Antonio Bernini Every night he will whistle up the tube Whistle back If you are going out for the evening notify him where you intend to go and when you expect to be back A wire from your bed to his cot will be installed In danger press the button That s the best I can do for you since you decide to stick I don t believe anything more will happen to night but from now on you will be watched Never come directly to my apartment Break your journey two or three times with taxis Always use Elevator Four The boy is mine belongs to the service So our Bolshevik friends won t gather anything about you from him As a matter of fact Cutty had now come to the conviction that it would be well to let Kitty remain here as a lure He had urged her to leave and she had refused so his conscience was tolerably clear Besides she would henceforth be guarded with a ceaseless efficiency second only to that which encompasses a President of the United States Always some man of the service would be watching those who watched her This was going to develop into a game of small nets one or two victims at a time Because these enemies of civilization lacked coherence in action there would be slim chance of rounding them up in bulk But from now on men would vanish one here a pair there perhaps on occasion four or five And those who had known them would know them no more The policy would be that employed by the British in the submarine campaign mysterious silence after the evanishment It s all so exciting said Kitty But that poor old man Gregor He had a wonderful violin Cutty and sometimes I used to hear him play folklore music sad haunting melodies We ll know in a little while what s become of him I doubt there is a foreign organization in the city that hasn t one or more of our men on the inside A word will be dropped somewhere I m rarely active on this side of the Atlantic and what I m doing now is practically due to interest But every active operative in New York Boston Philadelphia and Chicago is on the lookout for a man who if left free will stir up a lot of trouble He has leadership this Boris Karlov a former intimate here of Trotzky s We have reason to believe that he slipped through the net in San Francisco Probably under a cleverly forged passport Now please describe the man who came in with the policeman I haven t had time to make inquiries at the precinct where they will have a minute description of him He made me think of a gorilla just as I told you His face was pretty well banged up Naturally I did not notice any scar A dreadfully black beard shaven Squat powerful like a gorilla Lord I wish I d had a glimpse of him He s one of the few topnotchers I haven t met He s the spark the hand on the plunger The powder is all ready in this land of ours our job is to keep off the sparks until we can spread the stuff so it will only go puff instead of bang This man Karlov is bad medicine for democracy Poor devil Why do you say that Because I m honestly sorry for them This fellow Karlov has suffered He is now a species of madman nothing will cure He and his kind have gained their ends in Russia but the impetus to kill and burn and loot is still unchecked Sorry yes but we can t have them here They remind me of nothing so much as those blind deep sea monsters in one of Kipling s tales thrown up into air and sunlight by a submarine volcano slashing and bellowing But we can t have them here any longer Keep those revolvers under your pillow All you have to do is to point Nobody will know that you can t shoot And always remember we re watching over you Good night Mouquin s for lunch Well I ll be hanged But it can t be Kitty You and I must not be seen in public If that was Karlov you will be marked and so will any one who travels with you Good gracious Fact But come up to the roost changing taxis to morrow at five and have tea Down in the street Cutty bore into the slanting rain no longer a drizzle With his hands jammed in his side pockets and his gaze on the sparkling pavement he continued downtown in a dangerously ruminative frame of mind dangerous because had he been followed he would not have known it Molly Conover s girl That afternoon it had been Tommy Conover s girl now she was Molly s It occurred to him for the first time that he was one of those unfortunate individuals who are always able to open the door to Paradise for others and are themselves forced to remain outside Hadn t he introduced Conover to Molly and hadn t they fallen in love on the spot Too old to be a hero and not old enough to die He grinned Some day he would use that line Of course it wasn t Kitty who set this peculiar cogitation in motion It wasn t her arms and the perfume of her hair The actual thrill had come from a recrudescence of a vanished passion anyhow a passion that had been held suspended all these years Still it offered a disquieting prospect He was sensible enough to realize that he would be in for some confusion in trying to disassociate the phantom from the quick Most pretty young women were flitter flutters unstable shallow immature But this little lady had depth the sense of the living drama and Lord she was such a beauty Wanted a man who would laugh when he was happy and when he was hurt A bull s eye bang like that For the only breed worth its salt was the kind that laughed when happy and when hurt The average young woman rushing into his arms the way she had would not have stirred him in the least And immediately upon the heels of this thought came a taste of the confusion he saw in store for himself Was it the phantom or Kitty He jumped to another angle to escape the impasse Kitty s coming to him in that fashion raised an unpalatable suggestion He evidently looked fatherly no matter how he felt Hang these fifty two years to come crowding his doorstep all at once He raised his head and laughed He suddenly remembered now At nine that night he had been scheduled to deliver a lecture on the Italo Jugoslav muddle before a distinguished audience in the ballroom of a famous hotel He would have some fancy apologizing to do in the morning He stepped into a doorway then peered out cautiously There was not a single pedestrian in sight No need of hiking any further in this rain so he hunted for a taxi To morrow he would set the wires humming relative to old Stefani Gregor Boris Karlov if indeed it were he would lead the way Hadn t Stefani and Boris been boyhood friends and hadn t Stefani betrayed the latter in some political affair He wasn t sure but a glance among his nineteen twelve notes would clear up the fog But that young chap Who was he Cutty set his process of logical deduction moving Karlov always supposing that gorilla was Karlov had come in from the west So had the young man Gregor s inclinations had been toward the aristocracy at least that had been the impression A Bolshevik would not seek haven with a man like Gregor as this young man had But Two Hawks bothered him the name bothered him because it had no sense either in English or in Russian And yet he was sure he had heard it somewhere Perhaps his notes would throw some light on that subject too When he arrived home Miss Frances the nurse informed him that the patient was babbling in an outlandish tongue For a long time Cutty stood by the bedside translating Olga Olga And she gave me food Stefani this charming American girl Never must we forget that I was hungry and she gave me food But I paid for it You gone there was no one else And she is poor The torches I am burning burning Olga What does he say asked the nurse It is Russian Is it a crisis he evaded Not necessarily Doctor Harrison said he would probably return to consciousness sometime to morrow But he must have absolute quiet No visitors A bad blow but not of fatal consequence I ve seen hundreds of cases much worse pull out in a fortnight You d better go to bed sir All right said Cutty gratefully He was tired The ball did not rebound as it used to the resilience was petering out But look alive there Big events were toward and he must not stop to feel of his pulse Three o clock in the morning The man in the Gregor bedroom sat down on the bed the pocket lamp dangling from his hairy fingers Not a nook or cranny in the apartment had he overlooked In every cupboard drawer in the beds and under the trunks behind the radiators and the pictures the shelves and clothes in the closets What he sought he had not found His vengeance would not be complete without those green stones in his hands Anna would call from her grave Pretty little Anna who had trusted Stefani Gregor and gone to her doom All these thousands of miles by hook and crook by forged passports by sums of money sleepless nights and hungry days for this The last of that branch of the breed out of his reach and the stones vanished A queer superstition had taken lodgment in his brain he recognized it now for the first time The possession of those stones would be a sign from God to go on Green stones for bread Green stones for bread The drums of jeopardy In his hands they would be talismanic But wait That pretty girl across the way Supposing he had intrusted the stones to her Or hidden them there without her being aware of it CHAPTER XII Kitty Conover ate in the kitchen First off this statement is likely to create the false impression that there was an ordinary grain here a wedge of base hemlock in the citron Not so She ate in the kitchen because she could not yet face that vacant chair in the dining room without choking and losing her appetite She could not look at the chair without visualizing that glorious whimsical fascinating mother of hers who could turn grumpy janitors into comedians and send importunate bill collectors away with nothing but spangles in their heads So long as she stayed out of the dining room she could accept her loneliness with sound philosophy She knew as all sensible people know that there were ghosts that memory had haunted galleries and that empty chairs were evocations Her days were so busily active there were so many first nights and concerts that she did not mind such evenings as she had to spend alone in the apartment Persons were in and out of the office all through the day and many of them entertaining For only real persons ever penetrated that well guarded cubby hole off the noisy city room Many of them were old friends of her mother Of course they were a little pompous but this was less innate than acquired and she knew that below they were worth while She had come to the conclusion that successful actors and actresses were the only people in America who spoke English fluently and correctly Yes she ate in the kitchen but she would have been a fit subject for the fastidious Fragonard Kitty was naturally an exquisite Everything about her was dainty her body and her mind The background of pans and dishes gas range and sink did not absorb Kitty her presence here in the morning lifted everything out of the rut of commonplace and created an atmosphere that was ornamental Pink peignoir and turquoise blue boudoir cap silk petticoat and stockings and adorable little slippers No harm to tell the secret Kitty was educating herself for a husband She knew that if she acquired the habit of daintiness at breakfast before marriage it would become second nature after marriage Moreover she was determined that it should be tremendous news that would cause a newspaper to intervene She had all the confidence in the world in her mirror She got her breakfast this morning singing She was happy She had found a door out of monotony theatrical drama had given way to the living She had opened the book of adventure and she was going straight through to finis That there was an undertow of the sinister escaped her or she ignored it In all high strung Irish souls there is a bit of the old wife the foreteller the gift of prescience and Kitty possessed this in a mild degree Something held her here when for a dozen reasons she should have gone elsewhere She strained the coffee humming a tune out of The Mikado the revival of which she had seen lately My object all sublime I shall achieve in time To make the punishment fit the crime The punishment fit the crime And make the prisoner pent Unwillingly represent A source of innocent merriment Of innocent merriment And there you were To make the punishment fit the crime Wall in the Bolsheviki the I W W s the Red Socialist the anarchists and let them try it for ten years Those left would be glad enough to embrace democracy and sanity The poor benighted things to imagine that they were going forward there in Russia What kind of mentality was it that could conceive a blessing to humanity in the abolition of baths and work And Cutty felt sorry for them Well as for that so did Kitty Conover and she would continue feeling sorry for them so long as they remained thousands of miles away But next door Grapefruit eggs on toast and coffee mademoiselle is served she cried gayly sitting down and attacking her breakfast with the zest of healthy youth Often the eyes are like the lenses of a camera minus the sensitized plate they see objects without printing them Thus a dozen times Kitty s glance absently swept the range and the racks on each side of the stovepipe one rack burdened with an empty pancake jug and the other cluttered with old fashioned flatirons but she saw nothing She was carefully reviewing the events of the night before She could not dismiss the impression that Cutty knew Stefani Gregor or had heard of him and in either case it signified that Gregor was something more than a valet And decidedly Two Hawks was not of the Russian peasantry By the time she was ready to leave for the office the Irish blood in her was seething and bubbling and dancing She knew she would do crazy impulsive things all day It was easy to analyze this exuberance She had reached out into the dark and touched danger and found a new thrill in a humdrum world The Great Dramatist had produced a tremendous drama and she had watched curtain after curtain fall from the wrong side of the lights Now she had been given a speaking part and she would be down stage for a moment or two dusting the furniture while the stars were retouching their make up It was not the thought of Cutty of Gregor of Johnny Two Hawks of hidden treasure simply she had arrived somewhere in the great drama When she reached the office she had a hard time of it to settle down to the day s work Hustle up that Sunday stuff said Burlingame Kitty laughed Just as she had pictured it She hustled I have it she cried breaking a spell of silence What saint Vitus inquired Burlingame patiently No the Morgue What the dickens But Kitty was no longer there to answer In all newspaper offices there is a department flippantly designated as the Morgue Obituaries on ice as it were A photograph or an item concerning a great man a celebrated beauty or some notorious rogue from the king calibre down to Gyp the Blood brand all indexed and laid away against the instant need So running her finger tip down the K s Kitty found Karlov The half tone which she eventually exhumed from the tin box was an excellent likeness of the human gorilla who had entered her rooms with the policeman She would be able to carry this positive information to Cutty that afternoon When she left the office at four she took the Subway to Forty second Street She engaged a taxi from the Knickerbocker and discharged it at the north entrance to the Waldorf which she entered She walked through to the south entrance and got into another taxi She left this at Wanamaker s ducking and dodging through the crowded aisles She selected this hour because being a woman she knew that the press of shoppers would be the greatest during the day Karlov s man and the secret service operative detailed by Cutty both made the same mistake followed Kitty into the dry goods shop and lost her as completely as if she had popped up in China At quarter to five she stepped into Elevator Number Four of the building which Cutty called his home very well pleased with herself CHAPTER XIII To understand Kitty at this moment one must be able to understand the Irish and nobody does or can or will Consider her twenty four years her corpuscular inheritance the love of drama and the love of adventure Imagine possessing sound ideas of life and the ability to apply them and spiritually always galloping off on some broad highway more often than not furnished by some engaging scoundrel of a novelist and you will be able to construct a half tone of Kitty Conover That civilization might be actually on its deathbed that positively half of the world was starving and dying and going mad through the reaction of the German blight touched her in a detached way She felt sorry dreadfully sorry for the poor things but as she could not help them she dismissed them from her thoughts every morning after she had read the paper the way most of us do here in these United States You cannot grapple with the misery of an unknown person several thousand miles away That which had taken place during the past twenty four hours was to her a lark a blindman s buff for grown ups It was not in her to tremble to shudder to hesitate to weigh this and to balance that Irish curiosity Perhaps in the original that immortal line read The Irish rush in where angels fear to tread and some proofreader had a particular grudge against the race When the elevator reached the seventeenth floor the passengers surged forth All except Kitty who tarried We don t carry to the eighteenth miss I am Miss Conover she replied I dared not tell you until we were alone I see The boy nodded swept her with an appraising glance and sent the elevator up to the loft You understand If any one inquires about me you don t remember Yes miss The boss s orders And if any one does inquire you are to report at once That too The boy rolled back the door and Kitty stepped out upon a Laristan runner of rose hues and cobalt blue She wondered what it cost Cutty to keep up an establishment like this There were fourteen rooms seven facing the north and seven facing the west with glorious vistas of steam wreathed roofs and brick Matterhorns and the dim horizon touching the sea Fine rugs and tapestries and furniture gathered from the four ends of the world but wholly livable and in no sense atmospheric of the museum Cutty had excellent taste She had visited the apartment but twice before once in her childhood and again when she was eighteen Cutty had given a dinner in honour of her mother s birthday She smiled as she recalled the incident Cutty had placed a box of candles at the side of her mother s plate and told her to stick as many into the cake as she thought best Hello said Cutty emerging from one of the doors What the dickens have you been up to My man has just telephoned me that he lost track of you in Wanamaker s Kitty explained delighted Well well If you can lose a man such as I set to watch you you ll have no trouble shaking the others It was Karlov Cutty How did you learn Searched the morgue and found a half tone of him Positively Karlov How is the patient Harrison says he s pulling round amazingly A tough skull He ll be up for his meals in no time How do you do it she asked with a gesture Do what Manage a place like this In a busy office district It s the most wonderful apartment in New York Riverside has nothing like it It must cost like sixty The building is mine Kitty That makes it possible An uncle who knew I hated money and the responsibilities that go with it died and left it to me Why Cutty you must be rich I m sorry What can I do I can t give it away But you don t have to work Oh yes I do I m that kind I d die of a broken heart if I had to sit still It s the game Did mother know Yes With the toe of a snug little bronze boot Kitty drew an outline round a pattern in the rug Love is a funny thing was her comment It sure is old timer But what put the thought into your head I was thinking how very much mumsy must have been in love with father But she never knew that I loved her Kitty What s that got to do with it If she had wanted money you wouldn t have had the least chance in the world Probably not But what would you have done in your mother s place Snapped you up like that Kitty flashed back You cheerful little little Liar Say it Kitty laughed But am I a cheerful little liar I don t know It would be an awful temptation Somebody to wait on you heaps of flowers when you wanted them beautiful gowns and thingummies and furs and limousines I ve often wondered what I should do if I found myself with love and youth on one side and money and attraction on the other I ve always been in straitened circumstances I never spent a dollar in all my days when I didn t think I ought to have held back three or four cents of it You can t know Cutty what it is to be poor and want beautiful things and good times Of course I couldn t marry just money There would have to be some kind of a man to go with it Someone interesting enough to make me forget sometimes that I d thrown away a lover for a pocket book Would you marry me Kitty Are you serious Let s suppose I am No I couldn t marry you Cutty I should always be having my mother s ghost as a rival But supposing I fell in love with you Then I d always be doubting your constancy But what queer talk Kitty you re a joy Lordy my luck in dropping in to see you yesterday And a little whippersnapper like me calling a great man like you Cutty Well if it embarrasses you you might switch to papa once in a while Kitty s laughter rang down the corridor I ll remember that whenever I want to make you mad Who s here Nobody but Harrison and the nurse Both good citizens and I ve taken them into my confidence to a certain extent You can talk freely before them Am I to see the patient Harrison says not About Wednesday your Two Hawks will be sitting up I ve determined to keep the poor devil here until he can take care of himself But he is flat broke He said he had money Well Karlov s men stripped him clean Have you any idea who he is To be honest that s one of the reasons why I want to keep him here He s Russian for all his Oxford English and his Italian gestures and from his babble I imagine he s been through seven kinds of hell Torches and hobnailed boots and the incessant call for a woman named Olga a young woman about eighteen How did you find that out From a photograph I found in the lining of his coat A pretty blonde girl Good heavens recollecting her dream Where was it printed Amateur photography I ll pick it up on the way to the living room It was nothing like the blonde girl of her dream Still the girl was charming Kitty turned over the photograph There was writing on the back Russian What does it say To Ivan from Olga with all her love Cutty was conscious of the presence of an indefensible malice in his tones Why the deuce should he be bitter glad that the chap had left behind a sweetheart He knew exactly the basis of Kitty s interest as utterly detached as that of a reporter going to a fire On the day the patient could explain himself Kitty s interest would automatically cease An old dog in the manger Malice Cutty something dreadful has happened to this poor young woman That s what makes him cry out the name Caught in that horror and probably he alone escaped Is it heartless to be glad I m an American Do they let in these Russians Not since the Trotzky regime I imagine Two Hawks slipped through on some British passport He ll probably tell us all about it when he comes round But how do you feel after last night s bout Alive And I m going on being alive forever and ever Oh those awful drums They look like dead eyes in those dim corners Tumpitum tump Tumpitum tump she cried linking her arm in his What a gorgeous view Just what I m going to do when my ship comes in live in a loft I really believe I could write up here I mean worth while things I could enjoy writing and sell It s yours if you want it when I leave And I d have a fine time explaining to my friends You old innocent Or are you so innocent We do live in a cramped world But I meant it Don t forget to whistle down to Tony Bernini when you get back home to night I promise Why the gurgle Because I m tremendously excited All my life I ve wanted to do mysterious things I ve been with the audience all the while and I want to be with the actors You ll give some man a wild dance If I do I ll dance with him Now lead me to the cookies She was the life of the tea table Her wit her effervescence her whimsicalities amused even the prim Miss Frances When she recounted the exploit of the camouflaged fan Cutty and Harrison laughed so loudly that the nurse had to put her finger on her lips They might wake the patient I am really interested in him went on Kitty I won t deny it I want to see how it s going to turn out He was very nice after I let him into the kitchen A perfectly English manner and voice and Italian gestures when off his guard I feel so sorry for him What strangers we races are to each other Until the war we hardly knew the Canadians The British didn t know us at all and the French became acquainted with the British for the first time in history And the German thought he knew us all and really knew nobody All the Russians I ever saw were peasants of the cattle type so that the word Russian conjures up two pictures the grand duke at Monte Carlo and a race of men who wear long beards and never bathe except when it rains Think of it For the first time since God set mankind on earth peoples are becoming acquainted I never saw a Russian of this type before A leaf in the whirlpool Anyhow we ll keep him here until he s on his feet By the way never answer any telephone call I mean go anywhere on a call unless you are sure of the speaker I begin to feel important You are important You have suddenly become a connecting link between this Karlov and the man we wish to protect I ll confess I wanted you out of that apartment at first but when I saw that you were bent on remaining I decided to make use of you You are going to give me a part in the play Yes You are to go about your affairs as always just as if nothing had happened Only when you wish to come here will you play any game like that of to day Then it will be advisable Switch your route each time Your real part is to be that of lure Through you we shall gradually learn who Karlov s associates are If you don t care to play the role all you have to do is to move The idea I m grateful for anything You men will never understand You go forth into the world each day politics diplomacy commerce war while we women stay at home and knit or darn socks or take care of the baby or make over our clothes and hats or do household work or play the piano or read Never any adventure Never any games Never any clubs The leaving your house to go to the office is an adventure A train from here to Philadelphia is an adventure We women are always craving it And about all we can squeeze out of life is shopping and hiding the bills after marriage and going to the movies before marriage with young men our fathers don t like We can t even stroll the street and admire the handsome gowns of our more fortunate sisters the way you men do When you see a pretty woman on the street do you ever stop to think that there are ten at home eating their hearts out Of course you don t So I m going through with this to satisfy suppressed instincts and I shan t promise to trot along as usual They may attempt to kidnap you Kitty That doesn t frighten me So I observe But if they ever should have the luck to kidnap you tell all you know at once There s only one way up here the elevator I can get out to the fire escape but none can get in from that direction as the door is of steel And of course you ll take me into your confidence completely When the time comes Half the fun in an adventure is the element of the unexpected said Cutty Where did you first meet Stefani Gregor Captain Harrison laughed He liked this girl She was keen and could be depended upon as witness last night s work Her real danger lay in being conspicuously pretty in looking upon this affair as merely a kind of exciting game when it was tragedy What makes you think I know Stefani Gregor asked Cutty genuinely curious When I pronounced that name you whirled upon me as if I had struck you Very well When we learn who Two Hawks is I ll tell you what I know about Gregor And in the meantime you will be ceaselessly under guard You are an asset Kitty to whichever side holds you Captain Harrison is going to stay for dinner Won t you join us I m going to a studio potluck with some girls And it s time I was on the way I ll let your Tony Bernini know Home probably at ten Cutty went with her to the elevator and when he returned to the tea table he sat down without speaking Why not kidnap her yourself suggested Harrison if you don t want her in this She would never forgive me If she found it out She s the kind who would What do you think of her Miss Frances I think she is wonderful Frankly I should tell her everything if there is anything more to be told When dinner was over the nurse gone back to the patient and Captain Harrison to his club Cutty lit his odoriferous pipe and patrolled the windows of his study Ever since Kitty s departure he had been mulling over in his mind a plan regarding her future to add a codicil to his will leaving her five thousand a year so Molly s girl might always have a dainty frame for her unusual beauty The pity of it was that convention denied him the pleasure of settling the income upon her at once while she was young He might outlive her you never could tell Anyhow he would see to the codicil An accident might step in He got out his chrysoprase In one corner of the room there was a large portfolio such as artists use for their proofs and sketches and from this he took a dozen twelve by fourteen inch photographs of beautiful women most of them stage beauties of bygone years The one on top happened to be Patti The adorable Patti Linda Violetta Lucia Lord what a nightingale she had been He laughed laid the photograph on the desk and dipped his hand into a canvas bag filled with polished green stones which would have great commercial value if people knew more about them for nothing else in the world is quite so beautifully green He built tiaras above the lovely head and laid necklaces across the marvellous throat Suddenly a phenomenon took place The roguish eyes of the prima donna receded and vanished and slate blue ones replaced them The odd part of it was he could not dissipate the fancied eyes for the replacement of the actual Patti with slate blue eyes He discarded the photograph and selected another He began the game anew and was just beginning the attack on the problem uppermost in his mind when the phenomenon occurred again Kitty s eyes What infernal nonsense Kitty had served merely to enliven his tender recollections of her mother Twenty four and fifty two And yet hadn t he just read that Maeterlinck fifty six had married Mademoiselle Dahon many years younger In a kind of resentful fury he pushed back his chair and fell to pacing eddies and loops and spirals of smoke whirling and sweeping behind him The only light was centred upon the desk so he might have been some god pacing cloud riven Olympus in the twilight By and by he laughed and the atmosphere mental cleared Maeterlinck fifty six and Cutty fifty two were two different men Cutty might mix his metaphors occasionally but he wasn t going to mix his ghosts He returned to his singular game More tiaras and necklaces and his brain took firm hold of the theme which had in the beginning lured him to the green stones Two Hawks That name bothered him He knew he had heard it before but never in the Russian tongue It might be that the chap had been spoofing Kitty Still he had also called himself Hawksley The smoke thickened there were frequent flares of matches One by one Cutty discarded the photographs dropping them on the floor beside his chair his mind boring this way and that for a solution He had now come to the point where he ceased to see the photographs or the green stones The movements of his hands were almost automatic And in this abstract manner he came to the last photograph He built a necklace and even ventured an earring It was a glorious face black eyes that followed you full lipped every indication of fire and genius It must be understood that he rarely saw the photographs when he played this game It wasn t an amusing pastime a mental relaxation It was a unique game of solitaire the photographs and chrysoprase being substituted for cards and in some inexplicable manner it permitted him to concentrate upon whatever problem filled his thoughts It was purely accidental that he saw Patti to night or recalled her art Coming upon the last photograph without having found a solution of the riddle of Two Hawks he relaxed the mental pressure and his sight reestablished its ability to focus Good Lord he ejaculated He seized the photograph excitedly scattering the green stones She The Calabrian the enchanting colouratura who had vanished from the world at the height of her fame thirty odd years gone Two Hawks Cutty saw himself at twenty in the pit at La Scala with music mad Milan all about him Two Hawks He remembered now The nickname the young bloods had given her because she had been eternally guarded by her mother and aunt fierce beaked Calabrians who had determined that Rosa should never throw herself away on some beggarly Adonis And this chap was her son Yesterday rich and powerful with a name that was open sesame wherever he went to day hunted penniless and forlorn Cutty sank back in his chair stunned by the revelation In that room yonder CHAPTER XIV For a long time Cutty sat perfectly motionless his pipe at an upward angle a fine commentary on the strength of his jaws and his gaze boring into the shadows beyond his desk What was uppermost in his thoughts now was the fateful twist of events that had brought the young man to the assured haven of this towering loft All based singularly enough upon his wanting to see Molly s girl for a few moments and thus he had established himself in Kitty s thoughts Instead of turning to the police she had turned to him Old Cutty reaching round vaguely for something to stay the current age hoping by seeing this living link twixt the present and the past to stay the afterglow of youth As if that could be done He who had never paid any attention to gray hairs and wrinkles and time all at once found himself in a position similar to that of the man who supposes he has an inexhaustible sum at the bank and has just been notified that he has overdrawn Cutty knew that life wasn t really coordination and premeditation so much as it was coincident Trivials Nothing was absolute and dependable but death between birth and death a series of accidents and incidents and coincidents which men called life He tapped his pipe on the ash tray and stood up He gathered the chrysoprase and restored the stones to the canvas bag Then he carefully stacked the photographs and carried them to the portfolio The green stones he deposited in a safe from which he took a considerable bundle of small notebooks returning to the desk with these Denatured dynamite these notebooks full of political secrets solutions of mysteries that baffle historians A truly great journalist never writes history as a historian he is afraid to Sometimes conjecture is safer than fact And these little notebooks were the repository of suppressed facts ranging over twenty odd years Gerald Stanley Lee would have recognized them instantly as coming under the head of what he calls Sh An hour later Cutty returned the notebooks to their abiding place his memory refreshed The poor devil A dissolute father and uncle dissolute forbears corrupt blood weakened by intermarriage what hope was there Only one the rich fiery blood of the Calabrian mother But why had the chap come to America Why not England or the Riviera where rank even if shorn of its prerogatives is still treated respectfully But America Cutty s head went up Perhaps that was it to barter his phantom greatness for money to dazzle some rich fool of an American girl In that case Karlov would be welcome But wait a moment The chap had come in from the west In that event there should be an Odyssey of some kind tucked away in the affair Cutty resumed his pacing The moment his imagination caught the essentials he visualized the Odyssey Across mountains and deserts rivers and seas he followed Two Hawks in fancy pursued by an implacable hatred more or less historical of which the lad was less a cause than an abstract object And Karlov Cutty understood Karlov now always span near his hate reenergizing his faltering feet There was evidently some iron in this Two Hawks blood Fear never would have carried him thus far Fear would have whispered Futility Futility And he would have bent his head to the stroke So then there was resource and there was courage And he lay in yonder room beaten and penniless The top piece in the grim irony to have come all these thousands of miles unscathed to be dropped at the goal But America Well that would be solved later By the Lord Harry Cutty stopped and struck his hands together The drums From the hour Kitty had pronounced the name Stefani Gregor an idea had taken lodgment an irrepressible idea that somewhere in this drama would be the drums of jeopardy The mark of the thong Never any doubt of it now Those magnificent emeralds were here in New York The mob the Red Guard hammering on the doors what would have been Two Hawks most natural first thought To gather what treasures the hand could be laid to and flee Here in New York and in Karlov s hands ultimately to be cut up for Bolshevik propaganda The infernal pity of it The passion of the gem hunter blazed forth dimming all other phases of the drama Here was a real game a man s game sport Cutty rubbed his hands together pleasurably To recover those green flames before they could be broken up under the ancient ruling that Findings is keepings The stones of course meant nothing to Karlov beyond the monetary value and upon this fact Cutty began developing a plan He stood ready to buy those stones if he could draw them into the open Lord how he wanted them Murder and loot always murder and loot The thought of those two incomparable emeralds being broken up distressed him profoundly He must act at once before the desecration could be consummated Two Hawks Hawksley hereafter for the sake of convenience had an equity in the gems but what of that In smuggling them in and how the deuce had he done it he had thrown away his legal right to them Cutty kneaded his conscience into a satisfactory condition of quiescence and went on with his planning If he succeeded in recovering the stones and his conscience bit a little too deeply for comfort why he could pay over to Hawksley twenty per cent of the price Karlov demanded He could take it or leave it In a case like this to a bachelor without dependents money was no object All his life he had wanted a fine emerald to play with and here was an opportunity to acquire two If this plan failed to draw Karlov into the open then every jeweller and pawnbroker in town would be notified and warned What with the secret service operatives and the agents of the Department of Justice on the watch for Karlov who would recognize his limitations of mobility it was reasonable to assume that the Bolshevik would be only too glad to dicker secretly for the disposal of the stones Now to work Cutty looked at his watch Nearly midnight Rather late but he knew all the tricks of this particular kind of game If the advertisement appeared isolated all the better The real job would be to hide his identity He saw a way round this difficulty He wrote out six advertisements all worded the same He figured out the cost and was delighted to find that he carried the necessary currency Then he got into his engineer s dungarees touched up his face and hands to the required griminess and sallied forth Luck attended him until he reached the last morning newspaper on the list Here he was obliged to proceed to the city room risky business A queer advertisement coming into the city room late at night was always pried into as he knew from experience Still he felt that he ought not to miss any chance to reach Karlov He explained his business to the sleepy gate boy who carried the advertisement and the cash to the night city editor s desk Ordinarily the night city editor would have returned the advertisement with the crisp information that he had no authority to accept advertisements But the drums of jeopardy caught his attention and he sent a keen glance across the busy room to the rail where Cutty stood perhaps conspicuously Humph He called to one of the reporters This looks like a story I ll run it Follow that guy in the overalls and see what s in it Cutty appreciated the interlude for what it was worth Someone was going to follow him When the gate boy returned to notify him that the advertisement had been accepted Cutty went down to the street Hey there just a moment hailed the reporter I want a word with you about that advertisement Cutty came to a standstill I paid for it didn t I Sure But what s this about the drums of jeopardy Two great emeralds I m hunting for explained Cutty recalling the man who stood on London Bridge and peddled sovereigns at two bits each and no buyer Can it Can it jeered the reporter Be a good sport and give us the tip Strike call among the city engineers I m telling you Like Mike you are All right It s the word to tie up the surface lines like Newark if you want to know Now get t hell out o here before I hand you one on the jaw The reporter backed away Is that on the level Call up the barns and find out They ll tell you what s on And listen if you follow me I ll break your head On your way The reporter dashed for the elevator and back to the doorway in time to see Cutty legging it for the Subway As he was a reporter of the first class he managed to catch the same express uptown On the way uptown Cutty considered that he had accomplished a shrewd bit of work Karlov or one of his agents would certainly see that advertisement and even if Karlov suspected a Federal trap he would find some means of communicating with the issuer of the advertisement The thought of Kitty returned What the dickens would she say how would she act when she learned who this Hawksley was He fervently hoped that she had never read Thaddeus of Warsaw There would be all the difference in the world between an elegant refugee Pole and a derelict of the Russian autocracy Perhaps the best course to pursue would be to say nothing at all to her about the amazing discovery Upon leaving Elevator Four Cutty said Bob I ve been followed by a sharp reporter Sheer him off with any tale you please and go home Goodnight I ll fix him sir Cutty took a bath put on his lounging robe and tiptoed to the threshold of the patient s room The shaded light revealed the nurse asleep with a book on her knees The patient s eyes were closed and his breathing was regular He was coming along Cutty decided to go to bed Meantime when the elevator touched the ground floor the operator observed a prospective passenger Last trip sir You ll have to take the stairs Where ll I find the engineer who went up with you just now The man I took up Gone to bed I guess What floor Nothing doing bo I m wise You re the fourth guy with a subpoena that s been after him Nix I m not a lawyer s clerk I m a reporter and I want to ask him a few questions Gee Has that Jane of his been hauling in the newspapers Good night Toddle along bo there s nothing coming from me Nix Would ten dollars make you talk asked the reporter desperately Ye ah about the Kaiser and his wood sawing By by The operator secretly enjoying the reporter s discomfiture shut off the lights slammed the elevator door to the latch and walked to the revolving doors to the tune of Garry Owen The reporter did not follow him but sat down on the first step of the marble stairs to think for there was a lot to think about He sensed clearly enough that all this talk about street railway strikes and subpoenas was rot The elevator man and the engineer were in cahoots There was a story here but how to get to it was a puzzler He had one chance in a hundred of landing it tip the mail clerk in the business office to keep an eye open for the man who called for Double C mail Eventually the man who did call for that mail presented a card to the mail clerk At the bottom of this card was the name of the chief of the United States Secret Service And say to the reporter who has probably asked to watch hands off Understand Absolutely off When the reporter was informed he blew a kiss into air and sought his city editor for his regular assignment He understood with the wisdom of his calling that one didn t go whale fishing with trout rods CHAPTER XV Early the next morning in a bedroom in a rooming house for aliens in Fifteenth Street a man sat in a chair scanning the want columns of a newspaper Occasionally he jotted down something on a slip of paper This man s job was rather an unusual one He hunted jobs for other men jobs in steel mills great factories in the textile districts the street car lines the shipping yards and docks any place where there might be a grain or two of the powder of unrest and discontent His business was to supply the human matches No more parading the streets no more haranguing from soap boxes The proper place nowadays was in the yard or shop corners at noontime A word or two dropped at the right moment perhaps a printed pamphlet little wedges wherever there were men who wanted something they neither earned nor deserved Here and there across the land little flares one running into the other like wildfire on the plains and then the upheaval As in Russia so now in Germany later England and France and here The proletariat was gaining power He was no fool this individual He knew his clay the day labourer with his parrotlike mentality Though the victim of this peculiar potter absorbs sounds he doesn t often absorb meanings But he takes these sounds and respouts them and convinces himself that he is some kind of Moses headed for the promised land Inflammable stuff Hence the strikes which puzzle the average intelligent American citizen What is it all about Nobody seems to know Once upon a time men went on a strike because they were being cheated and abused Now they strike on the principle that it is excellent policy always to be demanding something it keeps capitalism where it belongs on the ragged edge of things No matter what they demand they never expect to give an equivalent and a just cause isn t necessary Thus the present day agitator has only one perplexity that of eluding the iron hand of the Department of Justice Suddenly the man in the chair brought the newspaper close up and stared He jumped to his feet ran out and up the next flight of stairs He stopped before a door and turned the knob a certain number of times Presently the door opened the barest crack then it was swung wide enough to admit the visitor Look he whispered indicating Cutty s advertisement The occupant of the room snatched the newspaper and carried it to a window Will purchase the drums of jeopardy at top price No questions asked Address this office Double C Very good I might have missed it We shall sell the accursed drums to this gentleman Sell them But Imbecile What we must do is to find out who this man is In the end he may lead us to him But it may be a trap Leave that to me You have work of your own to do and you had best be about it Do you not see beneath Who but the man who harbours him would know about the drums The man in the evening clothes I was too far away to see his face Get me all the morning newspapers If the advertisement is in all of them I will send a letter to each We lost the young woman yesterday And nothing has been heard of Vladimir and Stemmler Bad I do not like this place I move to the house to night My old friend Stefani may be lonesome I dare not risk daylight Some fool may have talked To work All of us have much to do to wake up the proletariat in this country of the blind But the hour will come Get me the newspapers Karlov pushed his visitor from the room and locked and bolted the door He stepped over to the window again and stared down at the clutter of pushcarts drays trucks and human beings that tried to go forward and got forward only by moving sideways or worming through temporary breaches seldom directly the way of humanity But there was no object lesson in this for Karlov who was not philosophical in the peculiar sense of one who was demanding a reason for everything and finding allegory and comparison and allusion in the ebb and flow of life The philosophical is often misapplied to the stoical Karlov was a stoic not a philosopher or he would not have been the victim of his present obsession The idea of live and let live has never been the propaganda of the anarch To the anarch the death of some body or the destruction of some thing is the cornerstone to his madhouse Nothing would ever cure this man of his obsession the death of Hawksley and the possession of the emeralds Moreover there was the fanatical belief in his poor disordered brain that the accomplishment of these two projects would eventually assist in the liberation of mankind Abnormally cunning in his methods of approach he lacked those imaginative scales by which we weigh our projects and which we call logic A child alone in a house with a box of matches a dog on one side of Fifth Avenue that sees a dog on the other side but not the automobiles inexorable logic irresistible force whizzing up and down the middle of that thoroughfare It is not difficult to prophesy what is going to happen to that child that dog Karlov was at this moment reaching out toward a satisfactory solution relative to the disappearance of the gems They had not been found on his enemy they had not been found in the Gregor apartment the two men assigned to the task of securing them would not have risked certain death by trying to do a little bargaining on their own initiative In the first instance they had come forth empty handed In the second instance that of intimidating the girl to disclose his whereabouts neither Vladimir nor Stemmler had returned Sinister The man in the dress suit again Conceivably then the drums were in the possession of this girl and she was holding them against the day when the fugitive would reclaim them The advertisement was a snare Very good Two could play that game as well as one The girl Was it not always so That breed God s curse on them all A crooked finger and the women followed hypnotized The girl was away from the apartment the major part of the day so it was in order to search her rooms A pretty little fool But where were they hiding him Gall and wormwood That he should slip through Boris Karlov s fingers after all these tortuous windings across the world Patience Sooner or later the girl would lead the way Still patience was a galling hobble when he had so little time when even now they might be hunting him Boris Karlov had left New York rather well known He expanded under this thought For the spiritual breath of life to the anarch is flattery attention Had the newspapers ignored Trotzky s advent into Russia had they omitted the daily chronicle of his activities the Russian problem would not be so large as it is this day Trotzky would have died of chagrin He would answer this advertisement Trap He would set one himself The man who eventually came to negotiate would be made a prisoner and forced to disclose the identity of the man who had interfered with the great projects of Boris Karlov plenipotentiary extraordinary for the red government of Russia Midtown Cutty tapped his breakfast egg dubiously Not that he speculated upon the freshness of the egg What troubled him was that advertisement Last night keyed high by his remarkable discovery of the identity of his guest and his cupidity relative to the emeralds he had laid himself open If he knew anything at all about the craft that reporter would be digging in Fortunately he had resources unsuspected by the reporter Legitimately he could send a secret service operative to collect the mail if Karlov decided to negotiate Still within his rights he could use another operative to conduct the negotiations If in the end Karlov strayed into the net the use of the service for private ends would be justified Lord those green stones Well why not Something in the world worth a hazard What had he in life but this second grand passion There shot into his mind obliquely an irrelevant question Supposing in the old days he had proceeded to reach for Molly as he was now reaching for the emeralds a bit lawlessly After all these years to have such a thought strike him Hadn t he stepped aside meekly for Conover Hadn t he observed and envied Conover s dazzling assault Supposing Molly had been wavering and this method of attack had decided her Never to have thought of that before What did a woman want A love storm and then an endless after calm And it had taken him twenty odd years to make this discovery Fact He had never been shy of women He had somehow preferred to play comrade instead of gallant and all the women had taken advantage of that used him callously to pair with old maids faded wives and homely debutantes What impellent was driving him toward these introspections Kitty Molly s girl Each time he saw her or thought of her the uninvited ghost of her mother Any other man upon seeing Kitty or thinking about her would have jumped into the future from the spring of a dream The disparity in years would not have mattered It was all nonsense of course But for his dropping into the office and casually picking up the thread of his acquaintance with Kitty Molly the memory of her would have gone on dimming Actions tremendous and world wide had set his vision toward the future he had been too busy to waste time in retrospection and introspection Thus instead of a gently rising and falling tide healthily recurrent a flood of mixed longings that was swirling him into uncertain depths Those emeralds had bobbed up just in time The chase would serve to pull him out of this bog He heard a footstep and looked up The nurse was beckoning to him What is it He s awake and there is sanity in his eyes Great Has he talked No The awakening happened just this moment and I came to you You never can tell about blows on the skull or brain fever never any two eases alike Cutty threw down his napkin and accompanied the nurse to the bedside The glance of the patient trailed from Cutty to the nurse and back Don t talk said Cutty Don t ask any questions Take it easy until later in the day You are in the hands of persons who wish you well Eat what the nurse gives you When the right time comes we ll tell you all about ourselves You ve been robbed and beaten But the men who did it are under arrest One question said the patient weakly Well just one A girl who gave me something to eat Yes She fed you and later probably your life Thanks Hawksley closed his eyes Cutty and the nurse watched him interestedly for a few minutes but as he did not stir again the nurse took up her temperature sheet and Cutty returned to his eggs Was there a girl No question about the emeralds no interest in the day and the hour Was there a girl The last person he had seen Kitty the first question after coming into the light Had he seen her Then and there Cutty knew that when he died he would carry into the Beyond of all his earthly possessions a chuckle Human beings The yarn that reporter had missed by a hair front page eight column head But he had missed it and that was the main thing The poor devil Beaten and without a sou marque in his pockets his trail was likely to be crowded without the assistance of any newspaper publicity But what a yarn What a whale of a yarn In his fevered flights Hawksley had spoken of having paid Kitty for that meal Kitty had said nothing about it Supposing Telephone sair announced the Jap Lady Molly s girl Cutty sprinted to the telephone Hello That you Kitty Yes How is Johnny Two Hawks Back to earth When can I see him I m just crazy to know what the story is Say the third or fourth day from this We ll have him shaved and sitting up then Has he talked Not permitted Still determined to stay the run of your lease Cutty heard a laugh All right Only I hope you will never have cause to regret this decision Fiddlesticks All I ve got to do in danger is to press a button and presto here s Bernini Kitty did Hawksley pay you for that meal Good heavens no What makes you ask that In his delirium he spoke of having paid you I didn t know Cutty s heart began to rap against his ribs Supposing after all Karlov hadn t the stones Supposing Hawksley had hidden them somewhere in Kitty s kitchen Anything about Gregor No Remember you re to call me up twice a day and report the news Don t go out nights if you can avoid it I ll be good Kitty agreed And now I must hie me to the job Imagine Cutty writing personalities about stage folks and gabfesting with Burlingame and all the while my brain boiling with this affair The city room will kill me Cutty if it ever finds out that I held back such a yarn But it wouldn t be fair to Johnny Two Hawks Cutty did you know that your wonderful drums of jeopardy are here in New York What barked Cutty Somebody is offering to buy them There was an advertisement in the paper this morning Cutty Yes The first problem in arithmetic is two and two make four By by Dizzily Cutty hung up the receiver He had not reckoned on the possibility of Kitty seeing that damfool advertisement Two and two made four and four and four made eight so on indefinitely That is to say Kitty already had a glimmer of the startling truth The initial misstep on his part had been made upon her pronouncement of the name Stefani Gregor He hadn t been able to control his surprise And yesterday having frankly admitted that he knew Gregor all that was needed to complete the circle was that advertisement Cutty tore his hair literally The very door he hoped she might overlook he had thrown open to her Thaddeus of Warsaw But it should not be He would continue to offer a haven to that chap but no nonsense None of that sinister and unfortunate blood should meddle with Kitty Conover s happiness Her self appointed guardian would attend to that He realized that his attitude was rather inexplicable but there were some adventures which hypnotized women and one of this sort was now unfolding for Kitty That she had her share of common sense was negligible in face of the facts that she was imaginative and romantical and adventuresome and that for the first time she was riding one of the great middle currents in human events She was Molly s girl Cutty was going to look out for her Mighty odd that this fear for her should have sprung into being that night quite illogically Prescience He could not say Perhaps it was a borrowed instinct fatherly the same instinct that would have stirred her father into action the protection of that dearest to him If he told her who Hawksley really was that would intrigue her If he made a mystery of the affair that too would intrigue her And there you were twixt the devil and the deep blue sea Hang it what evil luck had stirred him to tell her about those emeralds Already she was building a story to satisfy her dramatic fancy Two and two made four which signified that she was her father s daughter that she would not rest until she had explored every corner of this dark room Wanting to keep her out of it and then dragging her into it through his cupidity Devil take those emeralds Always the same trouble wherever they were The real danger would rise during the convalescence Kitty would be contriving to drop in frequently not to see Hawksley especially but her initial success in playing hide and seek with secret agents friendly and otherwise had tickled her fancy For a while it would be an exciting game then it might become only a means to an end Well it should not be Was there a girl Already Hawksley had recorded her beauty Very well the first sign of sentimental nonsense and out he should go Karlov or no Karlov Kitty wasn t going to know any hurt in this affair That much was decided Cutty stormed into his study growling audibly He filled a pipe and smoked savagely Another side Kitty s entrance into the drama promised to spoil his own fun he would have to play two games instead of one A fine muddle He came to a stand before one of the windows and saw the glory of the morning flashing from the myriad spires and towers and roofs and wondered why artists bothered about cows in pastures Touching his knees was an antique Florentine bridal chest with exquisite carving and massive lock He threw back the lid and disclosed a miscellany never seen by any eye save his own It was all the garret he had He dug into it and at length resurrected the photograph of a woman whose face was both roguish and beautiful He sat on the floor a la Turk and studied the face his own tender and wistful No resemblance to Kitty except in the eyes How often he had gone to her with the question burning his lips only to carry it away unspoken He turned over the photograph and read To the nicest man I know With love from Molly With love And he had stepped aside for Tommy Conover By George He dropped the photograph into the chest let down the lid and rose to his feet Not a bad idea that To intrigue Kitty himself to smother her with attentions and gallantries to give her out of his wide experience and to play the game until this intruder was on his way elsewhere He could do it and he based his assurance upon his experiences and observations Never a squire of dames he knew the part He had played the game occasionally in the capitals of Europe when there had been some information he had particularly desired Clever scheming women too A clever passably good looking elderly man could make himself peculiarly attractive to young women and women in the thirties Dazzlement for the young the man who knew all about life the trivial little courtesies a younger man generally forgot the moving of chairs the holding of wraps the gray hairs which served to invite trust and confidence which lulled the eternal feminine fear of the male To the older women no callow youth but a man of discernment discretion wit and fancy and daring who remembered birthdays husbands forgot who was always round when wanted There was no vanity back of these premises Cutty was merely reaching about for an expedient to thwart what to his anticipatory mind promised to be an inevitability Of course the glamour would not last it never did but he felt he could sustain it until yonder chap was off and away That evening at five thirty Kitty received a box of beautiful roses with Cutty s card Oh the lovely things she cried She kissed them and set them in a big copper jug arranged and rearranged them for the simple pleasure it afforded her What a dear man this Cutty was to have thought of her in this fashion Her father s friend her mother s and now hers she had inherited him This thought caused her to smile but there were tears in her eyes A garden some day to play in this mad city far away a home of her own would it ever happen The bell rang She wasn t going to like this caller for taking her away from these roses the first she had received in a long time roses she could keep and not toss out the window For it must not be understood that Kitty was never besieged Outside stood a well dressed gentleman older than Cutty with shrewd inquiring gray eyes and a face with strong salients Pardon me but I am looking for a man by the name of Stephen Gregory I was referred by the janitor to you You are Miss Conover Yes answered Kitty Will you come in She ushered the stranger into the living room and indicated a chair Please excuse me for a moment Kitty went into her bedroom and touched the danger button which would summon Bernini She wanted her watchdog to see the visitor She returned to the living room What is it you wish to know Where I may find this Gregory That nobody seems able to answer He was carried away from here in an ambulance but we have been unable to locate the hospital If you will leave your name That is not necessary I am out of bounds you might say and I d rather my name should be left out of the affair which is rather peculiar In what way I am only an agent and am not at liberty to speak Could you describe Gregory Then he is a stranger to you Absolutely Kitty described Gregor deliberately and at length It struck her that the visitor was becoming bored though he nodded at times She was glad to hear Bernini s ring She excused herself to admit the Italian A false alarm she whispered Someone inquiring for Gregor I thought it might be well for you to see him I ll work the radiator stuff Very well Bernini went into the living room and fussed over the steam cock of the radiator Nothing the matter with it miss Just stuck Sorry to have troubled you said the stranger rising and picking up his hat Bernini went down to the basement obfuscated for he knew the visitor He was one of the greatest bankers in New York that is to say in America Asking questions about Stefani Gregor CHAPTER XVI About nine o clock that same night a certain rich man having established himself comfortably under the reading lamp a fine book in his hands and a fine after dinner cigar between his teeth was exceedingly resentful when his butler knocked entered and presented a card My orders were that I was not at home to any one Yes sir But he said you would see him because he came to see you regarding a mister Gregory What Yes sir Damn these newspapers Wait wait the banker called for the butler was starting for the door to carry the anathema to the appointed head Bring him in He s a big bug and I can t afford to affront him Yes sir with the colourless tone of a perfect servant When the visitor entered he stopped just beyond the threshold He remained there even after the butler closed the door Blue eye and gray clashed two masters of fence who had executed the same stroke The banker laughed and Cutty smiled I suppose said the banker you and I ought to sign an armistice too Agreed And you ve always been rather a puzzle to me A rich man a gentleman and yet sticking to the newspaper game And you re a puzzle to me too A rich man a gentleman and yet sticking to the banking game What the devil was our row about Can t quite recall Whatever it was it was the way you went at it A reform was never yet accomplished by purring and pussyfooting said Cutty Come over and sit down Now how the devil did you find out about this Gregory affair The banker held out his hand which Cutty grasped with honest pressure If you are here in the capacity of a newspaper man not a word out of me Have a cigar I never smoke anything but pipes that ruin curtains You should have given your name to Miss Conover I was under promise not to explain my business But before we proceed an answer Newspaper No I represent the Department of Justice And we ll get along easier when I add that I possess rather unlimited powers under that head How did you happen to stumble into this affair Through Captain Rathbone my prospective son in law who is in Coblenz A cable arrived this morning instructing me to proceed precisely in the manner I did Rathbone is an intimate friend of the man I was actually seeking The apartment of this man Gregory was mentioned to Rathbone in a cable as a possible temporary abiding place What do you want to know Whether or not he is undesirable Decidedly I should say desirable You make that statement as an American citizen I do I make it unreservedly because my future son in law is rather a difficult man to make friends with I am acting merely as Rathbone s agent On the other hand I should be a cheerful liar if I told you I wasn t interested What do you know Everything answered Cutty quietly You know where this young man is At this moment he is in my apartment rather seriously battered and absolutely penniless Well I ll be tinker dammed You know who he is of course Yes And I want all your information so that I may guide my future actions accordingly If he is really undesirable he shall be deported the moment he can stand on his two feet The banker pyramided his fingers rather pleased to learn that he could astonish this interesting beggar He has on account at my bank half a million dollars Originally he had eight hundred thousand The three hundred thousand under cable orders from Yokohama was transferred to our branch in San Francisco This was withdrawn about two weeks ago How does that strike you All in a heap confessed Cutty When was this fund established with you Shortly before Kerensky s government blew up The funds were in our London bank There was of course a lot of red tape excessive charges in exchange and all that Anyhow about eight hundred thousand arrived What brought him to America Why didn t he go to England That would have been the safest haven I can explain that He intends to become an American citizen Some time ago he became the owner of a fine cattle ranch in Montana Well I ll be tinker dammed too exploded Cutty A young man with these ideas in his head ought eventually to become a first rate citizen What do you say I am considerably relieved His forbears the blood His mother was a healthy Italian peasant a famous singer in her time His fortune I take it was his inheritance from her She made a fortune singing in the capitals of Europe and speculating from time to time She sent the boy at the age of ten to England Afraid of the home influence He remained there under the name of Hawksley for something like fourteen years under the guardianship of this fellow Gregory Of Gregory I know positively nothing The young fellow is to all purposes methods of living points of view an Englishman Rathbone who was educated at Oxford met him there and they shared quarters But it was only in recent years that he learned the identity of his friend In nineteen fourteen the young fellow returned to Russia Military obligations That s all I know Mighty interesting though I am much obliged to you The white elephant becomes a normal drab pachyderm said Cutty Still something of an elephant on your hands I see Bring him here if you wish And sic the Bolshevik at your door That s so You spoke of his having been beaten and robbed Bolshevik Yes An old line of reasoning first put into effect by Oliver Cromwell The axe The poor devil Fact I m sorry for him but I wish he would blow away conveniently Rathbone says he s handsome gay but decent considering Humanity is being knocked about some The hour has come for our lawyers to go back to their offices Politics must step aside for business We ought to hang up signs in every state capitol in the country Men Wanted Specialists A steel man from Pittsburgh a mining man from Idaho a shipowner from Boston a meat packer from Omaha a grain man from Chicago What the devil do lawyers know about these things the energies that make the wheels of this country go round By the way that Miss Conover was a remarkably pretty girl She seemed to be a bit suspicious of me Good reasons That chap went to Gregor s Gregor is his name and was beaten robbed and left for dead She saved his life Good Lord Does she know No And what s more I don t want her to I am practically her guardian Then you ought to get her out of that roost Hang it I can t get her to leave I m not legally her guardian self appointed But she has agreed to leave in May I m glad you dropped in Command me in any way you please That s very good of you considering The war is over We d be a fine pair of fools to let an ancient grudge go on They tell me you ve a wonderful apartment on top of that skyscraper of yours Will you come to dinner some night Any time you say I should like to bring my daughter She doesn t know No Heard of Hawksley thinks he s English I am certainly agreeable This would be a distinct advantage to Kitty I see you have a good book there I ll take myself off In the Avenue Cutty loaded his pipe He struck a match on the flagstone and cupped it over the bowl of his pipe thereby throwing his picturesque countenance into ruddy relief Opposite emotions filled the hearts of the two men watching him in one chagrin in the other exultation Cutty decided to walk downtown the night being fine He set his foot to a long swinging stride An elephant on his hands truly Poor devil for a fad Nobody wanted him not even those who wished him well Wanted to become an American citizen He would have been tolerably safe in England Here he would never be free of danger A ranch The beggar would have a chance out there in the West The anarchist and the Bolshevik were town cooties His one chance actually The poor devil Kitty had the right idea It was a mighty fine thing these times to be a citizen under the protection of the American doctrine Three hundred thousand And Karlov had got that along with the drums The devil s own for luck The fool would be able to start some fine ructions with all that capital behind him Episodes in the night Kitty dreamed of wonderful rose gardens endless and changing but strive as she would she could not find Cutty anywhere which worried her even in her dream The nurse heard the patient utter a single word several times before he fell asleep What is it she asked Fan And he smiled She hunted for the palm leaf but with a slight gesture he signified that that was not what he wanted Cutty played solitaire with his chrysoprase until the telephone broke in upon his reveries What he heard over the wire disturbed him greatly You were followed from the Avenue to the apartment How do you know I am Henderson You assigned me to watch the apartment in Eightieth through the night I followed the man who followed you He saw your face when you lit the pipe When the banker left Miss Conover he was followed home That established him in the affair The follower hung round and so did I You appeared He took a chance shot in the dark Not sure but doing a bit of clever guessing You still followed him Yes Where did he wind up A house in the warehouse district Vacant warehouses on each side Some new nest I can lead you to it sir any time you wish Thanks Cutty pushed aside the telephone and returned to his green stones After all why worry It was unfortunate of course but the apartment was more inaccessible than the top of the Matterhorn Still they might discover what his real business was and interfere seriously with his future work on the other side A ruin in the warehouse district A good place to look for Stefani Gregor if he were still alive He was And in his dark room he cried piteously for water water water CHAPTER XVII A March day sunny and cloudless with fresh bracing winds Green things pushed up from the soil an eternal something was happening to the tips of the tree branches an eternal something was happening in young hearts A robin shook the dust of travel from his wings and bathed publicly in a park basin Here and there under the ten thousand roofs of the great city poets were busy with inkpots trying to say an old thing in a new way Woe to the pinched soul that did not expand this day for it was spring Expansion Nature perhaps she was relenting a little perhaps she saw that humanity was sliding down the scale withering and a bit of extra sunshine would serve to check the descension and breed a little optimism Cutty s study The sunlight thrown westward turned windows and roofs and towers into incomparable bijoux The double reflection cast a white light into the room lifting out the blue and old rose tints of the Ispahan rug Cutty shifted the chrysoprase irresolutely for him A dozen problems and it was mighty hard to decide which to tackle first Principally there was Kitty He had not seen her in four days deeming it advisable for her not to call for the present The Bolshevik agent who had followed him from the banker s might decide without the aid of some connecting episode that he had wasted his time It did not matter that Kitty herself was no longer watched and followed from her home to the office from the office home Was Karlov afraid or had he some new trick up his sleeve It was not possible that he had given up Hawksley He was probably planning an attack from some unexpected angle To be sure that Karlov would not find reason to associate him with Kitty Cutty had remained indoors during the daytime and gone forth at night in his dungarees Problem Two was quite as formidable The secret agent who had passed as a negotiator for the drums of jeopardy had disappeared That had sinister significance Karlov did not intend to sell the drums merely wanted precise information regarding the man who had advertised for them If the secret service man weakened under torture Cutty recognized that his own usefulness would be at an end He would have to step aside and let the great currents sweep on without him In that event these fifty two years would pile upon his head full measure for the only thing that kept him vigorous was action interest Without some great incentive he would shrivel up and blow away like some exhumed mummy Problem Three How the deuce was he going to fascinate Kitty if he couldn t see her But there was a bit of silver lining here If he couldn t see her what chance had Hawksley The whole sense and prompting of this problem was to keep Kitty and Hawksley apart How this was accomplished was of no vital importance Problem Three then hung fire for the present Funny how this idea stuck in his head that Hawksley was a menace to Kitty One of those fool ideas probably but worth trying out Problem Four That night all on his own he would make an attempt to enter that old house sandwiched between the two vacant warehouses Through pressure of authority he had obtained keys to both warehouses There would be a trap on the roof of that house Doubtless it would be covered with tin fairly impregnable if latched below But he could find out From the third floor windows of either warehouse the drop was not more than six feet If anywhere in town poor old Stefani Gregor would be in one of those rooms But to storm the house frontally without being absolutely sure would be folly Gregor would be killed The house was in fact an insane asylum occupied by super insane men Warned they were capable of blowing the house to kingdom come themselves with it Problem Five was a mere vanishing point He doubted if he would ever see those emeralds What an infernal pity He built a coronet and leaned back a wisp of smoke darting up from the bowl of his pipe I say you know but that s a ripping game to play drawled a tired voice over his shoulder Cutty turned his head to behold Hawksley shaven pale and handsome wrapped in a bed quilt and swaying slightly What the deuce are you doing out of your room growled Cutty but with the growl of a friendly dog Hawksley dropped into a chair weakly End of my rope Got to talk to someone Go dotty else Questions Skull aches with em Want to know whether this is a foretaste of the life I have a right to live or the beginning of death Be a good sport and let s have it out What is it you wish to know asked Cutty gently The poor beggar Where I am Who you are What happened to me What is going to happen to me rather breathlessly Don t want any more suspense Don t want to look over my shoulder any more Straight ahead All the cards on the table please Cutty rose and pushed the invalid s chair to a window and drew another up beside it My word the top of the world Bally odd roost You will find it safer here than you would on the shores of Kaspuskoi More replied Cutty gravely The Caspian wouldn t be a healthy place for you now With wide eyes Hawksley stared across the shining wavering roofs A pause What do you know he asked faintly Everything But wait Cutty fetched one of the photographs and laid it upon the young man s knees Know who this is Two Hawks A strained tense gesture as Hawksley seized the photograph then his chin sank slowly to his chest A moment later Cutty was profoundly astonished to see something sparkle on its way down the bed quilt Tears I m sorry cried Cutty troubled and embarrassed I m terribly sorry I should have had the decency to wait a day or two On the contrary thank you Hawksley flung up his head Nothing in all God s muddied world could be more timely the face of my mother I am not ashamed of these tears I am not afraid to die I am not even afraid to live But all the things I loved the familiar earth the human beings my dog gone I am alone I m sorry repeated Cutty a bit choked up This was honest misery and it affected him deeply He felt himself singularly drawn I want to live Because I am young No I want to prove to the shades of those who loved me that I am fit to go on So my identity is known to you dejectedly Yes You wish me to forget what I know Will you eagerly Will you forget that I am anything but a naked friendless human being Yes But your enemies know I rather fancy they will keep the truth to themselves Let them publish my identity and a hundred havens would be offered Your Government would protect me It is doing so now indirectly But why do you not want it known Freedom Would I have it if known Could I trust anybody Would it not be essentially the old life in a new land I want a new life in a new land I want to be born again I want to be what you patently are an American That is why I risked life a hundred times in coming all these miles why I sit in this chair before you with the room rocking because they battered in my head I do not offer a human wreck an illiterate mind in exchange for citizenship I bring a tolerably decent manhood Try me Always I have admired you people Always we Russians have But there is no Russia now that I can ever return to Hawksley s head drooped again and his bloodshot eyes closed Cutty sensed confusion indecision all his deductions were upset in the face of this strange appeal Russian born of an Italian mother and speaking Oxford English as if it were his birthright and wanting citizenship Wasn t ashamed of his tears wasn t afraid to die or to live Cutty searched quickly for a new handhold to his antagonism but he found only straws He was honest enough to realize that he had built this antagonism upon a want a desire there was no foundation for it Downright likeable A chap who had gone through so much who was in such a pitiable condition would not have the wit to manufacture character camouflage his soul Hang it he said briskly You shall have your chance Talk like that will carry a man anywhere in this country You shall stay here until you are strong again Then some night I ll put you on your train for Montana You want to ask questions I ll save you the trouble by telling you what I know But his narrative contained no mention of the emeralds Why A bit conscience stricken because if he could he was going to rob his guest on the basis that findings is keepings Cutty wasn t ready to analyze the omission Perhaps he wanted Hawksley himself to inquire about the stones test him out If he asked frankly that would signify that he had brought the stones in honestly paid his obligations to the Customs Otherwise smuggling and in that event conscience wouldn t matter the emeralds became a game anybody could take a hand in anybody who considered the United States Customs an infringement upon human rights What a devil of a call those stones had for him Did they mean anything to Hawksley aside from their intrinsic value But for the nebulous idea originally that the emeralds were mixed up somewhere in this adventure Cutty knew that he would have sent Hawksley to a hospital left him to his fate and never known who he was All through the narration Hawksley listened motionless with his eyes closed possibly to keep the wavering instability of the walls from interfering with his assimilation of this astonishing series of fact Found you insensible on the floor concluded Cutty hoisted you to my shoulders took you to the street and here you are Hawksley opened his eyes I say you know what a devil of an old Sherlock you must be And you carried me on your shoulders across that fire escape Ripping When I stepped back into that room I heard a rushing sound I knew But I didn t have the least chance You and that bully girl Cutty swore under his breath He had taken particular pains to avoid mentioning Kitty and here first off the fat was in the fire He remembered now that he had told Hawksley that Kitty had saved his life Fortunately the chap wasn t keen enough with that banged up head of his to apply reason to the omission Saved my life Suppose she doesn t want me to know Cutty jumped at this Doesn t care to be mixed up with the Bolshevik end of it Besides she doesn t know who you are The fewer that know the better But I ll always remember her kindness and that bally pistol with the fan in it But you Why did you bother to bring me up here Couldn t decently leave you where Karlov could get to you again Is Stefani Gregor dead Don t know probably not But we are hunting for him Cutty had not explained his interest in Gregor Those plaguey stones again They were demoralizing him Loot You spoke of Karlov Who is he Why the man who followed you across half the world There were many What is he like A gorilla Ah Hawksley became galvanized and extended his fists God let me live long enough to put my hands on him I had the chance the other day to blot out his face with my boots But I couldn t do it I couldn t do it He sagged in the chair No no Just a bit groggy All right in a moment By the Lord Harry I ll see you through Now buck up Hear that cried Cutty throwing up a window Music Look through that street there See the glint of bayonets American soldiers marching up Fifth Avenue thousands of them freemen who broke the vaunted Hindenburg Line God bless em Americans every mother s son of em who went away laughing who returned laughing who will go back to their jobs laughing The ability to laugh that s America Do you know how to laugh I used to I m jolly weak just now But I ll grin if you want me to And Hawksley grinned That s the way A grin in this country will take you quite as far All right In five years you ll be voting I ll see to that Now back to bed with you and no more leaving it until the nurse says so What you need is rest Cutty sent a call to the nurse who was standing undecidedly in the doorway and together they put the derelict back to bed Then Cutty fetched the photograph and set it on top of the dresser where Hawksley could see it Now no more gallivanting about I promise old top This bed is a little bit of all right I say What How long am I to be here If you re good two weeks interposed the nurse Two weeks I say would you mind doing me a trifling favour I d like a violin to amuse myself with A fiddle I don t know a thing about em except that they sound good Cutty pulled at his chin Whatever it costs I ll reimburse you the day I m up All right I ll bring you a bundle of them and you can do your own selecting Out in the corridor the nurse said I couldn t hold him But he ll be easier now that he s got the questions off his mind He will have to be humoured a lot That s one of the characteristics of head wounds What do you think of him He seems to be gentle and patient and I imagine he s hard to resist when he wants anything Winning you d call it I suppose I mustn t ask who he really is No Poor devil The fewer that know the better I ll be home round three Once in the street Cutty was besieged suddenly with the irresistible desire to mingle with the crowd over in the Avenue to hear the military bands the shouts to witness the gamut of emotions which he knew would attend this epochal day Of course he would view it all from the aloof vantage of the historian and store away commentaries against future needs And what a crowd it was He was elbowed and pushed jostled and trod on carried into the surges relegated to the eddies and always the metallic taptap of steel shod boots on the asphalt the bayonets throwing back the radiant sunshine in sharp clear flashes The keen joyous faces of those boys God to be young like that To have come through that hell on earth with the ability still to smile Cutty felt the tears running down his cheeks Instinctively he knew that this was to be his last thrill of this order He was fifty two Quit your crowding there barked a voice under his chin Sorry but it s those behind me said Cutty looking down into a florid countenance with a raggedy gray moustache and a pair of blue eyes that were blinking I m so damned short I can t see anything Neither can I You could if you wiped your eyes You re crying yourself declared Cutty Blinking jackass Got anybody out there All of em I get you old son of a gun No flesh and blood but they re ours all the same Couple of old fools huh Sure pop What right have two old codgers got here anyhow What brought you out What brought you Same thing Damn it If I could only see something Cutty put his hands upon the shoulders of this chance acquaintance and propelled him toward the curb There were cries of protest curses catcalls but Cutty bored on ahead until he got his man where he could see the tin hats the bayonets and the colours and thus they stood for a full hour Each time the flag went by the little man yanked off his derby and turned truculently to see that Cutty did the same Say he said as they finally dropped back I d offer to buy a drink only it sounds flat And it would taste flat after a mighty wine like this replied Cutty Maybe you ve heard of the nectar of the gods Well you ve just drunk it my friend I sure have Those kids out there smiling after all that hell and you and me on the sidewalk blubbering over em What s the answer We re Americans You said it Good bye Cutty pressed on to the flow and went along with it lighter in the heart than he had been in many a day These two million who lined Fifth Avenue who cheered laughed wept went silent cheered again what did their presence here signify That America s day had come that as a people they were homogeneous at last that that which laws had failed to bring forth had been accomplished by an ideal Bolshevism socialism call it what you will would beat itself into fragments against this Rock of Democracy which went down to the centre of the world and whose pinnacle touched the stars Reincarnation the simple ideals of the forefathers restored And with this knowledge tingling in his thoughts and perhaps there was a bit of spring in his heart Cutty continued on without destination chin jutting eyes shining He was an American He might have continued on indefinitely had he not seen obliquely a window filled with musical instruments Hawksley s fiddle He had all but forgotten All right If the poor beggar wanted to scrape a fiddle scrape it he should The least he Cutty could do would be to accede to any and every whim Hawksley expressed Wasn t he planning to rob the beggar of the drums happen they ever turned up But how the deuce to pick out a fiddle which would have a tune in it Of all the hypercritical duffers the fiddler was the worst Beside a fiddler of the first rank the rich old maid with the poodle was a hail fellow well met Of course Gregor had taught the chap That meant he would know instantly just as his host would instantly observe the difference between green glass and green beryl Cutty turned into the shop infinitely amused Fiddles What next Having constituted a guardianship over Kitty he was now playing impressario to Hawksley As if he hadn t enough parts to play Wouldn t he be risking his life to night trying to find where Stefani Gregor was Fiddles Fiddles and emeralds What a choice old hypocrite he was Fate has a way of telling you all about it afterward conceivably that humanity might continue to reproduce its species Otherwise humanity would proceed to extinguish itself forthwith Thus Cutty was totally unaware upon entering the shop that he was about to tear off its hinges the door he was so carefully bolting and latching and padlocking between Kitty Conover and this duffer who wanted to fiddle his way through convalescence Where there is fiddling there is generally dancing If it be not the feet then it will be the soul CHAPTER XVIII There are some men who know a little about all things and a great deal about many Such a man was Cutty But as he approached the counter behind which stood an expectant clerk he felt for once that he was in a far country There were fiddles and fiddles just as there were emeralds and emeralds Never again would he laugh over the story of the man who thought Botticelli was a manufacturer of spool thread He attacked the problem however like the thoroughbred he was frankly I want to buy a violin he began knowing that in polite musical circles the word fiddle was taboo I know absolutely nothing at all about quality or price Understand though while you might be able to fool me you wouldn t fool the man I m buying it for Now what would you suggest The clerk a salesman familiar with certain urban types thinly including the Fifth Avenue which came in for talking machine records recognized in this well dressed attractive elderly man that which he designated the swell Hateful word yes but having a perfectly legitimate niche since in the minds of the hoi polloi it nicely describes the differences between the poor gentleman and the gentleman of leisure To proceed with the digression to no one is the word more hateful than to the individual to whom it is applied Cutty would have blushed at the clerk s thought Perhaps I d better get the proprietor was the clerk s suggestion Good idea Cutty agreed Take my card along with you This was a Fifth Avenue shop and Cutty knew there would be a Who s Who or a Bradstreet somewhere about In the interim he inspected the case lined walls Trombones He chuckled Lucky that Hawksley s talent didn t extend in this direction True he himself collected drums but he did not play them Something odd about music human beings had to have it the very lowest in the scale A universal magic He was himself very fond of good music but these days he fought shy of it it had the faculty of sweeping him back into the twenties and reincarnating vanished dreams After a certain length of time from the corner of his eye he saw the clerk returning with the proprietor the latter wearing an amiable smile which probably connoted a delving into the aforesaid volumes of attainment and worth Cutty hoped this was so as it would obviate the necessity of going into details as to who he was and what he had Your name is familiar to me began the proprietor You collect antique drums My clerk tells me that you wish to purchase a good violin Very good I have in my apartment rather a distinguished guest who plays the violin for his own amusement He is ill and cannot select for himself Now I know a little about music but nothing about violins I suggest that I personally carry half a dozen instruments to your apartment and let your guest try them How much is he willing to pay Top price I should say Shall I make a deposit If you don t mind Merely precautionary Half a dozen violins will represent quite a sum of money and taxicabs are unreliable animals A thousand against accidents What time shall I call The proprietor s curiosity was stirred Musical celebrities as he had occasion to know were always popping up in queer places Some new star probably whose violin had been broken and who did not care to appear in public before the hour of his debut Three o clock said Cutty Very well sir I promise to bring the violins myself Cutty wrote out his check for a thousand and departed the chuckle still going on inside of him Versatile old codger wasn t he Promptly at three the dealer arrived his arms and his hands gripping violin cases Cutty hurried to his assistance accepted a part of the load and beckoned to the man to follow him The cases were placed on the floor and the dealer opened them putting the rosin on a single bow Hawksley a fresh bandage on his head his shoulders propped by pillows eyed the initial manoeuvres with frank amusement I say you know would you mind tuning them for me I m not top hole The dealer s eyebrows went up An Englishman Bewildered he bent to the trifling labour of tuning the violins Hawksley rejected the first two instruments after thrumming the strings with his thumb He struck up a melody on the third but did not finish it My word If you have a violin there why not let me have it at once The dealer flushed Try this sir But I do not promise you that I shall sell it Ah Hawksley stretched out his hands to receive the instrument Of course Cutty had heard of Amati and Stradivari master and pupil He knew that all famous violinists possessed instruments of these schools and that such violins were practically beyond the reach of many Only through some great artist s death or misfortune did a fine violin return to the marts But the rejected fiddles had sounded musically enough for him and looked as if they were well up in the society of select fiddles The fiddle Hawksley now held in his hands was dull almost black The maple neck was worn to a shabby gray and the varnish had been sweated off the chin rest Hawksley laid his fingers on the strings and drew the bow with a powerful flourishing sweep The rich sonorous tones vibrated after the bow had passed Then followed the tricks by which an artist seeks to discover flaws or wolf notes A beatific expression settled upon Hawksley face He nestled the violin comfortably under his chin and began to play softly Cutty the nurse and the dealer became images Minors a bit of a dance more minors nothing really begun nothing really finished sketches with a melancholy note running through them all While that pouring into his ears enchained his body it stirred recollections in Cutty s mind The fair at Novgorod the fiddling mountebanks Russian Perhaps the dealer s astonishment was greatest An Englishman Who ever heard of an Englishman playing a violin like that I will buy it said Hawksley sinking back Sir began the dealer I am horribly embarrassed I cannot sell that violin because it isn t mine It is an Amati worth ten thousand dollars I will give you twelve But sir Name a price interrupted Hawksley rather imperiously I want it Cutty understood that he was witnessing a flash of the ancient blood To want anything was to have it I repeat sir I cannot sell it It belongs to a Hungarian who is now in Hungary I loaned him fifteen hundred and took the Amati as security Until I learn if he is dead I cannot dispose of the violin I am sorry But because you are a real artist sir I will loan it to you if you will make a deposit of ten thousand against any possible accident and that upon demand you will return the instrument to me That s fair enough interposed Cutty I beg pardon said Hawksley I agree I want it but not at the price of any one s dishonesty He turned his head toward Cutty You re a thoroughbred sir This will do more to bring me round than all the doctors in the world But what the deuce is the difference Cutty demanded with a gesture toward the rejected violins The dealer and Hawksley exchanged smiles Said the latter The other violins are pretty wooden boxes with tolerable tunes in their insides This has a soul He put the violin against his cheek again Massenet s Elegie Moszkowski s Serenata a transcription and then the aria from Lucia Not compositions professional violinists would have selected Cutty felt his spine grow cold as this aria poured goldenly toward heaven He understood Hawksley was telling him that the shade of his glorious mother was in this room The boy was right Some fiddles had souls An odd depression bore down upon him Perhaps this surprising music topping his great emotions of the morning was a straw too much There were certain exaltations that could not be sustained A whimsical forecast This chap here in the dingy parlour of his Montana ranch playing these indescribable melodies to the stars his cowmen outside wondering what was the matter with their inards Somehow this picture lightened the depression My fingers are stiff said Hawksley My hand is tired I should like to be alone He lay back rather inertly In the corridor Cutty whispered to the dealer What do you think of him As he says his touch shows a little stiffness but the wonderful fire is there He s an amateur but a fine one Practice will bring him to a finish in no time But I never heard an Englishman play a violin like that before Nor I Cutty agreed When the owner sends for that fiddle let me know mister Hawksley might like to dicker for it If you know where the owner is you might cable that you have an offer of twelve thousand I m sorry but I haven t the least idea where the owner is However there is an understanding that if the loan isn t covered in eighteen months the instrument becomes salable for my own protection There is a year still to run Four o clock found Cutty pacing his study the room blue with smoke Of all the queer chaps he had met in his varied career this Two Hawks topped the lot The constant internal turmoil that must be going on the instincts of the blood artist and autocrat And in the end the owner of a cattle ranch if he had the luck to get there alive Dizzy old world Something else happened at four o clock A policeman strolled into Eightieth Street He was at peace with the world Spring was in his whistle in his stride in the twirl of his baton Whenever he passed a shop window he made it serve as a mirror No waistline yet a comforting thought Children swarmed the street and gathered at corners The older ones played boldly in midstreet while the toddlers invented games that kept them to the sidewalk and curb The policeman came stealthily upon one of these latter groups Italians At the sight of his brass buttons they fled precipitately He laughed Once in a month of moons he was able to get near enough to touch them Natural Hadn t he himself hiked in the old days at the sight of a copper Sure he had A bit of colour on the sidewalk attracted his eye and he picked up the object Something those kids had been playing with A bit of red glass out of a piece of cheap jewellery Not half bad for a fake He would put one over on Maggie when he turned in for supper Certainly this was the age of imitation You couldn t buy a brass button with any confidence He put the trinket in his pocket and continued on soon to forget it At six he was off duty As he was leaving the precinct the desk sergeant called him back Got change for a dollar an I ll settle that pinochle debt offered the sergeant I ll take a look The policeman emptied his coin pocket What s that yuh got there Which The red stone Oh that Picked it up on the sidewalk Some Italian kids dropped it as they skedaddled Let s have a look Sure The policeman passed over the stone Gee That looks like real money Say they can do anything with glass these days They sure can A man in civilian clothes a detective from headquarters went up to the desk What you guys got there A ruby this boob picks up off n the sidewalk said the sergeant winking at the finder who grinned Let s have a squint at it The stone was handed to him The detective stared at it carefully holding it on his palm and rocking it gently under the desk light Crimson darts of flame answered to this treatment He pushed back his hat Well you boobs he drawled What s the matter Matter Why this is a ruby A whale of a ruby an pigeon blood at that I didn t work in the appraiser s office for nothing But for a broken point kids probably tried to crack it it would stack up somewhere between three and four thousand dollars The sergeant and the policemen barked simultaneously What A pigeon blood Where was it you found it Holy Moses On Eightieth Any chance of finding that bunch of kids Not a chance not a chance If I got the hull district here there wouldn t be nothin doin The kids d be too scared t remember anything A pigeon blood ruby an I wasn t gonna pick it up at first Lock it up sergeant ordered the detective I ll pass the word to headquarters Too big for a ring Probably fallen from a pin But there ll be a holler in a few hours Lost or stolen there ll be some big noise You two boobs Well whadda yuh know about that whined the policeman An me thinkin it was glass But there was no big noise No one had reported the loss or theft of a pigeon blood ruby of unusual size and quality CHAPTER XIX Kitty came home at nine that night dreadfully tired She had that day been rocked by so many emotions She had viewed the parade from the windows of a theatrical agency and she had cheered and cried like everybody else Her eyes still smarted and her throat betrayed her every time she recalled what she had seen Those boys Loneliness She had dined downtown and on the way home the shadow had stalked beside her Loneliness Never before had these rooms seemed so empty empty If God had only given her a brother and he had marched in that glorious parade what fun they two would be having at this moment Empty rooms not even a pet Loneliness She had been a silly little fool to stand so aloof just because she was poor and lived in a faded locality She mocked herself Poor but proud like the shopgirl in the movies Denied herself companionship because she was ashamed of her genteel poverty And now she was paying for it Silly little fool It wasn t as if she did not know how to make and keep friends She knew she had attractions Just a senseless false pride The best friends in the world after a series of rebuffs would drop away Her mother s friends never called any more because of her aloofness She had only a few girl friends and even these no doubt were beginning to think her uppish She did not take off her hat and coat She wandered through the empty rooms undecided If she went to a movie the rooms would be just as lonely when she returned Companionship The urge of it was so strong that there was a temptation to call up someone even someone she had rebuffed She was in the mood to confess everything and to make an honest attempt to start all over again to accept friendship and let pride go hang Impulsively she started for the telephone when the doorbell rang Immediately the sense of loneliness fell away Another chapter in the great game of hide and seek that had kept her from brooding until to night The doorbell carried a new message these days Nine o clock Who could be calling at that hour She had forgotten to advise Cutty of the fact that someone had gone through the apartment She could not positively assert the fact Those articles in her bureau she herself might have disturbed She might have taken a handkerchief in a hurry hunted for something under the lingerie impatiently Still she could not rid herself of the feeling that alien hands had been rifling her belongings Not Bernini decidedly Remembering Cutty s advice about opening the door with her foot against it she peered out No emissary of Bolshevisim here A weary little messenger boy with a long box in his arms called her name Miz Conover Yes The boy thrust the box into her hands and clumped to the stairhead Kitty slammed the door and ran into the living room tearing open the box as she ran Roses from Cutty she knew it The old darling Just when she was on the verge of breaking down and crying She let the box fall to the floor and cuddled the flowers to her heart her eyes filling Cutty One of those ideas which sometime or another spring into the minds of all pretty women who are poor sprang into hers an idea such as an honest woman might muse over only to reject Sinister and cynical Kitty was at this moment in rather a desperate frame of mind Those two inherent characteristics which she had fought valiantly love of good times and of pretty clothes made ingress easy for this sinister and cynical idea Having gained a foothold it pressed forward boldly Cutty who had everything strength comeliness wisdom and money To live among all those beautiful things never to be lonely again to be waited on fussed over made much of taken into the high world Never more to add up accounts to stretch five dollar bills across the chasm of seven days An old man s darling No no no she burst out passionately She drew a hand across her eyes As if that gesture could rub out an evil thought It is all very well to say Avaunt But if the idea will not I couldn t I couldn t I d be a liar and a cheat But he is so nice If he did want me No no Just for comforts I couldn t What a miserable wretch I am She caught up the copper jug and still holding the roses to her heart the tears streaming down her cheeks rushed out to the kitchen for water She dropped the green stems into the jug buried her face in the buds to cool the hot shame on her cheeks and remembered what a ridiculous thing the mind was that she had three shirt waists to iron She set the jug on the kitchen table where it remained for many hours and walked over to the range to the flatiron shelf As she reached for a flatiron her hand stopped in midair A fat black wallet Instantly she knew who had placed it there That poor Johnny Two Hawks Kitty lifted out the wallet from behind the flatirons No doubt of it Johnny Two Hawks had placed it there when she had gone to the speaking tube to summon the janitor Not knowing if he would ever call for it Preferring that she rather than his enemies should have it And without a word What a simple yet amazing hiding place and but for the need of a flatiron the wallet would have stayed there until she moved Left it there with the premonition that he was heading into trouble But what if they had killed him How would she have explained the wallet s presence in her apartment Good gracious what an escape Without direct consciousness she raised the flap She saw the edges of money and documents but she did not touch anything There was no need She knew it belonged to Johnny Two Hawks Of course there was an appalling attraction The wallet was figuratively begging to be investigated But resolutely she closed the flap Why Because it was as though Two Hawks had placed the wallet in her hands charging her to guard it against the day he reclaimed it There was no outward proof that the wallet was his She just knew that was all Still she examined the outside carefully In one corner had been originally a monogram or a crest effectually obliterated by the application of fire Who he was and what he was by a simple turn of the wrist It was Cutty s affair now not hers He had a legal right to examine the contents He was an agent of the Federal Government The drums of jeopardy and Stefani Gregor and Johnny Two Hawks all interwoven She had waited in vain for Cutty to mention the emeralds What signified his silence She had indirectly apprised him of the fact that she knew the author of that advertisement offering to purchase the drums no questions asked Who but Cutty in New York would know about them The mark of the thong Johnny Two Hawks had been carrying the drums and Karlov s men had torn them from their victim s neck during the battle Was there any reason why Cutty should not have taken her completely into his confidence Palaces looted If Stefani Gregor had lived in a palace why not his protege Still it was possible Cutty was holding back until he could tell her everything But what to do with it If she called him up and made known her discovery Cutty would rush up as fast as a taxicab could bring him He had peremptorily ordered her not to come to his apartment for the present But to sit here and wait to be alone again after he had gone It was not to be borne Orders or no orders she would carry the wallet to him He could lecture her as much as he pleased To night at least she would lay aside her part as parlour maid in the drama It would give her something to do keep her mind off herself Nothing but excitement would pull her out of this semi hysterical doldrum She hid the wallet in the pocket of her underskirt Already her blood was beginning to dance She ran into her bedroom for two veils a gray automobile puggree and one of those heavy black affairs with butterflies scattered over it quite as effectual as a mask She wound the puggree about her hat When the right moment came she would discard the puggree and drop the black veil Her coat was of dark blue lined with steel gray taffeta Turned inside out it would fool any man She wore spats These she would leave behind when she made the change Someone might follow her as far as the Knickerbocker but beyond there never She was sorry but she dared not warn Bernini He might object notify Cutty and spoil everything By the time she reached the street exhilaration suffused her The melancholia was gone The sinister and cynical idea had vanished apparently Apparently Merely it had found a hiding place and was content to abide there for the present Such ideas are not without avenues of retreat they know the hours of attack Kitty was alive to but one fact The game of hide and seek was on again She was going to have some excitement She was going into the night on an adventure as children play at bears in the dark The youth in her still rejected the fact that the woof and warp of this adventure were murder and loot and pain En route to the Subway she never looked back At Forty second Street she detrained walked into the Knickerbocker entered the ladies dressing room turned her coat redraped her hat checked her gaiters and sought a taxi Within two blocks of Cutty s she dismissed the cab and finished the journey on foot At the left of the lobby was an all night apothecary s with a door going into the lobby Kitty proceeded to the elevator through this avenue Number Four was down and she stepped inside raising her veil You miss Very important Take me up The boss is out No matter Take me up You re the doctor What a pretty girl she was No come on in her eyes though The boss may not get back until morning He just went out in his engineer s togs He sure wasn t expecting you Do you know where he went Never know But I ll be in this bird cage until he comes back I shall have to wait for him Up she goes As Kitty stepped out into the corridor a wave of confusion assailed her She hadn t planned against Cutty s absence There was nothing she could say to the nurse and if Johnny Two Hawks was asleep why all she could do would be to curl up on a divan and await Cutty s return The nurse appeared You Miss Conover Yes Kitty realized at once that she must take the nurse into her confidence I have made a really important discovery Did Cutty say when he would return No I am not in his confidence to that extent But I do know that you assumed unnecessary risks in coming here Kitty shrugged and produced the wallet Is mister Hawksley awake He is It appears that he left this wallet in my kitchen that night It might buck him up if I gave it to him The nurse eyeing the lovely animated face conceded that it might Come I ve been trying futilely to read him asleep but he is restless No excitement please I ll try not to Perhaps after all you had better give him the wallet On the contrary that would start a series of questions I could not answer Come along When Kitty saw Hawksley she gave a little gasp of astonishment Why he was positively handsome His dark head standing out boldly against the bolstering pillows the fine lines of his face definite the pallor he was like a Roman cameo Who and what could he be this picturesque foundling His glance flashed into hers delightedly For hours and hours the constant wonder where she was why no one mentioned her why they evaded his apparently casual questions To burst upon his vision in the nadir of his boredom and loneliness like this She was glorious this American girl She made him think of a golden scabbard housing a fine Toledo blade Hadn t she saved his life More hadn t she assumed a responsibility in so doing Instantly he purposed that she should not be permitted to resign the office of good Samaritan He motioned toward the nurse s chair and Kitty sat down her errand in total eclipse Just when I never felt so lonely Ripping His quick smile was so engaging that Kitty answered it kindred spirits subconsciously recognizing each other Fire but neither of them knew that or that two lonely human beings of opposite sex in touch constitute a first rate combustible Quietly the nurse withdrew There would be a tonic in this meeting for the patient Her own presence might neutralize the effect She had not spent all those dreadful months in base hospitals without acquiring a keen insight into the needs of sick men No harm in letting him have this pretty self reliant girl alone to himself for a quarter of an hour She would then return with some broth How how are you asked Kitty inanely Top hole considering Quite ready to be killed all over again You mustn t talk like that she protested Only to show you I was bucking up Thank you for doing what you did I had to do it Most women would have run away and left me to my fate Not my kind Rather not Your kind would risk its neck to help a stray cat I say what s that you have in your hand Good gracious Kitty extended the wallet It is yours isn t it Yes I wanted you to bring it to me the way you have If I hadn t come back out of that it was to be yours Mine dumfounded But Why not Gregor gone there wasn t a soul in the world I was hungry and you gave me food I wanted that to pay you I ll wager you ve never looked into it I had no right to See He opened the wallet and spread the contents on the counterpane I wasn t so stony as you thought What Cash and unregistered bonds They would have been yours absolutely But I don t I can t quite Kitty stammered but I couldn t have kept them Positively yes You would have shown them to that ripping guardian of yours and he would have made you see Indeed yes He would have been scared to death You poor man can t you see Circumstantial evidence that I had killed you Good Lord And you re right too So it goes You can t do anything you want to do The good Samaritan is never requited and I wanted to break the rule Lord what a bally mix up I d have tumbled you in I forgot that you were you that you would have gone straight to the authorities Of course I knew if I pulled through and you found the wallet you would bring it to me Kitty no longer had a foot on earth She floated Her brain floated too because she could not make it think coherently for her A fortune for a dish of bacon and eggs The magnificence the utter prodigality of such generosity For a dish of bacon and eggs and a bottle of milk Had she left home Hadn t she fallen asleep the victim of another nightmare A corner of the atmosphere cleared a little A desire took form she wanted the nurse to come back and stabilize things In a wavering blur she saw the odd young man restore the money and bonds and other documents to the wallet I want you to give this to your guardian when he comes in I want him to understand I say you know I m going to love that old thoroughbred He s fine Fancy his carrying me on his shoulders and eventually bringing me up here among the clouds Americans Are you all like that And you Kitty s brain began to make preparations to alight as it were Cutty That gave her a touch of earth She heard herself say faintly And what about me You were brave and kind To help an unknown friendless beggar like that when you should have turned him over to the police Makes me feel a bit stuffy They left me for dead I wonder What If it wouldn t have been just as well You mustn t talk like that You just mustn t You re with friends real friends who want to help you all they can And then with a little flash of forced humour because of the recurrent tightening in her throat Who could be friendless with all that money Instantly she felt like biting her tongue He would know nothing of the sad American habit of trying to be funny to keep a wobbly situation on its legs He would interpret it as heartlessness I didn t mean that With the Irish impulsiveness which generally weighs acts in retrospection she reached over and gripped his hand I say you two Hawksley closed his eyes for a second Wanting to buck up a chap because you re that sort All right I ll stick it out You two And I might be the worst scoundrel unhung He drew her hand toward his lips and Kitty had not the power to resist him She felt strangely theatrical a character in a play for American men except in playful burlesque never kissed their women s hands The moment he released the hand the old wave of hysteria rolled over her She must fly The desire to weep little fool that she was was breaking through her defences Loneliness The two of them all alone but for Cutty She rose crushing the wallet in her hand Ah never had she needed that darling mother of hers so much as now Tears did not seem to afford relief when one shed them into handkerchiefs and pillows But on that gentle bosom to let loose this brimming flood to hear the tender voice consoling Oh I say now Please she heard Johnny Two Hawks cry out But she rushed on blindly knocking against the door jamb and almost upsetting the nurse who was returning Somehow she managed to reach the living room glad it was dark Alter sundry reaching about she found the divan and flung herself upon it What would he think What would the nurse think That Kitty Conover had suddenly gone stark raving crazy And now that she was in the dark alone the desire to weep passed over and she lay quietly with her face buried in the pillow But not for long She sat up Music violin music A gay waltz that made her think of flashing water the laughter of children Tschaikowsky Thrilled she waited for the finale Silence Scharwenka s Polish Dance with a swing and a fire beyond anything she had ever heard before Another stretch of silence a silence full of interrogation points Then a tender little sketch quite unfamiliar But all at once she understood He was imploring her to return She smiled in the dark but she knew she was going to remain right where she was Miss Conover It was the voice of the nurse Yes I m over here on the divan Anything wrong Good gracious no I m overtired A little hysterical maybe The parade to day with all those wounded boys in automobiles the music and colour and excitement have rather done me up And the way I rushed up here And not finding Cutty Anything I can get for you No thanks I ll try to snatch a little sleep before Cutty returns But he may be gone all night Will it be so very scandalous if I stay here You poor child Go ahead and sleep Don t hesitate to call me if you want anything I have a mild sedative if you would like it No thanks I did not know that mister Hawksley played Wonderfully But does it bother you It kind of makes me choky I ll tell him Kitty now strangely at peace snuggled down among the pillows Some great Polish violinist who had roused the bitter enmity of the anarchist But no he was Russian Cutty had admitted that It struck her that Cutty knew a great deal more than Kitty Conover and so far as she could see there was no apparent reason for this secrecy She rather believed she had Cutty Either he should tell her everything or she would run loose Bolshevik or no Bolshevik Sheep She boosted one over the bars another and another Round somewhere in the thirties the bars dissolved The next thing she knew she was blinking in the light Cutty his arms folded staring down at her sombrely There was blood on his face and blood on his hands CHAPTER XX Karlov moodily touched the shoulder of the man on the cot Stefani Gregor puzzled him He came to this room more often than was wise driven by a curiosity born of a cynical philosophy to discover what it was that reenforced this fragile body against threats and thirst and hunger He knew what he wanted of Gregor the fiddler on his knees begging for mercy And always Gregor faced him with that silent calm which reminded him of the sea aloof impervious exasperating Only once since the day he had been locked in this room had Gregor offered speech He Karlov had roared at him threatened baited but his reward generally had been a twisted wintry smile He could not offer physical torture beyond the frequent omissions of food and water the body would have crumbled To have planned this for months and then to be balked by something as visible yet as elusive as quicksilver Born in the same mudhole and still Boris Karlov the avenger could not understand Stefani Gregor the fiddler Perhaps what baffled him was that so valiant a spirit should be housed in so weak a body It was natural that he Boris with the body of a Carpathian bear should have a soul to match But that Stefani with his paper body should mock him The damned bourgeoisie The quality of this unending calm was understandable Gregor was always ready to die What to do with a man to whom death was release To hold the knout and to see it turn to water in the hand In lying he had overreached Gregor having accepted as fact the reported death of Ivan had nothing to live for Having brought Gregor here to torture he had blind fool taken away the fiddler s ability to feel The fog cleared He himself had given his enemy this mysterious calm He had taken out Gregor s soul and dissipated it No Not quite dissipated What held the body together was the iron residue of the soul Venom and blood clogged Karlov s throat He could kill only the body as he had killed the fiddle he could not reach the mystery within Ah but he had wrung Stefani s heart there There were pieces of the fiddle on the table where Gregor had placed them doubtless to weep over when he was alone Why hadn t he thought to break the fiddle a little each day Stefani Gregor sit up I have come to talk This was formula Karlov did not expect speech from Gregor Slowly the thin arms bore up the torso slowly the legs swung to the floor But the little gray man s eyes were bright and quick to night Boris what is it you want To talk surprised at this unexpected outburst No no I mean what is it all about these killings these burnings Karlov was ready at all times to expound the theories that appealed to his dark yet simple mind humanity overturned as one overturned the sod in the springtime to give it new life To give the proletariat what is his Ha said the little man on the cot What is his That which capitalism has taken away from him The proletariat The lowest in the human scale and therefore the most helpless They shall rule say you My poor Russia Beaten and robbed for centuries and now betrayed by a handful of madmen with brains atrophied on one side You are a fool Boris Your feet are in strange quicksands and your head among chimeras You write some words on a piece of paper and lo you say they are facts Without first proving your theories correct you would ram them down the throat of the world The world rejects you Wait and see damned bourgeoisie thundered Karlov not alive to the fact that he was being baited Bourgeoisie Yes I am of the middle class the rogue on top and the fool below I see The rogue and the fool cannot combine unless the bourgeoisie is obliterated Go on I am interested Under the soviet the government shall be everything As it was in Prussia Karlov ignored this The individual shall never again become rich by exploiting the poor Karlov strove to speak calmly Gregor s willingness to discuss the aims of the proletariat confused him He suspected some ulterior purpose behind this apparent amiability He must hold down his fury until this purpose was in the open Well that is good Gregor admitted But somehow it sounds ancient on my ear Was there not a revolution in France Fool it is the world that is revolting Karlov paused And no man in the future shall see his sister or his daughter made into a loose woman without redress Your proletariat s sister and daughter But the daughter of the noble and the daughter of the bourgeoisie fair game Sometimes there enters a man s head what might be called a sick idea when the vitality is at low ebb and the future holds nothing Thus there was a grim and sick idea behind Gregor s gibes It was in his mind to die All the things he had loved had been destroyed So then to goad this madman into a physical frenzy Once those gorilla like hands reached out for him Stefani Gregor s neck would break Be still fiddler You know what I mean There will be no upper class which is idleness and wastefulness no middle class the usurers the gamblers of necessities the war makers One great body of equals shall issue forth All shall labour For what The common good Your Lenine offered peace bread and work for the overthrow of Kerensky What you have given murder and famine and idleness Can there be common good that is based upon the blood of innocents Did Ivan ever harm a soul Have I You Karlov trembled You with your damned green stones Did you not lure Anna to dishonour with the promise to show her the drums the sight of which would make all her dreams come true A child with a fairy story in her head You speak of Anna If you hadn t been spouting your twaddle in taverns you would have had time to instruct Anna against guilelessness and superstition How much did they pay you Did you fiddle for her to dance But I left their faces in the mud A madman with two obsessions A pitiable Samson with his arms round the pillars of society to drag it down upon his head because society had defiled his sister Ah how many thousands in Russia like him A great yearning filled Gregor s heart because he understood but he suppressed expression of it because the sick idea was stronger Yes yes I loved those green stones because it was born in me to love beautiful things Have you forgotten Boris the old days in Moscow when we were students and I made you weep with my fiddle There was hope for you then You had not become a pothouse orator on the rights of the proletariat the red combed rooster on the smouldering dungheap Beauty no matter in what form I loved it Yes I was mad about those emeralds I was always stealing in to see them to hold them to the light simply because they were beautiful Gregor s hands flew to his throat which he bared I lured her there Twas I Boris Those beautiful hands of yours fit for the butcher s block Kill me Kill me But Karlov shrank back covering his eyes No I see now You wish to die You shall live He rushed toward the far wall a huge grotesque shadow rising to meet him his own thrown upon the wall by the wavering candlelight He turned shaking for the temptation had been great At once Gregor realized his failure The tenseness went out of him He spoke calmly Yes I wanted to die I no longer possess anything I lied Boris but it is useless to tell you that I knew nothing of Anna until it was too late I wanted to die Karlov began to pace furiously the candle flame springing after him each time he passed it There was a question in Gregor s mind It rushed to his lips a dozen times but he dared not voice it Olga Since Karlov could not be tempted to murder it would be futile to ask for an additional burden of mental torture Perhaps it had not happened the terrible picture he drew in his mind since Karlov had not boasted of it Come Boris There is blood on your hands What is one more daub of it Karlov stopped scowled and ran his fingers through his hair Perhaps some ugly memory stirred the roots of it You wish to die Gregor bent his head to his hands and Karlov resumed his pacing After a while Gregor looked up Private vengeance You begin your rule with private vengeance The vengeance of a people All the breed Did France stop at Louis Do we tear up the roots of the poisonous toadstool that killed someone we loved and leave the other toadstools thriving To cure the world of all its ills by tearing up the toadstools and the flowers together do you call that justice The proletariat shall have everything and he begins by killing off noble and bourgeoisie and dividing up the loot Even with his oppression the noble had a right to live The bourgeoisie must die because of his benefactions to a people The world for the proletariat and damnation for the rest Let each become one of us cried Karlov hoarsely We give them that right You lie You have done nothing but assassinate them when they surrendered But tell me have not you Lenine and Trotzky overlooked something What Karlov was vaguely grateful for this diversion The lust to kill was still upon him and he was fighting it He must remember that Gregor wished to die What have we overlooked Human nature Can you tear it apart and reconstruct it as you would a clock What of creative genius in this proletariat millennium of yours The state will carefully mother that Gregor laughed sardonically Will there be creative genius under your rule Will you not suffocate it by taking away the air that energizes it ambition You will have all the present marvels of invention to start with but will you ever go beyond Have you read history and observed the inexorable I doubt it What is progress A series of almost imperceptible steps Which capitalism has always obstructed flung back Karlov Which capitalism has always made possible Curb it yes but abolish it as you have done in unhappy Russia Why do you starve there Poor fool because you have assassinated those forces which created food that is to say put it where you could get it Three quarters of Russia are against you You read nothing in that The efficient and the inefficient they shall lie down together as the lion and the ass to paraphrase They shall become equal because you say so What is fundamentally this Bolshevism The revolt of the inefficient The mantle of horror that was Germany s you have torn from her shoulders and thrown upon yours Fools The anarch s huge fists became knotted wrinkles corrugated his forehead but he did not stir Gregor wanted to die Gregor pointed with trembling hand toward the brown litter on the table To destroy You shattered a soul there You tore mine apart when you did it For what To better humanity No to rend something to obliterate something that was beautiful Demolition Go on You will tear and rend until exhaustion comes then some citizen king some headstrong Napoleon will step in The French Revolution taught you nothing You play The Marseillaise in the Neva Prospekt and miss the significance of that song Liberty You choose license Equality You deny it in your acts Fraternity You slaughter your brothers Be silent roared Karlov wavering But Gregor continued with a new found hope He saw that his jeers were wearing down the other s control Perhaps the weak side was the political Karlov was a fanatic There might yet be death in those straining fingers To seize by confiscation without justice indiscriminately all that the group efficient laboriously constructed I enter your house kill your family and steal your silver Are your acts fundamentally different from mine Remember I am speaking from the point of view as three quarters of Russia see it and all the other civilized nations There may be something magnificent in that soviet constitution of yours but you have deluged it in blood and folly Ostensibly you are dividing up the great estates but actually you are parcelling them out and charging rent You will not own anything The state shall own all the property What will be the patriotism of the man who has nothing Why defend something that is only his government s not his own You are legalizing women as cows The sense of motherhood will vanish when a woman may not select her mate What is the greatest thing in the world The human need of possession To own something however little The spur of creative genius Human beings will never be equal except in lawful privileges The skillful will outpace the unskillful the thrifty will take from the improvident genius will overtop mediocrity And you will change all this with a scrape of your bloody pen Karlov s body began to rock and sway like an angry bear s but still he held his ground Gregor wanted to die to cheat him What of power went on his baiter Capitalism of might Lenine and Trotzky are they have they been honest Has Russia actually voted them into office They sit in the seats of the mighty by the capitalism of force For the capitalism of money which is progress physical and moral you substitute the capitalism of force which is terror You speak of yourselves as internationalists Bats that is the judgment day of God internationalism For only on the judgment day will nations become a single people A short silence Gregor was beginning to grow weak Presently he picked up the thread of his diatribe I have lived in England France Italy and here I am competent to draw comparisons Where you went to distill poison I went to absorb facts And I found that here in this great democracy is the true idea But you will not read the lesson Sweat began to drop from Karlov s beetling eyebrows You will fail miserably here Why Because the Americans are the greatest of individual property owners The sense of possession is satisfied And woe to the fool who suggests they surrender this Little wooden houses thousands and thousands of them with a small plot of ground in the rear where a man in the springtime may dig his hands into the soil and say gratefully to God Mine mine I too am a Russ I thought in the beginning that you would take this country as an example a government of the people by the people for the people Wrongs Yes But day by day these wrongs are being righted No lesson in this for Trotzky a beer hall orator like yourself Ten million men drafted to carry arms Did they revolt Shoulder to shoulder the selected millions marched to the great ships shoulder to shoulder they pressed toward the Rhine No lesson in that Capitalism seeking to save its loans you rant Capitalism of blood and money that asked only for simple justice to mankind The ideal of a great people a mixture of all bloods even German No lessons in these tremendous happenings And you babble about your damned proletariat who represents the dregs of Russia What is he The inefficient whining that the other man has the luck so kill him Russia the kindly ox fallen among wolves You cannot tear down the keystone of civilization which took seven thousand years to construct insert it upside down and expect the arch to stand You have your chance to prove your theories Prove them in Petrograd and Moscow and you will not have to go forth with the torch And what is this torch but the hidden fear that you may be wrong To wreck the world before you are found out You are idiots and you have turned Russia into a madhouse Spawns from the dung heap Damn you Stefani Gregor Karlov rushed to the cot raised his terrible fists his chest heaving Gregor waited No no You wish to die The madman swung on his heels and dashed toward the door sweeping the pieces of the violin to the floor as he passed the table Gregor feebly drew himself back upon his cot and laid his face in the pillow Ivan my violin all that I knew and loved gone And God will not let me die CHAPTER XXI From a window in one of the vacant warehouses twenty odd feet away Cutty from an oblique angle had witnessed the peculiar drama without being able to grasp head or tail to it For two hours he had crouched behind his window watching the man on the cot and wondering if he would ever turn his face toward the candlelight Then Karlov had entered Gregor s ironic calm with the exception of the time he had bared his throat and Karlov s tempestuous exit baffled him To the eye it had the appearance of a victory for Gregor and a defeat for Karlov but Cutty had long ago ceased to believe his eyes without some corroborative evidence of auricular character He had recognized both men Karlov answered to Kitty s description as an old glove answers to the hand And no man once having seen Gregor could possibly forget his picturesque head The old chap was alive This fact made the night s adventure tally one hundred per cent How to get a cheery word to him to buck him up with the promise of help A hard nut to crack so many obstacles Primarily this was a Federal affair Yonder hid the werewolf and his pack and it would be folly to send them scattering just for the sake of advising Gregor that he was being watched over Underneath the official obligation there was a personal interest in not risking the game to warn Gregor Cutty was now positive that the drums of jeopardy were hidden somewhere in this house To perform three acts then Save Gregor capture Karlov and his pack and privately confiscate the emeralds Findings were keepings No compromise regarding those green stones It would not particularly hurt his reputation with saint Peter to play the half rogue once in a lifetime Besides saint Peter hadn t he stolen something himself back there in the Biblical days or got into a scrape or something The old boy would understand Cutty grinned in the dark Any obsession is a blindfold A straight course lay open to Cutty but he chose the labyrinthian because he was obsessed He wanted those emeralds Nothing less than the possession of them would to his thinking round out a varied and active career Later perhaps he would declare the stones to the customs and pay the duty perhaps Thus his subsequent mishaps this night may be laid to the fact that he thought and saw through green spectacles The idea that the jewels were hidden near by made it imperative that he should handle this affair exclusively Coles the operative he had sent to negotiate with Karlov was conceivably a prisoner upstairs or down Coles knew about the drums and they must not turn up under his eye Federal property in that event If ever he laid his hands upon the drums he would buy something gorgeous for Kitty Little thoroughbred Time for work Without doubt Karlov had cellar exits through this warehouse or the other The job on hand would be first to locate these exits and then to the trap on the roof With his pocket lamp blazing a trail he went down to the cellar and carefully inspected the walls that abutted those of the house Nothing on this side He left the warehouse and hugged the street wall for a space The street was deserted Instead of passing Karlov s abode he wisely made a detour of the block He reached the entrance to the second warehouse without sighting even a marauding tom In the cellar of this warehouse he discovered a newly made door painted skillfully to represent the limestone of the foundation Tiptop Immediately he outlined the campaign There should be two drives one from the front and another from the roof so that not an anarchist or Bolshevik could escape The mouth of the Federal sack should be held at this cellar exit No matter what kind of game he played offside the raid itself must succeed absolutely Nothing should swerve him from making these plans as perfect as it was humanly possible He would be on hand to search Karlov himself If the drums were not on him he would return and pick the old mansion apart lath by lath Gay old ruffian wasn t he Another point worth considering He would keep his discoveries under cover until the hour to strike came Some over zealous subordinate might attempt a coup on his own and spoil everything He picked his way to the far end of the cellar to the doors Locks gone He took it for granted that the real estate agent would not come round with prospective tenants These doors would take them into the trucking alley where there were a dozen feasible exits There was no way out of the house yard as the brick wall ten feet high and running from warehouse to warehouse was blind Now for the trap on the roof He climbed the three flights of stairs crisscrossed and festooned with ancient cobwebs Occasionally he sneezed in the crook of his elbow philosophizing over the fact that there was a lot of deadwood property in New York Americans were eternally on the move The window from which he intended dropping to the house roof was obdurate Only the upper half was movable With hardly any noise at all he pulled this down straddled it balanced himself secured a good grip on the ledge and let himself down The tips of his shoes rubber soled just reached the roof He landed silently The glare of the street lamp at the corner struck the warehouse and this indirect light was sufficient to work by He made the trap after a series of extra cautious steps The roof was slanting and pebbled and the least turn of the foot might start a cascade and bell an alarm A comfort loving dress suiter like himself playing Old Sleuth when he ought to be home and in bed It was all of two thirty What the deuce would he do when there were no more thrills in life He stooped and caught hold of a corner of the trap to test it and drew back with a silent curse Glass He had cut his hand The beggars had covered the trap with cement and broken glass sealing it It would take time to cut round the trap and even then he wouldn t be sure they might have nailed it down from the inside The worst of it was he would have to do the work himself and in the meantime Karlov would have a fair wind for his propaganda gas and perhaps the disposal of the drums to some collector who wasn t above bargaining for smuggled emeralds Odd though that Karlov should have made a prisoner of Coles What lay behind that manoeuvre Well this trap must be liberated no getting round that Hang it he wasn t going to be dishonest exactly it would be simply a double play half for Uncle Sam and half for himself The idea of offering freely his blood and money to Uncle Sam and at the same time putting one over on the old gentleman had a novel appeal He stood up and wiped a tickling cobweb from his cheek As the window from which he had descended came into range he stared loose jawed Then be chuckled as thoroughbred adventurers generally chuckle when they find themselves at the bottom of the sack the mouth of which has simultaneously and automatically closed Wasn t he the brainy old top Wasn t he Sherlock Holmes plus Old fool how the devil was he going to get back through that window The drums of jeopardy even to think of them was unlucky Not to have planned a retreat to have climbed down a well and cut the bucket rope For in effect that was precisely what he had done Only wings could carry him up to that window With sardonic humour he felt of his shoulder blades Not a feather in sight Then he touched his ears Ah here was something definite they had grown several inches during the past few hours Monumental ass Of course there would be the drain He could escape but dear Lord with enough noise to wake the dead And that would write Finis to this particular adventure The quarry and the emeralds would be gone before he could return with help When everything had gone so smoothly a jolt like this A crowded day and no mistake as full of individual acts as a bill at a vaudeville trained animal act last Was it possible that he had gone fiddle hunting that morning netting an Amati worth ten thousand dollars Hawksley no he couldn t blame Hawksley Still if this young Humpty Dumpty hadn t been pushed off his wall he Cutty would not now be marooned upon this roof twixt the devil and the deep blue sea To remain here until sunrise would be impossible to slide down the drain was equally impossible that is if he ever wanted to see Boris Karlov again The way of the transgressor was hard He sat on his heels and let his gaze rove four square permitting no object to escape He saw a clothes pole leaning against the chimney Evidently the former tenants had hung up their laundry here There was no clothesline however Caught jolly well blooming well caught If ever this got abroad he would be laughed out of the game He wasn t going to put one over on Uncle Sam after all There might be some kind of a fire escape on the front of the house No harm in taking a look it would serve to pass the time There was the usual frontal parapet about three feet in height Upturned in the shadow lay a gift from the gods a battered kitchen chair probably used to reach the clothesline in the happy days when the word Bolshevism was known to only a select few dark angels Cutty waved a hand cheerfully if vaguely toward his guiding star picked up the chair commandeered the clothes pole and silently manoeuvred to the wall of the warehouse Standing on the chair he placed the tip of the pole against the top of the upper frame and pushed the frame halfway up He repeated this act upon the obdurate lower half He heaved slowly but with all his force Glory be the lower half went up far enough to afford ingress He would eat his breakfast in the apartment as usual To morrow night he would establish his line of retreat by fetching a light rope ladder There was sweat at the roots of his hair however when he finally gained the street He was very tired He observed mournfully that the vigour which had always recharged itself no matter how recklessly he had drawn upon it was beginning to protest Fifty two Well his troubles were over for the night So he believed Arriving home dirty and spent he had to find Kitty asleep on the divan CHAPTER XXII Kitty he said breaking the tableau what are you doing here You ve been hurt There is blood on you A trifling cut But I m hurt nevertheless that you should be so thoughtless as to come here against my orders It doesn t matter that Karlov has given up the idea of having you followed But for the sake of us all you must be made to understand that we are dealing with high explosives and poison gas It s not what might happen to me or to Uncle Sam s business It s you Any moment they may take it into their heads to get at me and Hawksley through you That s why we watch over you You don t want to see Hawksley done in do you It s real tragedy Kitty and nobody can guess what the end is going to be Kitty s lip quivered Cutty if you talk like that to me I shall cry Good Lord what about bewildered About everything I ve been on the verge of hysterics all day Kitty you poor child what s happened Nothing everything Lonesome When I saw all those mothers and wives and sisters and sweethearts on the curb to day watching their boys march by it hit me hard I was alone Nobody So please don t be cross with me I m on the ragged edge Silly I know But we women often go to pieces over nothing without any logical reason Ready to face murder and battle and sudden death and then to blow up as you men say it over nothing I had to move go somewhere do something so I came here But I came on what do you call it official business Here She offered him the wallet What s this Belongs to Johnny Two Hawks He hid it that night behind my flatirons on the range Why Cutty he s rich Did he show the contents Only the money and the bonds He said if he had died the money and bonds would have been mine Providing Gregor was also dead Cutty looked into the wallet but disturbed nothing I imagine these funds are actually Gregor s He told me to give the wallet to you And so I waited I fell asleep So please don t scold me I m a brute But it s because you ve become so much to me that I was angry You re Tommy and Molly s girl and I ve got to watch out for you until you reach some kind of a port Thank you for the flowers You ll never know just what they did for me There was somebody who gave me a thought Kitty I honestly don t get you A beauty like you lonesome That s it I am pretty Why should I deny it If I d been homely I shouldn t have been ashamed to invite my friends to my shabby home I shouldn t have cold shouldered everybody through false pride But where have you been and what have you been doing Official business But I just missed being a fine jackass I ll look into the wallet after I ve cleaned up I m a mess of gore and dust Is it interesting stuff dreading her answer The wallet I did not look into it I had no right Ah Well I ll be back in two jigs He hurried off relieved to learn that the secret was still beyond Kitty s knowledge Of course Hawksley wouldn t carry anything in the wallet by which his true identity might be made known Still there would be stuff to excite her interest and suspicion Hawksley had shown her some of that three hundred thousand probably What a game He would say nothing about his own adventures and discoveries He worked on the theory that the best time to tell about something was after it had become a fact But no theory is perfect and in this instance his reticence was going to cost him intolerable agony in the near future Within a quarter of an hour he was back in the living room Kitty was out of sight probably had curled up on the divan again He would not disturb her Hawksley s wallet He drew a chair under the reading lamp and explored the wallet Money and bonds he rather expected but the customs appraiser s receipt was like a buffet The emeralds belonged honorably to his guest All his own plans were knocked galley west by this discovery An odd sense of indignation blazed up in him as though someone had imposed upon him The sport was gone the fun of the thing it became merely official business To appropriate a pair of smuggled emeralds was a first class sporting proposition with a humorous twist As it stood now he would be picking Hawksley s pocket and he wasn t rogue enough for that Hang the luck Emeralds rubies sapphires pearls and diamonds No doubt many of them with histories in a bag hung to his neck and all these thousands of miles Not since the advent of the Gaekwar of Baroda into San Francisco in nineteen ten had so many fine stones passed through that port of entry But why hadn t Hawksley inquired about them Stoic indifference A good loser How had he got through the customs without a lot of publicity The Russian consul of the old regime probably and an appraiser who was a good sport To have come safely to his destination and then to have lost out The magnificent careless generosity of putting the wallet behind Kitty s flatirons to be hers if he didn t pull through Why this fiddling derelict was a man Stood up and fought Karlov with his bare fists wasn t ashamed to weep over his mother s photograph and fiddled like Heifetz All right This Johnny Two Hawks as Kitty persisted in calling him was going to reach his Montana ranch His friend Cutty would take it upon himself to see to that It struck him that after all he would have to play the game as he had planned it Those gems falling into the hands of the Federal agents would surely bring to light Hawksley s identity and Hawksley should have his chance Cutty then came upon the will Somehow the pathos of it went deep into his heart The poor devil a will that hadn t been witnessed the handwriting the same as that on the passport If he had fallen into the hands of the police they would have justifiably locked him up as a murder suspect Two Hawks It was a small world He returned the contents to the wallet leaving out the will however This he thrust into a drawer Coffee said Kitty at his elbow Kitty I d forgotten you I thought I smelt coffee Just what I wanted too only I hadn t brains enough left to think of it Smells better than anything Kuroki makes Tastes better too You re going to make some lucky duffer a fine wife Is there anything you can tell me Cutty A whole lot Kitty only I m twenty years too old I mean the wallet Who is he Cutty drained the cup slowly A good coherent lie to appease Kitty s curiosity half a truth something hard to nail He set down the empty cup building By the time he had filled his pipe and lit it he was ready Something bored up through the subconscious however a query Why hadn t he told her the plain truth at the start Wasn t on account of the drums He hadn t kept her in the dark because of the drums He could have trusted her with that part of it his tentative piracy That to divulge Hawksley s identity would be a menace to her peace of mind now appeared ridiculous and yet he had worked forward from this assumption No answer to the query Generally he thought clearly enough but somewhere along this route he had made a muddle of things and couldn t find the spot The only point clearly defined was that he should wish to keep her out of the affair because there were elements of positive danger But somewhere inside of him was a question asking for recognition and it eluded him Nothing could be solved until this question got out of the fog Even now he might risk the whole truth but the lie he had woven appeared too good to waste Human frailty The most accomplished human being is the finished liar Never to forget a detail to remember step by step the windings over a ticklish road And Cutty for all his wide newspaper experience was a poor liar because he had been brought up on facts Perhaps his lie might have passed had he not been so fagged The physical labours of the night had dulled his perceptions Ab but that tastes good as he blew forth a wavering ring of smoke It ought to have at least one merit replied Kitty wrinkling her nose What a fine profile Cutty had Now who and what is he I m dying to know An odd story probably hundreds like it You see the Bolsheviki have driven out of the country or killed all the nobles and bourgeoisie Some of them have escaped into China Sweden India wherever they could find an open route To his story there are many loose ends and Hawksley is not the talking kind You mustn t repeat what I tell you Hawksley with all that money and a forged English passport would have a good deal of trouble explaining if he ran afoul the police There is no real proof that the money is his or Gregor s As a matter of fact it is Gregor s and Hawksley was bringing it to him Hawksley is Gregor s protege Kitty nodded This dovetailed with what Johnny Two Hawks had told her that night How the two came together originally I don t know Gregor was in his younger days a great violinist but unknown to the American public Early in his career he speculated with his concert earnings and turned a pot of money He dropped the professional career for that of a country gentleman He had a handsome estate and lived sensibly He sent Hawksley to England to school and spent a good deal of time there with him teaching him how to play the fiddle for which it seems Hawksley had a natural bent He had to Anglicize his name for Two Hawks would have made people laugh To be a gentleman Kitty one does not have to be a prince or a grand duke Gregor was a polished gentleman and he turned Hawksley into one Again Kitty nodded her eyes sparkling The Russ the educated Russ is a queer biscuit Got to have a finger in some political pie and political pies in Russia before the war were lese majesty The result Gregor got in wrong with his secret society and the political police and was forced to fly to save his life But before he fled he had all his convertible funds transferred Only his estate was confiscated Hawksley was in London when the war broke out There was a lot of red tape naturally regarding the funds I shan t bother you with that Hawksley hoping to better his protector s future returned to Russia and joined his regiment and fought until the Czar abdicated Foretasting the trend of events he tried to get back to England but that was impossible He was permitted to retire to the Gregor estate where he remained until the uprising of the Bolsheviki Then he started across the world to join Gregor That was brave It certainly was I imagine that Hawksley s journey has that of Ulysses laid away on the shelf Karlov was the head of the society which had voted Gregor s death So he had agents watching Hawksley And Karlov himself undertook the chase across Russia China and the Pacific I m glad I gave him something to eat But Gregor a valet in a hotel with all that money The red tape What a dizzy world we live in Cutty Dizzy is the word Cutty sighed His yarn had passed a very shrewd censor Karlov feels it his duty to kill off all his countryman who do not agree with his theories He wanted these funds here but Hawksley was too clever for him Remember now not a word of this to Hawksley I tell you this in confidence I promise You ll have to spend the night here It s round four and the power has been shut off There s the stairs but it would be dawn before you reach the street Who cares I do I don t believe you re in a good mood to send back to that garlicky warren I wish to the Lord you d leave it It s difficult to find anything desirable within my means Rents are terrifying I ll sleep on the divan A rug or a blanket I m a silly fool I suppose You can have a guest room I d rather the divan less scandalous Cutty I forgot He played for me What He did I had to run out of the room because some things he said choked me up Didn t care whether he died or not He was even lonelier than I I lay down on the divan and then I heard music Funny but somehow I fancied he was calling me back and I had to hang on to the divan Cutty he is a great violinist Are you fond of music I am mad about it I m always running round to concerts and I d walk from Battery to Bronx to hear a good violinist Fiddles and Irish hearts Swiftly came the vision of Hawksley fiddling the heart out of this lonely girl if he had the chance And he Cutty was going to fascinate her with what He rose and took her by the shoulders bringing her round so that the light was full in her face Slate blue eyes Kitty what would you say if I kissed you Inwardly he asked Now what the devil made me say that The sinister and cynical idea leaped from its ambush Why Cutty I I don t believe I should mind It s it s you Vile wretch that she was Cutty noting the lily succeeding the rose did not kiss her Fate has a way of reversing the illogical and giving it logical semblance It was perfectly logical that he should not kiss her and yet that was exactly what he should have done The fatherliness of the salute and he couldn t have made it anything else would have shamed Kitty s peculiar state of mind out of existence and probably sent back to its eternal sleep that which was strangely reawaking in his lonely heart Forgive me Kitty That wasn t exactly nice of me even if I was trying to be funny She tore away from him flung herself upon the divan her face in the pillows and let down the dam This wild sobbing apparently without any reason terrified Cutty He put both hands into his hair but he drew them out immediately without retaining any of the thinning gray locks Done up both of them that was the matter He longed to console her but knew not what to say or how to act He had not seen a woman weep like this in so many years that he had forgotten the remedies Should he call the nurse But that would only add to Kitty s embarrassment and the nurse would naturally misinterpret the situation He couldn t kneel and put his arms round her and yet it was a situation that called for arms and endearments He had sense enough to recognize that Molly s girl crying like that and he able to do nothing It was intolerable But what was she weeping about Covering the divan was a fine piece of Bokhara embroidery He drew this down over Kitty and tucked her in turned off the light and proceeded to his bedroom Kitty s sobs died eventually There was an occasional hiccup That too disappeared To play or even think of playing a game like that She was despicable A silly little fool too to suppose that so keen a mind as Cutty s would not see through the artifice What was happening to her that she could let such a thought into her head By and by she was able to pick up Cutty s narrative and review it Not a word about the drums of jeopardy the mark of the thong round Hawksley s neck Hadn t she let him know that she knew the author of that advertisement offering to buy the drums no questions asked Very well then if he would not tell her the truth she would have to find it out herself Meanwhile Cutty sat on the edge of his bed staring blankly at the rug trying to find a pick up to the emotions that beset him One thing issued clearly He had wanted to kiss the child He still wanted to kiss her Why hadn t he Unanswerable It was still unanswerable even when the pallor of dawn began slowly to absorb the artificial light of his bed lamp CHAPTER XXIII When Cutty awoke having had about two hours sleep he was instantly conscious that the zest had gone from the adventure It had resolved itself into official business into which he had projected himself gratuitously and having assumed the offices of chief factor he would have to see the affair through victim of his own greediness It did not serve to marshal excuses He had frankly entered the affair in the role of buccaneer and here he was high and dry on the reef The drums of jeopardy so far as he was concerned had been shot into the moon two hundred thousand miles out of reach He found himself resenting Hawksley s honesty in the matter of the customs But immediately this sense of resentment caused him to chuckle Certainly some ancestor of his had been a Black Bart or a Galloping Dick He would put a few straight questions to Hawksley however To have lost all those precious stones and not to have inquired about them was a bit foggy wasn t normal human Unless bang on the plexus came the thought the beggar had hidden them himself He had been exceedingly clever in hiding the wallet Come to think of it he hadn t mentioned that either Of course he had hidden the stones either in Gregor s apartment or in Kitty s Blind as a bat Now he understood why Karlov had made a prisoner of Coles The old buzzard had sensed a trap and had countered it The way of the transgressor was hard His punishment for entertaining a looter s idea would be work when he wanted to loaf and enjoy himself Arriving at Hawksley s door he was confronted by a spectacle not without its humorous touch The nurse extending a bowl and Hawksley staring at the sky beyond the window stonily But you must insisted Miss Frances Chops or beefsteak It will give you nausea Permit me to find out Dash it I m hungry Hawksley declared I m no fever patient A smart rap on the head nothing more than that Healthy food will draw the blood down from there Haven t lost anything but a few hours of consciousness and you treat me as though I d been jolly well peppered with shrapnel and gassed Touch that stuff Rather not Chops or beefsteak Let him have it Miss Frances advised Cutty from the doorway But it s unusual replied the nurse as a final protest Give it a try Is he strong enough to sit up through breakfast He s really not fit But if he insists on doing the one he might as well do the other Righto from the patient Will you tell Kuroki to make it a beefsteak breakfast for four I know how mister Hawksley feels Been through the same bout Cutty wanted Miss Frances out of the room Very well Only I ve warned him Miss Frances left somewhat miffed Thanks said Hawksley smiling She thinks I m a canary Whereas you re an eagle Or a vulture Cutty chew up a chair Frankly I believe a good breakfast will put you a peg up A beefsteak Hawksley stared ecstatically at the ceiling You see I m naturally tough Always went in for rough sports football rowing boxing Poor old Stefani s idea and not so bad either Of course he was always worrying about my hands but I always took great care to keep them soft and pliant Which sounds rummy considering the pounding I used to give and take My word I used to go to bed with my hands done up in ointments like a professional beauty Of course I m dizzy yet and the bally spot is sore but solid food and some exercise will have me off your hands in no time I don t fancy being coddled y know I ve been trouble enough Don t let that worry you I ll bring some togs in flannels and soft shirts We re about the same height Anyhow the difference won t be noticeable in flannels I ve had to tell Miss Conover a bit of fiction I ll tell you so if need arises you can back me up When Cutty finished his romance Hawksley frowned All said and done if I m not that splendid old chap s protege what am I But for his patience and kindness I d have run true to the blood He was with me at the balancing age when a chap becomes a man or a rotter He actually gave up a brilliant career because of me He is a great musician with that strange faculty of taking souls out of people and untwisting them I have the gift too in a way but there s always a bit of the devil in me when I play Natural bent I fancy And they ve killed him No said Cutty slowly But this is for your ear alone He s alive and one of these days I ll bring him to you So buck up Alive Stefani alive whispered Hawksley He stretched out his hand rather blindly and Cutty was surprised at the strength of the grip Makes me feel choky I say are all Americans good Samaritans Cutty put this aside because he did not care to disillusion Hawksley I found an appraiser s receipt in your wallet You carried some fine jewels Did you hide them or did Karlov get them It struck me as odd that you haven t inquired about them The change that came into Hawksley s face alarmed Cutty The rich olive skin became chalky and the eyes closed What is it Shall I call Miss Frances No Hawksley opened his eyes but looked dully straight ahead The stones I was trying to forget My God I was trying to forget But they were yours Cutty was mystified beyond expression Yes mine mine mine panting Damn them Some day I ll tell you But just now I can t toe the mark I was trying to forget them Against my heart gnawing into my soul like the beetle of the Spanish Inquisition Silence But they were future bread and butter for Gregor as well as for myself They got them and may they damn Karlov as they have damned me I had no chance when I returned to Gregor s They were on me instantly I put up a fight but I d come from a lighted room and was practically blind Let them go Most of those stones came out of hell anyhow Let them go There is an unknown grave between those stones and me The level despair of the tone appalled Cutty A crime somewhere There was still a bottom to this affair he had not plumbed He rose deeply agitated I ll fetch those togs for you Miss Conover will breakfast with us and the sight of her will give you a brace I m sorry I had to ask you Beefsteak and a pretty girl That s something I suppose she was trapped by the lift not running Hawksley was trying to meet Cutty halfway to cover up the tragedy I say why the deuce do you let her live where she does Because I m not legally her guardian She is the daughter of the man and woman I loved best All I can do is to watch over her She lives on her earnings as a newspaper writer I d give her half of all I have if I had the least idea she would accept it Fond of her Fond of her repeated Cutty Why of course I m fond of her There was a touch of indignation in his tone Is she fond of you I suppose so What was the chap driving at Then marry her suggested Hawksley with a cynical smile make a settlement and give her her freedom Simple enough What Cutty stepped back stunned and terrified She would laugh at me You never can tell replied Hawksley maintaining the crooked smile The devil was blazing in his eyes now Try it It s being done every day even here in this big America of yours From the European point of view you have compromised her or she has compromised herself by spending the night here Convention has been disregarded A ripping good chance I call it You tell me she wouldn t accept benefits and you want to help her If she s the kind I believe her to be even if she refuses you she will not be angry You never can tell what woman will or won t do An old and forgotten bit of mental machinery began to set up a ditter datter in Cutty s brain Marry Kitty Make a settlement and then give her her freedom Rot Girls of Kitty s calibre were above such expediencies He tried to resurrect his interest in the drums of jeopardy which he might now appropriate without having to shanghai his conscience The clitter clatter smothered it indeed this new racket upset and demoralized the well ordered machinery of his thinking apparatus as applied daily Marry Kitty I m old enough to be her father What s that to do with it so long as convention is satisfied Cutty was so shaken and confused that he missed the tragic irony of the voice All the receptive avenues to his brain seemed to have shut down suddenly He was conscious only of the clitter clatter Marry Kitty You can t settle money on her went on Hawksley without scandal You can t offer her anything without offending her And you can t let her go to rust without having her bit of good times Utterly impossible said Cutty to the idea rather than to his tormentor Oh of course if you have an affair No God forgive me I don t mean that I m a damned ingrate But your bringing up those stones and knocking off the top of all the misery piling up in my heart I was only trying to hurt you hurt myself everybody Please have a little patience with me for I ve come out of hell Hawksley turned aside his head Buck up said Cutty his blazing wrath dropping to a smoulder I ll fetch those togs What had the boy done to fill him with such tragic bitterness Was he Two Hawks Cutty dismissed this doubt instantly He recalled the episode of the boy s conduct when confronted by the photograph of his mother No human being could be a play actor in such a moment The boy s emotion had been deep and real Cutty recognized the fact that he had become as a block in the middle of a Chinese puzzle only Fate could move him to his appointed place But offer marriage to Kitty so that he could provide for her Mechanically he rummaged his clothes press for the suit he was to take to Hawksley Well why not He could settle five thousand a year on her His departure for the Balkans he might be gone a year or more could be legally construed as desertion And with pretty clothes and freedom she would soon find some young chap to her liking But would a girl like Kitty see it from his point of view The marriage could take place an hour or two before he went aboard his ship Hang it Hawksley wasn t so far off Kitty couldn t possibly be offended if he laid the business squarely on the table To provide for Molly s girl When Kuroki announced that breakfast was ready Cutty went into the living room for Kitty whom he had not yet seen He found her by a window fascinated by the splendour of the panorama as seen in the morning light Not a vestige of the tears and disorder in which he had left her What had been behind those tears Dainty and refreshing to the eye as though she had stepped out of a bandbox Compromised That was utter rot Wasn t Miss Frances here Clitter clatter clitter clatter But Cutty was not aware that it was no longer in his head but in his heart Breakfast is served Your Highness he announced with a grave salaam Kitty pirouetted For some reason she could not explain to herself she wanted to laugh sing dance Perhaps it was because she was only twenty four Or it might have had its origin in the tonicky awakening among all these beautiful furnishings She assumed a haughty expression such as the Duchess of Gerolstein assumes when she appoints the private to the office of generalissimo and with a careless wave of the hand said Summon His Highness CHAPTER XXIV Between Cutty s heart and his throat there was very little space at that moment for the propelment of sound Kitty Conover had innocently he understood that almost immediately and recovered his mental balance Kitty had innocently thrown a bomb at his feet It did not matter that it was a dud The result was the same For a second then all the terror all the astounding suspension of thought and action attending the arrival of a shell on the battlefield were his As an aftermath he would have liked very much to sit down Instead maintaining the mock gravity of his expression he offered his arm which Kitty accepted still the Grand Duchess of Gerolstein Pompously they marched into the dining room But as Kitty saw Hawksley she dropped the air confusedly and hesitated Good gracious she whispered What s the matter Cutty whispered in turn My clothes What s the matter with em I slept in them If that wasn t like a woman It did not matter how she might look to an old codger aetat fifty two he didn t count But a handsome young chap now in white flannels and sport shirt his head bound picturesquely Don t let that bother you he said Those duds of his are mine Still Cutty was grateful for this little diversion As he drew back Kitty s chair he was wholly himself again At once he dictated the trend of the conversation moved it whither he willed into strange channels gave them all a glimpse of his amazing versatility with vivid shafts of humour to light up corners Kuroki who had travelled far with his master these ten years sometimes paused in his rounds to nod affirmatively Hawksley listened intently wondering a bit What was the dear old beggar s idea throwing such fireworks round at breakfast He stole a glance at Kitty to see how she was taking it and caught her stealing a glance at him Instantly both switched back to Cutty Shortly the little comedy was repeated because neither could resist the invisible force of some half conscious inquiry Third time they smiled unembarrassedly Mind you they were both hanging upon Cutty s words only their eyes were like little children at church restless It was spring Without being exactly conscious of what he was doing Hawksley began to dress Kitty that is he visualized her in ball gowns in sports in furs He put her on horses in opera boxes in limousines But in none of these pictures could he hold her she insisted upon returning to her kitchen to fry bacon and eggs Then came a twisted thought rejected only to return a surprising thought so alluring that the sense of shame of chivalry could not press it back Cutty s words began to flow into one ear and out of the other without sense There was in his heart put there by the recollection of the jewels an indescribable bitterness a desperate cynicism that urged him to strike out careless of friend or foe Who could say what would happen to him when he left here A flash of spring madness then to go forth devil may care She was really beautiful full of unsuspected fire To fan it into white flame The whole affair would depend upon whether she cared for music If she did he would pluck the soul out of her She had saved his life Well what of that He had broken yonder man s bread and eaten his salt Still what of that Hadn t he come from a race of scoundrels The blood he had smothered and repressed it all his life to unleash it once happen what might If she were really fond of music Once again Kitty s glance roved back to Hawksley This time she encountered a concentration in his unwavering stare She did not quite like it Perhaps he was only thinking about something and wasn t actually seeing her Still it quieted down the fluttering gayety of her mood There was a sun spot of her own that became visible whenever her interest in Cutty s monologue lagged Perhaps Hawksley had his sun spot And so she heard Cutty say mister Hawksley is going to become an American citizen Kitty what are some of the principles of good citizenship To be nice to policemen Not to meddle with politics because it is vulgar To vote perfunctorily To let George do it when there are reforms to be brought about To keep your hat on when the flag goes by because otherwise you will attract attention To find fault without being able to offer remedies To keep in debt because life here in America would be monotonous without bill collectors Cutty interrupted with a laugh Kitty you ll scare Hawksley off the map Let him know the worst at once retorted Kitty flashing a smile at the victim Spoofing me what said Hawksley appealing to his host This quality of light irony in a woman was a distinct novelty to Hawksley She had humour then So much the better An added zest to the game he was planning He recalled now that she was not of the clinging kind either A woman with a humorous turn of mind was ten times more elusive than a purely sentimental one Give him an hour or two with that old Amati if she really cared for music She would be coming to the apartment again some afternoon when his host was out of the way Better still he would call her by telephone the plea of loneliness Scoundrel Of course he was He was not denying that He would embark upon this affair without the smug varnish of self lies Fire to play with it He ate his portion of beefsteak potatoes and toast and emptied his coffee cup It was really the first substantial meal he had had in many hours A feeling of satisfaction began to permeate him He smiled at Miss Frances who shook her head dubiously She could not quite make him out pathologically Perhaps she had been treating him as shell shocked when there was nothing at all the matter with his nerves Presently Kuroki came in with a yellow envelope which he laid at the side of Cutty s plate Telegrams exploded Cutty Hang it I don t want any telegrams Open it and have it over with suggested Kitty If you don t mind It was the worst kind of news a summons to Washington for conference Which signified that the Government s plans were completed and that shortly he would be on his way to Piraeus A fine muddle Hawksley in no condition to send upon his way Kitty s affair unsettled the emeralds still in camera obscura Karlov at liberty with his infernal schemes and Stefani Gregor his prisoner Wild horses pulling him two ways A word and Karlov would come to the end of his rope suddenly But if he issued that word the whole fabric he had erected so painstakingly would blow away like cardboard If those emeralds turned up in the possession of any man but himself the ensuing complications would be appalling For he himself would be forced to tell what he knew about the stones Hawksley would be thrust conspicuously into the limelight and sooner or later some wild anarch would kill him Known Hawksley would not have one chance in a thousand Kitty would be dragged into the light and harassed and his own attitude toward her misunderstood All these things if he acted upon his oath Nevertheless he determined to risk suspension of operations until he returned from Washington There was one sound plank to cling to He had first hand information that anarchistic elements would remain in their noisome cellars until May first If he were not ordered abroad until after that no harm would follow his suspension of operations Bad news asked Kitty anxiously Aggravating rather than bad I am called to Washington May be gone four or five days Official business Leaves things here a bit in the air I ll stay as long as you need me said Miss Frances I d rather a man now You ve been a brick You need rest I ve a chap in mind He ll make our friend here toe the mark A physical instructor ex pugilist knows all about broken heads I say that s ripping cried Hawksley Give me your man and I ll be off your hands within a week The sooner you stop fussing over me the sooner the crack in my head will cease to bother me Kuroki will cook for you and Ryan will put you through the necessary stunts The roof when the weather permits makes a good exercising ground If you ll excuse me I ll do some telephoning Kuroki pack my bag for a five day trip to Washington I ll take you down to the office Kitty I don t fancy I ever will quite understand you said Hawksley leaning back in his chair listlessly Honestly now you d be perfectly justified in bundling me off to some hotel I have funds Why all this pother about me Cutty smiled When I tackle anything I like to carry it through I want to put you on your train To be reasonably sure that I shan t come back Precisely but without smiling With a vague yet inclusive nod Cutty hurried off It is because he is such a thorough sportsman mister Hawksley Kitty explained Having accepted certain obligations he cannot abrogate them off hand Did I bother you last night I mean did my fiddling Mercy no From the hurdy gurdy of my childhood down to Kubelik and his successors I have been more or less music mad You play wonderfully Sudden inexplicable shyness Hawksley smiled An hour or two with that old Amati I am only an unconventional amateur You should hear Stefani Gregor when the mood is on He puts something into your soul that makes you wish to go forth at once to do some fine unselfish act Stefani Gregor He thought of the clear white soul of the man who had surrendered imperishable fame to stand between him and the curse of his blood who had for ten years stood between his mother and the dissolute man whom irony had selected for the part of father Ten years of diplomacy tact patience Stefani Gregor There was the blood predatory and untamed and there was the spirit which the old musician had moulded He could not harm this girl Dead or alive Stefani Gregor would not permit it Hawksley rose slowly and without further speech walked to the corridor door He leaned against the jamb for a moment then went on to his bedroom I m afraid that breakfast was too much for him the nurse ventured An odd young man Very replied Kitty rather absently She was trying to analyze that flash of shyness Meantime Cutty sat down before the telephone He wanted Kitty out of town during his absence In her present excitable mood he was afraid to trust her She might surrender to any mad impulse that stirred her fancy So he called up Burlingame Kitty s chief and together they manufactured 
1789_142896_000011_000003	train-clean-360	an assignment 
none	none	that was always a pleasant recollection to Kitty Next Cutty summoned Professor Billy Ryan to the wire argued and cajoled for ten minutes and won his point He was always dealing in futures banking his favours here and there and drawing checks against them when needed Then he tackled his men and issued orders suspending operations temporarily He was asked what they should do in case Karlov came out into the open He answered in such an event not to molest him but to watch and take note of those with whom he associated There were big things in the air and only he himself had hold of all the threads He relayed this information to the actual chief of the local service from whom he had borrowed his men There was no protest Green spectacles Quarter to nine he and Kitty entered a subway car and found a corner to themselves while Karlov s agent was content with a strap in the crowded end of the car Karlov for once had outthought Cutty He had withdrawn his watchers confident that after a day or so his unknown opponent would withdraw his During the lull Karlov matured his plans then resumed operations calculating that he would have some forty odd hours leeway His agent was clever He had followed Kitty from Eightieth Street to the Knickerbocker Hotel There he had lost her He had loitered on the sidewalk until midnight and was then convinced that the girl had slipped by So he had returned to Eightieth Street but as late as five in the morning she had not returned This agent had followed the banker after his visit to Kitty He had watched the banker s house seen Cutty arrive and depart Taking a chance shot in the dark he had followed Cutty to the office building learned that Cutty was the owner and lived in the loft As Kitty had not returned home by five he proceeded to take a second chance shot in the dark stationing himself across the street from the entrance to the office building thereby solving the riddle uppermost in Karlov s mind He had found the man in the dress suit Cutty I m sorry I was such a booby last night But it was the best thing that could have happened The pentupness of it was simply killing me I hadn t any one to come to but you any one who would understand I don t know of any man who has a better right to kiss me I know You were just trying to buck me up Clitter clatter Clitter clatter Cutty stared hard at the cement floor Marry her settle a sum on her and give her her freedom Molly s girl Give her a chance to play He turned Kitty do you trust me Of all the foolish questions She pressed his arm Why shouldn t I trust you Will you marry me Wait Let me make clear to you what I have in mind I m all alone I loved your mother It breaks my heart that while I have everything in the way of luxuries you have nothing I can t settle a sum on you an income The world wouldn t understand Your friends would be asking questions among themselves This telegram from Washington means but one thing that in a few weeks I shall be on my way to the East I shall be mighty unhappy if I have to go leaving you in the rut This is my idea marry me an hour or so before the ship sails I will leave you a comfortable income Lord knows how long I shall be gone Well I won t write After a year you can regain your freedom on the grounds of desertion Simple as falling off a log It s the one logical way I can help you Will you Station after station flashed by Kitty continued stare through the window across the way by and by she turned her face toward him her eyes shining with tears Cutty there is going to be a nice place in heaven for you some day I understand I believe Mother understands too Am I selfish I can t say No to you and I can t say Yes Yet I should be a liar if I did not say that everything in me leaps toward the idea It is both hateful and fascinating Common sense says Yes and something else in me says No I like dainty things dainty surroundings I want to travel to see something of the world I once thought I had creative genius but I might as well face the fact that I haven t Only by accident will I ever earn more than I m earning now In a few years I ll grow old suddenly You know what the newspaper game does to women The rush and hurry of it the excitements the ceaseless change It is a furnace and women shrivel up in it quicker than men There won t be any nonsense Kitty An hour before I go aboard my ship I ll go back to the job the happiest of men Molly s girl taken care of Just before your father died I promised him I d keep an eye on you I never forgot but conditions made it impossible The apartment will be yours as long as you need it Kuroki of course goes with me It s merely going by convention on the blind side To leave you something in my will wouldn t serve at all I m a tough old codger and may be marked down for a hale old ninety All I want is to make you happy and carefree Cutty I d like to curl up in some corner and cry gratefully I didn t know there were such men I just don t know what to do It isn t as if you were asking me to be your wife And as you say I can t accept money There is a pride in me that rejects the whole thing but it may be the same fool pride that has cut away my friends I ought to fall on your neck with joy and here I am trying to look round corners You are my father s friend my mother s mine Why shouldn t I accept the proposition You are alone too You have a perfect right to do as you please with your money and I have an equally perfect right to accept your gifts We are all afraid of the world aren t we That s probably at the bottom of my doddering Cutty what is love she broke off whimsically Looking into mirrors and hunting for specks he answered readily I mean seriously So do I Before I went round to the stage entrance to take your mother out to supper I used to preen an hour before the mirror My collar my cravat my hair the nap on my stovepipe my gloves terrible things And what happened Your dad dressed in his office clothes came along like a cyclone walked all over my toes and swooped up your mother right from under my nose Now just look the proposition over from all angles Think of yourself let the old world go hang They ll call it alimony In a year or so you ll be free and some chap like Tommy Conover will come along and bang You ll know all about love Here s old Brooklyn Bridge I ll see you to the elevator All nonsense that you should have the least hesitance Fifteen minutes later he was striding along Park Row By the swing of his stride any onlooker would have believed that Cutty was in a hurry to arrive somewhere Instead one was only walking Suddenly he stopped in the middle of the sidewalk with the two currents of pedestrians flowing on each side of him as a man might stop who saw some wonderful cloud effect But there was nothing ecstatical in his expression on the contrary there was a species of bewildered terror The psychology of all his recent actions had in a flash become vividly clear An unbelievable catastrophe had overtaken him He loved Kitty loved her with an intense shielding passion quite unlike that which he had given her mother Such a thing could happen He offered not the least combat the revelation was too smashing to admit of any doubt It was not a recrudescence of his love for Molly stirred into action by the association with Molly s daughter He wanted Kitty for himself wanted her with every fibre in his body fiercely And never could he tell her now The tragic irony of it all numbed him Fate hadn t played the game fairly He was fifty two on the far side of the plateau near sunset It wasn t a square deal Still he stood there on the sidewalk like a rock in the middle of a turbulent stream rejecting selfish thoughts Marry Kitty and tell her the truth afterward He knew the blood of her loyalest of the loyal He could if he chose play that sort of game 
1789_142896_000054_000005	train-clean-360	cheat her 
none	none	He could not withdraw his proposition If she accepted it he would have to carry it through Cheat her CHAPTER XXV 
1789_142896_000001_000000	train-clean-360	Kitty hung up her hat and coat 
none	none	She did not pat her hair or tuck in the loose ends before the mirror a custom as invariable as sunrise 
1789_142896_000001_000002	train-clean-360	The coat tree stood at the right of the single window and out of this window Kitty stared solemnly at everything and at nothing 
none	none	Burlingame eyed her seriously Cutty had given him a glimmer of the tale enough to make known to him that this pretty sensible girl though no fault of her own was in the shadow of some actual if unknown danger 
1789_142896_000002_000002	train-clean-360	And Cutty wanted her out of town for a few days 
1789_142896_000002_000003	train-clean-360	Burlingame had intended sending Kitty out of town on an assignment during Easter week An exchange of telegrams that morning had closed the gap in time 
1789_142896_000003_000000	train-clean-360	 Well you might say Good morning 
1789_142896_000004_000000	train-clean-360	 I beg your pardon Burly 
1789_142896_000004_000001	train-clean-360	In newspaper offices you belong at once or you never belong and to belong is to have your name sheared to as few syllables as possible

1789_142896_000006_000001	train-clean-360	A Knight of the Round Table a prince of chivalry 
1789_142896_000006_000002	train-clean-360	What would you say if you saw one in spats and a black derby 
1789_142896_000007_000000	train-clean-360	 Why answered Burlingame I suppose I d consider July first as the best thing that could happen to me 
1789_142896_000008_000000	train-clean-360	Kitty laughed and that was what he wanted 
1789_142896_000009_000000	train-clean-360	What had that old rogue been doing now offering Kitty his eighteen story office building 
1789_142896_000010_000000	train-clean-360	 It s odd isn t it that I shouldn t possess a little histrionic ability 
none	none	You d think it would be in my blood to act
1789_142896_000011_000000	train-clean-360	 It is Kitty only not to mimic

1789_142896_000015_000000	train-clean-360	Burlingame jerked his thumb toward a photograph on the wall 
none	none	Oh 
1789_142896_000016_000001	train-clean-360	This will be the most scrumptious event in my life

1789_142896_000017_000003	train-clean-360	Truth is Kitty you d better dress in monotones 
1789_142896_000017_000004	train-clean-360	She might wake up to the fact that you re a mighty pretty young woman and suddenly become temperamental 
1789_142896_000017_000005	train-clean-360	She has a husband round the lot somewhere

1789_142896_000017_000013	train-clean-360	If you go at it right you two will react upon each other as a tonic 
1789_142896_000018_000000	train-clean-360	Kitty realized that this little junket was the very thing she needed open spaces long walks in which to think out her problem She hurried home and spent the morning packing 
1789_142896_000018_000001	train-clean-360	When this heartrending business was over she summoned Tony Bernini 
1789_142896_000019_000000	train-clean-360	 I am going out of town mister Bernini 
1789_142896_000019_000001	train-clean-360	I may be gone a week

1789_142896_000020_000001	train-clean-360	He knew all about this trip having been advised by Cutty over the wire 
none	none	Am I being followed any more

1789_142896_000022_000001	train-clean-360	Still you never can tell 
none	none	What s your destination Kitty told him
1789_142896_000022_000003	train-clean-360	 Better not go by train 
1789_142896_000022_000004	train-clean-360	I can get a fast roadster and run you out in a couple of hours

1789_142896_000023_000000	train-clean-360	 Anybody would consider that Karlov was after me instead of Hawksley 
1789_142896_000024_000000	train-clean-360	Bernini smiled 
1789_142896_000024_000001	train-clean-360	 Miss Conover the moment Karlov puts his hands on you the whole game goes blooey 
1789_142896_000024_000002	train-clean-360	That s the plain fact 
1789_142896_000024_000003	train-clean-360	There is death in this game

1789_142896_000024_000005	train-clean-360	We are easing them along because we want the top men in our net But if Karlov takes it into his head to get you and succeeds he ll have a stranglehold on the whole local service because we d have to make great concessions to free you 
1789_142896_000025_000000	train-clean-360	 Why wasn t I told this at the start

1789_142896_000029_000001	train-clean-360	Karlov s agent sought his chief and found him in the cellar of the old house sinisterly engaged 
none	none	The wall bench was littered with paraphernalia well known to certain chemists 
1789_142896_000029_000003	train-clean-360	Had the New York bomb squad known of the existence of this den the short hair on their necks would have risen 
1789_142896_000030_000000	train-clean-360	 Well greeted Karlov moodily 
none	none	I have found the man in the dress suit
1789_142896_000032_000000	train-clean-360	 He and the Conover girl left that office building together this morning and I followed them to Park Row 
1789_142896_000032_000001	train-clean-360	This man uses the loft of the building for his home 
1789_142896_000032_000002	train-clean-360	No elevator goes up unless you have credentials Our man is hiding there Boris 
1789_142896_000033_000000	train-clean-360	Karlov dry washed his hands 
none	none	We ll send him one of the samples if we fail in regard to the girl You say she arrives daily at the newspaper office about nine and leaves between five and six
1789_142896_000034_000000	train-clean-360	 Every day but Sunday 
none	none	Good news 
1789_142896_000035_000001	train-clean-360	Two bolts one or the other will go home 
1789_142896_000036_000000	train-clean-360	About the same time in Cutty s apartment rather an amusing comedy took place 
1789_142896_000036_000001	train-clean-360	Professor Ryan late physical instructor at one of the aviation camps stood Hawksley in front of him and ran his hard hands over the young man s body 
1789_142896_000036_000002	train-clean-360	Miss Frances stood at one side her arms folded her expression skeptical 
1789_142896_000037_000000	train-clean-360	 Nothin the matter with you Bo but the crack on the conk

1789_142896_000040_000001	train-clean-360	This was cruelty

1789_142896_000042_000000	train-clean-360	When Hawksley returned to the starting line the walls rocked there were two or three blinding stabs of pain but he faced this unusual Irishman with never a hint of the torture 
1789_142896_000042_000001	train-clean-360	A wild longing to be gone from this kindly prison to get away from the thought of the girl 
1789_142896_000043_000000	train-clean-360	 All right said Ryan

1789_142896_000046_000001	train-clean-360	He wasn t going to let them know but that bed was going to be tolerably welcome 
1789_142896_000047_000000	train-clean-360	 Well said Miss Frances

1789_142896_000051_000000	train-clean-360	Cutty attended his conferences 
1789_142896_000051_000001	train-clean-360	He learned immediately that he was booked to sail the first week in May 
1789_142896_000051_000002	train-clean-360	His itinerary began at Piraeus in Greece and might end in Vladivostok 
1789_142896_000051_000003	train-clean-360	But they detained him in Washington overtime because he was a fount of information the departments found it necessary to draw upon constantly 
1789_142896_000051_000004	train-clean-360	The political and commercial aspects of the polyglot peoples what they wanted what they expected what they needed racial enmities 
none	none	The bugaboo of the undesirable alien was no longer bothering official heads in Washington Stringent immigration laws were in the making 
1789_142896_000051_000006	train-clean-360	What they wanted to know was an American s point of view based upon long and intimate associations 
none	none	Washington reminded him of nothing so much as a big sheep dog The hazardous day was over the wolves had been driven off and the sheep into the fold and now the valiant guardian was turning round and round and round preparatory to lying down to sleep 
1789_142896_000052_000002	train-clean-360	For Washington would go to sleep again naturally 
none	none	Often it occurred to him what a remarkable piece of machinery the human brain was 
1789_142896_000053_000001	train-clean-360	He could dig up all this dry information with the precise accuracy of an economist all the while his actual thoughts upon Kitty His nights were nightmares 
1789_142896_000053_000002	train-clean-360	And all this unhappiness because he had been touched with the lust for loot 
1789_142896_000053_000003	train-clean-360	Fundamentally this catastrophe could be laid to the drums of jeopardy 
none	none	The alluring possibility of finding those damnable green stones the unsuspected kink in his moral rectitude had tumbled him into this pit Had not Kitty pronounced the name Stefani Gregor in his mind always linked with the emeralds he would have summoned an ambulance and had Hawksley carried off despite Kitty s protests and perhaps he would have seen her but two or three times before sailing seen her in conventional and unemotional parts 
1789_142896_000054_000001	train-clean-360	At any rate there would have been none of this peculiar intimacy Kitty coming to him in tears opening her young heart to him and discovering all its loneliness 
1789_142896_000054_000002	train-clean-360	If she loved some chap it would not be so hard the temptation would not be so keen to cheat her 
none	none	Marry her and then tell her 
1789_142896_000054_000004	train-clean-360	This dogged his thoughts like a murderer s deed terrible in the watches of the night Marry her and then tell her 
none	none	Cheat her 
1789_142896_000054_000006	train-clean-360	Break her heart and break his own 
none	none	Fifty two 
1789_142896_000055_000001	train-clean-360	Never before had he thought old 
1789_142896_000055_000002	train-clean-360	His splendid health and vigorous mentality were the results of thinking young 
none	none	But now he heard the avalanche stirring the whispering slither of the first pebbles 
1789_142896_000055_000004	train-clean-360	He would grow old swiftly thunderously 
1789_142896_000055_000005	train-clean-360	Kitty s youth would shore up the debacle suspend it indefinitely 
1789_142896_000055_000006	train-clean-360	Marry her cheat her and stay young Green stones accursed 
1789_142896_000056_000000	train-clean-360	Kitty s days were pleasant enough but her nights were sieges 
none	none	One evening someone put Elman s rendition of Schubert s Ave Maria on the phonograph Long after it was over she sat motionless in her chair Echoes 
1789_142896_000056_000003	train-clean-360	The Tschaikowsky waltz 
1789_142896_000056_000004	train-clean-360	She got up suddenly excused herself and went to her room 
1789_142896_000057_000000	train-clean-360	Six days and her problem was still unsolved 
1789_142896_000057_000001	train-clean-360	Something in her she could not define it she could not reach it it defied analysis something then revolted at the idea of marrying Cutty divorcing him and living on his money 
1789_142896_000057_000002	train-clean-360	There was a touch of horror in the suggestion 
1789_142896_000057_000003	train-clean-360	It was tearing her to pieces this hidden repellence And yet this occult objection was so utterly absurd 
1789_142896_000057_000004	train-clean-360	If he died and left her a legacy she would accept it gratefully enough 
none	none	Cutty s plan was only a method of circumventing this indefinite wait Comforts the good things of life amusements simply by nodding her head Why not 
1789_142896_000058_000002	train-clean-360	It wasn t as if Cutty was asking her to be his wife he wasn t 
1789_142896_000058_000003	train-clean-360	Just wanted to dodge convention and give her freedom and happiness 
none	none	He was only giving her a mite out of his income 
1789_142896_000058_000005	train-clean-360	Because he had loved her mother because but for an accident of chance she Kitty might have been his daughter 
none	none	Why then this persistent and unaccountable revulsion Why should she hesitate 
1789_142896_000058_000008	train-clean-360	The ancient female fear of the trap 
1789_142896_000058_000009	train-clean-360	That could not be it 
none	none	For a more honourable a more lovable man did not walk the earth Brave strong handsome whimsical why Cutty was a catch 
1789_142896_000059_000000	train-clean-360	Comfy 
none	none	Never any of that inherent doubt of man when she was with him Absolute trust 
1789_142896_000059_000002	train-clean-360	An evil thought had entered her head fate had made it honourably possible 
none	none	And still this mysterious repellence Romance 
1789_142896_000060_000001	train-clean-360	She was not surrendering her right to that 
1789_142896_000060_000002	train-clean-360	What was a year out of her life if afterward she would be in comfortable circumstances free to love where she willed 
1789_142896_000060_000003	train-clean-360	She wasn t cheating herself or Cutty she was cheating convention a flimsy thing at best 
none	none	Windows 
1789_142896_000061_000001	train-clean-360	We carry our troubles to our windows through windows we see the stars 
none	none	We cannot visualize God but we can see His stars pinned to the immeasurable spaces 
1789_142896_000061_000003	train-clean-360	So Kitty sought her window and added her question to the countless millions forlornly wandering about up there and finding no answer 
1789_142896_000062_000000	train-clean-360	But she would return to New York on the morrow 
none	none	She would not summon Bernini as she had promised 
1789_142896_000062_000002	train-clean-360	She would go back by train alone unhampered 
none	none	And in his cellar Boris Karlov spun his web for her CHAPTER XXVI Hawksley heard the lift door close and he knew that at last he was alone He flung out his arms ecstatically Free He would see no more of that nagging beggar Ryan until tomorrow Free to put into execution the idea that had been bubbling all day long in his head like a fine champagne firing his blood with reckless whimsicality Quietly he stole down the corridor Through a crack in the kitchen door he saw Kuroki s back the attitude of which was satisfying It signified that the Jap was pegging away at his endless studies and that only the banging of the gong would rouse him The way was as broad and clear as a street at dawn Not that Kuroki mattered only so long as he did not know so much the better With careful step Hawksley manoeuvred his retreat so that it brought him to Cutty s bedroom door The door was unlocked He entered the room What a lark They would hide his own clothes so much the worse for the old beggar s wardrobe Street clothes Presently he found a dark suit commendable not so much for its style as for the fact that it was the nearest fit he could find He had to roll up the trouser hems Hats Chuckling like a boy rummaging a jam closet he rifled the shelves and pulled down a black derby of an unknown vintage Large but a runner of folded paper reduced the size As he pressed the relic firmly down on his head he winced A stab over his eyes He waited doubtfully but there was no recurrence Fit as a fiddle Of course he could not stoop without a flash of vertigo but on his feet he was top hole He was gaining every day Luck He might have come out of it with the blank mind of a newborn babe and here he was keen to resume his adventures Luck They had not stopped to see if he was actually dead Some passer by in the hall had probably alarmed them That handkerchief had carried him round the brink Perhaps Fate intended letting him get through written on his pass an extension of his leave of absence Or she had some new torture in reserve Now for a stout walking stick He selected a blackthorn twirled it saluted and posed before the mirror Not so bally rotten He would pass Next he remembered that there were some flowers in the dining room window boxes with scarlet geraniums He broke off a sprig and drew it through his buttonhole Outside there was a cold pale April sky presaging wind and rain Unimportant He was going down into the streets for an hour or so The colour and action of a crowded street the lure was irresistible Who would dare touch him in the crowd These rooms had suddenly become intolerable He leaned against the side of the window Roofs thousands of them flat domed pinnacled and somewhere under one of these roofs Stefani Gregor was eating his heart out It did not matter that this queer old eagle whom everybody called Cutty had promised to bring Stefani home It might be too late Stefani was old highly strung Who knew what infernal lies Karlov had told him Stefani could stand up under physical torture but to tear at his soul to twist and rend his spirit The bubble in the champagne died down as it always will if one permits it to stand He felt the old mood seep through the dikes of his gayety Alone A familiar face he would have dropped on his knees and thanked God for the sight of a familiar face These people kindly as they were what were they but strangers Yesterday he had not known them to morrow he would leave them behind forever All at once the mystery of this bubbling idea was bared he was going to risk his life in the streets in the vague hope of seeing some face he had known in the days before the world had gone drunk on blood One familiar face Of course he would never forget at any rate not the girl whose courage had made possible this hour Those chaps scared off temporarily might have returned What had become of her He was always seeing her lovely face in the shadows now tender now resolute now mocking Doubtless he thought of her constantly because his freedom of action was limited He hadn t diversion enough Books and fiddling these carried him but halfway through the boredom Where was she Daily he had called her by telephone no answer The Jap shook his head the slangy boy in the lift shook his She was a thoroughbred even if she had been born of middle class parentage He laughed bitterly Middle class A homeless countryless derelict and he had the impudence to revert to comparisons that no longer existed in this topsy turvy old world He was an upstart The final curtain had dropped between him and his world and he was still thinking in the ancient make up Middle class He was no better than a troglodyte set down in a new wilderness He heard the curtain rings slither on the pole Believing the intruder to be Kuroki he turned belligerently And there she stood the girl herself The poise of her reminded him of the Winged Victory in the Louvre Where there had been a cup of champagne in his veins circumstance now poured a magnum You he cried What has happened Where are you going in those clothes demanded Kitty I am running away for an hour or so But you must not The risks after all the trouble we ve had to help you I shall be perfectly safe for you are going with me Aren t you my guardian angel Well rather The two of us people lights shop windows Perfectly splendiferous Honestly now where s the harm He approached her rapidly as he spoke and before the spell of him could be shaken off Kitty found her hands imprisoned in his Please I ve been so damnably bored The two of us in the streets among the crowds No one will dare touch us Can t you see And then I say this is ripping we ll have dinner together here I will play for you on the old Amati Please The fire of him communicated to the combustibles in Kitty s soul A wild reckless irony besieged her This adventure would be exactly what she needed it would sweep clear the fog separating one side of her brain from the other For it was plain enough that part of her brain refused to cooperate with the other A break in the trend of thought she might succeed in getting hold of the puzzle if she could drop it absolutely for a little while and then pick it up again She had not gone home She had not notified Bernini She had checked her luggage in the station parcel room and come directly here For what To let the sense of luxury overcome the hidden repugnance of the idea of marrying Cutty divorcing him and living on his money To put herself in the way of visible temptation What fretted her so what was wearing her down to the point of fatigue was the patent imbecility of her reluctance There would have been some sense of it if Cutty had proposed a real marriage All she had to do was mumble a few words sign her name to a document live out West for a few months and be in comfortable circumstances all the rest of her life And she doddered She would run the streets with Johnny Two Hawks return and dine with him Who cared Proper or improper whose business was it but Kitty Conover s Danger That was the peculiar attraction She wanted to rush into danger some tense excitement the strain of which would lift her out of her mood A recurrent touch of the wild impulsiveness of her childhood Hadn t she sometimes flown out into thunderstorms after merited punishment to punish the mother whom thunder terrorized And now she was going to rush into unknown danger to punish Fate like a silly child Nevertheless she would go into the streets with Johnny Two Hawks But are you strong enough to venture on the streets Rot Dash it all I m no mollycoddle All nonsense to keep me pinned in like this Will you go with me be my guide Yes She shot out the word and crossed the Rubicon before reason could begin to lecture Besides wasn t reason treating her shabbily in withholding the key to the riddle Johnny Two Hawks I will go as far as Harlem if you want me to Johnny Two Hawks He laughed joyously then kissed her hands But he had to pay for this bending a stab that filled his eyes with flying sparks He must remember once out of doors not to stoop quickly I say you re the jolliest girl I ever met Just the two of us what The way you speak English is wonderful Simple enough to explain Had an English nurse from the beginning Spoke English and Italian before I spoke Russian He seized the wooden mallet and beat the Burmese gong a flat piece of brass cut in the shape of a bell The clear whirring vibrations filled the room Long before these spent themselves Kuroki appeared on the threshold He bobbed Kuroki Miss Conover is dining here with me to night Seven o clock sharp The best you have in the larder Yes sair You are going out sair For a bit of fresh air And I am going with him Kuroki said Kitty Kuroki bobbed again Dinner at seven sair Another bob and he returned to the kitchen smiling The girl was free to come and go of course but the ancient enemy of Nippon would not pass the elevator door Let him find that out for himself When the elevator arrived the boy did not open the door He noted the derby on Hawksley s head I can take you down Miss Conover but I cannot take mister Hawksley When the boss gives me an order I obey it if I possibly can On the day the boss tells me you can go strolling I ll give you the key to the city Until then nix No use arguing mister Hawksley I shan t argue replied Hawksley meekly I am really a prisoner then For your own good sir Do you wish to go down Miss Conover No The boy swung the lever and the car dropped from sight I m sorry said Kitty Hawksley smiled and laid a finger on his lips I wanted to know he whispered There s another way down from this Matterhorn Come with me Off the living room is a storeroom I found the key in the lock the other day and investigated I still have the key Now then there s a door that gives to the main loft At the other end is the stairhead There is a door at the foot of the first flight down We can jolly well leave this way but we shall have to return by the lift That bally young ruffian can t refuse to carry us up y know Kitty laughed This is going to be fun Rather They groped their way through the dim loft for it was growing dark outside and made the stairhead The door to the seventeenth floor opened and they stepped forth into the lighted hallway Now what asked Kitty bubbling The floor below and one of the other lifts what Twenty minutes later the two of them arm in arm turned into Broadway This sir began Kitty with a gesture is Broadway America s backyard in the daytime and Ali Baba s cave at night The way of the gilded youth the funnel for papa s money the chorus lady the starting point of the high cost of living We New Yorkers despise it because we can t afford it The lights gasped Hawksley Wreckers lights Behold Yonder is a highly nutritious whisky blinking its bloomin farewell Do you chew gum Even if you don t in a few minutes I ll give you a cud for thought Chewing gum was invented by a man with a talkative wife He missed the physiological point however that a body can chew and talk at the same time Come on They went on uptown Hawksley highly amused exhilarated but frequently puzzled The pungent irony of her observations conveyed to him that under this gayety was a current of extreme bitterness I say are all American girls like you Heavens no Why Because I never met one like you before Rather stilted on their good behaviour I fancy And I interest you because I m not on my good behaviour Kitty whipped back Because you are as God made you without camouflage The poor innocent young man I m nothing but camouflage to night Why are you risking your life in the street Why am I sharing that risk Because we both feel bound and are blindly trying to break through What do you know about me Nothing What do I know about you Nothing But what do we care Come on come on Tumpitum tump tumpitum tump drummed the Elevated Kitty laughed The tocsin Always something happened when she heard it Pearls she cried dragging him toward a jeweller s window No he said holding back I hate jewels How I hate them He broke away from her and hurried on She had to run after him Had she hesitated they might have become separated Hated jewels No no There should be no questions verbal or mental this night She presently forced him to slow down Not so fast We must never become separated she warned Our safety such as it is lies in being together I m an ass Perhaps my head is ratty without my realizing it I fancy I m like a dog that s been kicked I m trying to run away from the pain What s this tomb The Metropolitan Opera House As they were passing a thin wailing sound came to the ears of both Seated with his back to the wall was a blind fiddler with a tin cup strapped to a knee He was out of bounds he had no right on Broadway but he possessed a singular advantage over the law He could not be forced to move on without his guide if he were honestly blind Hundreds of people were passing but the fiddler s Last Rose of Summer wasn t worth a cent His cup was empty The poor thing said Kitty Wait Hawksley approached the fiddler exchanged a few words with him and the blind man surrendered his fiddle Give me your hat cried Kitty delighted Carefully Hawksley pried loose his derby and handed it to Kitty No stab of pain something to find that out He turned the instrument tucked it under his chin and began Traumerei Kitty smiling extended the hat Just the sort of interlude to make the adventure memorable She knew this thoroughfare Shortly there would be a crowd and the fiddler s cup would overflow that is if the police did not interfere too soon As for the owner of the wretched fiddle he raised his head his mouth opened Up there somewhere a door to heaven had opened True to her expectations a crowd slowly gathered The beauty of the girl and the dark handsome face of the musician his picturesque bare head were sufficient for these cynical passers by They understood Operatic celebrities having a little fun on their own So quarters and dimes and nickels began to patter into Cutty s ancient derby hat Broadway will always contribute generously toward a novelty of this order Famous names were tossed about in undertones Entered then the enemy of the proletariat Kitty being a New Yorker born had had her weather eye roving The brass buttoned minion of the law was always around when a bit of innocent fun was going on As the policeman reached the inner rim of the audience the last notes of Handel s Largo were fading on the ear What s this demanded the policeman It s all over sir answered Kitty smiling Can t have this on Broadway miss Obstruction He could not speak gruffly in the face of such beauty especially with a Broadway crowd at his back It s all over Just let me put this money in the blind man s cup Kitty poured her coins into the receptacle At the same time Hawksley laid the fiddle in the blind man s lap Then he turned to Kitty and boomed a long Russian phrase at her Her quick wit caught the intent You see he doesn t understand that this cannot be done in New York I couldn t explain All right miss but don t do it again The policeman grinned And please don t be harsh with the blind man Just tell him he mustn t play on Broadway again Thank you She linked her arm in Hawksley s and they went on and the crowd dissolved only the policeman and the blind man remained the one contemplating his duty and the other his vision of heaven What a lark exclaimed Hawksley Were you asking me for your hat I was telling the bobby to go to the devil They laughed like children March hares he said No April fools Good heavens the time Twenty minutes to seven Our dinner We ll take a taxi Dash it What s wrong Not a bally copper in my pockets And I left my handbag on the sideboard We ll have to walk If we hurry we can just about make it Meantime there lay in wait for them this pair of April fools a taxicab It stood snugly against the curb opposite the entrance to Cutty s apartment The door was slightly ajar The driver watched the south corner the three men inside never took their gaze off the north corner But I say hasn t this been a jolly lark If we had known we could have borrowed a dollar from the blind man he d never have missed it CHAPTER XXVII Champagne in the glass is a beautiful thing to see So is water the morning after That is the fault with frolic there is always an inescapable rebound The most violent love drops into humdrum tolerance A pessimist is only a poor devil who has anticipated the inevitable he has his headache at the start Mental champagnes have their aftermaths even as the juice of the grape Hawksley and Kitty hurrying back began to taste lees They began to see things too menace in every loiterer threat in every alley They had had a glorious lark somewhere beyond would be the piper with an appalling bill They exaggerated the dangers multiplied them perhaps wisely There would be no let down in their vigilance until they reached haven But this state of mind they covered with smiling masks banter bursts of laughter and flashes of wit They were both genuinely frightened but with unselfish fear Kitty s fear was not for herself but for Johnny Two Hawks If anything happened the blame would rightly be hers With that head he wasn t strictly accountable for what he did she was A firm negative on her part and he would never have left the apartment And his fear was wholly for this astonishing girl He had recklessly thrust her into grave danger Who knew better than he the implacable hate of the men who sought to kill him Moreover his strength was leaving him There was an alarming weakness in his legs purely physical He had overdone and if need rose he would not be able to protect her Damnable fool But she had known That was the odd phase of it She hadn t come blindly What mood had urged her to share the danger along with the lark Somehow she was always just beyond his reach this girl He would never forget that fan popping out of the pistol the egg burning in the pan The apartment was only three blocks away when Kitty decided to drop her mask I d give a good deal to see a policeman They are never around when you really want them Johnny Two Hawks I m a little fool You wouldn t have left the apartment but for me Will you forgive me It is I who should ask forgiveness I say how much farther is it Only about two blocks but they may be long ones Let s step into this doorway for a moment I see a taxicab It looks to be standing opposite the building Don t like it Suppose we watch it for a few minutes Hawksley was grateful for the respite and together they stared at the unwinking red eye of the tail light But no man approached the cab or left it I believe I ve hit upon a plan said Kitty Certainly we have not been followed In that event they would have had a dozen chances If someone saw us leave together naturally they will expect us to return together We ll walk to the corner of our block then turn east but I shall remain just out of sight while you will go round the block Fifteen minutes should carry you to the south corner I ll be on watch for you The moment you turn I ll walk toward you It will give us a bit of a handicap in case that taxi is a menace If any one appears run for it Where s the cane you had What a jolly ass I am I remember now I left the stick against the wall of the opera house Blockhead With a stick now I m hopeless Never mind Let s start That taxi may be perfectly honest It s our guilty consciences that are peopling the shadows with goblins What really bothers us is that we have broken our word to the kindliest man in all this world Hawksley wondered if he could walk round the block without falling down He saw that he was facing a physical collapse hastened by the knowledge that the safety of the girl depended largely upon himself What he had accepted at the beginning as strength had been nothing more than exhilaration and nerve energy There was now nothing but the latter and only feeble straws at that Oh he would manage somehow he jolly well had to and there was a bare chance of falling in with a bobby But run Honestly now how the devil was a chap to run on a pair of spools Arriving at the appointed spot they separated He waved his hand airily and marched off If he fell it would be out of sight where the girl could not see him Clever chap what Damned rotter For himself he did not care He was weary of this game of hide and seek But to have lured the girl into it When he turned the first corner of his journey he paused and leaned against the wall his eyes shut When he opened them the sidewalk and the street lamps were normal again As soon as he disappeared a new plan came to Kitty She put it into execution at once on the basis that yonder taxicab was an enemy machine She left her retreat and walked boldly down the street her eyes alert for the least suspicious sign If she could make the entrance before they suspected the trick she could obtain help before Johnny Two Hawks made the south turn She reached her objective pushed through the revolving doors and turned Dimly she could see the taxi driver but he appeared to be dozing on the seat As a matter of fact one of the three men in the taxi recognized Kitty but too late to intercept her Her manoeuvre had confused him temporarily And while he and his companions were debating Kitty had time to summon Cutty s man from Elevator Four Step into the car he roughly ordered after she had given him a gist of her suspicions He turned off the lights stepped out and shut the gates with a furious bang And stick to the corner I ll attend to the other fool He rushed into the street his automatic ready eyed the taxicab speculatively wheeled suddenly and ran south at a dog trot He rounded the south corner but he did not see Hawksley anywhere The dog trot became a dead run As he wheeled round the corner of the parallel street he almost bumped into Hawksley who had a policeman in tow Officer said the man with the boy s face this is Federal business Aliens Come along There may be trouble If there should be any shooting don t bother with the atmosphere Pick out a real target Anarchists About the size of it Miss Conover asked Hawksley Safe No thanks to you though I d like to knock your block off if you want to know Do it Damned little use to me declared Hawksley sagging Here what s the matter with you cried the policeman throwing his arm round Hawksley They nearly killed him a few days gone A crack on the bean but he wasn t satisfied Help him along I ll be hiking back But the taxicab was gone Before Cutty s lieutenant opened the gate to the apartment he spoke to Hawksley The boss is doing everything he can to put you through sir Miss Conover s wit saved you For if you hadn t separated they d have nailed you I ve been running round like a chicken with its head cut off I forgot that door on the seventeenth floor I tell you honestly you ve been playing with death It wasn t fair to Miss Conover It was my fault volunteered Kitty Mine protested Hawksley Well they know where you roost now for a fact You ve spilled the beans I m sorry I lost my temper The devil fly away with you both The boy laughed You re game anyhow But darn it all if anything had happened to you the boss would never have forgiven me He s the whitest old scout God ever put the breath of life into He s always doing something for somebody He d give you the block if you had the gall to ask for it Play the game fifty fifty with him and you ll land on both feet And you Miss Conover must not come here again I promise I ll tell you a little secret It was the boss who sent you out of town He was afraid you d do something like this When you are ready to go home you ll find Tony Bernini downstairs Sore as a crab too I ll bet I ll be glad to go home with him said Kitty thoroughly chastened in spirit That s all for to night Kitty and Hawksley stepped out into the corridor the problem they had sought to shake off reestablished in their thoughts added too if anything How do you feel Top hole lied Hawksley My word though I wobbled a bit going round that block I almost kissed the bobby I say he thought I d been tilting a few But it was a lark Dinner is served announced Kuroki at their elbows His expression was coldly bland Dinner cried Hawksley brightening What does the American soldier say Eats answered Kitty All tension vanished in the double laughter that followed They approached dinner with something of the spirit that had induced Hawksley to fiddle and Kitty to pass the hat in front of the Metropolitan Opera House Hawksley s recuperative powers promised well for his future By the time coffee was served his head had cleared and his legs had resumed their normal functions of support I was so infernally bored And now asked Kitty recklessly Fancy asking me that Do you realize that all this is dreadfully improper Oh I say now Where s the harm If ever there was a young woman capable of taking care of herself That isn t it It s just being here alone with you But you are not alone with me Kuroki Kitty shrugged No At my side of the table is Stefani Gregor at yours the man who has befriended me Thank you for that I don t know of anything nicer you could say But the outside world would see neither of our friends I did not come here to see you No need of telling me that I had a problem a very difficult one to solve and I believed that I might solve it if I came to these rooms I had quite forgotten you Instantly upon receiving this blunt explanation he determined that she should never cease to remember him after this night His vanity was not touched it was something far more elusive It was perhaps a recurrence of that inexplicable desire to hurt Somehow he sensed the flexible steel behind which lay the soul of this baffling girl He would presently find a chink in the armour with that old Amati Blows on the head have few surgical comparisons That which kills one man only temporarily stuns another One man loses his identity another escapes with all his faculties and suffers but trifling inconvenience In Hawksley s case the blow had probably restricted some current of thought and that which would have flowed normally now shot out obliquely perversely It might be that the natural perverseness of his blood unchecked by the noble influence of Stefani Gregor and liberated by the blow governed his thoughts in relation to Kitty The subjugation of women the old cynical warfare of sex the dominant business of his rich and idle forbears the business that had made Boris Karlov a deadly and implacable enemy became paramount in his disordered brain She had forgotten him Very well He would stir the soul of her play with it lift it to the stars and dash it down if she had a soul Beautiful natural alone He became all Latin under the pressure of this idea I will play for you he said quietly Please And then I ll go home where I belong I ll be in the living room When he returned he found her before a window staring at the myriad lights Sit here he said indicating the divan I shall stand and walk about as I play Kitty sat down touching the pillows reflectively She thought of the tears she had wept upon them That sinister and cynical thought Suddenly she saw light Her problem would have been none at all if Cutty had said he loved her There would have been something sublime in making him happy in his twilight He had loved and lost her mother To pay him for that He was right Those twenty odd years his seniority had mellowed him filled him with deep and tender understanding To be with him was restful the very thought of him now was resting No matter how much she might love a younger man he would frequently torture her by unconscious egoism and by the time he had mellowed the mulled wine would be cold If only Cutty had said he loved her What shall I play Kitty raised her eyes in frank astonishment There was a fiercely proud expression on Hawksley s face It was not the man it was the artist who was angry Forgive me I was dreaming a little she apologized with quick understanding I am not quite myself Neither am I I will play something to fit your dream But wait When I play I am articulate I can express myself all emotions I am what I play happy sad gay full of the devil I warn you I can speak all things I can laugh at you weep with you despise you love you All in the touch of these strings I warn you there is magic in this Amati Will you risk it Ordinarily had this florid outburst come from another man Kitty would have laughed It had the air of piqued vanity but she knew that this was not the interpretation On the streets he had been the most amusing and surprising comrade she had ever known as merry and whimsical as Cutty young and handsome the real man He had been real that night when he entered through her kitchen window with the drums of jeopardy about his neck He had been real that night she had brought him his wallet Electric antagonism the room seemed charged with it The man had stepped aside for a moment and the great noble had taken his place It was not because she had been reared in rather a theatrical atmosphere that she transcribed his attitude thus She knew that he was noble That she did not know his rank was of no consequence Cutty s narrative which she had pretended to believe had set this man in the middle class Never in this world There was only one middle class out of which such a personality might and often did emerge the American middle class In Europe never No peasant blood no middle class corpuscle stirred in this man s veins The ancient boyar looked down at her Play said Kitty There was a smile on her lips but there was fiery challenge in her slate blue eyes The blood of Irish kings and what Irishman dares deny it surged into her throat We wear masks we inherit generations of masks and a trivial incident reveals the primordial which lurks in each one of us Savages Kitty with her stone hatchet and Hawksley swinging the curved blade of Hunk He began one of those tempestuous compositions brilliant and bewildering that submerge the most appreciative lay mentality because he was angry a double anger that he should be angry over he knew not what and broke off in the middle of the composition because Kitty sat upright stonily unimpressed Tschaikowsky s Serenade Melancolique Kitty after a few measures laid aside her stone hatchet and her body relaxed Music She began to absorb it as parched earth absorbs the tardy rain Then came the waltz which had haunted her Her face grew tenderly beautiful and Hawksley a true artist saw that he had discovered the fifth string and he played upon it with all the artistry which was naturally his and which had been given form by the master who had taught him For the physical exertions he relied upon nerve energy again Nature is generous when we are young No matter how much we draw against the account she always has a little more for us He forgot that only an hour gone he had been dizzy with pain forgot everything but the glory of the sounds he was evoking and their visible reaction upon this girl The devil was not only in his heart but in his hand Never had Kitty heard such music To be played to in this manner directly with embracing tenderness with undivided fire would have melted the soul of Gobseck the money lender and Kitty was warm blooded Irish emotional The fiddle called poignantly to the Irish in her She wanted to go roving with this man with her hand on his shoulder to walk in the thin air of high places Through it all however she felt vaguely troubled the instinct of the trap The sinister and cynical idea which had clandestinely taken up quarters in her mind awoke and assailed her from a new angle that of youth Something in her cried out Stop Stop But her lips were mute her body enchained Suddenly Hawksley laid aside the fiddle and advanced He reached down and drew her up Kitty did not resist him she was numb with enchantment He held her close for a second then kissed her her hair eyes mouth released her and stepped back a bantering smile on his lips and cold terror in his heart The devil who had inspired this phase of the drama now deserted his victim as he generally does in the face of superior forces Kitty stood perfectly still for a full minute stunned It was that smile frozen on his lips that brought her back to intimacy with cold realities Had he asked her pardon had he shown the least repentance she might have forgiven forgotten But knowing mankind as she did she could give but one interpretation to that smile of which he was no longer conscious Without anger in quiet level tones she said I had foolishly thought that we two might be friends You have made it impossible You have also abused the kindly hospitality of the man who has protected you from your enemies A few days ago he did me the honour to ask me to marry him I am going to I wish you no evil She turned and walked from the room Even then there was time But he did not move It was not until he heard the elevator gate crash that he was physically released from the thraldom of the inner revelation Love in the blinding flash of a thunderbolt He had kissed her not because he was the son of his father but because he loved her And now he never could tell her He must let her go believing that the man she had saved from death had repaid her with insult On top of all his misfortunes his tragedies love There was a God yes but his name was Irony Love He stepped toward the divan stumbled and fell against it his arms spread over the pillows and in this position he remained For a while his thoughts were broken inconclusive he was like a man in the dark groping for a door Principally his poor head was trying to solve the riddle of his never ending misfortunes Why What had he done that these calamities should be piled upon his head He had lived decently his youth had been normal he had played fair with men and women Why make him pay for what his forbears had done He wasn t fair game He A singular revelation cleared one corner Kitty had spoken of a problem and he by those devil urged kisses had solved it for her She had been doddering and his own act had thrust her into the arms of that old thoroughbred That cynical suggestion of his the other morning had been acted upon God had long ago deserted him and now the devil himself had taken leave Hawksley buried his face in the pillow once made wet with Kitty s tears The great tragedy in life lies in being too late Hawksley had learned this once before it was now being driven home again Cutty was to find it out on the morrow for he missed his train that night The shuttles of the Weaver in this pattern of life were two green stones called the drums of jeopardy inanimate objects but perfect tools in the hands of Destiny But for these stones Hawksley would not have tarried too long on a certain red night Cutty would not now be stumbling about the labyrinths into which his looting instincts had thrust him and Kitty Conover would have jogged along in the humdrum rut if not happy at least philosophically content with her lot CHAPTER XXVIII Decision is always a mental relief hesitance a curse Kitty having shifted her burdens to the broad shoulders of Cutty felt as she reached the lobby as if she had left storm and stress behind and entered calm She would marry Cutty she had published the fact burned her bridges She had stepped into the car her heart full of cold fury Now she began to find excuses for Hawksley s conduct A sick brain he was not really accountable for his acts Her own folly had opened the way Of course she would never see him again Why should she Their lives were as far apart as the Volga and the Hudson Bernini met her in the lobby I ve got a cab for you Miss Conover he said as if nothing at all had happened Have you Cutty s address Yes Then take me at once to a telegraph office I have a very important message to send him All right Miss Conover Say Decision made It is yes And sign it just Kitty Without being conscious of it her soul was still in the clouds where it had been driven by the music of the fiddle thus what she assumed to be a normal sequence of a train of thought was only a sublime impulse She would marry Cutty More she would be his wife his true wife For his tenderness his generosity his chivalry she would pay him in kind There would be no nonsense love would not enter into the bargain but there would be the fragrance of perfect understanding That he was fifty two and she was twenty four no longer mattered No more loneliness no more genteel poverty for such benefits she was ready to pay the score in full A man she was genuinely fond of a man she could look up to always depend upon Was there such a thing as perfect love She had her doubts She reasoned that love was what a body decided was love the psychological moment when the physical attraction became irresistible Who could tell before the fact which was the true and which the false Lived there a woman herself excepted who had not hesitated between two men a man who had not doddered between two women for better or for worse What did the average woman know of the man the average man know of the woman until afterward To stake all upon a guess She knew Cutty Under her own eyes he had passed through certain proving fires There would be no guessing the manner of man he was He was fifty two that is to say the grand passion had come and gone There would be mutual affection and comradeship True she had her dreams but she could lay them away without any particular regret She had never been touched by the fire of passion Let it go But she did know what perfect comradeship was and she would grasp it and never loose her hold Something out of life A narrow squeak Miss Conover said Berumi breaking the long silence A miss is as good as a mile replied Kitty not at all grateful for the interruption We ve done everything we could to protect you If you can t see now why the jig is up A chain is as strong as its weakest link And in a game like this a woman is always the weakest link You re quite a philosopher I have reason to be I m married Am I expected to laugh Miss Conover you re a wonder You come through these affairs with a smile when you ought to have hysterics I ll bet a doughnut that when you see a mouse you go and get it a piece of cheese Do you want the truth Well I ll tell it to you You have all kept me on the outer edge of this affair and I ve been trying to find out why I have the reportorial instinct as they say I inherited it from my father You put a strange weapon in my hands you tell me it is deadly but you don t tell me which end is deadly Do you know who this Russian is Honestly I don t Does Cutty I don t know that either Did you ever hear of a pair of emeralds called the drums of jeopardy Nope But I do know if you continue these stunts you ll head the whole game into the ditch You may set your mind at ease I m going to marry Cutty I shall not go to the apartment again until Hawksley as he is called is gone Well well that s good news But let me put you wise to one fact Miss Conover you have picked some man I m not much of a scholar but knowing him as I do I m always wondering why they made Faith Hope and Charity in female form But this night s work was bad business They know where the Russian is now and if the game lasts long enough they ll reach the chief find out who he is and that ll put the kibosh on his usefulness here and abroad Well here s home and no more lecture from me Sorry I ve been so much trouble Perhaps we ought to have shown you which end shoots Good night If Kitty had any doubt as to the wisdom of her decision the cold gloomy rooms of her apartment dissipated them She wandered through the rooms musing calling back animated scenes What would the spirit of her mother say Had she doddered between Conover and Cutty Perhaps But she had been one of the happy few who had guessed right Singular thought her mother would have been happy with Cutty too Oh the relief of knowing what the future was going to be She took off her hat and tossed it upon the table The good things of life and a good comrade Food The larder would be empty and there was her breakfast to consider She passed out into the kitchen wrote out a list of necessities and put it on the dumb waiter Now for the dishes she had so hurriedly left She rolled up her sleeves put on the apron and fell to the task After such a night dish washing She laughed It was a funny old world Pauses Perhaps she should have gone to a hotel away from all familiar objects Those flatirons intermittently pulled her eyes round Her fancy played tricks with her whenever her glance touched the window Faces peering in In a burst of impatience she dropped the dish towel hurried to the window and threw it up Black emptiness Cutty crossing the platform with Hawksley on his shoulders She saw that and it comforted her She finished her work and started for bed But first she entered the guest room and turned on the lights Olga She had intended to ask him who Olga was A great pity They might have been friends The back of her hand went to her lips but did not touch them She could not rub away those burning kisses that is not with the back of her hand Vividly she saw him fiddling bareheaded in front of the Metropolitan Opera House It seemed though that it had happened years ago A great pity The charm of that frolic would abide with her as long as she lived A brave man too Hadn t he left her with a gay wave of the hand not knowing for want of strength if he could make the detour of the block That took courage His journey halfway across the world had taken courage Yet he could so basely disillusion her It was not the kiss it was the smile She had seen that smile before born of evil If only he had spoken The heavenly magic of that fiddle It made her sad Genius the ability to play with souls soothe tantalize lift up and then to smile at her like that She shut down the curtain upon these cogitations and summoned Cutty visualized his handsome head shot with gray the humour of his smile She did care for him no doubt of that She couldn t have sent that telegram else Cutty name of a pipe as the Frenchmen said All at once she rocked with laughter She was going to marry a man whose given name she could not recall Henry George John William For the life of her she could not remember And with this laughter still bubbling in a softer note she got into bed twisted about from side to side from this pillow to that the tired body seeking perfect relaxation A broken melody entered her head Sleepily she sought one channel of thought after another to escape still the melody persisted As her consciousness dodged hither and thither the bars and measures joined She sat up chilled bewildered That Tschaikowsky waltz She could hear it as clearly as if Johnny Two Hawks and the Amati were in the very room She grew afraid Of what She did not know And while she sat there in bed threshing out this fear to find the grain Cutty was tramping the streets of Washington her telegram crumpled in his hand From time to time he would open it and reread it under a street lamp To marry her and then to cheat her It wasn t humanly possible to marry her and then to let her go He thought of those warm soft arms round his neck the absolute trust of that embrace Molly s girl No he could not do it He would have to back down tell her he could not put the bargain through invent some other scheme The idea had been repugnant to her It had taken her a week to fight it out It was a little beyond his reach however why the idea should have been repugnant to her It entailed nothing beyond a bit of mummery The repugnance was not due to religious training The Conover household as he recalled it had been rather lax in that respect Why then should Kitty have hesitated He thought of Hawksley and swore But for Hawksley s suggestion no muddle like this would have occurred Devil take him and his infernal green stones Cutty suddenly remembered his train He looked at his watch and saw that his lower berth was well on the way to Baltimore Always and eternally he was missing something CHAPTER XXIX Not unusually when we burn our bridges we have in the back of our minds the dim hope that there may be a shallow ford somewhere Thus bridges should not be burned impulsively there may be no ford The idea of retreat pushed forward in Kitty s mind the moment she awoke but she pressed it back in shame She had given her word and she would stand by it The night had been a series of wild impulses She had not sent that telegram to Cutty as the result of her deliberations in the country Impulse a flash and the thing was done her bridges burned To crush Johnny Two Hawks fill his cup with chagrin she had told him she was going to marry Cutty That was the milk in the cocoanut Morning has a way of showing up night gold for what it is tinsel Kitty saw the stage of last night s drama dismantled If there was a shallow ford she would never lower her pride to seek it She had told Two Hawks sent that wire to Cutty broke the news to Bernini But did she really want to go back Not to know her own mind to swing back and forth like a pendulum Was it because she feared that having married Cutty she might actually fall in love with some other man later She could still go through the mummery as Cutty had planned but what about all the sublime generosity of the preceding night A queer feeling pervaded her She was a marionette a human manikin and some invisible hand was pulling the wires that made her do all these absurd things Her own mind no longer controlled her actions The persistence of that waltz It had haunted her broken into her dreams awakened her out of them Why should she be afraid What was there to be afraid of in a recurring melody She had heard a dozen famed violinists play it It had never before affected her beyond a flash of emotionalism Perhaps it was the romantic misfortune of the man the mystery surrounding him the menace which walled him in Breakfast Human manikins had appetites So she made her breakfast Before leaving the kitchen she stopped at the window The sun filled the court with brilliant light The patches of rust on the fire escape ladder which was on the Gregor side of the platform had the semblance of powdered gold Half an hour later she was speeding downtown to the office All through the day she walked worked talked as one in the state of trance There were periods of stupefaction which at length roused Burlingame s curiosity Kitty what s the matter with you You look dazed about something How do you clean a pipe she countered irrelevantly Clean a pipe he repeated nearly overbalancing his chair Yes You see I may make up my mind to marry a man who smokes a pipe said Kitty desperately eager to steer Burlingame into another channel and certainly I ought to know how to clean one Kitty I m an old timer You can t sidetrack me like this Something has happened You say you had a great time in the country and you come in as pale as the moon like someone suffering from shell shock Ever since Cutty came in here that day you ve been acting oddly You may not know it but Cutty asked me to send you out of town You ve been in some kind of danger What s the yarn So big that no newspaper will ever publish it Burly If Cutty wants to tell you some day he can I haven t the right to Did he drag you into it or did you fall into it I walked into it as presently I shall walk out of it all on my own Better keep your eyes open Cutty s a stormy petrel when he flies there s rough weather What do you know about him Probably what he has already told you that he is a foreign agent of the Government What do you know Everything but one thing and that s a problem particularly my own Alien stuff I suppose Cutty s strong on that Well mind your step The boys are bringing in queer scraps about something big going to happen May Day no facts just rumours Better shoot for home the shortest route each night and stick round there There are certain spiritual exhilarants that nullify caution warning the presence of danger The boy with his first pay envelope the lover who has just been accepted the debutante on the way to her first ball the impetus that urges us to rush in where angels fear to tread At a quarter after five Kitty left the office for home unaware that the attribute designated as caution had evaporated from her system She proceeded toward the Subway mechanically the result of habit Casually she noted two taxicabs standing near the Subway entrance That she noted them at all was due to the fact that Subway entrances were not fortuitous hunting grounds for taxicabs Only the unusual would have attracted her in her present condition of mind It takes time and patience to weave a good web observe any spider time in finding a suitable place for it patience in the spinning All that worried Karlov was the possibility of her not observing him If he could place his taxicabs where they would attract her even casually the main difficulty would be out of the way The moment she turned her head toward the cabs he would step out into plain view The girl was susceptible and adventuresome Kitty saw a man step out of the foremost taxicab give some instructions to the chauffeur and get back into the cab immediately to be driven off at moderate speed She recognized the man at once Never would she forget that squat gorilla like body Karlov Yonder in that cab She ran to the remaining cab wherein she differed from angels Are you free Yes miss See that taxi going across town Follow it and I will give you ten extra fare You re on miss Karlov peered through the rear window of his cab If she had in tow a Federal agent the manoeuvre would fail at a great risk to himself But he would soon be able to tell whether or not she was being followed As a matter of fact she was not She had returned to New York a day before she was expected Her unknown downtown guardian would not turn up for duty until ordered by Cutty to do so She entered the second cab with no definite plan in her head Karlov the man who wanted to kill Johnny Two Hawks the man who held Stefani Gregor a prisoner For the present these facts were sufficient Don t get too near said Kitty through the speaking tube Just keep the cab in sight A perfectly logical compensation She herself had set in motion the machinery of this amazing adventure it was logically right that she should end it Poor dear old Cutty to fancy he could pull the wool over Kitty Conover s eyes Cutty the most honest man alive had set his foot upon an unethical bypath and now found himself among nettles To keep Johnny Two Hawks prisoner in that lofty apartment while he hunted for the drums of jeopardy Hadn t he said he had seen emeralds he would steal with half a chance Cutty playing at this sort of game his conscience biting whichever way he turned He had been hunting unsuccessfully for the stones that night he had come in with his face and hands bloody Why hadn t he kissed her Johnny Two Hawks bourgeois Utter nonsense Of course it did not matter now what he was he had dug a bridgeless chasm with that smile Sometime to morrow he and Stefani Gregor would be on their way to Montana and that would be the last of them both To morrow would mark the fork in the road But life would never again be humdrum for Kitty Conover The taxicabs were bumping over cobbles through empty streets It was six by now at that hour this locality which she recognized as the warehouse district was always dead The deserted streets how ever set in motion a slight perturbation Supposing Karlov grew suspicious and turned aside from his objective Even as this disturbing thought took form Karlov s taxicab stopped Kitty s stopped also but without instructions from her She had intended to drive on and from the rear window observe if Karlov entered that old red brick house Go on she called through the tube The chauffeur obeyed but he stopped again directly behind Karlov s taxicab He slid off his seat and opened the door His face was grim Tumpitum tump Tumpitum tump She did not hear the tocsin this time she felt it on her spine the drums of fear If they touched her Come with me miss If you are sensible you will not be harmed If you cut up a racket I ll have to carry you What does this mean faltered Kitty That we have finally got you miss You can see for yourself that there isn t any help in sight Better take it sensibly We don t intend to hurt you It s somebody else we want There s a heavy score against you but we ll overlook it if you act sensibly You were very clever last night but the game depends upon the last trick I ll go sensibly Kitty agreed They must not touch her Karlov did not speak as he opened the door of the house for her His expression was Buddha like This way miss said the chauffeur affably You are an American Whenever it pays Presently Kitty found herself in the attic alone They hadn t touched her so much was gained Poor little fool that she was It was fairly dark now but overhead she could see the dim outlines of the scuttle or trap The attic was empty except for a few pieces of lumber and some soap boxes She determined to investigate the trap at once before they came again She placed two soap boxes on end and laid a plank across After testing its stability she mounted She could reach the trap easily with plenty of leverage to spare She was confident that she could draw herself up to the roof She sought for the hooks and liberated them then she placed her palms against the trap and heaved Not even a creak answered her She pressed upward again and again The trap was immovable Light She turned to behold Karlov in the doorway a candlestick in his hand The scuttle is covered with cement Miss Conover Nobody can get in or out Kitty got down her knees uncertain If he touched her Oh the fool she had been What are you going to do with me she asked through dry lips You are to me a bill of exchange payable in something more precious to me than gold I am going to keep you here until you are ransomed The ransom is the man you have been shielding If he isn t here by midnight you vanish Oh we shan t harm you Merely you will disappear until my affairs in America are terminated You are clever and resourceful for so young a woman You will understand that we are not going to turn aside You are not a woman to me you are a valuable pawn You are something to bargain for I understand said Kitty her heart trying to burst through It seemed impossible that Karlov should not hear the thunder To placate him to answer his questions to keep him from growing angry I thought you would Karlov set the candle on Kitty s impromptu stepladder We saw your interest in the affair and attacked you on that side You had seen me once Being a newspaper writer the New York kind you would not rest until you learned who I was You would not forget me You were too well guarded uptown You have been out of the city for a week We could not find where You were reported seen entering your office this morning and here you are My one fear was that you might not see me Personally you will have no cause to worry No hand shall touch you Thank you for that Don t misunderstand There is no sentiment behind this promise I imagine your protector will sacrifice much for your sake Simply it is unnecessary to offer you any violence Do you know who the man is your protector is shielding Kitty shook her head Has he played the fiddle for you Yes Karlov smiled Did you dance Dance I don t understand No matter He can play the fiddle nearly as well as his master The two of them have gone across the world fiddling the souls of women out of their bodies Kitty sat down weakly on the plank Terror from all points Karlov s unexcited tones his lack of dramatic gesture convinced her that this was deadly business Terror that for all the promise of immunity they might lay hands on her Terror for Johnny Two Hawks for Cutty Has he injured you she asked to gain time He is an error in chronology He represents an idea which no longer exists He spoke English fluently but with a rumbling accent But to kill him for that Kill him My dear young lady I merely want him to fiddle for me said Karlov with another smile You tried to kill him insisted Kitty the dryness beginning to leave her throat Bungling agents Do know what became of them the two who invaded your bedroom They were taken away the police So I thought What became of the wallet I found it hidden on the back of my stove I never thought to look there said Karlov musingly Who has the drums The emeralds You haven t them cried Kitty becoming her mother s daughter though her heart never beat so thunderously as now We thought you had them Karlov stared at her moodily What is that button for at the side of your bed Kitty comprehended the working of the mind that formulated this question If she answered truthfully he would accept her statements It rings an alarm in the basement Karlov nodded You are truthful and sensible I haven t the emeralds Perhaps one of your men betrayed you I have thought of that But if he had betrayed me the drums would have been discovered by the police Damn them to hell Kitty wondered whether he meant the police or the emeralds Later food and a blanket will be brought to you If your ransom does not appear by midnight you will be taken away If you struggle we may have to handle you roughly That is as you please Karlov went out locking the door Oh the blind little fool she had been All those constant warnings and she had not heeded Cutty had warned her repeatedly so had Bernini and she had deliberately walked into this trap As if this cold murderous madman would risk showing himself without some grim and terrible purpose She had written either Cutty s or Johnny Two Hawks death warrant She covered her eyes It was horrible Perhaps not Cutty but assuredly Two hawks His life for her liberty And he will come she whispered She knew it How was not to be analyzed She just knew that he would come What if he had smiled like that The European point of view and her own monumental folly He would come quietly without protest and give himself up God forgive me What can I do What can I do She slid to the floor and rocked her body Her fault He would come even as Cutty would have come had he been the man demanded And Karlov would kill him because he was an error in chronology She sensed also that the anarchist would not look upon his act as murder He would be removing an obstacle from the path of his sick dreams Comparisons She saw how much alike the two were Cutty was only Johnny Two Hawks at fifty two fearless and whimsical Had Cutty gone through life without looking at some woman as last night Two Hawks had looked at her All the rest of her life she would see Two Hawks eyes Abysmal fool to pit her wits against such men as Karlov Because she had been successful to a certain extent she had overrated her cleverness with this tragic result He had fiddled the soul out of her But death She sprang up It was maddening to sit still to feel the approach of the tragedy without being able to prevent it She investigated the windows No hope in this direction It was rapidly growing dark outside What time was it The door opened A man she had not seen before came in with a blanket a pitcher of water and some graham crackers His fingers were stained a brilliant yellow and a peculiar odour emanated from his clothes He did not speak to her but set the articles on the floor and departed Kitty did not stir An hour passed she sat as one in a trance The tallow dip was sinking By and by she became conscious of a faint sound a tapping Whence it came she could not tell She moved about cautiously endeavouring to locate it When she finally did the blood drummed in her ears The trap Someone was trying to get in through the trap Cutty Thus soon Who else could it be She hunted for a piece of lumber light enough to raise to the trap She tapped three times and waited Silence She repeated the signal This time it was answered Cutty In a little while she would be free and Two Hawks would not have to pay for her folly with his life Terror and remorse departed forthwith She took the plank to the door and pushed one end under the door knob Then she piled the other planks against the butt The moment she heard steps on the stairs she would stand on the planks It would be difficult to open that door She sat down on the planks to wait From time to time she built up the falling tallow Cutty must have light The tapping on the trap went on They were breaking away the cement Perhaps an hour passed At least it seemed a very long time Steps on the stairs She stood up facing the door the roots of her hair tingling She heard the key turn in the lock and then as in a nightmare she felt the planks under her feet stir slightly but with sinister persistence She presently saw the toe of a boot insert itself between the door and the jamb The pressure increased the space between the door and the jamb widened Suddenly the boot vanished the door closed and the plank fell Immediately thereafter Karlov stood inside the room scowling suspiciously CHAPTER XXX Cutty arrived at the apartment in time to share dinner with Hawksley He had wisely decided to say nothing about the escapade of Hawksley and Kitty Conover since it had terminated fortunately Bernini had telegraphed the gist of the adventure He could readily understand Hawksley s part but Kitty s wasn t reducible to ordinary terms of expression The young chap had run wild because his head still wobbled on his shoulders and because his isolation was beginning to scratch his nerves But for Kitty to run wild with him offered a blank wall to speculation As if he could solve the riddle when Kitty herself could not So he determined to shut himself up in his study and shuffle the chrysoprase Something might come of it Looking backward he recognized the salient at no time had he been quite sure of Kitty She seemed to be a combination of shallows and unfathomable deeps From the Pennsylvania Station he had called up the office Kitty had gone Bernini informed him that Kitty was dining at a cafe on the way home Cutty was thorough He telephoned the restaurant and was advised that Miss Conover had reserved a table He had forgotten to send down the operative who guarded Kitty at that end But the distance from the office to the Subway was so insignificant You are looking fit he said across the table Ought to be off your hands by Monday But what about Stefani Gregor I can t stir leaving him hanging on a peg I am going into the study shortly to decide that Head bother you Occasionally Ryan easy to get along with Rather a good sort I say you know you ve seen a good deal of life Which do you consider the stronger the inherited traits or environment Environment That is the true mould There is good and bad in all of us It is brought into prominence by the way we live An angel cannot touch pitch without becoming defiled On the other hand the worst gutter rats in the world saved France Do you suppose that thought will not always be tugging at and uplifting those who returned from the first Marne There is hope then for me Hope Yes You know that my father my uncle and my grandfather were fine scoundrels Under their influence you would have been one too But no man could live with Stefani Gregor and not absorb his qualities Your environment has been Anglo Saxon where the first block in the picture is fair play You have been constantly under the tutelage of a fine and lofty personality Gregor s Whatever evil traits you may have inherited they have become subject to the influences that have surrounded you Take me for instance I was born in a rather puritanical atmosphere My environments have always been good Yet there lurks in me the taint of Macaire Given the wrong environment I should now have my picture in the Rogues Gallery You Yes Hawksley played with his fork If you had a daughter would you trust me with her Yes Any man who can weep unashamed over the portrait of his mother may be trusted Once you are out there in Montana you ll forget all about your paternal forbears Handsome beggar thought Cutty but evidently born under the opal An inexplicable resentment against his guest stirred his heart He resented his youth his ease of manner his fluency in the common tongue He was theoretically a Britisher he thought British approached subjects from a British point of view A Britisher except when he had that fiddle tucked under his chin Then Cutty admitted he did not know what he was Devil take him There must have been something electrical in Cutty s resentment for the object of it felt it subtly and it fired his own He resented the freedom of action that had always been denied him resented his host s mental and physical superiority Did Cutty care for the girl or was he playing the game as it had been suggested to him Money and freedom But then it was in no sense a barter she would be giving nothing and the old beggar would be asking nothing His suggestion He laughed What s the joke asked Cutty looking up from his coffee which he was stirring with unnecessary vigour It isn t a joke I m bally well twisted I laugh now when I think of something tragic I am sorry about last night I was mad I suppose Tell me about it Cutty listened intently and smiled occasionally Mad as hatters both of them He and Kitty couldn t have gone on a romp like this but Kitty and Hawksley could Thereupon his resentment boiled up again Have you any idea why she took such a risk Why she came here knowing me to be absent She spoke of a problem I fancy it related to your approaching marriage She told me Cutty laid down his spoon I d like to dump Your Highness into the middle of East River for putting that idea into my head She has consented to it and now damn it I ve got to back out of it Cutty rose and flung down his napkin Why asked the bewildered Hawksley Because there is in me the making of a first rate scoundrel and I never should have known it if you and your affairs hadn t turned up Cutty entered his study and slammed the door leaving Hawksley prey to so many conflicting emotions that his head began to bother him Back out of it Why Why should Kitty have a problem to solve over such a marriage of convenience and why should the old thoroughbred want to back out Kitty would be free then A flash of fire which subsided quickly under the smothering truth What if she were free He could not ask her to be his wife Not because of last night s madness That no longer troubled him She was the sort who would understand if he told her She had a soul big with understanding It was that he walked in the shadow of death and would so long as Karlov was free and he could not ask any woman to share that He pushed back his chair slowly In the living room he took the Amati from its case and began improvising What the chrysoprase did for Cutty the fiddle did for this derelict solved problems He reviewed all the phases as he played That dish of bacon and eggs the resolute air of her that popping fan Allegretto She had found him senseless on the floor She had had the courage to come to his assistance Andante con espressione What had been in her mind that night she had taken flight from his bedroom after having given him the wallet Something like tears What about An American girl natural humorous and fanciful Somehow he felt assured that it had not been his kisses she had looked into his eyes and seen the taint Always there the beast that old Stefani had chained and subdued He knew now that this beast would never again lift its head And he had let her go without a sign Dolorosomente To have gone through life with a woman who would have understood his nature The test of her had been last night in the streets His mood had been hers Allegretto con amore Love he said lowering the bow Love said Cutty shifting his chrysoprase There was no fool like an old fool It did not serve to recall Molly in all her glory to reach hither and yon for a handhold to pull him out of this morass Molly had become an invisible ghost He loved her daughter Double sunset the phenomenon of the Indian Ocean was now being enacted upon his own horizon Double sunset But why should Kitty have any problem to solve Why should she dodder over such a trifle as this prospective official marriage It was only a joke which would legalize his generosity She had sent that telegram after leaving this apartment What had happened here to decide her Had Hawksley fiddled There was something the matter with the green stones to night they evoked nothing He leaned back in his chair listening the bowl of his pipe touching the lapel of his coat Music Queer what you could do with a fiddle if you knew how After all there was no sense in venting his anger on Hawksley He was hoist by his own petard Why not admit the truth He had had a crack on the head the same night as Hawksley only he had been struck by an idea often more deadly than the butt of a pistol He would apologize for that roaring exit from the dining room The poor friendless devil He bent toward the green stones again In the living room Hawksley sat in a chair the fiddle across his knees He understood now The old chap was in love with the girl and was afraid of himself couldn t risk having her and letting her go A curse on the drums of jeopardy Misfortune followed their wake always The world would have been different this hour if he The break in the trend of thought was caused by the entrance of Kuroki who was followed by a man This man dropped into a chair without apparently noticing that the room was already tenanted for he never glanced toward Hawksley A haggard face dull of eye Kuroki bobbed and vanished but returned shortly beckoning the stranger to follow him into the study Coles cried Cutty delightedly Here was the man he had sent to negotiate for the emeralds free How did you escape We ve combed the town for you They had me in a room on Fifteenth Street Once in a while I got something to eat But I haven t escaped I m still a prisoner What do you mean by that I am here as an emissary There was nothing for me to do but accept the job Did he have the stones asked Cutty without the least suspicion of what was coming That I don t know He pretended to have them in order to get me where he wanted me I ve been hungry a good deal because I wouldn t talk I m here as a negotiator A rotten business I agreed because I ve hopes you ll be able to put one over on Karlov It s the girl Kitty Karlov has her The girl wasn t to blame Any one in the game would have done as she did Karlov is bugs on politics but he s shrewd enough at this sort of game He trapped the girl because he d studied her enough to learn what she would or would not do Now they are not going to hurt her They merely propose exchanging her for the man you ve been hiding up here There s a taxi downstairs It will carry me back to Fifteenth then it will return and wait If the man is not at the appointed place by midnight he must go in this taxi the girl will be carried off elsewhere and you ll never lay eyes on her again Karlov and his gang are potential assassins all they want is excuse Until midnight they will not touch the girl but after midnight God knows What message am I to take back Do you know where she is Cutty spoke without much outward emotion Not the least idea Whenever Karlov wanted to quiz me he appeared late at night from some other part of the town But he never got much You saw him this evening Yes It probably struck him as a fine joke to send me And if you don t go back The girl will be taken away I m honestly afraid of the man He s too quiet spoken That kind of a man always goes the limit I see Wait here At Cutty s approach Hawksley looked up apathetically Want me Perhaps You are pale Anything serious Yes Karlov has got Kitty For a minute Hawksley did not stir Then he got up put away the Amati and came back He was pale too I understand he said They will exchange her for me Am I right Yes But you are not obliged to do anything like that you know I am ready You give yourself up Why not You re a man Cutty burst out I was brought up by one Honestly now could I ever look a white man in the face again if I didn t give myself up I did begin to believe that I might get through But Fate was only playing with me May I use your desk to write a line Come with me said Cutty unsteadily This was not the result of environment Quiet courage of this order was race No questions demanding if there wasn t some way round the inevitable Cutty s heart glowed the boy had walked into it never to leave it I m ready It took a man to say that when the sequence was death Coles said Cutty upon reentering the study tell Karlov that His Highness will give himself up He will be there before midnight That s enough for me But if there s the least sign that you re not playing straight it will be all off Two men will be watching the taxi and the entrance If you appear it s good night They told me to warn you I promise not to appear Coles smiled enigmatically and reached for his hat He held his hand out to Hawksley You re a white man sir Thanks said Hawksley absently To have it all over with As soon as the captive Federal agent withdrew Hawksley sat down at the desk and wrote Will this hold legally he asked extending the written sheet to Cutty Cutty saw that it was a simple will In it Hawksley gave half of his possessions to Kitty and half to Stefani Gregor In case the latter was dead the sum total was to go to Kitty I got you into a muddle this will take you out of it Karlov will kill me I don t know how I am his obsession He will sleep better with me off his mind Will this hold legally Yes But why Kitty Conover a stranger Is a woman who saves your life a stranger Well not exactly This is what we might call zero hour I gave you a haven here not particularly because I was sorry for you but because I wanted those emeralds Once upon a time Gregor showed them to me Until I examined your wallet I supposed you had smuggled in the stones and that would have been fair game But you had paid your way in honestly Now what did you do to Kitty Conover last night that decided her to accept that fool proposition She sent her acceptance after she left you I did not know that I played for her She became music struck and I took advantage of it kissed her Then she told me she was going to marry you And that is why you asked me if I would trust you with a daughter of mine Yes Conscience That explains this will No Why did you accept my suggestion to marry her To make her comfortable without sidestepping the rules of convention No Because you love her the way I do Cutty s pipe slipped from his teeth It did not often do that He stamped out the embers and laid the pipe on the tray What makes you think I love her What makes me tell you that I do Yes death may be at the end of to night s work so I ll admit that I love her She is like a forest stream wild at certain turns but always sweet and clear I m an old fool old enough to be her father I loved her mother Can a man love two women with all his heart one years after the other It is the avatar she is the reincarnation of the mother I understand now What was a beautiful memory takes living form again You still love the mother the daughter has revived that love By the Lord Harry I believe you ve struck it Walked into the fog and couldn t find the way out Of course What an old ass I ve been Simple as daylight I ve simply fallen in love with Molly all over again thinking it was Kitty Plain as the nose on my face And I might have made a fine mess of it if you hadn t waked me up All this gentle irony went over Hawksley s head When do you wish me to go down to the taxi Son I m beginning to like you You shall have your chance In fact we ll take it together There ll be a taxi but I ll hire it I m quite positive I know where Kitty is If I m correct you ll have your chance If I m wrong you ll have to pay the score We ll get her out or we ll stay where she is In any event Karlov will pay the price Wouldn t you prefer to go out if you must in a glorious scrap Fighting Hawksley was on his feet instantly Do you mean that I can die with free hands With a chance of coming out top hole I say what a ripping thing hope is always springing back Cutty nodded But he knew there was one hope that would never warm his heart again Molly Well he d let the young chap believe that Kitty must never know Poor little chick fighting with her soul in the dark and not knowing what the matter was Such things happened He had loved Molly on sight He had loved Kitty on sight In neither case had he known it until too late to turn about Mother and daughter a kind of sacrilege as if he had betrayed Molly But what a clear vision acknowledged love lent to the mind He understood Kitty who did not understand herself Well this night s adventure would decide things He smiled Neither Kitty nor the drums of jeopardy nothing The gates of paradise again for somebody else Whoever heard of a prompter receiving press notices Let s look alive We haven t any time to waste We ll have to change to dungarees engineer togs There ll be some tools to carry We go straight down to the boiler room We come up the ash exit on the street side Remember no suspicious haste Two engineers off for their evening swig of beer at the corner groggery Through the side door there and into my taxi Obey every order I give Now run along to Kuroki and say night work for both of us He ll understand what s wanted I ll set the machinery in motion for a raid How do you feel I want the truth I don t want to turn to you for help and not get it Hawksley laughed Don t worry about me I ll carry on Don t you understand To have an end of it one way or the other To come free or to die there And if Kitty is not where I believe her to be Then I ll return to the taxi outside To be young like that thought Cutty feeling strangely sad and old To come free or to die there That was good Anglo Saxon He would make a good American citizen if he were in luck At half after nine the two of them knelt on the roof before the cemented trap Nothing but raging heat disintegrates cement So the liberation of this trap considering the time was a Herculean task because it had to be accomplished with little or no noise Cold chisels fulcrums prying heaving boring To free the under edge the top did not matter Not knowing if Kitty were below that was the worst part of the job The sweat of agony ran down Hawksley s face but he never faltered He was going to die to night somehow somewhere but with free hands the way Stefani would have him die the way the girl would have him die All these thousands of miles to die in a house he had never seen before just when life was really worth something An hour went by Then they heard Kitty s signal Instinctively the two of them knew that the taps came from her They were absolutely certain when her signal was repeated She was below alone Faster whispered Cutty Hawksley smiled To say that to a chap when he was digging into his tomb When the sides of the trap were free Cutty tapped to Kitty again There was a long agonizing wait Then three taps came from below Cutty flashed a signal to the warehouse windows In five minutes the raid would be in full swing from the roof from the street from the cellar With their short crowbars braced by stout fulcrums the two men heaved Noise did not matter now Presently the trap went over Look out for your hands there s lots of loose glass And together when we drop Right o whispered Hawksley assured that when he dropped through the trap the result would be oblivion Done in CHAPTER XXXI Karlov upon forcing his way past Kitty s barricade stared at her doubtfully This was a clever girl she had proved her cleverness frequently She might have some reason other than fear in keeping him out So he put a fresh candle in the sconce and began to prowl He pierced the attic windows with a ranging glance no one was in the yard or on the Street The dust on the windows had not been disturbed To Kitty the suspense was intolerable At any moment Cutty might tap a query to her How to warn him that all was not well A scream would do it but in that event when Cutty arrived there would be no Kitty Conover Something that would sound unusual to Cutty and accidental to Karlov She hit upon it She seized a plank from her barricade raised it to a perpendicular position then flung it down violently Would Cutty hear and comprehend that she was warning him As a matter of fact Cutty never heard the crash for at that particular minute he was standing up to get the kinks out of his knees Karlov whirled on his heels ran to Kitty and snatched her wrist Why did you do that Kitty remained mute Answer with a cruel twist You hurt she gasped Anything to gain time She tried to break away Why did you do that I was going to thrust it through a window to attract attention It was too heavy This explanation was within bounds of reason It is possible that Karlov who had merely come up with a fresh candle would have departed but for a peculiarly grim burst of humour on the part of Fate Tap tap tap inquired the unsuspecting man on the roof exactly to Kitty like some innocent inquisitive child embarrassing the family before company Karlov flung her aside roughly stepped under the trap and cupped an ear He required no explanations from Kitty who shrank to the wall and remained pinned there by terror Karlov s intuition was keen Men on the roof held but one significance The house was surrounded by Federal agents For a space he wavered between two desires the political and the private vengeance A call down the stairs and five minutes afterward there would be nothing on the spot but a jumble of smoking wood and brick But not to see them die His subsequent acts cold and methodical fascinated Kitty He took a step toward her The scream died in her throat But he did not go beyond that step The picture of her terror decided his future actions He would see them die here with the girl looking on A full measure Well enough he knew who were digging away the cement of the trap What gave lodgment to this conviction he did not bother to analyze The man he had not yet seen who had balked him now here now there from that first night and who but the last of that branch of the hated house should be with him To rend batter crush kill If he were bound for hell to go there with the satisfaction of knowing that his private vengeance had been cancelled The full reckoning for Anna s degradation Stefani Gregor broken and dying and all the others dead He would shoot them as they dropped through the trap Not to kill but to maim render helpless then he would taunt them and grind his heels in their faces Up there the two he most hated of all living men First he restored Kitty s barricade to keep assistance from entering before his work was completed The butt of the first plank he pushed under the door knob The other planks he laid flat end to end with the butt of the last snug against the brick chimney The door would never give as a whole it would have to be smashed in by axes He then set the candle on the floor backed by an up ended soapbox His enemies would drop into a pool of light while they would not be able to see him at once The girl would not matter Her terror would hold her for some time These manoeuvres completed he answered the signal sat down on another box and waited reminding Kitty of some grotesque Mongolian idol Kitty saw the inevitable Thereupon her terror ceased to bind her As Cutty flung back the trap she would cry out a warning Karlov might and probably would kill her Her share in this night s work her incredible folly required full payment Having decided to die with Cutty all her courage returned This is the normal result of any sublime resolve But with the return of her courage she evolved another plan She measured the distance between herself and Karlov calculating there would be three strides As Cutty dropped she would fling herself upon the madman The act would at least give Cutty something like equal terms What became of Kitty Conover thereafter was of no importance to the world Sounds She became conscious of noises elsewhere in the house The floor trembled There came a creaking and snapping of wood and she heard the trap fall Karlov stood up menacing terrible She saw where Cutty would drop and now understood the cunning of the manoeuvre of placing the candle in front of the soapbox Cutty would be an absolute mark for Karlov protected by the shadow She set herself as a runner at the tape Karlov was not the type criminal which when cornered thinks only of personal safety He was a political fanatic All who opposed his beliefs must not be permitted to survive There was a touch of Torquemada of the Inquisition in his cosmos He could not kill directly he had to torture first He knew by the ascending sounds that there would be no way out of this for him To the American Russia was an outlaw He would be treated as a dangerous alien enemy and locked up Boris Karlov should never live to eat his heart out behind bars Unique angle of thought he mused He wanted mud to trample them in Russian mud The same mud that had filled the mouth of Anna s destroyer He was then a formidable antagonist for any two strong men let alone two one of whom was rather spent the other dizzy with pain holding himself together by the last shreds of his will They dropped through the trap Cutty in front of the candle Hawksley a little to one side The elder man landed squarely but Hawksley fell backward He crawled to his feet swaying drunkenly For a space he was not sure of the reality of the scene Torches and hobnailed boots So said Karlov The torturer must talk he must explain the immediate future to double the agony He could have maimed them both then trampled them to death but he had to inform them of the fact He pointed the automatic at Cutty because he considered this man the more dangerous of the two He at once saw that the other was a negligible factor He spoke slowly And the girl shall witness your agonies he concluded Cutty bereft of invention could only stare Death He had faced it many times but always with a chance There was none here and the absolute knowledge paralyzed him Had Cutty been alone Kitty would have rushed at the madman but the sight of Hawksley robbed her of all mobility His unexpected appearance was to her the Book of Revelation The blind alley she had entered and reentered so many times and so futilely crumbled Johnny Two Hawks As for Hawksley he knew he had but little time The floor was billowing he saw many candles where he knew there was only one He was losing his senses There remained but a single idea to do the old thoroughbred one favour for the many Scorning death perhaps inviting it he lunged headlong at Karlov s knees This reckless challenge to death was so unexpected that Karlov had no time to aim He fired at chance The bullet nipped the left shoulder of Hawksley s coat and shattered the laths of the partition between the attic and the servant s quarters Under the impact of the human catapult Karlov staggered back desperately striving to maintain his balance He succeeded because Hawksley s senses left him in the instant he struck Karlov s knees Still the episode was a respite for Cutty who dashed at Karlov before the latter could set himself or raise the smoking automatic Kitty then witnessed dimly a primordial titanic conflict which haunted her dreams for many nights to come They were no longer men but animals the tiger giving combat to the gorilla one striking the quick terrible blows of the tiger the other seeking always to come to grips The floor answered under the step and rush Rare athletes these two big men who were light on their feet Kitty could see their faces occasionally and the flash of their bare hands but of their bodies little or nothing Nor could she tell how the struggle was going Indeed until the idea came that they might be trampling Johnny Two Hawks there was no coherent thought in her head only broken things She ran to the soapbox and kicked it aside She saw Hawksley on his face motionless At least they should not trample his dead body She caught hold of his arms and dragged him to the wall to discover that she was sobbing sobs of rage and despair that tore at her breast horribly and clogged her throat She was a woman and could not help she could not help Cutty She was a woman and all she could do was to drag aside the lifeless body of the man who had given Cutty his chance She knelt turning Hawksley over on his back There was a slight gash on one grimy cheek possibly caused by contact with the latchets of Karlov s boots She raised the handsome head pressed it to her bosom and began to sway her body from side to side Tumult The Federal agents were throwing their bodies against the door repeatedly In the semi darkness Cutty fought for his life But Kitty neither heard nor saw The world had suddenly contracted there was only this beautiful head in her arms beyond and about nothing Cutty felt his strength ebbing soon he would not be able to wrench himself loose from those terrible arms He knew all the phases of the fighting game Chivalry and fair play had no part in this contest Clear light to observe what his blows were accomplishing a minute or two of clear light Half the time his blows glanced The next time those arms wound about him that would be the end He was growing tired winded he had not gone into battle fresh He knew that many of his blows had gone home Any ordinary man would have dropped but Karlov came on again and again And all the while Karlov was not fighting Cutty he was endeavouring to remove him He was an obstacle What Karlov wanted was that head the girl was holding in her arms to grind his heel into it Had Cutty stepped aside Karlov would have rushed for the other man Kitty the door the door Cutty shouted in despair taking a terrible kick on the thigh The door Kitty did not stir A panel in the door crushed in The sole of a boot appeared and vanished Then an arm reached in groping touched the plank propped under the door knob wrenched and tugged until it fell Immediately the attic became filled with men It was time Karlov had Cutty in his arms This turn in the affair roused Kitty Presently she saw men in a snarl heaving and billowing with a sudden subsidence The snarl untangled itself men began to step back and produce pocketlamps Kitty saw Cutty s face battered and bloody appear and disappear in a flash She saw Karlov s too as he was pulled to his feet his hands manacled Again she saw Cutty With shaking hand he was trying to attach the loose end of his collar to the button The absurdity of it Take him away But don t be rough with him He s only a poor devil of a madman said Cutty Karlov turned and calmly spat into Cutty s face A dozen fists were raised but Cutty intervened No Let him be Just take him away and lock him up He s a rough road to travel And hustle a comfortable car for me to go home in Not a word to the newspapers This isn t a popular raid As soon as the attic was cleared Cutty limped over to Molly Conover s daughter The poor innocent The way she was holding that head was an illumination With a reassuring smile an effort for his lips were puffed and burning he knelt and put his hand on Hawksley s heart Done in Kitty that s all He isn t dead Lord no He had nine lives this chap and only one of em missing to date But I had no right to let him come I thought he was fairly fit but he wasn t Saved my life though Kitty your Johnny Two Hawks is a real man how real I did not know until to night He has earned his American citizenship Fights like he fiddles on all four strings All our troubles are at an end so buck up Alive He is alive The wild joy in her voice Yes ma am and we two can regularly thank him for being alive also That lunge gave me my chance He s only stunned Perhaps he ll need a nurse again Anyhow he ll be coming round in a minute or two I ll wager the first thing he does is to smile I should Suddenly Kitty grew strangely shy She became conscious of her anomalous position She had promised to marry Cutty promised herself that she would be his true wife and here she was holding another man s head to her heart as if it were the most precious head in all the world She could not put that head upon the floor at once that would be a confession of her embarrassment and yet she could not continue to hold Hawksley while Cutty eyed her with semi humorous concern Cutty was merciful however Let me hold him while you make a pillow out of your coat After he had laid Hawksley s head on the coat he said He ll come about quicker this way We ve had some excitement haven t we I don t want any more Cutty never any more I ve been a silly romantic fool Not silly only glorious Your poor face Banged up Well honestly it feels as it looks Kitty this chap was going to give himself up in exchange for you Not a word of protest not a question All he said was I am ready That s why I m always going to be on his side He did that for me For you Did it never occur to you that you re the sort folks always want to do things for if you ll let them God bless you Cutty He s always blessing me Kitty He blessed me with your mother s friendship now yours Kitty I m going to jilt you Jilt me her heart leaping Yes ma am We can t go through with that mummery We aren t built that way I ll figure it out in some other fashion But marriage is a sacred contract and this farce would have left a scar on your honest mind You d have to tell some man Your kind can t go through life without being loved Would he understand I wonder He ll be human or you wouldn t fall in love with him and always he ll be pondering and bedevilling himself with queer ideas because he ll be human Of course there s a loophole you can sue me for breach of promise Please Cutty don t laugh You re one of those men they call Greathearts And now I m going to tell you something It wasn t going to be a farce I intended to become your true wife Cutty make you as happy as I could Cutty patted her hand and got up Lord how bruised and sore his old body was His true wife She might have been his if he had not missed that train But for this hour hot with life she might never have discovered that she loved Hawksley His true wife Ah she would have been all of that Molly s girl Will you mind waiting here until I see where old Stefani Gregor is No answered Kitty dreamily Cutty limped to the door Outside he leaned against the partition Done in body and soul Always opening the gates of paradise for somebody else His true wife Slowly he descended the stairs Alone Kitty smoothed back the dank hair from Hawksley s brow which she kissed Benediction and good bye CHAPTER XXXII Because it was assumed that some of Karlov s pack might be at large and unsuspectingly return to the trap Federal agents would remain on guard all night They explored the house hunting for chemicals documents letters and addresses They found enough high explosive to blow up the district And they found Stefani Gregor They were standing by the cot as Cutty came in Yes sir Just this minute went out Did he speak A woman s name Rosa Yes sir Looks to me as if he had been starved to death Know who he was Yes Tell the coroner to be gentle Once upon a time Stefani Gregor spoke to kings by right of genius The thought that he himself might have been the indirect cause of Gregor s death shocked Cutty who was above all things tender He had held back the raid for several days to serve his own ends He could have ordered the raid from Washington and it would have gone through as smoothly as to night The drums of jeopardy Well that phase of the game was done with He had held up this raid so that he might be on hand to search Karlov and until now he had forgotten the drums Accurst They were accurst The death of Stefani Gregor would always be on his conscience Cutty stared not very clearly at the cameo like face so beautifully calm As in life so it was in death the calm that had brooked and beaten down the turbulent instincts of the boy the imperturbable calm of a great soul Rosa The sublime unselfishness of the man He had sacrificed wealth and fame for the love of the boy s mother unspoken unrequited love the quality that passes understanding And his reward to die on this cot in horrid loneliness Rosa All at once Cutty felt himself little trivial beside this forlorn bier What did he know about love He had never made any sacrifices he had simply carried in his heart a bittersweet recollection But here Twenty odd years of unremitting devotion to the son of the woman he had loved Stefani Gregor Creating environments that would develop the noble qualities in the boy interposing himself between the boy and the evil pleasures of the uncle teaching him the beautiful cleansing his soul of the inherited mud Reverently Cutty drew the coverlet over the fine old head What s this asked one of the operatives Looks like the pieces of a broken fiddle Out of those dark red bits of wood some of them bearing the imprints of hobnails Cutty constructed the scene A wave of bitter rage rolled over him The beast Karlov had done this thing with poor old Gregor looking on too weak to intervene Not so many years ago these bits of wood under the master s touch had entranced the souls of thousands Cutty recalled a fairy tale he had read when a boy about a prince whose soul had been transformed into a flower which if plucked or broken died Karlov had murdered Stefani Gregor perhaps not legally but actually nevertheless Rehabilitated in soul Cutty left the room He had read a compelling lesson in self sacrifice He was going to pick up his cross and go on with it smiling After all Kitty was only an interlude the big thing was the game and shortly he would be in the thick of great events again But Kitty should be happy His old analytical philosophy resumed its functions The contempt and jealousy of one race for another what was God s idea in implanting that in souls Hawksley was at base Russian The boy s English education his adopted outlook upon life made it possible for Cutty to ignore the racial antagonism of the Anglo Saxon for all other races Stefani Gregor at one end of the world and he at the other blindly working out the destinies of Kitty Conover and Ivan Mikhail Feodorovich and so forth and so on with the blood of Catharine in his veins Made a chap dizzy to think of it Traditions were piling up along with crowns and sceptres in the abyss When he returned to the attic he felt himself fortified against any inevitability Hawksley was sitting up his back to the wall staring groggily but with reckless adoration into Kitty s lovely face Youth will be served As if watching these two there could be any doubt of it And he had bent part of his energies toward keeping them separated Ha he cried cheerfully Back on top again I see How s the head Haven t any no legs I m nothing at all but a bit of my own imagination How do you feel Like the aftermath of an Irish wake Then Cutty s battered face assumed an expression that was meant to typify gravity John he aid I ve bad news for you John A glow went over the young man s aching body John What could that signify except that he had passed into the eternal friendship of this old thoroughbred John About Stefani Stefani is dead He died speaking your mother s name Hawksley s head sank his chin touched his chest He spoke without looking up Something told me I would never see him alive again Old Stefani If there is any good in me it will be his handiwork I say he added his eyes now seeking Cutty s you called me John Will you carry on Keep an eye on you So long as you may need me I come from a lawless race Stefani had to fight Even now I m afraid sometimes God knows I want to be all he tried to make me You re all right John You ve reached haven the storms hereafter will be outside Besides Stefani will always be with you You ll never pick up that old Amati without feeling Stefani near Can you stand Between the two of you perhaps With Kitty on one side and Cutty on the other Hawksley managed the descent tolerably well Often a foot dragged How strong she was this girl No hysterics no confusion after all that racket with death or something worse reaching out toward her calmly telling him that there was another step warning him not to bear too heavily on Cutty Holding him up physically and morally these two now all he had in life to care for Yesterday unknown to him this night bound by hoops of steel The girl had forgiven him he knew it by the touch of her arm Old Stefani A sob escaped him Their arms tightened No I was thinking of Stefani Rather hard to die all alone because he loved me Kitty longed to be alone There were still many unshed tears some for Cutty some for Stefani Gregor some for Johnny Two Hawks and some for herself In the limousine Cutty sat in the middle Kitty on his left and Hawksley on his right his arms round them both Presently Hawksley s head touched his shoulder and rested there a little later Kitty did likewise His children Lord he was going to have a tremendous interest in life after all He smiled with kindly irony at the back of the chauffeur His children these two and he knew as he planned their future that they were thinking over and round but not of him which is the way of youth At the apartment Cutty decided to let Hawksley sit in an easy chair in the living room until Captain Harrison arrived Kuroki was ordered to prepare a supper which would be served on the tea cart set at Hawksley s knees Kitty because it was impossible for her to remain inactive set the linen and silver She was in and out of the room ill at ease angry frightened bitter avoiding Hawksley s imploring eyes because she was not sure of her own She was sure of one thing however All the nonsense was out of her head To morrow she would be returning to the regular job She would have a page from the Arabian Nights to look upon in the days to come She understood though it twisted her heart dreadfully she was in the eyes of this man a plaything a pretty woman he had met in passing If she had saved his life he had in turn saved hers they were quits She did not blame him for his point of view He had come from the top of the world where women were either ornaments or playthings while she and hers had always struggled to maintain equilibrium in the middle stratum Cutty could give him friendship but she could not because she was a woman young and pretty Love him Well she would get over it It might be only the glamour of the adventure they had shared Anyhow she wouldn t die of it Cutty hadn t Of course it hurt she was a silly little fool and all that Once he was in Montana he would be sending for his Olga There wasn t the least doubt in her mind that if ever autocracy returned to power he d be casting aside his American citizenship his chaps and sombrero for the old regalia Well truculently to the world at large why not So she avoided Hawksley s gaze sensing the sustained persistence of it But oh to be alone alone alone Cutty washed the patient s hands and face and patched up the cut on the cheek interlarding his chatter with trench idioms banter jokes Underneath though he was chuckling He was the hero of this tale he had done all the thrilling stunts carried limp bodies across fire escapes in the rain climbed roofs eluded newspaper reporters fought with his bare fists rescued the girl All with one foot in the grave Fifty two gray haired with a prospect of rheumatism on the morrow and putting it over like a debonair movie idol Hawksley met these pleasantries halfway by grousing about being babied when there was nothing the matter with him but his head his body and his legs Why didn t she look at him What was the meaning of this persistent avoidance She must have forgiven last night She was too much of a thoroughbred to harbour ill feeling over that Why didn t she look at him The telephone called Cutty from the room Kitty went into the dining room for an extra pair of salt cellars and delayed her return until she heard Cutty coming back Karlov is dead he announced Started a fight in the taxi got out and was making for safety when one of the boys shot him He hadn t the jewels on him John I m afraid they are gone unless he hid them somewhere in that What s the matter Kitty For Kitty had dropped the salt cellars and pressed her hands against her bosom her face colourless Hawksley terrified tried to get up No no Nothing is the matter with me but my head To think I could forget Good heavens She prolonged the words drolly Wait She turned her back to them When she faced them again she extended a palm upon which lay a leather tobacco pouch cracked and parched and blistered by the reactions of rain and sun Think of my forgetting them I found them this morning Where do you suppose On a step of the fire escape ladder Well I ll be tinker dammed said Cutty I ve reasoned it out went on Kitty breathlessly looking at Cutty When the anarchist tore them from mister Hawksley s neck he threw them out of the window The room was dark his companion could not see Later he intended no doubt to go into the court and recover them and cheat his master I was looking out of the window when I noticed a brilliant flash of purple then another of green The pouch was open the stones about to trickle out I dared not leave them in the apartment or tell anybody until you came home So I carried them with me to the office The drums Cutty The drums Tumpitum tump Look She poured the stones upon the white linen tablecloth A thousand fires The wonderful things she gasped Oh the wonderful things I don t blame you Cutty They would tempt an angel The drums of jeopardy and that I should find them Lord said Cutty in an awed whisper Green stones The magnificent rubies and sapphires and diamonds vanished he could see nothing but the exquisite emeralds He picked up one still warm with Kitty s pulsing life and toyed with it Actually the drums And all this time they had been inviting the first comer to appropriate them Money love tragedy death history pageants lovely women murder and loot All these days on the step of the fire escape ladder He must have one of them positively he must Could he prevail upon Hawksley to sell one Had he carried them through sentiment He turned to broach the suggestion of purchase but remained mute Hawksley s head was sunk upon his chest his arms hung limply at the sides of his chair He is fainting cried Kitty her love outweighing her resolves Cutty desperately fearing to touch Hawksley herself No The stones the stones Take them away out of sight I m too done in I can t stand it I can t The Red Night Torches and hobnailed boots CHAPTER XXXIII Her fingers seemingly all thumbs her heart swelling with misery and loneliness wanting to go to him but fearing she would be misunderstood Kitty scooped up the dazzling stones and poured them hastily into the tobacco pouch which she thrust into Cutty s hands What she had heard was not the cry of a disordered brain There was some clear reason for the horror in Hawksley s tones What tragedy lay behind these wonderful prisms of colour that the legitimate owner could not look upon them without being stirred in this manner Take them into the study urged Kitty Wait interposed Hawksley I give one of the emeralds to you Cutty They came out of hell if you want to risk it The other is for Miss Conover with Mister Hawksley s compliments He was looking at Kitty now his face drawn his eyes bloodshot Don t be apprehensive They bring evil only to men With one in your possession you will be happy ever after as the saying goes Oh they are mine to give mine by right of inheritance God knows I paid for them If I said Mister began Kitty her brain confused her tongue clumsy You haven t forgiven he interrupted A thoroughbred like you to hold last night against me Mister after what we two have shared together Why didn t you leave me there to die Cutty observed that the drama had resolved itself into two characters he had been relegated to the scenes He tiptoed toward his study door and as he slipped inside he knew that Gethsemane was not an orchard but a condition of the mind He tossed the pouch on his desk eyed it ironically and sat down His one of them one of those marvellous emeralds was his He interlaced his fingers and rested his brow upon them He was very tired Kitty missed him only when she heard the latch snap She was alone with Hawksley and all her terror returned Not to touch him not to console him to stand staring at him like a dumb thing I do forgive Johnny But your world and my world Those stains The wretches hurt you What Where bewildered The blood on your waist Kitty looked down That is not my blood Johnny It is yours Mine Johnny Something in the way she said it Mine trying to solve the riddle Yes It is where your cheek rested when I thought you were dead The sense of misery of oppression of terror all fell away miraculously leaving only the flower of glory She would be his plaything if he wanted her Silence Kitty I came out of a dark world to find you I loved you the moment I entered your kitchen that night But I did not know it I loved you the night you brought the wallet Still I did not understand It was when I heard the lift door and knew you had gone forever that I understood Loved you with all my heart with all that poor old Stefani had fashioned out of muck and clay If you held my head to your heart if that is my blood there Do you can you care a little I can and do care very much Johnny Her voice to his ears was like the G string of the Amati Will you go with me Anywhere But you are a prince of some great Russian house Johnny and I am nobody What am I Kitty Less than nobody a homeless outcast with only you and Cutty An American Well when I m that it will be different I ll be somebody God forgive me if I do not give it absolute loyalty this new country Never call me anything but Johnny Johnny Anywhere whatever he willed her to be I m a child Kitty I want to grow up if I can to be an American something like that ripping old thoroughbred yonder Cutty Johnny wanted to be something like Cutty Johnny would have to grow up to be his own true self for nobody could ever be like Cutty He was as high and far away from the average man as this apartment was from hers Would he understand her attitude Could she say anything until it would be too late for him to interfere She was this man s woman She would have her span of happiness come ill come good even if it hurt Cutty whom she loved in another fashion But for Johnny dropping through that trap she might never have really known married Cutty and been happy Happy until one or the other died never gloriously never furiously but mildly happy perhaps understanding each other far better than Johnny and she would understand each other The average woman s lot But to give her heart her mind her body in a whirlwind of emotions absolute surrender to know for once the highest state of exaltation to love All this tender exchange with half a dozen feet between them Kitty had not stirred from the far side of the tea cart and he had not opened his arms She had given herself with magnificent abandon for the present that satisfied her instincts As for him he was not quite sure this miracle might not be a dream and one false move might cause her to vanish Johnny who is Olga The question was irrepressible Perhaps it was the last shred of caution binding her All of him or none of him There must be no other woman intervening Hawksley stiffened in his chair His hands closed convulsively and his eyes lost their brightness Johnny Kitty ran round the tea cart What is it She knelt beside the chair alarmed for the horror had returned to his face What did they do to you back there She clasped one of his hands tensely in hers In my dreams at night he said staring into space I could run away from my pursuers but I could not run away from my dreams Torches and hobnailed boots They trampled on her and I up there in the gallery with those damned emeralds in my hands Ah if I hadn t gone for them if I hadn t thought of the extra comforts their sale would bring There would have been time then Kitty I had all the other jewels in the pouch Horses were ready for us to flee on loyal servants ready to help us but I thought of the drums A few more worldly comforts with hell forcing in the doors I didn t tell her where I was going When I came back it was to see her die They saw me and yelled I ran away I hadn t the courage to go down there and die with her She thought I was in that hell pit She went down there to die with me and died horribly alone Ah if I could only shut it out forget Olga my tender young sister Kitty the last one of my race I could love And I ran away like a yellow dog like a yellow dog I don t know where her grave is and I could not seek it if I did I dared not write Stefani tell him I had seen Olga go down under Karlov s heels and then ran away Day by day to feel those stones against my heart Nothing is more terrible to a woman than the sight of a brave man weeping For she knew that he was brave The sudden recollection of the emeralds a little more comfort for himself and sister if they were permitted to escape Not a cowardly instinct not even a greedy one a normal desire to fortify them additionally against an unknown future and he had surrendered to it impulsively without explaining to Olga where he was going Johnny Johnny you mustn t She sprang up seizing his head and wildly kissing him You mustn t God understands and Olga Oh you mustn t sob like that You are tearing my heart to pieces I ran away like a yellow dog I didn t go down there and die with her You didn t run away to night when you offered your life for my liberty Johnny you mustn t Under her tender ministrations the sobs began to die away and soon resolved into little catching gasps He was weak and spent from his injuries otherwise he would not have given way like this discovered to her what she had not known before that in every man however strong and valiant he may be there is a little child It has been burning me up Kitty I know I know It is because you have a soul full of beautiful things Johnny God held you back from dying with Olga because He knew I needed you You will marry me knowing that I did this thing Marry him A door to some blinding radiance opened and she could not see for a little while Marry him What a miserable wretch she was to think that he would want her otherwise Johnny Two Hawks fiddling in front of the Metropolitan Opera House to fill a poor blind man s cup Yes Johnny Now yesterdays never were For us there is nothing but to morrows Out there in the great country where souls as well as bodies may stretch themselves we ll start all over again You will be the cowman and I ll be the kitchen wench As in the beginning so it will always be hereafter I ll cook your bacon and eggs She pulled his chair round and pushed it toward a window dropped beside it and laid her cheek against his hand Let us look at the stars Johnny They know Kuroki having arrived with coffee and sandwiches paused on the threshold gazed wheeled right about face and returned to the kitchen By and by Kitty looked up into Hawksley s face He was asleep She got up carefully lightly kissed the top of his head the old wound and crossed to Cutty s door She must tell dear old Cutty of the wonderful happiness that was going to be hers She opened the study door but did not enter at once Asleep on his arms Why he hadn t even opened that Ali Baba s bag Tired out done in as Johnny Two Hawks called it in his English fashion She waited but as he did not stir she approached with noiseless step The light poured full upon his head How gray he was A boundless pity surged over her that this tender valiant knight should have missed what first her mother had known now she herself requited love To have everything in the world without that was to have nothing She would not wake him she would let him sleep until Captain Harrison came Lightly she touched the gray head with her lips and stole from the study Oh Molly Molly Cutty whispered into his rigid fingers And so they were married in the apartment at the top of the world on a May night thick with stars It was not a wedding it was a marriage The world never knew because it was none of the world s business Who was Kitty Conover A nobody Who was John Hawksley Something to be Out of the storm into the calm which is something of a reversal Generally in love affairs happiness is found in the approach to the marriage contract the disillusions come afterward It was therefore logical that Kitty and her lover should be happy as they had run the gamut of test and fire beforehand The young people were to leave for the West soon after the supper for three At midnight Cutty s ship would be boring down the bay Did Kitty regret even a little the rice and old shoes the bridesmaids and cake so dear to the female of the species She did not Did she think occasionally of the splendour of the title that was hers She did To her mind missus John Hawksley was incomparably above and beyond anything in that Bible of autocracy the Almanach de Gotha After supper Cutty brought in the old Amati Play he said lighting his pipe So Hawksley played played as he never had played before and perhaps as he would never play again We reach zenith sometimes but we never stay there But he was not playing to Cutty Slate blue eyes two books with endless pages the soul of this wife of his He had come through The miracle had been accomplished Love Kitty smiled and smiled the doors of her soul thrown wide to absorb this magic message Love Cutty smoked on with his eyes closed He heard it too Love Well he said sighing I see innovations out there in Montana The round up will be different The Pied Fiddler of Bar K will stand in the corral and fiddle and the bossies will come galloping in two by two and a few jackrabbits He laughed John the Amati is yours conditionally If after one year it is not reclaimed it becomes yours automatically My wedding present Remember next winter if God wills you ll come and visit me As if we could forget cried Kitty embracing Cutty who accepted the embrace stoically I ll be needing clothes and Johnny will have to have his hair cut Oh Cutty I m so foolishly happy Time we started for the choo choo Time tables have no souls But Lord what a racket we ve had Well rather from Hawksley Bo listen to me Out there you must remember that bally and ripping and rather are premeditated insults Gee whiz but I d like a look see when you say to your rough and readies Bally rotten weather What They ll shoot you up More banter which fooled none of the three as each understood the other perfectly The hour of separation was at hand and they were fortifying their courage Funny old top was Hawksley s comment as they stood before the train gate Three months gone we were strangers And now began Cutty With hoops of steel interrupted Kitty You must write Cutty and Johnny and I will be prompt You ll get one from the Azores Train going west Good luck children Cutty pressed Hawksley s hand and pecked at Kitty s cheek Shan t go through with you to the car Kuroki is waiting Good bye The redcaps seized the luggage and Hawksley and his bride followed them through the gate Because he was tall Cutty could see them until they reached the bumper Funny old world for a fact Next time they met the wounds would be healed Hawksley s head and old Cutty s heart Queer how he felt his fifty two He began to recognize one of the truths that had passed by One did not sense age if one ran with the familiar pack But for an old timer to jog along for a few weeks with youth That was it the youth of these two had knocked his conceit into a cocked hat Poor dear old Cutty said Kitty Old thoroughbred said Hawksley And there you were relegated to the bracket where the family kept the kaleidoscope the sea shell and the album His children though from now on he would have that interest in life The blessed infant Molly s girl taking a sunbonnet when she might have worn a tiara And that boy stepping down from the pomp of palaces to the dusty ranges of Bar K An American citizen It was more than funny this old top it was stark raving mad Well he had one of the drums It reposed in his wallet Another queer thing he could not work up a bit of the old enthusiasm It was only a green stone One of the finest examples of the emerald known and he could not conjure up the panorama of murder and loot behind it Possibly because he was no longer detached the stone had entered his own life and touched it with tragedy For it was tragedy to be fifty two and to realize it Thus whenever he took out the emerald he found his imagination walled in Besides it was a kind of magic mirror he saw always his own tentative villainy He was not quite the honest man he had once been But what was happening down the line there The passengers were making way for someone Kitty and racing back to the gate She did not pause until she stood in front of him breathless Forget something he asked awkwardly Uh hm Suddenly she threw her arms round his neck and kissed him If only the three of us could be always together Take care of yourself Johnny and I need you Then she caught his hand gave it a pressure and was off again Cutty stood there staring blindly in her direction Old Stefani Gregor sacrifice By and by he became conscious of something warm and hard in his palm He looked down A green stone green as the turban of a Mecca pilgrim green as the eye of a black panther in the thicket He dropped the emerald into a vest pocket and fumbled round for his pipe always his mental crutch He lit it and marched out of the station into the night chuckling sardonically For the second time the thought occurred to him Of all his earthly possessions he would carry into the Beyond a chuckle Molly then Kitty but the drums of jeopardy were his End of Project Gutenberg s The Drums Of Jeopardy by
